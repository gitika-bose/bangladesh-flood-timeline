      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-14 00:00:00      \nMany hospitals have been turning away patients for fear of Covid-19, with tragic consequences It was shocking to read, a few days ago, that a doctor was not able to manage to get her father, a senior government official with kidney complications, admitted in hospital unless he had been tested for Covid-19 and had a certificate.  According to the reports which I read, she tried to get him admitted to as many as a dozen hospitals, government and private. Without the appropriate ICU treatment, he died. It would appear that these hospitals, collectively, caused the patient's death.  If the country was not in the middle of a pandemic, I would have suggested that this sort of case -- many others similar to this have been reported in the media -- should be investigated by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council as it is empowered by a 1980 act of parliament to \"look after public interest by maintaining proper medical and dental standards.\"  In any case, some way should be found to reprimand the various hospital authorities concerned and the individual doctors who were responsible for hastening the unfortunate death of this man. In addition, it has been reported that dialysis patients who go to hospitals once or twice a week for dialysis are being turned away if they do not have a certificate to say that they are not infected by coronavirus.  Doctors in Bangladesh, on qualification, sign up to a Bangladesh version of the 1948 World Medical Association's \"Declaration of Geneva.\" This is a modern version of what is known as the Hippocratic Oath, which is the promise that doctors make to keep to the principles of the medical profession.  This appalling attitude of doctors reminds me of the many government doctors who refuse to be posted in rural areas at the beginning of their careers. They fail to see that rural experience could broaden their education, including widening their knowledge of medicinal herbs and plants. On another medically related matter, it is good to learn that finally the low cost rapid test kits for coronavirus, developed by Gonoshasthaya Kendra (GK), have been handed over to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) for performance trial. It is understood that progress has only been possible by intervention at the highest level.   There are many in the medical and pharmaceutical fields who have not forgiven Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury, the founder of GK, for his role in the formulation of the National Drug Policy in 1982 which then banned the importation of over 1,700 locally and internationally produced drugs which were either dangerous, or combinations of similar or incompatible ingredients, or because they could be produced by local companies instead of being imported.  A list of essential drugs, in their generic forms, was drawn up for use in all systems of the health care system. This action was met with howls of protest from the transnational drug companies, who feared a serious loss of profits if more countries followed Bangladesh's example. Later on in 1994, the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade liberalized international trade and therefore made such \"restraints on trade\" illegal, thus favouring the interests of large transnational companies. They then became free to flood the Bangladesh market with non-essential pharmaceutical products. A contributory factor to the demise of the drugs policy in Bangladesh was the failure of the Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA) to support it. Many doctors opposed the legislation from the outset, seeing it as a threat to their professional freedom; those who owned a pharmacy had a financial interest in prescribing lavishly. Fast forward to 2020, Covid-19 and the promotion of Remdesivir for treatment of coronavirus. Not yet approved, as far as I am aware, anywhere in the world, clinical trials are reported to have shown that on acutely ill patients, recovery time of 15 days has come down to 11 days. Many companies, including in Bangladesh, are surging ahead to produce the drug, but at what cost?  Figures per treatment have been reported to vary between $390 and $4,500. This is both confusing and mind-boggling, to say the least. I am lost for more words!  Julian Francis has been associated with relief and development activities of Bangladesh since the War of Liberation. In 2012, the government of Bangladesh awarded him the 'Friends of Liberation War Honour' in recognition of his work among the refugees in India in 1971, and in 2018 honoured him with full Bangladesh citizenship."

Indian Prime Minister Modi was scheduled to visit Bangladesh on March 17 to attend the birth centenary celebrations, but postponed it due to the coronavirus outbreak. Following the detection of coronavirus cases for the first time in Bangladesh, the year-long programs chalked out to celebrate the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during the \"Mujib Borsho\" have been rescheduled in consideration of public health. The grand inaugural ceremony of the birth centenary celebrations scheduled for March 17 at the National Parade Ground has been put on hold due to the prevailing situation across the world caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The ceremony will be held later. In the video message, the Indian prime minister will also announce some advancement in bilateral relations between Bangladesh and India, sources at the Indian External Affairs Ministry have confirmed. In the video message, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also showcase Bangabandhu's life, they added.  Indian Foreign Secretary Vardhan Shringla at the Hyderabad House in Delhi on Wednesday, March 11, 2020 | Courtesy Bangladesh to get defence supply from India soon  For the first time in the country's history, the Bangladesh Armed Forces will get the first installment of defence supplies from India soon, according to a top level source at the Indian External Affairs Ministry.  As part of the first phase of the defence pact, the Indian prime minister will officially announce the handing over of some sports utility vehicles (Tata Hexa) to the Bangladesh Army. The $500million pact was signed between the two neighbours when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina paid a four-day visit to Delhi in July 2018.  Traditionally India supplies defence equipment to Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and of late to Afghanistan. India has also extended $600million defence related Line of Credit (LoC) to Vietnam and another LoC to Mauritius in the past.  Defence diplomacy is emerging as a key element in India's foreign policy, with Delhi eyeing a supply of defence equipment to friendly countries in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, according to experts. Indian to give 150 ambulances As a token of friendship, India will provide 150 ambulances to Bangladesh, 100 for the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujib and 50 others representing the 50 years of relationship between India and Bangladesh, Shringla said. On the donation of ambulances, Shringla said they were a gift from Modi who would make the formal announcement. He said these were not ordinary ambulances but had systems in place so that victims facing trauma could access a nearby ambulance by calling a designated number immediately."

      "text": "Studies Seek Flood Control In Bangladesh\n1989-07-06T05:00:00.000Z\nAs monsoon rains begin to fall again on Bangladesh, the World Bank is mobilizing an international force of scientists and aid officials to draft a comprehensive, long-term plan to save this vulnerable nation from perennial catastrophe.\nWith the height of the flood season still a few weeks away, 58 villages were destroyed in late June by rising water and erosion of banks along six rivers. At least 9,000 families lost their homes, the Government says.\nAfter record-breaking floods last September, in which three of the world's mightiest rivers inundated two-thirds of Bangladesh and left more than 2,000 people dead and millions homeless, four major flood prevention studies were begun.\nIn the last few weeks, all four reports - by the United States, France, Japan and the United Nations Development Program - were completed and turned over to the Government of President H. M. Ershad, diplomats and officials of international agencies said in interviews. Consideration at Summit\nSome proposals are so sweeping as to envisage a multibillion-dollar rebuilding of Bangladesh's river embankments, or the construction of huge dikes or polders to keep away both the rivers and the unpredictable sea.\nThe reports will now be discussed in international forums, including the group of seven leading industrialized nations at a summit meeting in Paris in mid-July.\nAt about the same time, the World Bank will convene a meeting in Washington of scientific experts and officials from donor nations, Francis van Gigch, chief of the World Bank's Bangladesh office, said in an interview.\nWhile Bangladesh waits for international action, the Government has been building embankments around low-lying areas of Dhaka to protect the capital and its airport. Last September, the airport was closed for nearly a week during the flood, delaying the arrival of relief supplies. A Fatal Convergence\nDiplomats and Bangladeshi officials say that last year's flood, caused by a fatal convergence of rising water in all three major river systems, the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna, dealt a heavy blow to an already fragile development process.\nBangladesh, one of the world's poorest and most densely populated nations, suffered millions of dollars in losses to buildings, roads and other essential structures. Untold numbers of farm animals were lost.\nThe findings of the four studies are in agreement on several points, but differ in recommending courses of action. All agree, for example, that projects must be confined to Bangladesh, not the larger region.\nNations in South Asia say it is unrealistic to expect that India, which controls substantial river water, can be brought into a regional discussion. New Delhi has said repeatedly that it will discuss the issue only on a one-to-one basis with its neighbors.\nIn the case of Bangladesh, this has led to a stalemate over an Indian proposal to build a huge canal across Bangladeshi territory to link the Brahmaputra and Ganges Rivers. But the reports on the whole say that better coordination in issuing flood warnings should be possible. Disagreement on Embankments\nAll reports agree that some annual flooding is not only inevitable but beneficial to the agricultural lands of Bangladesh that feed 110 million people. They say that the damages of these ''normal'' floods could be minimized by better warning systems and emergency services inside the country.\nWhere the reports diverge, and enter into political territory, is on the question of embankments.\nThe United Nations Development Program and the French studies advocate the building of more and higher banks along the rivers, a course favored by President Ershad.\nThe American study - prepared for the United States Agency for International Development by the Irrigation Support Project for Asia and the Near East - questions the value of embankments designed for worst-case floods.\nIt puts emphasis on more effective utilization of ground water in dry seasons, lowering the aquifers by pumping through tube wells, and on drainage during rainy periods."

Over 15 thousand people in the five upazilas have been affected by the flood. They lost their homes, croplands and livelihoods, and had to seek shelter in flood protection embankments and became scattered to different areas in the district for survival.  Shahitan Begum, 60, of Pachil village under Shahzadpur upazila, lost her home in the flood last month and is now living in a small makeshift shanty on a piece of rented land near the village market. She no longer affords food twice a day as the flood and river erosion took away everything she had. \"When the village got flooded, I could not save food grains, furniture and money at my home. Now my home no longer exists as the hungry Jamuna devoured my homestead and everything of my family-owned. I am struggling to survive as I have nothing and there is also no work for me,\" Shahitan said. \"We are barely surviving with minimum food; in most of the days we don't get to eat twice due to the lack of food grains,\" she lamented. \"At a time when it is costly to even survive barely, Eid festivities have no meaning to us,\" Shahitan said adding \"our joy of Eid got washed away into the river.\" Johura Begum, another flood victim of the same village now living at a temporary flood shelter near the village market, also echoed what Shahitan had said. \"We are struggling to manage food for everyone in the family for the last couple of months as the recent flood washed away all we had. Eid hardly means anything anymore,\" Johura said.   \"We feel happy if we can manage just some rice and salt to eat for the whole family,\" she said. \"Amid such destitute situation, the joy of Eid with new clothes and tasty food items seem too farfetched for us. Eid cannot make us happy anymore,\" Johura added. A total of 15,434 people from over 3,079 families of 408 villages in the five upazilas were greatly affected having lost everything in the recent flood. Meanwhile, another 3,13,997 people in the district were partially affected by the flood, according to the Sirajganj relief and rehabilitation office. A total of 6,505 houses were entirely damaged while 44,013 houses were partially damaged during the flood. Talking to The Daily Star, Hasen Ali, a resident of Ghatabari village under Enayetpur upazila, urged the authorities concerned to provide them relief materials and rehabilitation for their survival. \"Victims like us, who have lost everything in the recent flood in last one month, need more relief materials and rehabilitation so that we can return to our normal life,\" he said. Dr Faruk Ahmed, deputy commissioner of Sirajganj district, told The Daily Star that they have already submitted a report about the flood damage to the ministry concerned for getting fund for rehabilitation of the victims."

Due to the sudden erosion many dwelling houses as well as a vast tract of croplands at different villages under Govindsi, Gabsara and Arjuna unions in the upazila were devoured within a few weeks. The worst affected villages are Khanurbari, Kostapara and Bhalkutia under Govindasi union as over 100 dwelling houses and a vast tract of croplands were devoured by the river in the last few days. The erosion affected people have taken shelter on different roads and other's houses. Meanwhile, demanding steps to protect their villages from the dreadful erosion the affected people, living alongside the river, formed a human chain at Kostapara village on Friday. Several hundred riverside people, carrying placards inscribed with different slogans, took part in the rally. Locals alleged that illegal extraction of sand from different places along the river using powerful dredgers is one of the main reasons behind the erosion. Local influential people, having political clout, extracting sand from the river and sell those from over a dozen sand landing stations within eight kilometre areas stretching from Bangabandhu Bridge East Cantonment area to Govindasi Ghat area, they added. Last year, erosion by the Jamuna devoured numerous dwellings and a vast tract of croplands at Arjuna, Bharua, Kuthir Boira, Jagatpura, Tarai and Balarampur villages in Bhuapur upazila and Gorilabari and Beltia village under Gohaliabari union in adjacent Kalihati upazila. Abdul Mazid of Kostapara village said over 100 dwellings and a vast tract of croplands at three villages under Govindasi union were devoured by the river in the last one week. Although the swelling river has been devouring houses, croplands, rural markets, schools, madrasas and other establishments for the last eight years, no step has been taken to protect the areas, he said. Tangail WDB Executive Engineer Sirajul Islam said Geo bags should have been dumped in the affected areas, but they could not do it due to shortage of Geo bags. Away in Netrakona, a newly constructed embankment along the Mohadeo river in Kalmakanda upazila collapsed within five months of its construction, affecting hundreds of families of at least 25 villages under different unions, reports our Mymensingh correspondent. Water Development Board (WDB) built the 285-metre-long embankment recently at a cost of Tk 17 lakh. Netrakona WDB. Sub Assistant Engineer Ibrahim Khalilullah said the construction work of the dyke was conducted on an emergency basis as there was no scope to start a fresh project to rise of water level in the river. \"We are taking preparation to build a 300-metre embankment in Chikontop and Baruakona areas in the coming dry season with an estimated cost of Tk one crore,\" Engineer Khalilullah said, adding that the dam will be built with concrete blocks and guide walls. Contractor Fazlur Rahman, who got the work order, said the embankment collapsed due to strong current and the recent flash flood. Refuting the allegation of substandard work, the contractor said he completed the work as per the work schedule using bamboo, logs and sand bags. Mentionable, about 3,000 families under Rongchhati, Kharnoi and Lengura unions in the upazila have been affected in the recent flash flood."

Explaining the salient features of the import policy, Commerce Minister MR Siddiqui says that there will be no import of luxury items for the period. Although the aim of the government is to arrange import through government agencies as far as practicable, it has been decided to allow import in the private sector since the government agencies are not fully equipped to handle all the import requirements and since there is also a need to rehabilitate the trading community engaged in import business. The government has also decided to induct newcomers in the import trade for a number of items. Preference will be given to those newcomers who suffered during the Liberation War including those whose shops and business establishment were damaged. The list of importable items contains essential consumer goods, industrial raw materials, spares and components.  TV CORPORATION ABOLISHED  The government of Bangladesh has decided to abolish Television Corporation. Television will become an attached department of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. FARAKKA WILL BE DISCUSSED BM Abbas, Chairman of WAPDA and adviser of Prime Minister Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on power and flood control, says that all aspects of the Farakka Barrage will be discussed at the high-level India-Bangladesh talks beginning in Dhaka on April 26, 1972 to safeguard the interest of Bangladesh. He adds that the interest of Bangladesh with regard to Farakka Barrage is to obtain from the Indian government a guarantee for a minimum quantum of water for use of Bangladesh. Referring to flood control, Abbas emphasises that joint action is essential to lower flood levels in Bangladesh and ensure increased dry weather flow in the rivers which may be possible through construction of storage dams in upper reaches of the major rivers lying in India. SSC EXAMS BEGIN The Secondary School Certificate examinations begin throughout Bangladesh today. The examinations were due to commence on April 22, 1971. The Pakistan occupation forces made an abortive attempt to hold the examinations in August 1971 in which a handful of candidates appeared. Results of the mocke of examinations were also published in October that year. However, the Bangladesh government declared the results of that farcical examination void in January 1972 and decided to hold the examinations afresh on the free soil of Bangladesh.

Floating storage and offloading tanker J. Nat, which was used by offshore oil and gas companies, left Indonesian water on April 18 even though local activists warned Indonesian authorities about the toxicity of the vessel, says the NGO Shipbreaking Platform. \"Official documents indicate that the tanker has more than 1500 tons of hazardous waste from the oil extraction process onboard, including 1000 tons of slop oil, 500 tons of oily water and 60 tons of sludge oil contaminated with high concentration of mercury,\" reads a statement by the Platform released on Apr 29.  The vessel likely also contains high amounts of mercury in its structures as well as in ballast waters, it added. As most of the shipbreaking yards use the blow torch method to cut vessels, the high concentration of mercury in the steel hull of J. Nat risks the inhalation of mercury vapour, says the Platform. Exposure to it, even at low levels, has been linked to central nervous system damage, kidney and liver impairment, reproductive and developmental disorders, defects in foetuses and learning deficits, according to the statement.  \"Mercury is a naturally occurring element present in virtually all oil and gas fields. Concentrations are especially high in the South American and East Asian regions,\" it quoted Ingvild Jenssen, executive director and founder of NGO Shipbreaking Platform. Citing a recent court judgement on the illegal import of another oil and gas unit -- North Sea Producer, the rights body said the Bangladesh Supreme Court denounced the fraudulent documents claiming the vessel was toxic-free, when it was contaminated by radioactive substances. The court had then called for full transparency on toxic material in end-of-life vessels brought in to the country.   \"In light of the recent judgment on the North Sea Producer, there is no scope to give any authorization for import, beaching, and breaking of the J. NAT. It is public knowledge that Bangladesh will not be able to deal with the hazardous waste flow downstream. The vessel will simply flood our shores with toxic substances and expose our workers to deadly risks,\" the statement quoted Syeda Rizwana Hasan, director of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association. With many units to be decommissioned in the next few years, it is high time that the oil and gas industry collectively seeks sustainable solutions for the recycling of its floating units, said the Platform's founder Jenssen.  \"All actors involved in the oil and gas supply chain, directly or indirectly, have the responsibility to not cause harm to workers and the environment in developing countries.\""

The United Nations said 70,000 people in the Bahamas needed immediate humanitarian relief after the most damaging storm ever to hit the island nation. Aerial video of the worst-hit Abaco Islands in the northern Bahamas showed widespread devastation, with the harbor, shops, workplaces, a hospital and airport landing strips damaged or decimated, frustrating rescue efforts. One of the most powerful Caribbean storms on record, Dorian was rated a Category 5 hurricane when it killed at least 20 people in the Bahamas. Authorities expect that number to rise, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a news briefing, as retreating floodwaters revealed the scope of destruction. \"My island of Abaco, everything is gone. No banks, no stores, no nothing,\" said Marsh Harbour resident, Ramond A King as he surveyed the wreckage of his home, which had its roof ripped off and debris scattered throughout. \"Everything is gone, just bodies.\" With telephones down in many areas, residents posted lists of missing loved ones on social media. One Facebook post by media outlet Our News Bahamas had 2,500 comments, mainly listing lost family members. Dorian killed one person in Puerto Rico before hovering over the Bahamas for two days with torrential rains and fierce winds that whipped up 12- to 18-foot (3.7- to 5.5-metre) storm surges. Possible record surge South Carolina was preparing for a record storm surge, potentially reaching a height of eight feet (two metres) at the popular vacation destination of Myrtle Beach, the US National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. The storm was located about 115km south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, at 8am EST (1200 GMT) on Thursday and was headed north-northeast at about 13kph, the NHC said. It was packing 185kph winds. About a foot (30cm) of rain will drop on flood-prone Charleston and many parts of the coasts of the Carolinas on Thursday and Friday, said Bob Oravec, a forecaster with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. \"It's pretty substantial,\" he said early on Thursday. \"It's already raining heavy in Charleston and up and down the coast.\" More than 185,000 homes and businesses were without power along the South Carolina and Georgia coastal areas, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. The streets of downtown Charleston were all but deserted early Thursday as driving rain and strong winds lashed the city. On South Battery Street, a block away from the water, Brys Stephens and his family worked hard to keep the water away from a large gray home with white verandas along the front, the type of home that has made Charleston famous and is a major tourist draw. He was working to reattach metal flood gates to a sturdy high wall fronting the property. \"The gates worked pretty well so far and we've managed to keep water away from the house,\" Stephens said. \"But we've got another storm surge coming later on, so we'll see then if it holds.\" The NHC's storm surge warning covered parts of the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina stretching from the Savannah River and extending to southern Virginia. More than 2.2 million people in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina have been ordered to evacuate, although Florida has avoided a direct hit. Relief efforts An international relief effort was underway for the Bahamas, with a British Royal Navy vessel providing assistance and Jamaica sending a 150-member military contingent to help secure Abaco and Grand Bahama, officials said. Volunteers also ferried supplies to the islands in a flotilla of small boats. \"Let us give of our best in this moment of historic tragedy,\" Minnis said. He also encouraged international tourists to visit the Bahamas, which relies heavily on its hospitality industry. As many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. Norwegian energy company Equinor said it had discovered a spill on the ground outside tanks at its damaged storage terminal in the Bahamas, but was unclear on volumes and had not seen any oil at sea. The State Department said it did not believe any U.S. citizens who were in the Bahamas during the storm were killed. President Donald Trump said the United States was sending supplies, including materials originally intended for any Dorian victims in Florida."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-01 00:00:00      \nIt is difficult for farmers to develop a good marketing plan without proper market information, as is the case for managers of any industry. Fortunately, in today's day and age, digital technology can help the agriculture industry in many ways. From daily prices of agricultural products to costs of fertilisers, seeds and renting tractors, digital technology can help disseminate the market information that the farmers need. This timely information for agricultural commodities can assist farmers to not only plan production and harvesting dates, but also decide when and where to sell their products. While farmers can get to know current prices of their local markets through middlemen or by directly visiting the market places, at times, they do not receive the correct market information and get exploited. Proper market information gives farmers more bargaining power against middlemen. They can sell their products to different wholesalers or directly to the vegetable sellers in the market place if they know the availing prices.   The Department of Agricultural Marketing (DAM), a section of the Ministry of Agriculture, Bangladesh, updates the daily retailer and wholesaler prices for key agricultural commodities such as rice, fish, flour, betel leaves and vegetables, in addition to prices of seeds and fertilisers and many markets of several sub districts of Bangladesh.   Teaming up with the DAM, a group of undergraduate students, led by Mohammad Hassan, an adjunct lecturer of the Department of Economics & Banking at International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC), has taken steps to raise awareness about market data and enhance data literacy among the farmers, so that they can collect and interpret data to make informed decisions. Under the title, 'Sharing Market Data with Farmers', the project is currently covering the Sitakunda upazila in the Chattogram district. Predominantly funded by the initiators, the project was launched in November 2018. The activities of the project include teaching farmers how to see daily price data of specific products for a specific location, generate bar charts for monthly, weekly and yearly prices, and read and interpret the data charts. The project is designed to make things simpler for farmers so that they can easily use the DAM website and mobile app.  Farmers in Sitakunda have responded to the project positively. Mohammad Sayedul, who owns two poultry farms, uses the website to check the daily price of eggs. \"As an arable farmer, my father grows tomatoes and cabbages. He does not use a smartphone. Ever since I have come across this project, I let him know of the market prices with its help,\" says Rabiul Islam. \"I think it is also useful for buying vegetables from the market.\" The students who are a part of the project also shared their experiences. \"We are currently taking a course in Agricultural Economics with Mohammad Hassan,\" says Kawsar Ahmed. \"It is exciting to engage in real-world applications of agricultural practices. We work on the project during our time off from classes. We are also thankful to the IIUC family for encouraging us.\""

Three local influential men, who took lease for sand lifting from a portion of the Manu river area six months ago, are extracting sand from a depth of around 50 feet of the waterbody near the bridge in Sharifpur union of Kulaura, said stakeholders. During a visit to the spot a couple of days ago, this correspondent found three dredgers engaged in extracting sand near the bridge. \"Flood control embankment in Manu bridge area got damaged more than once due to unplanned sand lifting from the riverbed. Later authorities repaired it with sandbags,\" said Makhlisur Rahman of Namaja area in Kulaura. Many houses and other set-ups in the area are on the verge of extinction due to the sand lifting, said locals, adding that they observed different programmes including human chains on several occasions over the issue. Seeking anonymity, several locals said the lease-holders conduct the illegal act at night amid lax monitoring by the authorities. \"I am going to lose three acres of land due to erosion caused by illegal sand lifting,\" said Firoz Khan, a local. Md Junab Ali, chairman of Sharifpur union parishad (UP), said they submitted a complaint to the deputy commissioner of Moulvibazar demanding immediate steps to stop illegal sand lifting from the bridge area. \"If the callous act is not prevented, Manu Bridge will face threat, especially during the monsoon, when the water level sees an alarming rise. \"Once the bridge becomes unusable, import and export from and to India through Chatlapur land port will stop, causing trouble for a large number of people on both sides,\" he said. Abdul Malik, former president of Shamshernagar Banik Samity, said he along with former local UP member Nashibur Rahman Nashim and Noor Ahmed Chowdhury Bulbul took the lease for sand lifting from the river area for 2019-2020 fiscal year. Asked whether the deal allows them to lift sand from near the bridge, he declined to make any comment. According to the Balu Mohal O Mati Babosthapona Ain, 2010 (Sand Fields and Soil Management Act, 2010), sand lifting is not allowed within 500 metres of any bridge area, said Abdul Karim Kim, executive member of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon. But the syndicate of influential traders having political connections continued lifting sand near the bridge with powerful dredgers, he said. Asked about the matter, Kulaura Upazila Assistant Commissioner (Land) Nazratun Naim said, \"I seized different equipment from the spot several times and ordered the sand lifters to remove the dredgers from the bridge area. Administrative action will be taken if sand lifting is done there again.\" Upazila Nirbahi Officer ATM Farhad Chowdhury said he will look into the matter and take action against the perpetrators."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-10 00:00:00      \nA leader who was always one with the people For our generation who witnessed the birth of Bangladesh, it is a daunting task to express in words the unique role played by the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman in the creation of the new state. It is even more challenging to analyze the political ideas underpinning his life's work. Whenever I think of Bangabandhu I first remember those exciting and memorable days of March 1971.  I consider myself to be very lucky that I was able to witness the events of March 1971 and Bangabandhu's role in creating history. Very few people are fortunate enough to see the making of history. I witnessed the transformation of our movement for autonomy into our struggle for independence. I witnessed how the main actor of this historic transformation, Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman, realized an impossible dream. There have been leaders in other countries who led their nations. But few could create history. Bangabandhu was one such rare grand actor of history. It is unfortunate that even after 48 years of our independence and 43 years after his assassination there is no well-researched comprehensive biography of Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman. Fortunately two recent books, based on his personal diaries, have been published which can serve as original source that help us understand his ideals and political philosophy.  The first book, The Unfinished Memoirs, published in 2012, throws light on his childhood, and early political life. Though The Unfinished Memoirs does not include events after the late 1950s it still illuminates his political thoughts very clearly.    The second book, Karagarer Rojnamcha (prison diaries) which was published in 2017, is based on his diaries when he was in prison after he launched the six point movement in 1966. Here again his political thoughts are made very clear. He discusses at length the different methods of suppression of people's movements pursued by an autocratic state. He highlights the importance of fundamental civil and political rights, particularly the need for ensuring freedom of expressions for sustaining democracy. In this article I quote extensively from his writings so that we can hear his own voice. To understand his political philosophy we should always keep in mind that Bangabandhu spent most of his life as a political player outside state power. He struggled against colonial and undemocratic state power, first against the British and later against the Pakistan state to establish the economic, political, and cultural rights of the Bengalees.  He exercised state power only for a limited period of time -- barely three and a half years after independence. His political discourse, as illustrated in these two books, is that of a leader fighting authoritarian state power, not that of a leader who was using state power to govern a country.  One of the remarkable features of his political life was his transformation from an ordinary rank and file worker of a political party to an unparalleled leader of millions of people. Bangabandhu possessed outstanding organizational capacity; at the same time he was a great orator. Generally we do not find such a combination of qualities in one leader.  In his Unfinished Memoirs Bangabandhu notes that he was more interested in party organizational work than in discussing theoretical and ideological issues. Though he was not a political theoretician, Bangabandhu had a few specific political ideals and goals and he worked consistently to achieve them. His values are best captured in three sentences which Bangabandhu penned on May 3, 1973. He writes: \"As a man, what concerns mankind concerns me. As a Bengalee, I am deeply involved in all that concerns Bengalees. This abiding involvement is born of and nourished by love, enduring love, which gives meaning to my politics and to my very being.\" The above quote makes it clear that Bangabandhu identified himself both as a human being and as a Bengalee.  This self-identification helps us explore the main features of his political philosophy, such as nationalism, secularism, socialism, and people-orientation.  Nationalism Independence, liberation, and democracy  From the beginning of his political life, Bangabandhu was proud of his Bengali national identity. He was involved in the Pakistan movement but he believed that Pakistan should be established on the basis of the Lahore Resolution which envisaged two Muslim majority independent sovereign states.  He perceived the nationalist movement not simply as a struggle to gain independence from the rule of an external colonial power but also as a struggle for the economic and political emancipation of the down-trodden masses from various forms of oppression.  He joined the Pakistan movement in the hope that poor Muslim peasants will be liberated from the exploitation of the landlord classes. He had always viewed the Bengali nationalist movement as a movement for the achievement of democracy as well as liberation of the oppressed people. Thus on March 7, 1971 he called upon the people to launch simultaneously the struggle for independence and liberation.      Prior to the establishment of Pakistan, when as a student in Kolkata, Bangabandhu joined the Muslim League. He belonged to the Shaheed Suhrawardy and Abul Hashem faction of the party which was known as the progressives group. In his Unfinished Memoirs he writes: \"Under Mr Suhrawardy's leadership we wanted to make the Muslim League the party of the people and make it represent middle-class Bengali aspirations. Upto that time Muslim League had not become an organization that was rooted in the people. It used to serve the interests of landlords, moneyed men, and Nawabs and Khan Bahadurs.\" After the creation of Pakistan, Bangabandhu returned to Dhaka and became involved in various progressive movements and organizations which championed the linguistic, cultural, and economic rights of the Bengalis. In 1948 he was imprisoned for participating in the movement demanding recognition of Bengali as one of the state languages of Pakistan.  He was also involved in other social and political protest movements, such as the movement of poor peasants against prohibiting inter-district trade in rice known as the \"cordon\" system. He supported the movement of the fourth class employees of Dhaka university and was again imprisoned in 1949.  Within a relatively short period after the establishment of Pakistan he became convinced about the need for establishing an opposition political party not only for championing the rights of the Bengalis but also to challenge the authoritarian rule of the Muslim League. In his Unfinished Memoirs he explained the rationale for the establishment of the Awami League in the following way: \"There is no point in pursuing the Muslim League any longer. This party has now become the establishment. They can no longer be called a party of the people ... if we did not form an organization that could take on the role of the opposition the country would turn into a dictatorship.\" In 1949, the Awami Muslim League (AML) was founded and Bangabandhu was elected the joint secretary of the party though he was still in prison. In 1953 he became the general secretary of the party. The demand for self-rule gained increasing popular support in East Bengal from the mid-1950s. In 1955 Bangabandhu became a member of the Pakistan National Assembly (NA). In one of his speeches in the NA we already find a strong articulation of various demands of the Bengali nationalists and his strong sense of Bengali identity. He said:  \"They want to place the word 'East Pakistan' instead of 'East Bengal.' We have demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word Bengal has a history, has a tradition of its own. You can change it only after people have been consulted. If you want to change it then we have to go back to Bengal and ask them whether they accept it ... what about the state language Bengali? What about joint electorate? What about autonomy? ... I appeal to my friends on that side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of referendum or in the form of plebiscite.\" In the council session of the party in 1955 the Awami League (AL) dropped the word \"Muslim\" from its name and Bangabandhu again became the general secretary of the party. In February 1966, Bangabandhu presented his historic six points demand which put forward a very radical notion of provincial autonomy leaving only limited powers in the hands of the central government.  In March of that year he became the president of the AL and began a country-wide campaign to popularize the six points which soon became the sole agenda of the party. Six points captured the aspirations of the nation and it was billed as the charter for the liberation of the Bengalis. Following the launch of the six points, Bangabandhu was again imprisoned and he was charged with treason by the Pakistan government in the Agartala conspiracy case.  In 1969, Ayub fell from power in the face of massive students' movement. Bangabandhu was released from prison and the students conferred on him the title of Bangabandhu (friend of Bengal). During the 1970 election campaign Bangabandhu started using nationalist slogans such as \"Bangladesh\" and \"Joy Bangla.\"  Thus, within a relatively short span of four years, between 1966 to 1970, Bangabandhu was able to unite the whole Bengali nation behind his demand for liberation and independence. I do not think any other nationalist leader had been so successful in mobilizing such a huge number of people within such a short period of time.  It is noteworthy that though throughout his life Bangabandhu was involved in movement politics and talked about people's emancipation from exploitation and oppression, he believed in peaceful non-violent political movements. From 1947 till 1970 the Bengali nationalist movement became stronger day-by-day under his leadership but he stayed within the bounds of democratic politics.  Whenever Pakistani rulers gave opportunities for election he participated in them, though the elections were often not free and fair and attempts were made to foil the election results. In Karagarer Rojnamcha he points out repeatedly that by limiting the democratic space an autocratic regime ultimately leads the country towards terrorist politics. He writes:   \"Newspapers arrived. I was alarmed that they [the Pakistani government] are trying to shut down democratic politics ... If anybody criticizes the government there will be cases against them under the proposed secret act ... I myself am facing five cases under article 124, section 7 (3) for making public speeches ... My fear is they are leading Pakistan toward terrorist politics. We do not believe in that politics. But those of us who want to do good for the people through democratic politics, our space is shrinking.\"      Secularism Non-communalism and equal rights for all citizens Though he was a Bengali nationalist, Bangabandhu never tried to create division and hatred between different identity groups. Many nationalist politicians use provocative languages and symbols that encourage violence between different groups. These days we are witnessing the rise of such nationalist leaders even in Western democratic countries who are trying to instigate intolerance and violence towards minority groups. But Bangabandhu's nationalist politics was different. He believed in co-existence and mutual tolerance of different identity groups and talked about equal rights of all citizens. He always stood against communal violence.  Though he was involved in the Pakistan movement he believed that in India, Muslims and in Pakistan, Hindus should enjoy equal rights as citizens and live together in peace and harmony. He talked about equal rights of all groups to practice their respective religions.  He witnessed the communal riots in Kolkata on August 16, 1947. He points out that Suhrawardy asked his supporters to observe the day in a peaceful way so that no blame could fall on the Suhrawardy government. But unfortunately, communal riots did break out in Kolkata and later spread to Noakhali. Bangabandhu saved both Muslims and Hindus from acts of communal violence in Kolkata. Later when Suhrawardy joined Mahatma Gandhi in efforts to bring back communal harmony, Bangabandhu joined them. After returning to Dhaka he joined Gonotantrik Jubo League and took up the cause of building communal harmony as his main mission. He was against all forms of communal violence, not simply between Hindus and Muslims but also between different Muslim sects and between Bengalis and non-Bengalis.  In his Unfinished Memoirs he strongly condemns the anti-Kadiyani riots that took place in Lahore in 1953. In 1954, when riots broke out between Bengali and non-Bengali workers in Adamjee jute mills in Narayanganj, he rushed to the area to calm the situation. In 1964 when Hindu-Muslim riots spread in India he started a civic campaign to prevent communal riots in East Bengal. Even in his March 7, 1971 speech he asked people to remain vigilant against the threat of communal violence. He said: \"Be very careful, keep in mind that the enemy has infiltrated our ranks to engage in the work of provocateurs. Whether Bengalee or non-Bengalee, Hindu or Muslim, all are our brothers and it is our responsibility to ensure their safety.\" In his personal life he followed the preachings of Islam. But Bangabandhu was against the political use of religion. He condemned the Muslim League's practice of using the slogan of Islam and not paying attention to the economic well-being of the people which he argued was the goal for which \"the working class, the peasants, and the labourers had made sacrifice during the movement for independence.\"  Socialism Equality, freedom from exploitation, and oppression   In his Unfinished Memoirs Bangabandhu writes: \"I myself am no communist, but I believe in socialism and not in capitalism. I believe capital is a tool of the oppressor. As long as capitalism is the mainspring of the economic order people all over the world will continue to be oppressed.\" By socialism he meant a system that would free people from exploitation and oppression and remove inequality. He visited China in 1952 which left a deep imprint in his mind. He found great differences in the living conditions of people in Pakistan and China which he attributed to the differences in the two political systems.  Bangabandhu believed that the government has a role to play in removing inequality and freeing people from exploitation. He admired the priorities set by the Chinese government in improving the socio-economic conditions of the people. He writes:  \"Everywhere we could see new schools and colleges coming up. The government has taken charge of education.\" He further writes: \"The communist government had confiscated the land owned by landlords and had distributed it among all farmers. Thus landless peasants had become land owners. China now belonged to peasants and workers and the class that used to dominate and exploit had had their day.\" He did not want to see inequality grow in Bangladesh. In the council session of the AL held during April 7-8, 1972, he reiterated his commitment to promote an exploitation-free socio-economic system and socialism was formally adopted as one of the ideals of the party. In the next council session of the party held in 1974 he, again, pledged to work for freeing the nation of exploitation and oppression. People Orientation People's issues, people's politics   Often we find leaders who lead people towards great goals but they do not become emotionally involved with the people. Bangabandhu was an exception. When I compare the speeches of various leaders of the world with those of Bangabandhu, one of his off-repeated expressions -- \"love for people\" -- stands out as unique. He often talked about his love for people and people's love for him in return.  He always prioritized the issues that are upper-most in ordinary people's lives. His politics was people's politics. During the campaign for Pakistan when famine struck, he worked in feeding centres for the famine victims. He worked to rescue the victims of communal riots in Kolkata. He participated in street rallies demanding food security for the poor in East Bengal. His political philosophy was not centred only around the goal of getting state power: He developed his political ideas by being involved with the concerns of the ordinary masses.  This people's orientation made him a pragmatist. In his diaries he constantly refers to issues that would affect ordinary people's everyday life such as the rise in essential commodity prices or tax increase or flood or famine.    At one level, Bangabandhu was a man of the masses. He learned about people's aspirations from them. At another level he was the leader of the people. He carried forward ordinary people's aspirations. He had faith in people. That is why he could call upon people on March 7, 1971 to join the liberation struggle with \"whatever little they have.\"  Four guiding principles of state We see the reflections of Banganabdhu's political philosophy in the four guiding principles of state adopted by our constitution: Nationalism, democracy, secularism, and socialism. He defended these four principles in various speeches delivered in the parliament, in the party forums, and in addresses to the nation. Bangabandhu used to articulate the goals of his life's work in two simple words. He would either say he wants to build again \"Shonar Bangla\" or he would say he wants to bring \"a smile on the faces of the poor and unhappy people.\" Bangabandhu never talked about GDP growth or other theoretical issues. He knew very well how precious a smile was and his goal was to achieve that priceless objective.   Rounaq Jahan is a Distinguished Fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), Dhaka, Bangladesh."

To transform these plans into reality Green Delta Insurance Company Limited and its distribution channel partner OXFAM Bangladesh and local associate Sancred Welfare Foundation (SWF) have insured 316 Farmers of Tahirpur, Sunamganj area under Index-Based Crop Insurance recently as a pilot basis, says a press release. Several integrated plans and activities have been going on for a while now, at the direction of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina under the supervision of the Financial Institutions Department of the Ministry of Finance to stand by the farmers who are at risk of financial loss in flood-prone Haor areas. To mitigate the risks of the farmers of the Haor area arising from excessive rainfall and river flood Green Delta will provide this insurance service to the farmers from April 28 to May 28 while converting the crop losses into fatal financial risks for them. In case of crop damage under this insurance, the insured farmers can get the insurance claim depending on the extent of excess rainfall and the height and stability of the floodwater causing by river flood. In the case of river flood, if the water level if above 6.8 meters and in case of excess rainfall if it rains 125 millimeters in 3 consecutive days the insured farmers will receive maximum Tk12,000 depending on total loss and duration of the flood. In August last year, Green Delta Insurance Company, with the support of Oxfam and SKS Foundation, provided index-based crop insurance to 650 farmers in Fulchhari and Saghata areas of Gaibandha."

The second severe storm in a week to hit Britain brought high winds of more than 140km an hour and more than a month's worth of rain in 48 hours in some places, leading officials to issue rare \"danger to life\" warnings. The storm also pummelled much of France, with some 20,000 people still without electricity on Monday after suffering power cuts in the northwest of the country and rail traffic disrupted. \"This is not yet over,\" warned James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, which is responsible for flood protection in England. \"We still have many flood warnings in force and we may still see significant flooding in the middle of this week from larger rivers,\" he told BBC radio. Bevan said more than 400 homes in England had been flooded while at least 1,000 agency staff were working around the clock alongside emergency officials \"to protect and support those communities which have been hit.\" Major incidents declared More than 600 warnings and alerts - a record number - were issued on Sunday, extending from the River Tweed on the border of England and Scotland, to Cornwall in southwest England. After a day of torrential rain, major flooding incidents were later declared in south Wales and parts of western England. Some five \"severe\" warnings - denoting lives could be endangered by the flooding - remained active Monday on two rivers in Worcestershire and Herefordshire in west central England. Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue service on Sunday airlifted to hospital one man pulled from the River Teme, who was in a stable condition on Monday. But emergency responders suspended the search overnight for a missing woman also swept away by the floodwater near the town of flood-prone town of Tenbury, according to police. \"The search has continued this morning, including the use of the police helicopter,\" said Chief Superintendent Tom Harding, from West Mercia Police. \"Sadly, however, due to the circumstances of the length of time in the water and other conditions we believe that this will now be a recovery rather than rescue operation.\" Two rivers in south Wales burst their banks, prompting rescue workers to launch operations in several places to evacuate people and their pets trapped in their homes. Police said a man in his 60s died after entering the River Tawe, north of the Welsh city of Swansea but later clarified that the death was not \"linked to the adverse weather.\" On Saturday, the coastguard said the bodies of two men were pulled from rough seas off the south coast of England as the storm barrelled in. One is thought to have been the subject of a search triggered when a tanker reported that one of its crew was unaccounted for. 'More extreme' In northern England, the defence ministry deployed troops in West Yorkshire, which suffered badly from flooding caused by last weekend's Storm Ciara. There are fears rivers there could burst their banks later on Monday. Newly appointed environment secretary George Eustice said the government had done \"everything that we can do with a significant sum of money\" to combat increased flooding. \"We'll never be able to protect every single household just because of the nature of climate change and the fact that these weather events are becoming more extreme.\" France was also affected by the storm, especially northwestern Brittany where the Finistere and Morbihan regions were temporarily placed on orange alert for rain and flooding, according to the national weather service Meteo-France. Electricity provider Enedis said it had deployed 450 staff to restore power to 30,000 homes in Brittany. Power cuts also hit parts of northern and central France. The storm interrupted two high-speed TGV train services, one stopped by a fallen tree and the other by a power failure, the national rail company SNCF said."

They included some of the thousands displaced by fighting between the military and the Arakan Army insurgent group since late last year, according to Tun Aung Kyaw, secretary of the Arakan National Party, who visited a camp for several hundred displaced people near the ancient city of Mrauk-U. \"The whole camp is flooded and people are desperately in need of immediate shelter and food,\" he told Reuters by telephone. Myanmar has restricted access to the conflict zone for most international aid agencies. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a Facebook post it was helping the government respond to the flooding, while the Myanmar Red Cross, aid groups and private donors were also aiding the victims. \"We are working closely with authorities and stand ready to support the government's response,\" Knut Ostby, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator, said on Twitter."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-21 00:00:00      \nThe closures of academic institutions for two weeks in response to the Covid-19 pandemic sweeping the globe have caught many of us involved in the academia by surprise. The immediate purpose of the suspension of classes is to ensure social distancing by discouraging our young ones from physically gathering in a crowded place. The intention to stop the novel coronavirus from spreading is noble. However, in all probability, the moratorium is going to be prolonged, and the end is not in sight. All of a sudden, many working parents do not know what to do with the mischief-making adorable little humans in their houses during the daytime. Many teachers do not know how to compensate for the lost time and finish their lesson plans on time. Many students do not know how to negotiate with this unexpected isolation.    For the most, one thing is certain: it means missing classes altogether. Some of the private universities tried to switch to online platform trialling e-teaching. My institution, ULAB, has been using a learning management system--MOODLE--for the last five years or so. We have mostly used it as a supplementary platform for in-class teaching. In response to the closures, we initiated an emergency management protocol and decided to migrate to e-teaching with an aim of delivering lectures, uploading learning materials, and assessing learning progress online. Our faculty members were enthusiastic; many were pro-active enough to adjust and adopt. The response from our students, however, was an eye-opener. It gave us a rare insight into the psychosocial behaviour of our students as well as the lack of nationwide e-structure to support off-campus online teaching. Our tiny effort is a pebble in the pond, and the waves have reached many shores, exposing a critical gap in our broader education sector that lacks emergency preparedness. The unofficial Facebook page of our university is crowded with comments from students who have gone back to their hometowns or villages where they reportedly do not have regular access to the internet. Many of them do not have PCs, laptops or smartphones. Even if they do, they do not have the speed and bandwidth to connect with a live classroom. They are worried about having uninterrupted power supply during a real-time examination. Printing, scanning a document, uploading assignments within a given time are concerns shared by our students. In our response, we tried to remain flexible, offering both synchronous and asynchronous services in multiple avenues and platforms. At the same time, we have realised that our students are the microcosm of a system that screams inadequacy. I am sure many of the students are presenting the problem as larger than it is to skip exams or classes as they are used to equating closures with vacation. Add to that the genuine resilience against a system that is new. Still our hiccups suggest a mal-digested education system that is currently in place. A survey done in the US shows only nine percent of educators are comfortable in teaching in a completely online environment. One suspects, in our culture, the number is going to be significantly low among those who have been solely exposed to bricks-and-mortar classrooms. For many of the old-school teachers, a virtual classroom where it is difficult to pick up the non-verbal cues of students (e.g. whether they are bored or excited, confused about a topic, shy to ask a question, etc.) robs us of the fun of teaching. Then again, good teaching is good teaching. The challenge for us then is to prepare the course contents in a way so that the human side of a teacher remains intact. Students must feel the warmth of a teacher even while attending a virtual classroom. A teacher can show the warmth by intuitively placing herself/himself in the shoes of the learners, explaining what is expected of a student, and making the learning experience pleasant. Having conducted many teachers' training courses for intermediate and graduate level teachers, I know the banality of my supposition above. Our peripheral schools and colleges are yet to make digital experience central to their pedagogical practices. The ICT in Education Masterplan Review 2019 prepared by Unesco, which is available on the website of the Ministry of Education, may tell you that there has been a significant progress in the incorporation of ICT in classrooms. This simply involves equipping schools with computers and multimedia projectors. Whether they are properly being used is a different issue. While I was teaching the teachers how to make their classes interactive and to apply blended learning, my trainee teachers told me that, in most cases, the projectors in their institutions were locked in the rooms of the principals. A teacher can issue the equipment at her/his own risk, giving written assurances that she/he will be responsible for any damage as the institutions do not have any maintenance budget. This is symbolic of how our digital progress is contained. The equipment lies in a box, nipping any possibility of thinking-out-of-the-box in its bud.   When students from these institutions come to the tertiary system, particularly to places where student-centred active learning is practiced, they find it difficult to cope with the changes and challenges. The recent aversion to digital classrooms made me reflect on the contextual background. What is even more alarming is the fact that there is an absolute lack of preparedness to deal with crisis management in the education sector. All the directives so far involve health and safety related issues. There are no official directives regarding the safeguarding of the education of our future generation in a prolonged crisis scenario. Hence, immediate guidance is needed for the clueless teachers, students and parents so that they can prepare for educational continuity. Similar guidance is needed so that psychosocial support can be made available to both teachers and students during long-term out-of-school closures. Education is not only transmission of knowledge from educators to learners; it is related to the holistic growth and wellbeing of the individuals concerned. Education shapes one's personalities, one's attitudes towards life, and makes one a social being. How we do that in a virtual setting (better not to confuse with social media) is a \"koti taka\" question! We need a plan for strategic interventions--a national contingency plan for the education sector which may go beyond fire drilling or natural disasters. The existing Bangladesh Emergency Response Plan 2014 and a follow-up SOD simply include guidelines for the aftermath of flood, cyclones or earthquakes. The pandemonium ensued by the pandemic has given rise to new concerns. Long-term social distancing, self-isolation is not only a probability but a reality. Migrating to the online teaching platform can be a logical step. Countries such as Syria, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and the Philippines have earlier adopted flexible distance learning to deal with war-time emergency. Maybe the time has come for us to educate ourselves and brace ourselves against the new dangers that may not wear a crown; they may appear in the shape of climate change or in some other formats where we will need to relearn everything that we have learned so far. And that day is not far, yet we are far away from being ready for it.   Shamsad Mortuza is a Professor of English, University of Dhaka (now on leave). Currently, he is Pro-Vice-Chancellor of ULAB.

      "text": "IDEAS & TRENDS; Once More, the Earth Visits Disaster on the Plains of Bangladesh\n1988-09-11T05:00:00.000Z\nSPRAWLING across a vast delta where three of the world's great rivers meet, Bangladesh is the drainpipe of Central Asia. In bountiful times, the rich alluvial silt that covers most of the country yields as many as three rice crops a year. But when the drainpipe overflows, as it did two weeks ago, Bangladesh becomes a land reminiscent of Bruegel's visions of triumphant death.\nIn a 10-day period of torrential monsoon rain that ended last week, more than 22 inches fell in some regions, and rainfall throughout the country was twice as much as normal for such a period. When the rain finally let up, 50 of the country's 64 administrative districts lay under a sheet of water that covered roads to depths of up to eight feet.\nGovernments and relief organizations throughout the world hastened to send food and medicine, but as usual in such disasters, most of Bangladesh's 110 million inhabitants were isolated by the flood and beyond immediate help.\nHundreds died when the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna Rivers overflowed. When the bacteria-laden water began to subside last week, germinating intestinal diseases lingered, tainting wells, rice paddies and streams. Water-borne illness is a principal cause of Bangladesh's 12 percent infant mortality rate.\nFor the people of long-suffering Bengal, disaster never seems to end. Though this year's floods were particularly destructive in the region, some flooding occurs nearly every year, shifting land, dispossessing farmers and spreading disease.\nSince the bloody birth of Bangladesh in 1971, some of the nation's leaders have blamed India, their one-time ally, for contributing to both floods and droughts. India and Bangladesh have often been at odds over the equitable division of water from the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and other rivers on which both countries depend. Bangladesh officials have accused India of disrupting the flow with its dams, and of worsening the silting problem by permitting extensive deforestation of regions drained by the rivers. Long, Slow Flooding\nThis year, although the overflowing of rivers originating in India, Nepal and Tibet apparently exacerbated matters, climatologists believe that the main cause of the disaster was rain in Bangladesh itself. Aside from the tea-growing hill country in the northeast, Bangladesh is as flat as a board and only a few feet above sea level. In hard rains, the shallow, sluggish rivers quickly overflow. Once inundated, the countryside takes weeks to drain.\nThe underlying problem is Bangladesh's yearly exposure to the southwest monsoon. As climatologists explain it, the monsoon affecting South Asia pivots around western China, where the sun warms the ground and the ground warms a rising column of air. This mass of rising air sucks in cooler air from the oceans, notably the Bay of Bengal, creating sea breezes in coastal areas.\nAs the moisture-filled air from the sea moves inland, it is warmed and pulled into the rising column. When the column reaches the cold air at high altitude, the moisture condenses. The rain is especially likely to begin over land that rises abruptly from a plain. This year, the rain was torrential where the Bangladesh highlands rise above the flat rice and jute fields.\nNo one knows why monsoon rains and the cyclonic storms that sometimes accompany them are destructive in some years and mild in others. But climatologists have a growing suspicion that ''active'' monsoons like the one Bangladesh has just been through are closely related to a phenomenon experts call the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.\nEvery few years, the surface water off the west coast of South America becomes warmer than usual, heating the air above it and disturbing circulation patterns in the atmosphere throughout the world. During a typical El Nino event, normally rainy regions are sometimes stricken by droughts, and normally parched areas are drenched. In 1982-83, the world experienced the most severe El Nino event on record, which damaged crops and fishing industries in regions as widely separated as New Zealand, California and Africa. Scientists believe it also perturbed carbon dioxide and ozone concentrations and may even have slightly slowed the Earth's rotation on its axis.\nOddly enough, however, the years when El Nino activity peaks seem to correspond to those in which the monsoon season in Bangladesh is mild, and vice versa. The most recent El Nino event ended last March, and some experts believe that this might have been taken as a sign that the monsoon in Bangladesh this summer would be severe.\nNo one yet knows what the connection between El Nino and the monsoon may be. Nor is anyone sure that being able to predict bad weather would really help Bangladesh much. The country's impoverished masses have nowhere to go, much as the many Bangladeshis who would like to emigrate to Pakistan or India. Flood control measures in a country that is mostly a big flood plain are limited.\n''At any rate,'' a public health official in Dhaka once said, ''the monsoon helps to assure our supply of the one commodity in which we are rich: misfortune.''"

Launched by the USAID GeoCenter and three universities in 2015, it has grown into a global network of 163 university chapters with over 5000 students. \"We don't build maps, we build mappers\" is their official motto, as they attempt to cultivate a generation of young leaders to create resilient communities. Their leadership fellow programmes, research fellow programmes and virtual internships are beneficial to both students and faculty members for self-development. Maliha Binte Mohiuddin from University of Dhaka began her journey with YouthMappers in 2016, shortly after she wrote a blog entry titled, \"Mapping is like a box of chocolates\", for one of their programmes. Consequently, she was selected as a Leadership Fellow in 2017 and attended a seven-day training session in Nepal, where she also received the Best Blog certificate. In 2018, she was selected for a five-month training programme in Manila, under the National NGO Program for Humanitarian Leadership, organised by Concern Worldwide. She was the youngest representative at International Medical Corps and Harvard Humanitarian Initiatives. YouthMappers works around mapping for humanitarian matters and projects like malaria prevention, food security and resilience against natural calamities. Everyone at YouthMappers is engaged with remote and field mapping sectors. Maliha regards mapping to be an exciting activity for young students, as it enables them to utilise different areas of knowledge and turn them into diagrams. Her current job as the Regional Ambassador is to aid in the process of creating new chapters through local communication with the youth in Asia. Maliha is also involved with their Let Girls Map campaign for bringing aspiring female mappers to the forefront. She recently organised a workshop at Daffodil International University where she taught the students about mapping and worked on a project based on flood resilience in Noakhali. \"We used the Kobo Toolbox, field paper and Mapillary app. With the help of two female volunteers from University of Dhaka, Nowshin Afrose and Sabiha Muna, the programme was a great success,\" she shared. Presently, there are twelve chapters of the network at different institutions across Bangladesh, including University of Dhaka, Dhaka College, Eastern University, Jahangirnagar University, Asian University of Women, Daffodil International University and State University of Bangladesh.  Maliha had Dr Patricia Soils, Director and Principal Investigator of YouthMappers, as her mentor, when she started out. She strongly believes that the platform has given her the encouragement and strength to pursue her goals as a humanitarian in the long run. She is grateful to YouthMappers for equipping her with valuable life skills. Maliha recently presented her paper, Elevating the Skills of Youth Through the Humanitarian Remote Mapping with the Thrive of YouthMappers Network, as one of the keynote speakers at the 3rd International Conference on Natural Hazards and Disaster Management, held in Japan. She has also contributed to the engagement of students at Keio University and Okayama University of Science, with the goal of affiliating them with the YouthMappers network."

Work on the bridge is stopped as the construction firm withdrew the workers around three months ago. Sadar Upazila Engineer of Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) Saiful Islam said the old bridge was washed away in the flood of 2015, so they floated a tender to build a new 190-foot-long and 20-foot-wide concrete bridge at a cost of Tk 2.41 crore. Local firm Messrs Mofakkharul Islam got work order in November, 2016, to complete it within two years. Visiting the site on January 22, this correspondent found that girders, wing walls and three pairs of pillars have been completed, but the railings on both sides of the bridge are still incomplete. No labourers or masons were present at the site, he added. The upazila engineer said only 70 percent of the work has been completed so far. The contractor did not build the approach roads but just dumped some sand on the two ends of the bridge, he added. Locals said they made a bamboo bridge on one side so that bikes and rickshaw vans can cross, but it is risky and people sometimes fall from it and get hurt. Tafser Ali of the area said a biker, Laxmikanta Roy, 50, was injured when he slipped from the risky makeshift bridge and fell on the dried river bed last week. He is undergoing treatment at Rangpur Medical College Hospital, Tafser added. Giriza Prosonna Roy, 60, a resident and an ex-schoolteacher, said the contractor took his workers to work at another site, leaving the bridge incomplete.  \"We are now compelled to bring groceries on trucks, travelling an additional 30 km,\" said Abdus Sattar, 45, a grocer of nearby Bahalipara market. Wahidul Islam, 55, headmaster of Ramnagar High School, said there are five schools on both sides of the river and many students cannot attend classes in the rainy season for want of a bridge. Contractor Mofakhkharul Islam Mamun refuted the allegatiosn, alleging that some people stopped the construction, claiming that the land belongs to them.  \"Initially, locals donated land to build the bridge and approach roads but now they are demanding compensation, which we cannot give as the government has not allocated any money. We want to solve the problems with the help of elected public representatives,\" said Md Belal Hossain, executive engineer of district LGED."

But a simple rethinking of the ways governments give food assistance may achieve what high tech has not.\nDazzling advances in research and ever-increasing harvests in many developing countries have not been able to protect the world's poor from malnutrition. But a simple rethinking of the ways governments give food assistance may achieve what high tech has not.\nSuch rethinking is now under way in some of the neediest and most debt-distressed countries. The best of their new food programs show that it is possible to reduce malnutrition substantially, quickly and affordably - without fostering dependence on welfare. The key is to target food program to those in need. Obvious? Yes, but too many programs have squandered benefits on those who do not require special attention.\nUntil recently, Brazil's annual $1 billion wheat subsidy was available to the rich and poor alike. In a number of African countries, subsidies go to foods like meat and butter, which are out of the reach of the poor even with the subsidy - and the poor continue to go hungry.\nAn income test would seem the most sensible approach to deciding who gets benefits, but it is often unworkable. Even in the United States, where income reporting is systematized, the food stamp program has been jeopardized by charges of abuse. In the developing world, where income is less documented and often takes the form of food a family grows for itself, determining eligibility by income is next to impossible.\nSome countries have found creative, alternative ways to reach the neediest. They target programs by place, type of food, age and signs of faltering growth in children, or even by season. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, several countries are beginning to concentrate food resources in scarce months, before the harvest, when malnutrition is most severe.\nThailand and Brazil now focus on regions where malnutrition is concentrated, in the northeast of both countries. Several Brazilian states have gone further. They target the favelas, the very poor neighborhoods, by subsidizing basic foods for customers of small stores. Because better-off Brazilians prefer not to journey into favelas, even for lower prices, the benefits go to those who need them. In Colombia, poverty is scattered throughout the country. So the Government ranked each county according to poverty criteria such as infant mortality and access to health care. Food coupons were distributed to the needy in the 30 percent of counties ranking lowest in these categories.\nSome countries target by subsidizing foods consumed primarily by the poor. In Bangladesh, rice is the preferred grain for those with money; thus, a subsidy on sorghum, which is nutritionally splendid, benefited only those too poor to buy rice. Morocco, which is restructuring its subsidies to emphasize foods eaten by the poor, expects to give the poor greater nutritional benefits for one-fifth the former cost. This year, Mexico established a similar but even larger program than Morocco's, dismantling many of its generalized subsidies.\nTamil Nadu, a state in India, targets a food and nutrition education program in the poorest areas for those at greatest risk. Nutrition workers in 9,000 villages weigh children monthly and provide daily feedings for 90 days to those whose growth is faltering. At the same time, they teach mothers of underweight children how to improve nutrition at home within their means. High-risk pregnant and breast-feeding women also receive food.\nThe benefit of the Tamil Nadu project has been dramatic and enduring. Serious malnutrition has declined by about 50 percent. Two years after children complete the program they are, on average, a significant four pounds heavier than children who did not participate. Sri Lanka is now developing a similar program.\nWhat makes all of these targeted programs so attractive is that they are cost-effective. Food stamps and other broad subsidies often eat up 10 to 20 percent of national budgets. But the new programs get better results at projected costs of only 1 to 2 percent of national budgets, and overall costs are much lower than in conventional approaches. Because these programs provide food only when or where it is most needed, they are less likely to foster a welfare mentality.\nNone of this is to suggest that alleviating the underlying causes of poverty should not remain the most important goal. Education, jobs and access to land are all sorely needed. But the poorest cannot wait. A direct attack on malnutrition is needed as well, and governments willing to make that effort now have effective and affordable measures to make it happen."

      "text": "About New York; A 'Mother' Waits With Open Arms At Ports of Call\n1989-05-13T05:00:00.000Z\nThe big man at the top of the gangplank wore lots of tattoos and a leer. ''Hiya, sister,'' he said. ''Welcome to the love boat.''\nThe Rev. Barbara C. Crafton, who has been called Sweetie, Cupcake, Honey Doll and more, was unabashed. The Episcopal priest, one of the first 50 women ordained in 1980, has visited some 4,000 ships and heard it all. Her ministry is to the 200,000 seafarers from 60 countries who call each year at ports in the area.\n''The job is real dirty and ugly,'' said Mother Crafton, as she prefers to be known, director of Seafarers' Services for the Seamen's Church Institute of New York and New Jersey. But the joy of comforting achingly lonely souls is immense. ''The smallest sort of thing you do is a big thing,'' she said.\nThings like distributing armloads of magazines, offering a lift to stores, arranging a phone call home, setting up a soccer game, counseling marriages split by half a planet and helping seafarers fight for what few rights they have. Mother Crafton has gone into lockers to administer last rites; in these days of refrigeration, bodies are shipped home rather than buried at sea. She has exorcised demons from unlucky vessels.\nIt is all some distance from Mora, Minn., the farm town where Mother Crafton grew up landlocked and driven by an ambition to go where not everyone was blond. Now 38 years old, she is sailing a voyage that has included study at Rutgers, Princeton and the General Theological Seminary; a marriage, two daughters and a divorce, and work from cabaret singer to parish priest.\nMother Crafton's love affair with the sea began when the seamen's institute - which is ecumenical but affiliated with the Episcopal Church - asked her to perform the Cole Porter songs she loves. She expected ''a swashbuckling bunch of beer-swillers.'' What she found were ''polite little Asian boys'' far, far from home.\n''I felt sorry for them,'' she said. Thus it was that\nMother Crafton left her New Jersey parish and went to work on the waterfront in 1983. It was a different waterfront from the wild and wooly one prevailing when the institute, in 1844, launched the first of three floating churches -steeples and all - that became East River landmarks. It was different, too, from the macho jungle Marlon Brando prowled in ''On the Waterfront.''\nFierce competition has changed the maritime industry. To raise productivity and slash costs, ships have become larger and more automated, carrying smaller crews and spending 12 hours rather than a week in port. Most now register under what are called flags of convenience - Panama's, say, or Liberia's - to avoid taxes and labor rules that American or European flags would mandate.\nToday's sailors come from the bargain basement, the villages of the third world. Mother Crafton tells of a Greek cruise ship in which 50 Bangladeshis in a crew of 600 were kept in despicable conditions: eight in rooms meant for two, no bedding, the toilet a smelly hole in the next room. Unlike sailors of other nationalities, the Bangladeshis were denied shore leave for fear they would bolt.\nMother Crafton knew she could not do much, but she attacked a particularly egregious insult - men who made 50 cents an hour having to pay 55 cents for a soda. She succeeded in forcing the price to 20 cents, but probably only for as long as the boat was berthed.\nShe has seen other bad things. A Filipino whose village scraped together $1,400 to pay his way to Miami so he could become an $800-a-month assistant chef. All that was available was a messboy's job at $200 a month.\nShe saw a Chinese seaman break his neck and slowly die on a cold December day. She tells of ships abandoned at New York docks and bewildered crews running out of food. Missing fingers are common. Some shipping companies keep such inadequate records that families aren't notified of a death. All they know is that the checks no longer come.\n''You don't have to treat people like dogs to make money,'' declared Mother Crafton, who admits the world labor market is sufficiently glutted that owners can make even more by doing precisely that.\nAnd there is the loneliness. Today's seamen are gone for a year at a stretch, missing children's births, parents' deaths. Mother Crafton fears the effects of the solace many seek from prostitutes. Seamen, she worries, could become Typhoid Mary's carrying AIDS far and wide. She has distributed 30,000 pamphlets warning of the dangers in six languages.\nMother Crafton doesn't force religion on people. But while chauffeuring three Colombian seamen from Red Hook Terminal in Brooklyn to the Fulton Street Mall, she did recall that some of Jesus's apostles were seamen.\n''This is neat work,'' she judged."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-24 00:00:00      \nSeveral hundred people, mostly children, gathered at a paddy field in Bankina village of Kalihati upazila of Tangail district. They were witnessing something they had never seen before. A part of a paddy field, overflowing with fully-ripened harvest-ready paddy, was set ablaze by its owner. While the children were cheering at the \"bonfire,\" as they could not perceive the gravity of the incident, some people were trying to console a weeping Abdul Malek Shikder, the owner of the paddy field, while others were trying to extinguish the fire. Abdul set fire to the fruit of his hard labour out of sheer desperation. He had already spent more than Tk 25,000 to cultivate and irrigate his 52 decimals of land. Then, he just learnt that he had to pay at least Tk 900-1000 to a labourer, along with providing food and accommodation, to harvest the crop. A land of this size required at least 10 to 15 labourers. However, he would not get more than Tk 500 from selling one maund (one maund is 40 kilogrammes) of paddy. Abdul was shocked to his core when he learnt about this rate. This meant that he would not be able to hire a single labourer to harvest his crop. He says, \"When I saw my fully ripened paddy was being reduced to food for rats and birds, I could not control myself. Sometimes I thought of committing suicide. I had taken a loan to purchase seeds, pesticides and fertiliser and I didn't know how I would pay back the loan when the price of paddy is this low. Then, out of desperation, I set my field on fire.\" Abdul was not alone. Another farmer named Nazrul Islam also set fire to his paddy field because he could not afford to harvest his crop due to the low price of paddy. In several districts, farmers like Abdul have taken to the streets demanding fair prices for paddy. And while the farmers are being given a nominal price for their hard-earned harvest, the costs of rice and all other essential commodities are on the rise. This year, in different parts of the country, the price per kilogram of rice has increased up by Tk 3-5. Now, a farmer has to purchase a kilogram of coarse rice at Tk 50 and half a litre of bottled water at Tk 15 whereas he is being forced to sell every kilogramme of paddy only at Tk 12.  Kazi Sazzad Zahir Chandan, general secretary of Bangladesh Krishak Shamiti (Bangladesh Farmers' Association) says, \"Farmers have agreed to sell paddy at the government fixed rate of Tk 1,040 per maund of paddy. Despite the fact that a rate has been declared by the government, they are being forced to sell their paddy at less than half this rate. The middlemen and millers are making a huge profit by depriving the farmers.\" Every year the government takes the initiative to procure rice and paddy directly from the farmers at a fixed price. However, the government procures such an insignificant amount of paddy that it cannot influence the market at all. For instance, last year, 19.5 million tonnes of Boro rice was harvested in Bangladesh and the government procured only one million tonne of that. As a result, most of the farmers have to sell their paddy to the middlemen and millers. According to Abdul and his neighbours, \"During every harvest season, the local political leaders and their henchmen suddenly become rice-paddy traders. Many of us cannot afford the transport cost of shipping our crops to the rice mills. We are forced to sell our paddy harvest to these seasonal traders. They are rich people and have sufficient storage facility. Sometimes, they sell the paddy to the rice mills at a profit, and sometimes they trade with the government.\" These middlemen sell their stock to the government buyers and the millers at the government fixed rate of Tk 1040 per maund of paddy but they purchase paddy from the farmers at only Tk 500-600 per maund. In this way, these middlemen make more than a hundred percent profit while the farmers incur huge losses.  Considering increasing production costs, the government is supposed to increase the buying rate of paddy to ensure a fair price for the farmers. For instance, in 2017, the government's fixed price for each kilogramme was Tk 24 and in 2018 it was increased to Tk 26. However, this year, the government did not increase the price at a time when price of rice and all other commodities are increasing. Dr Mohammad Yunus, senior research fellow, Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) says, \"We should keep in mind that the government procures paddy from the farmers not to ensure a fair price for them. They make the procurements only to replenish the government granaries. The Bangladesh government procures a very small amount of paddy from the farmers. China, Japan and Vietnam have formed purchase commissions to buy crops directly from the farmers and also to ensure that they get a fair price. Unfortunately, we have not formed any such body in Bangladesh yet.\" Just several days earlier, minister for agriculture, Dr Abdur Razzaque told the media that it would not be possible to increase the price of paddy. \"This season, the farmers will have to bear with the loss. We don't see any alternative at this moment. We will try to purchase as much paddy as possible. But the government's stockpiles are already full with imported rice. We are thinking of exporting paddy to increase its price but we need to think about making such commitments because Bangladesh is extremely prone to natural calamities,\" states Dr Abdur Razzaque. While the state is being indifferent to the plight of the farmers, hundreds of thousands of them are passing days in poverty and starvation. Many of them are moving to the cities to avoid meeting their debtors. Some of them like Abdul are taking desperate and destructive measures. This year on March 29, a farmer named Arjun Sarker from Naogaon district killed his wife and son by poisoning their food and then committed suicide. The officer-in-charge of Mohadebpur police station of Naogaon district says, \"Arjun borrowed money from several non-government organisations and individuals. Due to repeated loss in agriculture, he could not repay the debts. His debtors had been pursuing him for months.\" On April 19 this year, another farmer named Subroto Pramanik from Magura district committed suicide as his debtors seized all of his lands and his house when he failed to repay the interest of his debts. Subrata and Arjun's suicides are not isolated incidents. According to a 2013 research conducted by Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh, the monthly income of 55 percent of the suicide victims was less than Tk 4000 and most of them were involved in agricultural activities. In 2016, a local NGO of Jhenaidah called Society for Voluntary Activities (SOVA), conducted a survey on the suicide victims of the district and found that 63 percent of them were involved in agriculture and most of them committed suicide due to poverty and debt-related reasons. So far, loan default cases have been filed against at least 168,000 farmers by different NGOs, individuals and banks. Among these cases, arrest warrant has been issued against at least 12,000 farmers. Some NGOs and banks announced the names of the defaulters in the local bazaars. Md Mokbul Hossain, a farmer from Joatpur village of Cumilla's Burichong upazila says, \"I took Tk 20,000 as a loan from the Bangladesh Krishi Bank. When my name was announced in the market as a defaulter, I felt ashamed. I don't know how to pay the debt because I took out only Tk 20,000 but they filed a case claiming Tk 55,000 from me. How will I pay such a huge amount of interest? So, I have fled from my village and am now pulling a rickshaw in Dhaka.\" According to an official of the bank who requested anonymity, \"We announced names and filed these cases to create psychological pressure among the farmers. This measure has worked out already. Many of them have partially paid their debts back.\" However, the total amount of money owed by all the 168,000 farmers who have been prosecuted, is only Tk 561 crore. Muhammad Nazrul Islam, chairman of Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank, a specialised state-owned financial institution that finances the farmers of Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions, says, \"Most of the farmers take very small loans. And, according to my experience, they usually repay the loan in time unless they are hit by severe loss or crop failure. In this area, we are disbursing the loan at four percent interest and we never give any pressure to the farmers. I think we should decrease the rate of interest and make the loan payment system more popular and easier so that farmers feel more interested to take out loans from banks than from usurers and NGOs. This year, we are thinking of launching an agricultural fair where farmers will be able to sell their produces and repay their loan at the same spot.\" According to experts, the lack of a farmer-friendly policy has led to this crisis and it might worsen the situation in the near future. Dr MA Sattar Mondol, professor emeritus, department of agricultural economics and rural sociology at Bangladesh Agricultural University says, \"The agricultural ministry should conduct area-wise customised research to predict crop production all over the country. If we could conduct this research annually, such is being conducted even in India, our farmers and traders could prepare accordingly. Secondly, we must ensure automation in agriculture. We have ensured almost 100 percent automation in ploughing the land but we could not ensure it in sowing and harvesting the crop which are extremely labour intensive. We should also formulate a concrete policy regarding export and import of rice. After the flash flood of 2017, the government withdrew tariffs on rice import but did not reinstate the tariff in 2018. As a result, the government granaries are now flooded with imported rice and there is hardly any place left for the home-grown rice.\"     Just on May 20, the parliamentary standing committee on ministry of food recommended to stop all kinds of rice import immediately to recover from the situation. The committee has also recommended procuring more paddy from the farmers than the amount previously determined. However, according to experts, this decision has come too late to make any impact on the situation. According to Kazi Sazzad Jahir Chandan of Bangladesh Krishak Samity, \"The government must build temporary granaries in all the major rice producing areas. In this way, they can purchase paddy directly from the farmers and stockpile it properly. They should provide incentives to the farmers who have suffered irreparable losses so that they feel motivated to harvest paddy again. Otherwise, the situation will not improve.\" Development of high-yield crops has ensured sustained agricultural production in Bangladesh but due to the lack of a farmer-friendly agricultural policy, the farmers are not getting any benefit from the increased production. A manipulated and unstable market has been pushing a large number of farmers below the poverty line. If the state does not address this issue immediately with a sustainable and pro-farmer policy, our agriculture, our country's economic backbone will be broken in the near future.

      "text": "In Bangladesh, Too Much Water and Not Enough\n1988-09-18T05:00:00.000Z\nWith two jerrycans in hand, Muklesha Khatun waited impatiently for about four hours for the water trucks to arrive, and finally took home her allotted daily quota, two gallons.\n''I have to make do with these two pots for my entire family of five,'' Mrs. Khatun said, ''but in a way I'm thankful to Allah that we're still getting it.''\nMrs. Khatun, 45 years old, is one of about 30,000 residents of the overcrowded, low-lying neighborhood of Mugdapara here in the capital who have been at the mercy of such erratic water deliveries since Bangladesh was inundated with widespread flooding late last month. It is estimated that at least a third of the capital's five million people have been without regular water supplies because of the flooding.\nWith reservoir tanks and pumping stations submerged in many areas, hundreds of thousands of people are now dependent on drinking water brought from outside. The water and sewerage authority and political and volunteer organizations have mounted a major operation to bring drinking water to the affected areas, but, as Mrs. Khatun's experience shows, their efforts sometimes fall short.\nMuch of the country is still under water. The Government says that 935 people have died in the flooding, but its count is generally considered too low, and Dhaka newspapers put the toll at more than 1,800. The Health Ministry says that about 220,000 people are suffering from gastrointestinal diseases like diarrhea and dysentery as a result of the flooding, and that 185 people have died from such diseases. [ Railroad service from Dhaka to Chittagong, the main port, and Sylhet, the business center, has been restored after repairs to a railroad bridge outside the capital, Reuters reported. The bridge was washed away two weeks ago in the flooding. ] Getting water to Mugdapara, Mrs. Khatun's neighborhood, is an arduous and time-consuming exercise.\nVolunteers of the Family Planning Association of Bangladesh must first negotiate by rickshaw through waterlogged roads to reach the municipal pumping station, where their drums are filled. The drums are taken by pickup truck for a distance, but transferred again to rickshaws for delivery through streets where the water is still too deep. A stretch of mud has to be covered by men who carry the drums on their heads. Finally, when the drums reach the neighborhood, they are loaded onto boats that set off down serpentine lanes and bylanes to the community center, where the family planning association has set up its distribution camp.\n''It's a killing job,'' said Kazi Anisur Rahman, secretary general of the association. ''We spend nearly two hours to deliver five drums to this area less than three miles from our headquarters.'' Land for Dead and Living\nThe wan smile never left Nuruddin Mia's face as he wearily maneuvered his boat past submerged trees and houses under a blazing sun, on his way to Paschimgaon, a village of about 5,000 people 12 miles southwest of Dhaka.\nFor 30 years, Mr. Mia, who is from the village, has been ferrying people to and from the village of Demraghat three miles away. His route is the Balu River, which in the flooding has become a huge lake stretching as far as the eye can see.\n''Never, ever have I heard or seen such a flood and horror in my life,'' said Mr. Mia, who is 46. ''There's not a single house in this area that has escaped its wrath.''\nHis own house has been inundated by waist-deep water and looks as if it might crumble at any moment.\nMr. Mia and his 18-year-old son, Sohrab Hossain, spend nights in the boat. The other five members of his family sleep on the tin roof of the house, exposed to the elements. ''My own nephew, born 20 days ago, died of cold, and there is no doctor here who could be consulted with,'' he said.\nHe said the family had a hard time finding a dry spot where the body could be buried. ''Ultimately we took him to an adjoining area where a small parcel of land was found and we buried him there,'' he said.\nThe parcel holding the burial site is also haven for at least 200 people, mostly women and children huddling together with cattle, ducks and chickens.\n''This flood has leveled everybody -rich and poor, high and low,'' said Janab Ali Matbar, 65, the village headman. 'Living Like Animals'\nIn another neighborhood, 30 minutes ride by boat, an incomplete two-story rural health center converted into a relief camp houses more than 300 men, women and children. Of the four toilets in the building, two in the ground floor are under water, so many of those taking refuge in the building relieve themselves in the surrounding flood water. Many people were seen bathing and washing in the contaminated water.\n''You can't really call it life,'' said Rafiqul Islam Khandker, 40, who is in charge of the camp and who is also the headmaster of the local high school. ''They're living like animals.'' Still, many of those in the center appeared grateful to have found a place where one meal is provided daily, since they are extremely poor even in their normal circumstances.\nMr. Khandker said that there have been surprisingly few cases of diarrhea, dysentery and flu, diseases normally inevitable in such conditions.\n''There's no death yet due to these diseases,'' Mr. Khandker said.\nAzimul Baki, a rural health assistant, interjected: ''If there is any, we simply have to put the dead on a makeshift raft for lack of dry space for burial.''"

They grow different types of vegetables like pointed gourd, pumpkin, aubergine and bottle gourd in Kharif-1 (March-July) season, said Bimal Kumar De, sub-assistant agricultural officer of Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in Kurigram. Nine upazilas in the district have been affected by flood early this month and the floodwater started receding from the areas in the last couple of days. But the growers in eight unions of the four upazilas still continued harvesting the vegetables as floodwater could not enter their fields situated in highland areas. The agricultural officer said around 4,038 hectares of land in the district have been brought under vegetable cultivation this year. As the flood has affected 3,739 hectares out of 4,038 hectares of fields, vegetable prices have shot up, he said.  Saidur Rahman of Kaley village in Belgachha union of Sadar upazila said \"I have been cultivating vegetable in Kharif-1 season for the last four years and earning good profit.\" He has cultivated pointed gourd on 12 decimals of land spending Tk 6,000 this year, said the farmer. \"I've already sold pointed gourds at Tk 10,000,\" said Saidur, adding that he is expecting to earn Tk 16,000 more from sale of the vegetable. Grower Rezaul Islam of Sanwashi village in Halokhana union under Sadar upazila said he cultivated aubergine on 10 decimals of land and pointed gourd on 22 decimals of land this season. \"I have already sold the vegetables at Tk 31,000. I'm also expecting to earn Tk 43,000 more in the next two months,\" said Rezaul. They are getting good profits from the vegetable farming this season every year, he said. Another farmer Akbar Ali of Chhinaye Haat village in Chhinaye union of Rajarhat upazila said he cultivated aubergine on 40 decimals of land and pumpkin on 16 decimals of land spending Tk 19,000 in May this year. \"I'm expecting to earn Tk 42,000 from sale of the vegetables in the next two months,\" he said. Kurigram DAE Additional Deputy Director (Plant Protection) Sasty Chandra Roy said there are many vegetable growers in Rajarhat and Sadar upazilas and they are known as adapted farmers, who cultivate different types of vegetables during this period of the year, and get a good profit. In the rainy season, extra care is needed for pollination, he said."

In Natore, around 1,700 families in five unions of Lalpur upazila have become waterlogged as the Padma River continues to swell as a result of the opening of Farakka Barrage gates. Farmers in the affected areas are counting losses as their sugarcane fields and crop lands were inundated, causing immense sufferings to the residents of the areas. Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Ummul Banin Duti said: \"Three shelter homes were opened and the flood victims were asked to move there.\" The local administration said 500 flood-affected families in Lalpur union received 15kg rice each as relief. Assistant Engineer of Natore Water Development Board Al Asad said: \"The water level of Padma will continue to rise till Saturday.\" The flood situation in the upazila has been worsening for the last several days following a rise of the Padma water level. In Rajbari, water level of the Padma River was recorded at 12cm above the danger point at Goaland point in the district, and the water continually rose for the past 7 days.

Local sources said erosion by Padma River has intensified in Rajbari, and is gradually receding in Shariatpur, causing immense sufferings to the people. A large number of houses, structures, trees, and crops on vast tracts of land were washed away by floodwaters, and strong river currents in different flood-hit areas. In Rajbari, erosion in the Padma River has taken an alarming turn, it already forced thousands of families, under the Sadar, Goalanda, and Kalukhali upazila, to leave their houses, due to rise in water levels, villages within the district are becoming more vulnerable. According to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), they are dumping sand bags in the river to prevent erosion in the area. But locals claimed that BWDB's efforts aren't enough as forceful current, and rising water level is washing the sand bags away. They hoped the authority would take more effective measures to prevent erosion, which eroded at least 19 points of the district. Goalanda's Bhakla Union Parishad Chairman Md Amjad Hossain said: \"Not only the houses, but acres of croplands are underwater. BWDB initiatives are praiseworthy, but not enough to avert the erosion.\"  Arifur Rahman Angkur, Sub-Divisional Engineer BWDB's Rajbari office, said: \"We are dumping Geo bags to lessen the casualties. We will take more measures if needed.\" In Shariatpur, at least 20 establishments, including a mosque, 5 business centres, and houses were devoured by the Padma River, and it is threatening more areas in Naria upazila of Shariatpur district due to a wild rise in water level, causing severe river erosion in the past couple of days. Around 200 meters of the river protection dam has collapsed in the district on Thursday, making hundreds of residents, around the riverbank, to shift from the spot instantly. Locals said, the water level of the Padma was increasing since Thursday but has receded on Sunday.  Member of Parliament (MP), Deputy Minister for Water Resources AKM Enamul Haque Shamim, State Minister Zahid Faruque, and Director General of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) Mahfuzur Rahman, visited the area Sunday. They said there was no negligence with the construction of the protection dam. The damage was a result of increased current, and rise of water level in the river. It is to be noted that last year, more than 6,000 houses, around 1,000 business centres, and many other establishments were washed away due to devastating erosion of the Padma River in Naria upazila."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-21 00:00:00      \nDespite serious discord and disputes between the countries of South Asia, the concept of a common future of the region based on increasing cooperation among the people and governments has somehow survived because of strong geographical, economic and cultural factors. More recently however, this concept itself has been increasingly threatened. India has moved closer towards its eastern borders. Pakistan had already leaned more closely towards both China and some Arab countries. To a lesser extent, Nepal and Sri Lanka have also moved towards China. Sectarianism has weakened cultural relationships in South Asia level. Terrorism has become an issue of relentless discord and tension. The decline of the overall prospects of close cooperation at this juncture is tragic as this is probably the time when close cooperation is most needed. South Asia is passing through a critical phase of climate change which requires various countries to focus on new emerging developmental and environmental challenges as well as increase cooperation to face these extremely difficult challenges for which the region is not at all well prepared. South Asia has 16 percent of the world's population, over 30 percent of the world's poor, only 2 percent of its land and 1 percent of oil resources. So, the developmental challenges here were already acute before the advent of the disruptive manifestations of climate change. Experts see South Asia as a region where some of the most serious impacts of climate change are likely to emerge. In addition, a range of related life-threatening environmental problems have also been worsening in the region, including freshwater scarcity, decline in water tables, serious threats to rivers, deforestation, soil/land erosion and sharp decline in natural fertility, air quality, threats to safe food and proliferation of various hazards. The need to reduce GHG emissions while meeting basic needs of all people with dignity is a huge challenge, the most important real challenge for South Asia. South Asia can stand up to this challenge in a sustained situation of peace and stability where it is possible to devote most efforts, talents and resources for this. The actual situation, sadly, is a very different one. South Asia is commonly seen to consist of eight countries--India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bhutan and Maldives. Two of these are nuclear powers. The chances of actual use of nuclear weapons have increased in recent times. It is well known that any use of nuclear weapons, or any accident relating to these, can have destructive impacts not just in the nuclear weapon countries but also in neighbouring countries. While six out of eight countries of South Asia have absolutely no involvement with nuclear weapons, they may have to bear the consequences of their use or even deployment/storage by two countries. South Asia has emerged as one of highest arms-importing regions of the world. Combining direct and indirect expenses, the total military expenditure may be much higher than what is stated officially, denying precious resources for urgent development and environment protection tasks. South Asia has seen two extremely violent partitions and a much higher number of violent secessionist movements and insurgencies. It has also seen four wars involving India and Pakistan, and a persistent state of foreign invasion and internal violence in Afghanistan for over four decades. Terrorism is a big source of violence but also has a larger and more destructive role as a trigger for an all-out war. On the whole, war and civil war, secession and insurgency are likely to have claimed nearly six million lives in South Asia in the post-World War II phase. The number of people who were displaced or ruined in other ways is higher. Sectarianism and sectarian violence remain at high levels. Secularism has very dim prospects. Democracy has had its ups and downs in various countries of the region. It survives at rather low levels of achievement. Democracy needs to be strengthened from many points of view, one of the most important being the creation of conducive conditions in which alternative viewpoints can emerge and acquire strength. These alternative views should seek peace, harmony, environment protection, justice and equality (including gender-based justice and equality). An accompanying effort would be to make dedicated efforts to spread values of universal peace, non-violence, non-dominance, non-discrimination and social equality (including at the gender level), a wider understanding of honesty and sincerity as well as some basic human rights and duties. Such an effort if sustained for about five years can help to change public perceptions so that democratic leaderships devoted to peace, justice and environment protection can emerge.

The idea of moving Indonesia's seat of government from an urban conglomeration of nearly 30 million people with some of the world's worst traffic jams has stretched on for decades. Low-lying Jakarta is also prone to annual flooding and is one of the world's fastest sinking cities due to excessive groundwater extraction. Indonesia wants to move the capital from sinking Jakarta https://t.co/g0ejcImWZL On Monday, urban planning minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said the long-stalled relocation plan won approval from President Joko Widodo who favoured moving the capital away from Indonesia's most populous Java island. Jakarta, which suffers billions of dollars in annual congestion-and-flood linked economic losses, would remain the country's financial hub. \"Widodo decided on the option to relocate the capital,\" Brodjonegoro said after a cabinet meeting.  In a statement before the meeting, Widodo expressed support for the idea, but he did not give an alternate location or a timeline for any move. \"In the future, would Jakarta be able to carry the double burden of being both the centre of government and its business centre?\" he asked in the statement. \"If we prepare well from the very beginning, this great relocation idea could be realised,\" he added. During his re-election campaign, Widodo pledged to spread economic growth more evenly in the nation of 260 million.  He won a second term this month, according to unofficial poll results.  Local media have reported that a possible new capital would be Palangkaraya city on the island of Borneo."

A seven-member SC bench, headed by Chief Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain, dismissed the five petitions seeking a review of its earlier verdict. The apex court verdict has brought to an end the legal battle that had dragged on for around 15 years. Now the project authorities have to remove all the earth from the area for keeping it as a free-flood flow zone, say legal experts. On July 11, 2013, the SC released the full text of its 159-page verdict directing the project owner, Metro Makers and Developer Limited, to restore within six months the wetland in Savar's Bilamalia and Bailarpur moujas. In September 2013, the private firm and buyers of plots in the project lodged five petitions with the SC, seeking a review of its judgment. Earlier, the SC in a verdict on August 7, 2012, upheld a High Court judgment that had declared illegal the Modhumoti Model Town near Aminbazar.  The apex court directed the authorities concerned to keep the area as a free-flood flow zone. Metro Makers and Developer Limited developed the housing project, filling up 550 acres of wetland identified as floodplain in the 1997 Dhaka City Master Plan. The HC on July 27, 2005, declared the project unauthorised, illegal and against public interest. It also said that the interest of the buyers must be protected. In August 2004, Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela) filed a writ petition with the HC as public interest litigation, challenging the legality of the project. It said the project was developed violating the Environment Conservation Act, Town Improvement Act and Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) rules. In its petition, Bela mentioned that if the project continued, the character of the area would be destroyed and the environment would be polluted. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bela, told this newspaper that following the SC order, the Metro Makers and Developer Limited must remove all the earth from the project area and restore the wetland within six months."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-21 00:00:00      \nLong despised by German fans as the face of big-money football, billionaire Dietmar Hopp is now being held up by some as a national hero in the coronavirus crisis. Three weeks ago, the 79-year-old owner of the Hoffenheim club was the subject of nationwide protests in Germany's stadiums, with fans calling him a \"son of a b***h\" and holding up pictures of his face in crosshairs. This week, Hopp raised hopes of a vaccine for the COVID-19 disease, suggesting a company he owns could develop one as soon as the autumn. Ranked by Forbes as the eighth richest person in Germany, Hopp made his fortune with SAP, a software company he co-founded in 1972. Decades later, he used his wealth to propel Hoffenheim, based near Sinsheim in southwestern Germany, from amateur league anonymity to the top-flight Bundesliga and a place among Europe's elite in the Champions League. That made him a hate figure for football fans across the country. For Germany's \"ultras\", Hopp is a symbol for how wealthy investors hold too much power in football. They see him as a threat to the culture and traditions of the German game, and more specifically to the 50+1 rule, which underpins the considerable influence of supporters in the way German clubs are run. Hopp has also riled fans by taking legal action over insulting chants sung about him by away supporters. A decision by the German Football Association to ban Borussia Dortmund fans from Hoffenheim for two years prompted a flood of protests last month, with fans across the country accusing football authorities of pandering to Hopp's personal wishes. Supporters of clubs such as Bayern Munich, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Union Berlin held up banners insulting Hopp and the DFB, leading in some cases to games being suspended. Three weeks on, the Bundesliga has been suspended due to the coronavirus crisis, but Hopp remains firmly in the headlines. He is now being heralded as a hero in some quarters, after it emerged that one of his companies, biotech firm CureVac, is working on a vaccine for COVID-19. CureVac's research was at the centre of a diplomatic row last weekend. According to a report in Welt newspaper on Sunday, US President Donald Trump offered the company up to a billion dollars to secure exclusive rights to the vaccine research for the United States. CureVac denied the report, while Hopp said such a deal \"would not be an option\". \"It's obvious for me that it can't be the case that a German company develops a vaccine which is then used exclusively in the US.\" The firm response earned him praise but football fans remain largely unmoved by Hopp's comments on the vaccine, which he says should be for \"people across the world\". \"It's very nice that a successful businessman is recognising his social responsibility and acting accordingly, but that has nothing to do with his involvement in football,\" said Sig Zelt, a spokesman for the organisation \"Pro-Fans\", on Wednesday."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-27 00:00:00      \nFarmers are acutely at risk of contracting sewage-borne diseases Comilla City Corporation's unplanned drainage system is turning farmland into water bodies; as polluted water is flooding hundreds of hectares of farmland. However, the city corporation has undertaken several mega projects to improve  rural infrastructure and increase opportunities for urbanization. Among these projects, one of them was undertaken to ensure a better sewerage system. However, the newly-constructed drainage system--in nine wards of Comilla City Corporation, including wards 23 and 24-- has brought sewage onto arable farmland, into open fields, and near educational institutions; mostly harming farmers in the process. Diseases--such as: cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and diarrhea--are emerging from these unhealthy conditions. Various crops, dwellings, schools, and other institutions, are in danger of becoming water-logged. Farmers complain that due to the negligence of the city corporation officials, the drains empty onto farmland instead of into rivers or canals. They claim that if the sewerage system had been carefully planned, the farmers would not be suffering. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said the drainage line empties onto farmland for various reasons; including that some cases filed against construction of the line, by people who do not want drains over their land, have left the process incomplete. He said: \"We are trying to find a solution to this problem.\" Visiting the area, this correspondent found that starting from the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) Comilla sector, the main drain pipe ends near Nandanpur Bishwaroad. Branches of drainpipes from other areas link to this main drain line, leading the sewage water away to places near farmlands, houses, and educational institutions in several areas, including: Gandhamati, Changini, Batabaria, and Rampur. The main drain line of the 23rd and 24th ward ends near Batabaria school, while Ghungaijhuri canal is only 2700 square feet away. If the drain had been extended by 2700 square feet--over the Changini-Nandanpur area to the canal--then the problems would not have existed. There are at least 30 government and non-government institutions in wards 23 and 24, including: the Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development (Bard), the BGB sector headquarters, Comilla University, a section of cantonment, a cadet college, Shalban Vihara, and the Buddhist Bihar Museum. Locals said if the unplanned sewerage system persists, these places will flood with polluted water. A farmer from Nandanpur, Abul Hashem said they are struggling to yield crops as contaminated water is flooding their arable farmland. They demand the pipeline be moved so that it ends at Ghungaijhuri canal, rather than on the farmland. Many people--including Md Ayub Ali, Md Lutfur Rahman, Zahid Hossain Mithu, and Md Abul Kalam--have complained that apart from harming the crops, farmers are also contracting skin diseases from the contaminated water. Dr Mosleh Uddin, president of Comilla Environment Movement, said: \"Due to the dirty and contaminated water of the drains, the farmers of those areas are [working] in extremely dangerous conditions. \"All the polluted water from the city is flowing onto agricultural land. As there is no way to dispose of the sewage--other than in the southern area of the city corporation--the area will be considered a recycling zone.\" He said it is possible to protect the agricultural land--at least in those areas--by creating a recycling project. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said: \"The work to extend the drainpipes, for them to empty into canals, is going ahead according to the master plan. It will be completed in phases. He also said alongside it, there is a plan to extend the main drain line of Nandanpur towards Ghungaijhuri canal. The mayor said: \"A man named Abdul Jalil from ward 24 has filed cases against seven city corporation officials, including me. Construction of drains in various places is hindered due to these problems.\""

Cattle in Africa are regarded as ''lobola,'' or bride price, an index of social prestige and a custom very much alive in Africa, and the more cattle the better, without regard to condition or whether or not they produce milk. Which is why one sees herds of emaciated cattle in rural Africa.\nI had personal experience with this attitude in a semirural environment, where the family had good elementary education. The family, consisting of six children and one adult, had one milk-producing cow, and when a serious drought affected the region, I offered to send money beyond what I was sending for their own needs to keep the cow alive. This was refused, and the cow was sold for a paltry sum that would have bought milk powder for about two months.\nI don't know what the solution might be, but attitudes must first change before inroads can be made to alleviate Africa's mass, periodic famines.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-21 00:00:00      \nSurging waters broke through embankments surrounding an island in Bangladesh's Noakhali district, destroying more than 500 homes A powerful cyclone pounded eastern India and Bangladesh on Wednesday, killing at least 14 people and destroying thousands of homes, officials said, leaving authorities struggling to mount relief efforts amid a surging coronavirus outbreak. The populous Indian state of West Bengal took the brunt of Cyclone Amphan, which barrelled out of the Bay of Bengal with gusting winds of up to 185 km per hour (115 mph) and a storm surge of around five metres. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said at least 10 people had died in the state, and two districts been completely battered by one of the strongest storms to hit the region in several years. \"Area after area has been devastated. Communications are disrupted,\" Banerjee said, adding that although 500,000 people had been evacuated, state authorities had not entirely anticipated the ferocity of the storm. With rains continuing, she said the hardest hits areas were not immediately accessible. Federal authorities said they could only make a proper assessment of the destruction on Thursday morning. \"We are facing greater damage and devastation than the Covid-19,\" Banerjee said, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has so far killed 250 people in the state. In West Bengal's capital city, Kolkata, strong winds upturned cars and felled trees and electricity poles. Parts of the city were plunged into darkness. An official in the adjoining Hooghly district said thousands of mud homes were damaged by raging winds. In neighbouring Bangladesh, at least four people were killed, officials said, with power supplies cut off in some districts. Authorities there had shifted around 2.4 million people to more than 15,000 storm shelters this week. Bangladeshi officials also said they had moved hundreds of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, living on a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, to shelter. But officials said they feared that standing crops could be damaged and large tracts of fertile land in the densely-populated country washed away.  \"Fortunately, the harvesting of the rice crop has almost been completed. Still it could leave a trail of destruction,\" said Mizanur Rahman Khan, a senior official in the Bangladesh agriculture ministry. Cyclones frequently batter parts of eastern India and Bangladesh between April and December, often forcing the evacuations of tens of thousands and causing widespread damage. Surge and high tide Surging waters broke through embankments surrounding an island in Bangladesh's Noakhali district, destroying more than 500 homes, local official Rezaul Karim said. \"We could avoid casualties as people were moved to cyclone centres earlier,\" Karim said. Embankments were also breached in West Bengal's Sundarban delta, where weather authorities had said the surge whipped up by the cyclone could inundate up to 15 km inland. The ecologically-fragile region straddling the Indian-Bangladesh border is best known for thick mangrove forests that are a critical tiger habitat, and is home to around 4 million people in India. On the Sundarbans' Ghoramara island, resident Sanjib Sagar said several embankments surrounding settlements had been damaged, and some flooding had started. \"A lot of houses have been damaged,\" he told Reuters by phone. Anamitra Anurag Danda, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation think-tank who has extensively studied the Sundarbans, said that embankments across the area may have been breached. \"The cyclone surge coincided with the new moon high tides. It is devastation in the coastal belt,\" he said."

      "text": "Flood-Ravaged Bangladesh Seeks Plan to Control Rivers\n1988-09-09T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Government of Bangladesh, reacting to what may be the worst flood of the country's history, called today for an international panel of experts to devise plans to control the rivers of South Asia.\nAt a news conference here tonight, Bangladesh's Minister of Information, Mahbubur Rahman, announced that the Foreign Minister, Humayun Rashid Chowdhury, had called for the prompt convening of an international panel so that a plan for the river systems could be discussed in December at a summit meeting of nations in the region.\nEarlier today, in an interview in a badly stricken area near the northern outpost of Ghatail, close to the Indian border, Mr. Rahman said that his country would seek to draw Nepal, Bhutan and India into substantive talks on the river systems.\nHe added that ''involving China may also be ultimately necessary,'' because of the proximity of Tibet.\nIt is in areas like Ghatail that the toll of the flooding, which began late last month, is most starkly revealed. Officials there think it will be three to six months before something resembling a normal existence returns. 'A Terrible Human Tragedy'\nBrig. Gen. Subed Ali Bhuya and his infantry brigade there are feeding and housing nearly 30,000 people, 12,000 head of cattle and innumerable chickens and goats. ''Their houses were washed away,'' the general said today of the people who have converged on his garrison since Aug. 30, leading cattle and carrying what they could salvage of their homes. ''It was a terrible human tragedy.''\nThe flooding this year is unlike the expected annual inundation that comes with the monsoon season. It has been a sudden flood ''out of season,'' destroying the barriers and embankments that this impoverished country has managed to construct.\nBangladesh is on the receiving end of mighty river systems - among them the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Jamuna and Meghna - that descend from the Himalayas. From ancient times, it has been destined to suffer major floods with great regularity.\nAdding to the problem in modern times, the great mountains of South Asia have become increasingly denuded and eroded in many places, and the cascade of earth and water each year grows more devastating to Bangladesh, which sprawls over delta after delta at the rivers' mouths.\nIf an international effort were to be mounted to control the rivers, the task would be mammoth, not only because of the technical challenges involved but also because of regional politics. India Called Key to Effort\nNo effective plan can be drawn up without the active support of the regional power, India. Although Bangladesh has sought to involve other neighbors, especially Nepal, where deforestation has also contributed to problems downriver, India continues to insist that the rivers are a matter for direct negotiation between New Delhi and Dhaka. But joint commissions have produced no comprehensive improvement.\nIn addition, relations between China and India have been cool since they fought a border war in the 1960's, and diplomats think India would be unlikely to welcome Chinese involvement in such talks.\nThe Government of Bangladesh today was decribing the floods as ''an unprecedented human tragedy.'' [ The Indian Government announced that it was sending two transport aircraft to drop food supplies to flood victims in Bangladesh.\nAn Indian spokesman said the craft are to carry about 30 tons of foodgrains on Friday and that four Indian helicopters already are assisting in relief work. ] No Place to Land a Helicopter In Ghatail, which is in one of the most severely affected parts of the country, nearly 100 percent of the farmland was under water today.\n''There is no place to land even a helicopter,'' General Bhuya said of the outlying villages in this area in the Tangail district, nearly 100 miles north of Dhaka. Reporters were brought to the general's headquarters by a Bangladesh Air Force helicopter.\nAll of the district's 384,309 people have been dislocated, General Bhuya said. At least 247,670 houses have been damaged or destroyed.\nThe situation is as bad or worse across three-fourths of Bangladesh's land area and for most of the country's 110 million people. Unlike Ghatail, many other areas have no military base where refuge can be sought.\nAmala Hussain, waiting with her seven children for a meal of rice taken from the rations of the men at the Ghatail garrison, said today that throughout her life of hardship as the wife of a landless tenant farmer she had ''never seen anything like this.''\nAt the garrison, medical treatment is administered by army doctors and there is clean water to drink, but when flood victims return home they will have no medicine to fight disease or snake bites. The national death toll from all causes during the flooding now stands at about 510."

According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) of the district, at least 3500 hectares of land have been used for cultivating tobacco in six upazilas . However, a group of people who deal with tobacco in the district said the figure was almost 10,000 hectares. Agricultural officers have said they are discouraging farmers not to grow this crop as it is harmful for both health and soil. However, the farmers are not paying heed to them as tobacco cultivation brings them huge profits every year. They also added several tobacco companies, including multinational companies, were luring tobacco growers with seeds, fertilisers as well as technical support free of cost. This correspondent visited several villages- Itakhola, Kochukata, Tupamari, Panchapakur, Gorgarm , Charcharabari and Kanaikata Bamondanga - of Sadar upazila and observed that farmers, including women and children, were passing busy times in the tobacco fields. Farmer Nazrul Islam of Charcharabari village of Sadar upazila said tobacco companies had set up many purchasing centres and warehouses of tobacco in the district for the advantage of farmers . They are collecting produce from the fields directly. Even supervisors and officials of tobacco companies are regularly assisting them with various facilities. Farmer Arzina Begum of Kanaikata Bamondanga village of Kishoreganj upazila said she had cultivated tobacco on two bighas of land that cost her Tk 8,000. She added, \"Akij company provided me with fertilizer, seeds free of cost.\" Another farmer, Mukta Akhtar, said: \"I have cultivated tobacco on two bighas of land, costing me Tk 10,000. I would sell the crops at Tk30,000-35,000. \"Had we cultivated rice, potatoes and green chillis, we would not be able to make much profit,\" she added. Some farmers of the district alleged that agriculture offices were not sincere in encouraging farmers to grow other crops. Farmers do not get advice from agriculture officials when their seed beds and crops get damaged. Nilphamari Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) Deputy Director Nikhil Chandra Biswas said: \"Profit in cultivating tobacco is more than the cost. For this reason, farmers, disregarding health risks, are cultivating tobacco in huge quantities. As a result, families of tobacco growers are getting exposed to various diseases and cropland is losing fertility gradually.\" \"However, we are trying to create awareness among farmers,\" he added."

Padma River erosion took an alarming turn in the last few days, rendering over 200 families homeless in the Rajeswhawar union of the Chandpur Sadar upazila. The affected people of Rajarchar, Mander Bazar, Khaskandi, Lagnimararchar, and Dewan Bazar areas of the union said onrush of flood waters from upstream and heavy rain in the last few days  swelled Padma-Meghna, flooding the areas on its banks. This made over 200 families of low-lying areas homeless, locals and Water Development Board officials said. A large number of flood victims took shelter on nearby highlands including  Bashgari, Majherchar, Goal Nagar and Rayerchar. Hajrat Ali Bepari , chairman of the Rajeswhawar union said about a thousand other families, living close to the river, are passing their days in anxiety and fear of being devoured by the Padma in the near future. He also said the  erosion along vast areas on the river bank earlier washed away scores of homesteads, schools in the area. The situation had been deteriorated due to constant erosion, he added.  Erosion-hit Kamal, 40, and Akkel Ali, 35, of the union said they had been passing sleepless nights in fear of erosion. \"Where will we go? We are all poor people,\" said Akkel Ali. Gourango, Abul Kalam and Laila of Mander Bazar alleged that unplanned dredging had sped up the erosion.  Executive Engineer of Chandpur Water Development Board Abu Raihan said, \"During the monsoon season the water stream in the river is very high. There are strong vortex current flows. This place is very risky within the union.\" He said they have nothing to do as the union is situated in the char area.  "

The flood control embankment construction project on the Padma river, flowing through Naria and Zajira upazilas of the district, has come to a halt with the recent outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic that has led to a nationwide lockdown. Over a lakh people living in the upazilas fear that if an erosion occurs again in the locality --which is highly likely as it happens every year-- it will be difficult for them to settle and earn their livelihood. The poverty-stricken locality had hardly any respite from the damage caused by the last erosion and yet there is now a threat of another. Over six thousand people --who lost their homestead and belongings in the last erosion-- settling in on others' land either through pity or rent are in a huge crisis. Roksana Begum, a resident of Naria upazila, lost everything to the river last year and now, when she and her husband both are jobless, the pandemic is making each day of their lives harder as the days go by. She said: \"We made a shed on a neighbour's land temporarily. We were hoping to get back to our normal life after the flood control embankment project was completed. But now erosion is coming towards us in one way and coronavirus has come in another. \"We have no money or anyone to help us. Either we will die of the disease or of poverty. It does not make much difference to us,\" Roksana added in sheer despair. Thousands of working class people, who lost everything in the regular erosion in the area like Roksana are facing the same difficulties. They are without work, income, food and scope for treatment.  Despite government-allocated ration goods, said another resident of the area seeking anonymity, people have been sleeping on hungry stomachs as they are not getting help or it would be correct to say that their goods are being looted by local representatives and political activists.  Mohadeb Das, a kitchen shopkeeper of Hindupara, said he used to own a large store. However, after the river devoured it, he was managing well with his single-shed kitchen shop by the riverside.  He said: \"I was waiting to see the embankment project completed. But now no one comes to my shop because of the disease and the river is closing in every day to consume my shop, my only means of livelihood again.\" Rashida Begum, who rented her neighbour's house after losing her home in the erosion, said: \"We were well off, with our daily jobs and income. It was not much but enough for a couple like us. \"But due to the coronavirus, we lost our jobs and did not have any help or rations from the authority. We do not know what will we do,\" said Rashida, who has been suffering from acute poverty due to the outbreak of the pandemic. Denying the allegations, Kazi Abu Taher, Deputy Commissioner of Shariatpur, told Dhaka Tribune that there was not a single house in his locality which had not been given proper help and not a single person was there who was hungry or had been deprived of rations. According to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), the flood control embankment project, stretching for 8.9 kilometres, was initiated in 2018 and was expected to be completed in 2021 at a cost of Tk1,097 crore. However, 33% of work remaining for the project has now come to a halt as workers have left for their homes with the outbreak of the pandemic. Stating that the project would be completed in due time, BWDB Executive Engineer Ahsan Habib said: \"The project is still ongoing in fractionally. Even if it gets halted overall, we will speed up the construction work later to complete it in due time.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-31 00:00:00      \n\"I've got to do something for my country -- that's all I could think of. I have to free my country from Pakistan,\" Kina Kora reminisced about how he felt when the Pakistani occupation army cracked down on unarmed Bangladeshis in the dark night of March 25 in 1971. Now 68, Kina Kora can still vividly recollect those turbulent days of '71 when he was only nineteen years of age. Some time around the end of March or early April that year, Kina and three others left their village to join the war -- the war to liberate their motherland. One of the three was his 21-year-old brother Sattan Kora. The other two, Thopal and Gopal Kora, also 19 and 21 at the time, were also siblings. These four courageous youths belong to the Koras -- a timid but hardworking small ethnic community on the verge of extinction. Only 21 Kora families still live in the remote village of Haljay, in Dinajpur's Biral upazila. Before Bangladesh won independence in '71, there were around 200 Kora families in Haljay, now known as Korapara. With sparkle in his eyes, Kina continued the story. \"We were young and brave\" and driven by Bangabandhu's fiery speech of 7th March.  After leaving the village, on their way to receive training on guerrilla warfare in West Bengal of India, they somehow got separated. Sattan ended up in Siliguri's Panighatta, where he received his training. The other three got their training in Hamzapur, near the western border of Dinajpur.      Kina said, \"After the training at Hamzapur, I was stationed in Ghugudanga village of Dinajpur Sadar upazila, where the Pakistanis had a stronghold.\" \"A fierce battle ensued between the Pakistanis and us. We lost our comrade Alim Uddin there. Later, we engaged in heavy fighting with the Pakistanis in Jamalpur and Ramsagar areas of Sadar upazila.\" But around September, before the struggle for freedom of his motherland ended, Kina had to return home to stand by his family's struggle for survival.    \"My family was in a dire situation when I came home,\" Kina said, adding that his family and the villagers were suffering from a near-famine situation. Out of his three compatriots, Gopal, son of Papua Kora, died in 1973 and Gopal's brother Thopal is now incapable of talking perceptibly due to paralysis, said Kina, who still makes a living by working as an agricultural day labourer.     His brother Sattan, who passed away in India in 2018, was wounded during the war, he said, adding that Sattan had moved to the country in 1987 following a land dispute with villagers. Saleq Khokon, a Dhaka-based writer and researcher of small ethnic communities, said about 13 years ago, when Sattan Kora was visiting his village home, Saleq had the opportunity to interview Sattan and Thopal -- two among the four Koras who had fought in the Liberation War of 1971. Confirming that Sattan had sustained injuries during the war, Saleq said he could not interview Kina due to time constraint at the time.  Asked whether he or the other Koras, who fought in Bangladesh's War of Independence, ever received any formal recognition as freedom fighters, Kina said the four Kora fighters were given some sort of documentation by the then government after independence of the country. \"We were given some papers then. But, that got washed away during the devastating flood of 1987,\" he said helplessly. Ever since he returned home from the war 49 years ago, he and the other members of his community have been struggling to stave off hunger and poverty, Kina said. \"Thopal's and my family still live from hand to mouth.\" Even though they fought for the country's independence without expecting any return, said the Kora fighter, adding that formal recognition as freedom fighters during their lifetime would offer some solace amid financial hardship and illness."

      "text": "Photographs That Reflect and Confront Cultural Icons\n1988-01-29T05:00:00.000Z\nJUDGED by its first month, 1988 promises to be an energetic, expansive and sometimes controversial year for photography. On a weekend's excursion to museums and galleries currently exhibiting photographs, one can sense a ferment that compensates for the often uninviting chill of winter streets and sidewalks.\nIf the shows now on view are any indication, the biggest issue to be faced this year hinges on how we look at photographs. Do they wear their meanings on their sleeves, or are they signs of half-hidden attitudes and biases? The sharpest delineation of this question can be found in the exhibition ''Picturing 'Greatness' '' at the Museum of Modern Art. Part of the museum's ''Contemporary Art in Context'' program, the show consists of 39 portrait photographs of artists, selected from the museum's photography collection by the artist Barbara Kruger.\nGiven Ms. Kruger's post-modernist reputation and the nature of her artworks - declarative, billboard-size photomontages that intend to upset the status quo - a collaboration between her and the museum's generally conservative department of photography would seem unlikely. But the result is a huge success. For the museum's audience, it offers a chance to see firsthand how a new generation of artists and critics is responding to photographs as cultural evidence. For the museum's photography department, it marks what one hopes is a new era of openness and experimentation.\n''Picturing 'Greatness' '' is a show about the ways in which artists of this century have presented themselves to the camera, and the ways in which photographers have chosen to depict them. Although Ms. Kruger does not bother to sort out whether photographers or their subjects are more responsible for the images that are presented, her essential point is well taken: the idea of ''the artist'' is, in pictorial terms, a virtual cliche. The ''look'' of being an artist is predetermined by cultural precedent. The art-ists on view range from Claude Monet to Jackson Pollock, and in appearance they vary from ''a kind of well-tailored gentility,'' in Ms. Kruger's words, to ''a kooky middleman between God and public.'' Many of the pictures are well known, including the show's most obvious cliche, Edward Steichen's print of Rodin posed as a mirror of his sculpture ''The Thinker.'' But others are sufficiently individual as to seem fresh, including a 1935 image of Alexander Rodchenko, thought to be a self-portrait, and Irving Penn's 1947 portrait of John Marin, imperiously leaning on a umbrella.\nBut the intent of the exhibition is not to present these images as individual works of art. This is made obvious by the installation itself, which differs radically from usual museum practice. Ms. Kruger has hung the prints in groups, stacking some like totem poles, to point out certain motifs. In one group, all the artists are holding cigarettes; in another, they are all wielding brushes. And then there is the show's wall label, which dominates the center of the gallery. It greatly resembles one of Ms. Kruger's own artworks, with bands of red paint flanking type so big it can be read from outside the gallery.\nWhat Ms. Kruger has done, in short, is to make obvious the curator's intention and intervention. She also has expanded the context of the photographs so that they are ''about'' more than just the history and esthetics of photography itself. For this we have to thank the artist and Susan Kismaric, the photography curator who invited her to put together the show.\n''Picturing 'Greatness' '' remains at the Museum of Modern Art through March 29. ''The Logic of Display'' P. S. 1 46-01 21st Street Long Island City, Queens Through March 6\nWhile less emphatic about revealing the hand of the curator than ''Picturing 'Greatness,' '' the group exhibition ''The Logic of Display'' at P. S. 1 suggests that the urge to link photography with larger cultural forces is a widespread, even international phenomenon. Consisting of work by 10 artists from four countries, the exhibition makes the point that photographic images are increasingly being used in hybrid works that resemble sculpture more than traditional photographs. But that's only part of the purpose of the show, which was organized by two P. S. 1 curators, Paul Laster and Renee Riccardo. The less obvious, more telling message is that artists are ''packaging'' their photographs in ways that refer to, and comment on, commercial precedents.\nBarbara Bloom's ''Arena,'' for example, is a glass-fronted showcase that holds photographs and a shoe. The images depict a sports stadium and a shoe store that is designed like a stadium. On another wall, a group of French artists who call themselves Information Fiction Publicite show a series of four light boxes, arrayed from floor to ceiling, that look like miniaturized bus-shelter advertising panels. But in this case, the backlit ''ads'' are merely images of clouds.\nThe most intriguing piece in the show, however, may have more to do with architecture than packaging. By an artist known as B. Wurtz, it consists of an empty amplifier case, on which is mounted a cylindrical chair leg, and two photographs. The photos seem to show us industrial factory buildings, but close examination reveals them to be close-up, worm's-eye views of the assemblage on the floor.\nAlso at P. S. 1 is a fascinating exhibition of work by the Swiss artists Peter Fischli and David Weiss and an intriguing slide installation by Richard Baim. The Fischli and Weiss show, organized by Karen Marta for the List Visual Arts Center of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, features humorous photographs of their unlikely, Rube Goldberg-style constructions and a video projection of their masterpiece to date, a film called ''Der Lauf der Dinge'' (loosely, ''How Things Work''). Using elemental means - fire and fireworks, blasts of air, gravity and a variety of corrosive liquids - the artists manage to sustain a chain reaction of ever-more-absurd materials and events for 30 minutes.\nMr. Baim's installation, called ''World/Fair,'' uses the techniques of corporate slide presentation, including computer-controlled dissolves and lighting effects, to undercut the implicit promise of progress they contain. Images of ''modern'' society - highways, factories and buildings - merge and blend in sometimes revelatory, sometimes unfathomable ways. Their slow procession, seen over a monument bearing an optimistic message about a ''brave new world,'' gives the installation a seriousness and gravity unusual in today's art world. 'No Trumpets, No Swans' Pratt Manhattan Gallery Puck Building 295 Lafayette Street Through Feb. 24\nA far more jaundiced view of contemporary art photography than the P. S. 1 shows - indeed, an oppositional one - can be found in the exhibition ''No Trumpets, No Swans,'' at the Pratt Manhattan Gallery. Organized by Philip Perkis, who teaches photography at Pratt Institute, with Eleanor Moretta, the gallery's exhibitions director, ''No Trumpets, No Swans'' aims to rehabilitate the practice of what's called ''street photography'' from what Mr. Perkis clearly feels is its currently unfashionable position in the art world.\nAlthough situated geographically on the edge of SoHo, ''No Trumpets'' is situated against it esthetically. The eight photographers in the show seem less interested in issues of representation and packaging than in reporting on fleeting facts of the visible world. In an argumentative statement available at the gallery, the critics Marvin Hoshino and Roberta Hellman say that these pictures challenge ''the common notion that straight camera work is somehow limiting, that it's come to a dead end and is not contemporary.''\nThe evidence gathered here includes Helen Levitt images dating to 1942 and Garry Winogrand pictures from the 60's together with much recent photography, including Mr. Perkis's. The pictures indeed show that the pleasures of straightforward, uninflected photography remain as strong as ever. Photographs such as Elaine Mayes's image of a boy flattened against his skateboard, and Judy Linn's Coney Island view, in which a young woman's shoulder merges magically with the horizon behind her, seem marvelous no matter what one calls them. But it remains to be seen whether the incidental beauty of images like these is enough to displace the current trend toward more elaborated, skeptical uses of photography. (After closing in Manhattan, the show will reopen at the Rubelle and Norman Schafler Gallery, Pratt Institute, 200 Willoughby Avenue, in Brooklyn, March 4 to 31.) 'Marc Riboud: Lasting Moments, 1953-1988' I.C.P.-Midtown Gallery 77 West 45th Street Through March 12\nThe ''hidden hand'' tradition of ''No Trumpets, No Swans'' is by no means limited to the eight photographers represented in that show, of course. It can also be seen at the I.C.P.-Midtown Gallery, in an endearing retrospective of the work of the French photographer Marc Riboud. Mr. Riboud's output of the last 35 years serves as a reminder of Henri Cartier-Bresson's vast influence on postwar photography. While never a slavish imitator of Cartier-Bresson's style, Mr. Riboud does share the master's reliance on intuition and devotion to lyrical moments. What distinguishes his work is its obvious sympathy with peasants, laborers, refugees and common people generally.\nCompared to Cartier-Bresson, whose work can be seen in the show ''Henri Cartier-Bresson in India,'' at the International Center of Photography (1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, through Feb. 28), Mr. Riboud seems to function on the sidelines of world events. He portrays strife in Bangladesh through the faces of grieving young widows, the Vietnam antiwar movement by juxtaposing a flower and a bayonet. Although he has called himself a poor reporter because of this, his knack for recording history from the viewpoint of those most affected by it gives his pictures their unique and often compelling personality. Robert Rauschenberg Pace/MacGill Gallery 11 East 57th Street Through March 5\nRobert Rauschenberg's new photographs, taken with a large-format Polaroid camera and displayed at the Pace/MacGill Gallery, are something else entirely from Marc Riboud's work. Rather than report on the world, they record the omnivorous vision of their maker. The photographs fall into two groups. Those in black and white, showing us bits of cars, bicycles and palm trees, are bleached and stained and sometimes grouped into grids of four. The color images are straightforward, almost documentary observations of fading signs, peeling plywood and other forms of material dereliction.\nPhotography is nothing new to Rauschenberg, who started taking pictures at Black Mountain College in 1949. The idea of claiming for art items that were bound for the junkyard is not new either - witness his show of ''Glut'' sculptures at Blum Helman Gallery (20 West 57th Street, through tomorrow). What is of interest, though, is the way these pictures make clear his penchant for decay.\nThere are, however, two problems here. One is that the pictures seem to have a touch of deja vu. The black-and-whites have the look of earlier Rauschenberg prints, perhaps mixed with a touch of the Starn Twins; the color is reminiscent of William Eggleston's work. The other is that the artist's perceptive facility is so great there seems to be no end to its expression. By using a camera - that mechanical producer of endless images - Rauschenberg doubles the odds of visual surfeit."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-03 00:00:00      \nHundreds of thousands more people in West Bengal state have also been given orders to flee At least two people died Friday as Cyclone Fani, the biggest in years, slammed into eastern India, sending coconut trees flying and cutting off power, water and telecommunications. The monster weather system made landfall at the holy city of Puri in the morning, with winds gusting at up to 200km per hour. In recent days authorities in Odisha state, where 10,000 people perished in a 1999 cyclone, evacuated more than a million people as they worried about a possible 5ft storm surge sweeping far inland. One man died of a heart attack in one of several thousand shelters set up, while another was killed by a falling tree on Friday, authorities said. Media reports put the death toll at up to six, but officials could not confirm this. Authorities in Bangladesh, where Fani was headed, said that 14 villages were inundated as flood dams broke due to a tidal surge.  Disaster management spokesman Mohammad Jahir told AFP that 400,000 people from Bangladeshi coastal villages have been taken to shelters. Hundreds of thousands more people in India's West Bengal state have also been given orders to flee. Local airports have been shut, while train lines and roads were closed. \"It just went dark and then suddenly we could barely see five metres in front of us,\" said one resident in Puri. \"There were the roadside food carts, store signs all flying by in the air,\" the man told AFP from a hotel where he took shelter. \"The wind is deafening.\" Another witness said he saw a small car being blown along a street by the winds and then turned over. After pounding Puri and Odisha state capital Bhubaneswar and heading north-eastwards, losing strength as it goes, authorities were battling to remove fallen trees from roads and to restore phone and internet services. On Saturday Fani was expected in West Bangal's capital Kolkata, a city home to 4.5 million people. \"We are monitoring the situation 24x7 and doing all it takes. Be alert, take care and stay safe for the next two days,\" West Bengal's chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted. The winds were felt as far away as Mount Everest, with tents blown away at Camp 2 at 21,000ft and Nepali authorities cautioning helicopters against flying. Meanwhile a baby was born near Bhubaneswar just as the cyclone passed through. \"We are calling her Lady Fani as she was born when the hospital was hit,\" a spokesperson for the hospital told the Press Trust of India. Cyclone Fani makes landfall in eastern India: Met Office https://t.co/XGL0Ldd19a 'Total destruction' Meteorologists have warned of the \"total destruction\" of thatched houses, the uprooting of power and communication poles, the \"flooding of escape routes\" and damage to crops in some areas. Some 3,000 shelters in schools and government buildings were set up to accommodate more than a million people in Odisha, with families including women and babies huddled on the floor. Ports have been closed but the Indian Navy has sent six warships to the region while India's biggest oil and gas producer ONGC evacuated almost 500 workers from offshore rigs. Measures were also being taken to protect the 850-year-old Jagannath temple in Puri, a Hindu holy town normally thronging with pilgrims. AFP correspondents in the resort said it was a near ghost town with trees already torn down and water levels rising even before Fani's awesome arrival. Electricity and water supplies were already cut for much of the city of 200,000 people. Metal shutters covered store fronts and sand blew up the streets from the nearby beach. Only a few police vehicles and tractors trying to pull trees or push aside collapsed walls could be seen. Media reports said hundreds of trees were uprooted at the nearby Chilika Lake just south of Puri in the first violent winds. \"We will just stay for the day until the cyclone has passed. We are not scared but we feel safer here,\" said Krishna Chandra Sahu, 43, sheltering with seven members of his family in a hotel. "

      "text": "Bangladeshi Asks for Help on Controlling Floods\n1988-10-11T05:00:00.000Z\nIn an appeal to the General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh said today that a permanent solution to the country's annual flood disasters must be reached through regional cooperation with international support.\nThe remarks of the Bangladeshi minister, Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, were seen as an implicit criticism of India, which has thus far resisted any ''internationalization'' of the issue.\nAfter last month's devastating flood, which was the worst in the country's history, the President of Bangladesh, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, reached individual agreements with India and other neighboring countries for cooperation. But he has thus far failed to win sufficient support for a regional response to the flooding.\n''What we want is a regional water authority, including the five concerned countries, to regulate and harness water resources for the benefit of all,'' Mr. Choudhury said in an interview before his address. This would mean no diversion of water, construction of dams or other such projects, without common consent, he said. Looking to Dutch and Germans\nHe said such a regional agency would need international support both in technology and financing because of the magnitude of the problem. Specifically, it would look for technological help from the Netherlands and West Germany, ''which have cooperated successfully in taming the Rhine,'' he said.\nBangladesh and India have been at odds for some time over the control of the waters of the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and other common rivers. Bangladesh accuses India of permitting rampant deforestation that has resulted in flooding, and building dams that divert badly needed water from Bangladesh in the dry season. Specifically, these officials are concerned over an Indian proposal to build a canal across Bangladesh to drain water from the Brahmaputra to the Ganges system.\nThe Bangladeshi official said his Government has tried to generate enthusiasm for regional cooperation. Ershad and Gandhi Meet\nHe noted that General Ershad and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India agreed late last month to set up a joint task force to study the flood management and water flow of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers. Subsequently, the President visited Nepal, and it was agreed to set up a joint study team on the problem. He will also visit Bhutan this week and later China to take up the same issue.\nReferring to the recent catastrophic flood, Mr. Choudhury said 1,250,000 houses were destroyed, leaving about eight million people homeless. More than 2,000 deaths have been attributed to the flooding.\nThe Foreign Minister said the country's ''highest priority needs'' are now wheat and construction materials.\nEmphasizing the need for a permanent solution to the problem, he said, ''The primary imperative will be in harnessing regional cooperation among all our concerned neighbors with a view to arriving at coherent and well-coordinated policies and plans to our mutual benefit.''"

      "text": "Key Sections of the Paris Communique by the Group of Seven\n1989-07-17T05:00:00.000Z\nFollowing are key sections of the communique issued today by the Group of Seven major industrialized democracies:\n1. We, the heads of state or government of seven major industrial nations and the president of the Commission of the European Communities, have met in Paris for the 15th annual Economic Summit. The Summit of the Arch initiates a new round of summits to succeed those begun at Rambouillet in 1975 and at Versailles in 1982. The round beginning in 1982 has seen one of the longest periods of sustained growth since the Second World War. These summits have permitted effective consultations, offered the opportunity to launch initiatives and to strengthen international cooperation.\n2. This year's world economic situation presents three main challenges:\n* The choice and the implementation of measures needed to maintain balanced and sustained growth, counter inflation, create jobs and promote social justice. These measures should also facilitate the adjustment of external imbalances, promote international trade and investment, and improve the economic situation of developing countries.\n* The development and the further integration of developing countries into the world economy. Whilst there has been substantial progress in many developing countries, particularly those implementing sound economic policies, the debt burden and the persistence of poverty, often made worse by natural disasters affecting hundreds of millions of people, are problems of deep concern which we must continue to face in a spirit of solidarity.\n* The urgent need to safeguard the environment for future generations. Scientific studies have revealed the existence of serious threats to our environment such as the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, excessive emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which could lead to future climate changes. Protecting the environment calls for a determined and concerted international response and for the early adoption, worldwide, of policies based on sustainable development. International Economic Situation\n3. Growth has been sustained by focusing policies on improving the efficiency and flexibility of our economies and by strengthening our cooperative efforts and the coordination process. In the medium term, the current buoyant investment seen during this period should pave the way for an increased supply of goods and services and help reduce the dangers of inflation. The outlook is not, however, without risks.\n4. Until now, the threat of inflation in many countries has been contained, thanks to the concerted efforts of governments and monetary authorities. But continued vigilance is required and inflation, where it has increased, will continue to receive a firm policy response. . . .\n5. While some progress has been made in reducing external imbalances, the momentum of adjustment has recently weakened markedly; there needs to be further progress in adjusting external imbalances through cooperation.\n6. In countries with fiscal and current-account deficits, including the United States of America, Canada and Italy, further reductions in budget deficits are needed. Action will be taken to bring them down. This may help reduce the savings-investment gap and external imbalances, contribute to countering inflation and encourage greater exchange rate stability in a context of decreasing interest rates.\n7. Countries with external surpluses, including Japan and Germany, should continue to pursue appropriate macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that will encourage non-inflationary growth of domestic demand and facilitate external adjustment.\n8. All our countries share the responsibility for the sound development of the world economy. Over the medium term, deficit countries have to play a key role in global adjustment through their external adjustment and increased exports; surplus countries have to contribute to sustaining global expansion through policies providing favorable conditions for growth of domestic demand and imports.\n9. The emergence of the newly industrializing economies and the initiation of a dialogue with them are welcome. We call on those with substantial surpluses to contribute to the adjustment of external imbalances and the open trade and payments system. To that end, they should permit exchange rates to reflect their competitive position, implement GATT commitments and reduce trade barriers. International Monetary Developments and Coordination\n10. Under the Plaza and Louvre agreements, our countries agreed to pursue, in a mutually reinforcing way, policies of surveillance and coordination aimed at improving their economic fundamentals and at fostering stability of exchange rates consistent with those economic fundamentals.\nThere has been progress in the multilateral surveillance and coordination of economic policies with a view to ensuring internal consistency of domestic policies and their international compatibility. . . .\n11. The coordination process has made a positive contribution to world economic development and it has also contributed greatly to improving the functioning of the International Monetary System. There has also been continued cooperation in exchange markets.\nIt is important to continue and, where appropriate, to develop this cooperative and flexible approach to improve the functioning and the stability of the International Monetary System in a manner consistent with economic fundamentals. . . .\n12. We welcome the decision to complete the work on the ninth review of the International Monetary Fund quotas with a view to a decision on this matter before the end of the years.\n13. Within the European Community, the European Monetary System has contributed to a significant degree of economic policy convergence and monetary stability. Improving Economic Efficiency\n14. We will continue to promote measures in order to remove inefficiencies in our economies. . . . Tax reforms, modernization of financial markets, strengthening of competition policies and reducing rigidities in all sectors including energy, industry and agriculture are necessary. So are the improvement of education and vocational training, transportation and distribution systems and further policies aimed at giving more flexibility and mobility to the labor market and reducing unemployment.\nWithin the European Community, the steady progress toward completion by the end of 1992 of the program contained in the Single Act has already given a strong momentum to economic efficiency.\n15. The decline of saving in some of our countries in this decade is a cause of concern. This lower level of saving can contribute to high real interest rates and therefore hamper growth. Inadequate saving and large fiscal deficits are associated with large external deficits. We recommend . . . policies to encourage saving and remove hinderances. . . .\n16. Financial activities are being increasingly carried out with new techniques on a worldwide basis. As regards insider trading, which could hamper the credibility of financial markets, regulations vary greatly among our countries. These regulations have been recently, or are in the process of being strengthened. International cooperation should be pursued and enhanced. Trade Issues\n17. World trade developed rapidly last year. Yet protectionism remains a real threat. We strongly reaffirm our determination to fight it in all its forms.\nWe agree to make effective use of the improved GATT dispute settlement mechanism and to make progress in negotiations for further improvements. We will avoid any discriminatory or autonomous actions, which undermined the principles of the GATT. . . .\nWe also are pledged to oppose the tendency toward unilateralism, bilateralism, sectoralism and managed trade which threatens to undermine the multilateral system and Uruguay Round negotiations.\n18. The successful negotiation of the Trade Negotiations Committee of the Uruguay Round in Geneva last April, thereby completing the midterm review, is a very important achievement. It gives a clear framework for future work in all sectors including the pursuit of agricultural reform in the short term as well as in the long term. . . .\nWe express our full commitment to making further substantive progress in the Uruguay Round in order to complete it by the end of 1990.\n19. We note with satisfaction the entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement betwen Canada and the United States, as well as more recent initiatives to intensify the close economic relations between the European Community and E.F.T.A. countries. . . .\n20. It is the firm intention of the European Community that the trade aspects of the single market program should also be trade-creating and complementary to the multilateral liberalization process. 21. We note with satisfaction the progress that has been made in strengthening the multilateral disciplines on trade and aid distorting export credit subsidies. This effort must be pursued actively and completed in the competent bodies of the O.E.C.D. . . . at the earliest possible date. General Problems Of Development\n22. Development is a shared global challenge. We shall help developing countries by opening the world trading system and by supporting their structural adjustment. We shall encourage too, economic diversification in commodity-dependent countries and the creation of a favorable environment for transfers of technology and capital flows.\nWe underline the continuing importance of official development assistance and welcome the increased efforts of summit participants in this respect. . . .\n23. We urge developing countries to implement sound economic policies. A vital factor will be the adoption of financial and fiscal policies which attract inward investment and encourage growth and the return of flight capital.\n24. We note with satisfaction that there has been substantial progress in the multilateral aid initiative for the Philippines that was given special attention in the Toronto economic declaration. 25. Faced with the worrying economic situation of Yugoslavia, we encourage its Government to implement a strong economic reforms program that can command bilateral and multilateral support. The Situation In the Poorest Countries\n26. The enhancement of the International Monetary Fund Structural Adjustment Facility, the World Bank special program of assistance for the poorest and most indebted countries and the fifth replenishment of the African Development Fund are all important measures. . . . We stress the importance attached to a substantial replenishment of Intenational Development Association resources.\n27. As we urged last year in Toronto, the Paris Club reached a consensus in September 1988 on the conditions of implementation of significant reduction of debt-service payments for the poorest countries. Thirteen countries have already benefited by this decision.\n28. We welcome the increasing grant element in the development assistance as well as the steps taken to convert loans into grants and we urge further steps. . . . Flexibility in development aid as much as in debt rescheduling is required. 29. We attach great importance to the efficient and successful preparation of the next general conference of the United Nations on the least developed countries, which will take place in Paris in 1990. Strengthened Debt Strategy for the Heavily Indebted Countries\n30. Our approach to the debt problems has produced signficant results, but serious challenges remain: In many countries the ratio of debt service to exports remains high, financing for growth promoting investment is scarce, and capital flight is a key problem. An improvement in the investment climate must be a critical part of efforts to achieve a sustainable level of growth without excessive levels of debt. These improvements . . . depend above all on sustained and effective adjustment policies in the debtor countries.\n31. To address these challenges, we are strongly committed to the strengthened debt strategy. This will rely, on a case-by-case basis, on the following actions:\n* Borrowing countries should implement, with the assistance of the Fund and the Bank, sound economic policies, particularly designed to mobilize savings, stimulate investment and reverse capital flight;\n* Banks should increasingly focus on voluntary, market-based debt and debt-service reduction operations, as a complement to new lending;\n* The International Monetary Fund and World Bank will support significant debt reduction by setting aside a portion of policy-based loans;\n* Limited interest support will be provided, through additional financing by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, for transactions involving significant debt and debt service reduction. For that purpose the use of escrow accounts is agreed;\n* Continued Paris Club rescheduling and flexibility of export-credit agencies;\n* Strengthening of the international financial institutions capability for supporting medium-term macroeconomic and structural adjustment programs and for compensating the negative effects of export shortfalls and external shocks.\n32. In the framework of this strategy:\n* We welcome the recent decisions taken by the two institutions to encourage debt and debt service reduction which provide adequate resources for these purposes;\n* We urge debtor countries to move ahead promptly to develop strong economic reform programs that may lead to debt and debt service reductions in accordance with the guidelines defined by the two Bretton Woods institutions;\n* We urge banks to take realistic and constructive approaches in their negotiations with the debtor countries and to move promptly to conclude agreements on financial packages including debt reduction, debt service reduction and new money. We stress that official creditors should not substitute for private lenders. . . . Environment\n33. There is growing awareness throughout the world of the necessity to preserve better the global ecological balance. This includes serious threats to the atmosphere, which could lead to future climate changes. We note with great concern the growing pollution of air, lakes, rivers, oceans and seas; acid rain; dangerous substances; and the rapid desertification and deforestation. . . .\nDecisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect the Earth's ecological balance. We will work together to achieve the common goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environment in order to meet shared economic and social objectives. . . .\n34. We urge all countries to give further impetus to scientific research on environmental issues, to develop necessary technologies and to make clear evaluations of the economic costs and benefits . . .\nIn this connection, we ask all countries to combine their efforts in order to improve observation and monitoring on a global scale.\n35. We believe that international cooperation also needs to be enhanced in the field of technology and technology transfer in order to reduce pollution. . . .\n36. We believe that industry has a crucial role in preventing pollution at source, in waste minimization, in energy conservation, and in the design and marketing of cost-effective clean technologies. The agricultural sector must also contribute to tackling problems such as water pollution, soil erosion and desertification.\n37. Environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade, development, energy, transport, agriculture and economic planning. Therefore, environmental considerations must be taken into account into economic decision-making. . . .\nIn order to achieve sustainable development, we shall ensure the compatibility of economic growth and development with the protection of the environment. Environmental protection and related investment should contribute to economic growth. . . .\nClear assessments of the costs, benefits and resource implications of environmental protection should help Governments take the necessary decisions on the mix of price signals (e.g. taxes or expenditures) and regulatory actions, reflecting where possible the full value of natural resources.\nWe encourage the World Bank and regional development banks to integrate environmental considerations into their activities. . . .\n38. To help developing countries deal with past damage and to encourage them to take environmentally desirable action, economic incentives may include the use of aid mechanisms and specific transfer of technology. . . .\nWe also emphasize the necessity to take into account the interests and needs of developing countries in sustaining the growth of their economies and the financial and technological requirements to meet environmental challenges.\n39. The depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is alarming and calls for prompt action.\nWe welcome the Helsinki conclusions related, among other issues, to the complete abandonment of the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons covered by the Montreal protocol as soon as possible and not later than the end of the century. . . . We shall promote the development and use of suitable substitute substances and technologies. . . .\n40. We strongly advocate common efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which threaten to induce climate change, endangering the environment and the economy. . . .\n41. We agree that increasing energy efficiency could make a substantial contribution to these goals. We urge international organizations concerned to encourage measures, including economic measures, to improve energy conservation and, more broadly, efficiency in the use of energy. . . .\nWe are committed to maintaining the highest safety standards for nuclear power plants and to strengthening international cooperation in safe operation of power plants and waste management, and we recognize that nuclear power also plays an important role in limiting output of greenhouse gases.\n42. Deforestation also damages the atmosphere and must be reversed. We call for the adoption of sustainable forest management practices, with a view to preserving the scale of world forests. . . .\n43. Preserving the tropical forests is an urgent need for the world as a whole. While recognizing the sovereign rights of developing countries to make use of their natural resources, we encourage, through a sustainable use of tropical forests, the protection of all the species therein and the traditional rights to land and other resources of local communities. We welcome the German initiative in this field as a basis for progress.\nTo this end, we give strong support to rapid implementation of the Tropical Forest Action Plan which was adopted in 1986 in the framework of the Food and Agricultural Organization. . . .\n45. The increasing complexity of the issues related to the protection of the atmosphere calls for innovative solutions. New instruments may be contemplated. We believe that the conclusion of a framework or umbrella convention on climate change to set out general principles or guidelines is urgently required. . . .\nWe welcome the work under way by the United Nations Environment Program, in cooperation with the World Meteorological Organization, drawing on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the results of other international meetings. . . .\n46. We condemn indiscriminate use of oceans as dumping grounds for polluting waste. . . .\n47. We are committed to insuring full implementation of existing rules for the environment. In this respect, we note with interest the initiative of the Italian Government to host in 1990 a forum on international law for the environment. . . .\n48. We advocate that existing environment institutions be strengthened within the United Nations system. In particular, the United Nations Environment Program urgently requires strengthening and increased financial support. . . .\n50. It is a matter of international concern that Bangladesh, one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world, is periodically devastated by catastrophic floods.\nWe stress the urgent need for effective, coordinated action by the international community, in support of the government of Bangladesh, in order to find solutions to this major problem which are technically, financially, economically and environmentally sound. In that spirit, and taking account of help already given, we take note of the different studies concerning flood alleviation, initiated by France, Japan, the U.S. and the United Nations Development Program, which have been reviewed by experts from all our countries. We welcome the World Bank's agreement, following those studies, to coordinate the efforts of the international community so that a sound basis for achieving a real improvement in alleviating the effects of flood can be established. . . .\n51. We give political support to projects such as the joint project to set up an observatory of the Saharan areas, which answers the need to monitor the development of that rapidly deteriorating, fragile, arid region. Drug Issues\n52. The drug problem has reached devastating proportions. We stress the urgent need for decisive action, both on a national and international basis. We urge all countries, especially those where drug production, trading and consumption are large, to join our efforts to counter drug production, to reduce demand, and to carry forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and the laundering of its proceeds.\n53. Accordingly, we resolve to take the following measures within relevant fora:\n* Give greater emphasis on bilateral and United Nations programs for the conversion of illicit cultivation in the producer countries. The United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC), and other United Nations and multilateral organizations should be supported, strengthened and made more effective. These efforts could include particular support for the implementation of effective programs to stop drug cultivation and trading as well as developmental and technical assistance.\n* Support the efforts of producing countries who ask for assistance to counter illegal production or trafficking.\n* Strengthen the role of the United Nations through an increase in its resources and through reinforced effectiveness of its operation.\n* Intensify the exchange of information on the prevention of addiction, and rehabilitation of drug addicts.\n* Support the international conference planned for l990 on cocaine and drug demand reduction.\n* Strengthen the efficiency of the cooperative and mutual assistance on these issues, the first steps being a prompt adhesion to, ratification and implementation of the Vienna Convention on illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.\n* Conclude further bilateral or multilateral agreements and support initiatives and cooperation, where appropriate, which include measures to facilitate the identification, tracing, freezing, seizure and forfeiture of drug crime proceeds.\n* Convene a financial action task force from summit participants and other countries interested in these problems. Its mandate is to assess the results of cooperation already undertaken in order to prevent the utilization of the banking system and financial institutions for the purpose of money laundering, and to consider additional preventive efforts in this field. The first meeting will be called by France and its report will be completed by April 1990. International Cooperation Against AIDS\n54. We take note of the creation of an International Ethics Committee on AIDS which met in Paris in May 1989, as decided at the Summit of Venice (June 1987). It assembled the summit participants and the other members of the European Community, together with the World Health Organization.\n55. We take note of the representations that we received from various heads of state or government and organizations and we will study them with interest. Next Economic Summit\n56. We have accepted the invitation of the president of the United States to meet next year in the United States of America."

      "text": "Plane for Bhutan Opens Many Lost Horizons\n1988-11-27T05:00:00.000Z\nThe tiny and remote landlocked Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan took a major new step toward improving its communications with the outside world recently when it bought its first passenger jet.\nA top Bhutanese official said last week that the new plane, a British Aerospace 146 jetliner with 82 seats, will increase the strength of Druk Airways, the kingdom's carrier, to a total of three. The others are small turbo-prop Dorniers bought from West Germany that hold 18 people each and are used between Calcutta and Bhutan. ''This aircraft will play a positive role in the further development of Bhutan,'' said the official, Chi Dorji, Secretary of the Planning Commission. Mr. Dorji said the plane will be used not only to promote tourism but also to ferry cargo from India to Bhutan.\nMost Western visitors to Bhutan travel by air and must stop or make a connection in India or Bangladesh.\nThe current ruler of Bhutan, governed for much of this century by the Wangchuk family, is King Jigme Singye Wangchuk, who sent his Foreign Minister to India a few weeks ago to announce the solemnization of his marriage to four sisters and the declaration of his successor, an 8-year-old boy born to one of the sisters.\nKing Jigme, 32 years old, revered throughout his nation of 1.3 million that has an annual per capital income of $150. One of the poorest countries in the world, Bhutan is cautiously trying to blend its cultural traditions and economic development at its own pace.\nMr. Dorji said the Aid Bhutan Consortium that meets in the French capital every three years had substantially increased its contribution. Explaining that in previous years Bhutan had been getting $45 million a year from the consortium, he said, ''We have been pledged $63 million a year.'' This figure does not include India's aid, which is several times higher.\nHe said that he had to sharply counter demands by those who suggested that Bhutan modernize its economy.\nMr. Dorji said the new plane would would be used to transport people and goods between New Delhi, Bhutan and Calcutta. ''Later we can explore some more areas, maybe Katmandu in Nepal, maybe other places,'' he said.\nHe stressed that Bhutan was not going to open its borders to a flood of tourists. For years, the kingdom has kept mass tourism at bay because it does not want to be swamped by Western influence and because the powerful Buddhist clergy believes that largescale tourism will hurt national character and the morality of the young.\nFor decades, India has played a powerful role in developing Bhutan and keeping other nations out. It bankrolls most of the country's economic plans, has built all-weather roads across tough mountain terrain, trains Bhutanese soldiers and keeps an eye on Chinese troops across the border, has set up a major hydro-electric project that supplies power to the kingdom and is sold to power-hungry Indian states. Under the terms of a 30-year accord, New Delhi also consults regularly with Bhutanese leaders on foreign policy.\nSignificantly too, the Indian Embassy was for many years the only diplomatic mission in Bhutan. It is still the largest although Bangladesh and the United Nations Development Program also have presences there now. Most other foreign embassies operate out of New Delhi and cover Bhutan in occasional visits."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-02 00:00:00      \nDengue, the notorious mosquito-borne menace in the country, is back and so is the familiar paranoia that accompanies its advent every monsoon. Splashed across the front pages of newspapers and the headlines of news channels are the alarming numbers of new cases of dengue every day. People are grappling with anxiety and confusion over the news that dengue is manifesting itself in a different form this time; patients are presenting with atypical features and their conditions rapidly deteriorating in the absence of timely medical intervention. \"The epidemiology of dengue is complex and it still remains poorly understood. It entails the host (humans), vector (Aedes mosquito) and viral (Dengue virus) status; these factors are further influenced by demographic, behavioral and societal determinants,\" explains Professor Dr Quazi Tarikul Islam, during his speech at the seminar \"Dengue: changing trends and management update\", organised by the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and the Bangladesh Society of Medicine. \"Aedes mosquito is very adaptive.  It has evolved in terms of both longevity and survival due to climate change and different socio-cultural and economic factors of human habitation,\" adds Dr Islam, who is also editor-in-chief of the national guideline on dengue. He refers to the shift in the affected age group earlier, dengue fever used to be uncommon in adults, whereas older age groups being affected have been reported not only in Bangladesh, but also in Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia. Another shift is that the largely urban-centric disease has now spread to rural areas too. \"Moreover, changes in the dengue virus are altering its ability to cause infections. In sequential or secondary infections, the manifestations become severe,\" says Dr Islam. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), warmer temperatures due to global warming accelerate the development of mosquitoes and reduce the time it takes for them to become infectious. In addition, increased rainfall leads to more ideal breeding sites and high humidity enhances their chances of survival. The worsening flood situation this year, coupled with the unusually high temperatures, could have triggered such alterations. Concerns over the re-emergence of a new serotype have also been voiced by experts. There are four distinct serotypes of dengue. The national guideline on dengue, published by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), documents that following its first outbreak in Bangladesh back in mid-2000, the prevalent serotypes of dengue were the first three; among them, serotype-3 was only predominant till 2002. A study published in the journal New Microbes and New Infections states that the re-emergence of serotype-3 in 2017 may have been responsible for the massive dengue outbreak in Bangladesh last year. Previously, no cases of serotype-3 or serotype-4 had been seen in Bangladesh after 2002--the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control & Research (IEDCR) found only serotype-1 and serotype-2 in patients' serum samples between 2013 and 2016. In a report in The Daily Star last month, Dr HM Nazmul Ahsan, associate professor at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, said that the number of serotype-3 cases were higher than the others last year and that would most likely prove the same this year. In a subsequent report, Kinkar Ghosh, an epidemiologist at Dhaka Shishu Hospital, also stated to The Daily Star that the pattern of dengue was different this year. Patients presented with new as well as faster-acting symptoms indicating that the serotype of the virus had changed but why, he stated, is as of yet uncertain. When a person is infected with one serotype, his/her immune system confers him life-long protection from re-infection from the same serotype. But he/she still remains vulnerable to infection from the other serotypes after a transient protective state lasting for a few months. That is when the complications ensue. Secondary infection with a different serotype is the most significant risk factor leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome--severe forms of dengue, where mortality rates can be as high as 20 percent. However, it is to be noted that Bangladesh's dengue mortality rate is still significantly lower than that of other endemic zones of dengue such as Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Hence, the re-emergence of serotype-3 in Bangladesh where serotype-1 and serotype-2 were prevalent for over a decade increases the chances of cross-infections and consequently, the severity of dengue. Which is why it is important to immediately screen anyone with a fever during this time, for dengue. \"Plasma leakage [the fluid portion of our blood, plasma, leaking from the blood vessels] or impaired ability of our body to regulate bleeding may proceed to multi-organ failure. When three or more organs fail, there is an 80 percent risk that it will culminate in death. That's what concerns us,\" states Dr Md. Robed Amin, associate professor of medicine at DMCH and an editor of national guideline at the seminar. Droves of patients have been getting admitted to hospitals and medical care is stretched thin. \"The workload is overwhelming as we constantly juggle between evaluating new patients and monitoring the admitted ones. But we're always here for them,\" says a duty doctor at DMCH, busy examining dengue patients. \"Early diagnosis and appropriate quality care can bring down the mortality rate to below one percent,\" states Dr Sanya Tahmina, line director of communicable disease control at the DGHS. \"Our case fatality rate (CFR), calculated by dividing total deaths by total identified cases, is quite below one percent. The numbers (as of July 25) show eight deaths out of 9,256 cases, yielding a CFR of only 0.09 percent. Even if you consider the death rate to be 28 as per some unsupported sources, CFR is still 0.3 percent--still below one percent.\" \"We have an efficacious national guideline on the management of dengue. We regularly train our physicians to enhance their skills. This year, from January to June, we've trained around 2,000 clinicians both in government and public sectors including the consultants of Intensive Care Units about the clinical management of dengue,\" states Dr Tahmina. Considering diagnostic efficacy and quality care as the metrics, we are performing quite well. Our doctors are putting in their best efforts to rein in the epidemic, but is the government doing the same?   Kazi Md. Shaimul Reza is a medical student at Dhaka Medical College."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-17 00:00:00      \nConstruction and renovation work of an important road in Basail upazila could not be completed even after eight months of its stipulated deadline due to alleged negligence of the contractor concerned. Due to the delay, thousands of inhabitants of several villages in Basail and adjacent two upazilas -- Sakhipur and Mirzapur -- are suffering immensely for long. According to the data provided by Local Government and Engineering Department (LGED) in Basail, the six-kilometre-long road stretching from Kanchanpur to Dhangpara via Pathatghata has remained unusable for locals and unfit for vehicular movement. In a bid to ease the public sufferings, LGED floated a tender for construction and renovation work of the road at a costs of 5.59 crores. Contractor firm Bishal Enterprise got the work order and started the work on April 30, 2018.   Mentionable, although the works were supposed to be completed by May 6, 2019, it still remain incomplete even after eight months of its actual deadline. During a recent visit to the area this correspond saw construction materials lying scattered beside the under construction road in Dhangpara, Jotuki, Poulee, Haluapara and Sankapara area while construction materials did not even reached in many areas. Saiful Islam of Kanchanpur village said they have been facing lots of trouble due to the shabby condition of the road and huge amount of dust in the air. \"We did not saw the contractor concerned at the construction site yet,\" he alleged. Accidents often occur while travelling on the damaged road, Mohammad Ali of the area said. \"As the road is not suitable for vehicular movements local traders suffer immensely while carrying their goods,\" trader Shafiqul Islam said.  \"We have to move on foot as transports are not available due to the bad condition of the road,\" housewife Protima Rani said.  Basail Upazila Parishad Chairman Kazi Alid Islam said the road repair work was in full swing till the beginning of the rainy season, but suddenly it stopped. \"I hope the work will complete in a short time and local people will be benefited from it,\" he added. Basail LGED Upazila Engineer Rozdid Ahmed said about 45 percent of the total work has already been completed and they have served notice to the contractor concerned for completing the work by June this year. Mohammad Hossain, owner of Bishal Enterprise, said they could not continue the work as they were unable to carry the construction materials at many sites due to the recent flood.     \"We hope to complete the work within the next couple of months,\" he added."

Welfare agencies fear that the lowering tide from the devastating floods will leave epidemic diseases in the slate-gray mud.\nBut today, shops were open in the city center, which escaped the flooding. The international airport, an island of sorts on a waterlogged plain, began to function again after the annual monsoon rains left much of the nation under water and millions homeless.\nOfficials said today that the death toll from the floods had risen to more than 800. They said at least 150 people had died in less than 24 hours, most of those from diarrhea and dysentery caused by impure water and rotten food. The central Government's announced death toll is slightly more than half that, but is widely considered far too low. Unofficial tabulations in Dhaka newspapers run to more than 1,200, and communications with many outlying areas are still out.\nBicycle rickshaw pullers were doing a brisk business along roads where drivers feared to take their cars, areas that are still under water. Spirit of the Marketplace\nSubmerged streets were full of indefatigable entrepreneurs - fellows who will push your car for anything you can spare, children standing in water for a pittance to show a driver how deep it is, a pushcart vendor-turned-boatman who grinned with embarrassment each time he beached his leaky vessel on a curb or an unseen bush.\nBoats themselves are a new business. Tiny skiffs that once cost less than $20 are being hustled in the wetter neighborhoods for as much as $50, a huge amount of money for the very poor.\nSome families have no choice but to buy one anyway. A boat takes marooned people to the markets for food. It allows them to live at home - albeit often on their traditional flat rooftops, from which they can keep looters away. A boat also saves slogging barefoot through waters polluted with sewage and infested with snakes.\nThe better-off residents of Dhaka concede that, this time, it is to some extent a ''middle-class flood.'' The people of Bangladesh, most rural and poor, are used to the annual inundation of their land and homes. Indians Are Blamed\nThe flooding is worse this year because south Asia in general, and India in particular, have had a record monsoon rain. Hundreds of people have also died in eastern India.\nA commonly heard explanation here is that ''the water comes from India.''\nEvery year there is concern about India's deforested hills and mountains and its uncompleted flood-control programs, which allow flood waters to tumble through Bangladesh on their way to the sea. This year, the complaint is heard more often because the water has washed into the capital.\nDhaka is a city that can empty its streets quickly in a crisis. Political tension seems to be a recurrent part of life here, since the days when Bangladesh was the eastern region of Pakistan.\nToday, however, there was no such anxiety but , if anything, a sense of making the best of a terrible situation.\n''Pani, pani,'' a man said with a rueful smile, shaking his head and using the Bengali word for water, as he hoisted a parcel wrapped in a bandanna into the air. Then he plunged in up to his neck on the way home from shopping.\nBangladeshis, the majority of whom are Moslems, have been augmenting official relief efforts with their own makeshift projects.\nTonight, as dusk fell on a sodden community in south Dhaka, a group of energetic young men arrived with two barrels of clean, fresh drinking water, which they began to distribute in a school and along a muddy highway median.\nOne of them, Nakim Mahmud Narullah, a law student at Dhaka University, said he and his three colleagues were volunteers for the Islamic Dawa Complex, a charitable organization. Islam ranks welfare high among the obligations of its adherents.\nAsked why he and his friends were standing there in their immaculate clothes, giving drinks and water-purification tablets to the children of beggars, he replied:\n''We are Moslems. It is our duty.''"

The new economic zone is expected to create employment opportunities for 1.5 million people within the next 15 years and ensure export earnings of $15 billion, a top official at the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) said. Mirsarai Economic Zone, styled as Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Shilpa Nagar, is being developed on a contiguous 30,000 acres of land stretching to Feni's Sonagazi upazila. These zones have special economic regulations that differ from the rest of Bangladesh. An entrepreneur can enjoy various facilities from authorities for setting up an industrial unit within it.  Paban Chowdhury, Executive Chairman of BEZA told the Dhaka Tribune the development work was going on in full swing at Mirsarai Economic Zone.  \"Currently development work to the tune of Tk 4,000  crore is going on in the largest economic zone of the country. Till now, we have received investment proposal of $ 12 billion dollar from different enterprises of home and abroad for the economic zone,\" added Paban.   When visiting the zone recently, the correspondent found the under-construction industrial enclave abuzz with activity. According to officials of the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA), 16,000 acres of land have already been acquired for the zone, while the acquisition of an additional 7,000 acres of land is underway. Mirsarai Economic Zone, the largest industrial enclave and also Bangladesh's first multi-sector economic zone, will be developed in some 30 phases. Currently, the development work of the site is in progress on 1,950 acres of land, which is the first phase of the economic zone. The first phase started in 2016, and will be completed by 2021. Utility Services Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) is now constructing a coastal embankment (super dyke) and a slope protection embankment to protect the project area from flood, saline intrusion, erosion caused by tidal surge and natural disasters. In addition, the BWDB is constructing eight sluice gates on the rivers and canals passing through the economic zone to Sandwip Channel in the Bay of Bengal. The Roads and Highways Department (RHD) is constructing an 18km-long motorable pavement and a 10km access road to the project area. The Rural Electrification Board (REB) has already installed a power distribution line and a substation. The Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) is now sinking deep tube-wells and a water reservoir.  The Karnaphuli Gas Distribution Company Ltd (KGDCL) is working to upgrade an existing gas distribution network from 350 mmcfd to 500 mmcfd to facilitate adequate gas supply to bulk and industrial customers. On December 4, BEZA has signed a Land Lease Agreement with the Rural Power Company Ltd (RPCL) to establish a power plant with 1800 megawatt power generation capacity to ensure uninterrupted power supply. Local, foreign enterprises eager to invest Many local and foreign companies have already shown interest to invest in the economic zone. Well Group will establish a Composite Textile Mill in the economic zone at a cost of $72.412 million. This project will create employment opportunities for 2,834 people and annual export of $59.283 million. Ananta Group will also set up six new factories in the zone for producing fabrics and yarn. Ananta Group, one of the leading apparel exporters, has been allotted 250 acres land for 50 years. The company will invest Tk3,500 crore and is expected to generate employment for 25,000 people. Kunming Iron & Steel Holding Company Limited, a state-owned Chinese company, is going to invest the amount of $2.13 billion in Bangladesh for establishing the Iron and Steel Industries Park. BEZA has allotted 500 acres of land to Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) for setting up a readymade garment factory park in the economic zone. BGMEA sought the land from BEZA for relocating the factories randomly established at different places in Dhaka.  BGMEA will invest $2 billion for setting up RMG and garment accessories factories at this park to generate employment for 500,000 people. Bangladesh's leading industrial conglomerate Bashundhara Group is also going to set up an industrial park over an area of 500 acres of land in the zone. The group will invest $500 million for setting up an ultra-modern pulp, paper and board mill, where 10,000 people are expected to work. Additionally, BEZA has allotted 1,141 acres of land to the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA) in Mirsarai Economic Zone. BSRM Steel Re-Rolling Mills Ltd has been allotted 165 acres of land in the economic zone. Besides, Asian Paints was allotted 20 acres, Berger Paints 30 acres and Arman Haque Denims Ltd was allotted 10 acres of land.  Ferdous Wahid, assistant engineer (civil) of the Bangladesh Economic Zones Development Project (Phase 1), told the Dhaka Tribune that they have already achieved 50% progress in site development under the first phase. \"Construction is going on at full throttle, and we are hopeful of completing the project within the stipulated time,\" the official said. He said: \"We expect the economic zone to start its complete operation by 2030.\"  Mahbubul Alam, president of the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI), said Bangladesh's economy would get a boost after the completion of the zone. He said: \"A suitable site has been chosen for establishing the zone. The prime goal of setting up an economic zone is to create employment opportunities by accelerating industrial development.\" \"I think the economic zone will definitely attract the investors from home and abroad. With the completion of the economic zone, Chittagong will turn out to be a leading regional business hub, and we will be able to explore the full potential of our demographic dividend. Besides, it will present us with huge employment opportunities,\" the CCCI President said. BEZA has been working to set up 100 economic zones in all potential regions--including backward and underdeveloped regions--by 2030, and to create 10 million new jobs and fetch additional annual exports of $40 billion, BEZA officials said. It has already identified 74 locations across Bangladesh for the setting up of economic zones. On February 28, 2016, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina laid the foundation stones of 10 economic zones, including Mirsarai Economic Zone in Chittagong."

      "text": "U.S. Agency Urges More Aid for Bangladesh Now\n1988-09-22T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Agency for International Development has urged President Reagan to send additional relief assistance immediately to Bangladesh, where floods that affected three-fourths of the country have claimed at least 1,000 lives, according to a report by the agency.\nThe report, which was requested by the President and presented this week to White House officials by Jay F. Morris, the A.I.D. deputy administrator, concludes that the United States should immediately provide an additional $20 million in 80,000 tons of food aid, between $1 million and $2 million in urgently needed medical supplies, oral rehydration salts and water purification tablets as well as other disaster and surveillance assistance.\nThe report also recommends that the aid agency develop a plan with other countries to rehabilitate Bangladesh and address the long-term causes of flooding in the region.\n''It is a disaster of historic proportions, mind-numbing,'' said Mr. Morris, who returned last week from a six-day tour of the flood-ravaged country. ''I don't really know how to describe it except to say that it's certainly the largest flood I could ever imagine.'' During his visit, Mr. Morris met with officials, relief workers and flood victims and delivered a letter from President Reagan to President H. M. Ershad expressing concern and a promise ''to do what we can to help.''\nAs part of its relief effort, the United States has already speeded up the availability of about $150 million in aid to Bangladesh, including food aid, disaster relief supplies and local currency earnings.\nThe report stressed that the full effect of the flood and the ultimate needs of the people of Bangladesh will become known only over the next few months. It predicted the possibility of ''significant loss of life and degradation of human welfare over the next three to six months.''\nOfficials in Bangladesh say millions of people in the capital, Dhaka, have been exposed to disease by drinking contaminated water. #25 Million Homeless The flood has so far claimed 1,000 lives, according to official figures, but unofficial estimates put the dead at 2,000 or more. The Bangladeshi Government says that a fourth of the deaths were caused by diarrhea, and that the others were caused by drowning, building collapses and snake bites.\nAccording to the A.I.D. report, 25 million people lost their homes in the flood, which inundated five million acres of rice land and damaged 43,000 miles of roads."

The river has already devoured at least 28 dwellings, in areas under the union, in the last two days. According to villagers, the disaster occurred due to continuous sand lifting by unscrupulous traders.  The authorities dumped geo-bags but failed to prevent the erosion that left at least 28 families homeless. Although law prohibits sand lifting within a six-kilometre radius of a bridge, a syndicate of influential traders, having political connections, continued lifting sand near the bridge with powerful dredgers, the villagers said. Over 20,000 people in the union are under the threat of erosion, and are passing their days in panic. When Gorilabari village was visited yesterday, the villagers expressed grave concerns. \"Our tin-shed building, toilet, and tube-well were devoured by the river,\" said Fatema Begum adding that they are now living in somebody else's house. Not only Fatema but also Akbar Ali Akanda, Chand Miah Haji, Abdul Ali Mondol, Abdus Salam, Janab Ali Talukder, Abul Hossain, Korban Ali, Akbar Shikder, Ashraf Ali, Solaiman, Shafiq Uddin, Jahurul Islam, and Khaled Mondol of Gorilabari, and Beltia villages have lost their dwellings due to erosion. They have taken shelter in open spaces, and relatives' houses. \"Many people of the village have lost their houses in the erosion. I have lost my house,\" said Akbar Ali Akanda of the village. During the last rainy season, erosion by the river devoured at least 50 houses, and a 200-metre embankment in the village within a few days. This year, erosion started in Gorilabari village on May 30, and it devoured over a dozen dwellings so far, said Rashida Begum, an erosion victim of the village. Tangail-4 (Kalihati upazila) constituency MP  Hasan Imam Khan Sohel said work  for a permanent embankment in the area, to save the people from erosion, will start in December. \"Each erosion victim will get Tk, 6000, and two bundles of corrugated tins,\" he also said."

Local people also participated in the programme jointly organised by Abalambon, a voluntary organisation, and Human Rights Programme of UNDP at Mahmudbagh Islamia High School ground around 4:00pm today, our local correspondent reports.   The programme included discussion meeting, oath taking, debate competition and cultural events. The programme would enable students to learn how to behave with children, women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities with fairness, speakers said. Education is not only for becoming doctors and engineers, but the students should also learn humanity from education, they said. The speakers also urged all the students to be loyal to the country's constitution and human rights and not to get involved in terrorism, militancy, drug addiction and corruption. They also called upon all to play a vital role in building the country in the spirit of the great Liberation War. The students also pledged to behave respectfully with the elderly and with the people of other communities, and agreed to be fair to all irrespective of religion and caste. The two-day event started yesterday when contestants from each school participated in debates and other events. On the concluding day, artists of ethnic and Bangalee communities performed in cultural events today. The programme was presided over by Shafique Mahmud Golap, president of the managing committee of the school. Philimon Baske, president of Shahebgan-Bagda Farm Bhumi Uddher Sangram Committee; Sadequl Islam, agriculturist; Anjali Rani Devi, human rights activist; Rumilla Hembrom, debate coordinator; Abdus Samad, principal of the school; and British Soren, adivasi jubo leader, spoke during the event among others."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-29 00:00:00      \n The underprivileged people of Borangile village in Sirajganj's Chauhali upazila can sleep a little better at night, knowing that if they are ever unable to find work as day labourers the next day, they can easily borrow some rice from the community food bank. Such little comfort is all thanks to the smart thinking of Kohinoor Begum, who along with some 40 other villagers, set up the food bank for times of need. The initiative is now a source of inspiration for neighbouring villages. Situated around a hundred kilometres from Sirajganj town, the people of Borangile often fall out of the purview of receiving government amenities or relief, even though they are among those critically affected by flood. The village lies on char lands of the Jamuna basin, where people are mostly dependent on finding work as day labourers to survive. They are able to grow some crops when the water in the river recedes and the char lands are exposed. Kohinoor, a housewife, and the others set up the food bank last year to meet food demands during times like off-crop periods. She is chairman of the reserve. When this correspondent visited the village on August 9, he attended one of the meetings of the reserve at the chairman's house along with the other members. \"Early in 2018, a few women of our underprivileged community and I walked back barefoot for a couple of hours after we went to collect relief materials from the local government. However, we were let down as relatives of the local member-chairman got the relief items instead of us,\" said Kohinoor, reminiscing the time when the reserve came into being. \"I then called a meeting at home to take matters in my hand and shared my decision to form a food bank.\" The community is poor and destitute, but there are some who are needier than the others, she added. \"We should do something for them. During hard times, any member can take rice from our bank.\" On avoiding total dependence on government support, she said, \"We are also trying to gather financial support from other villagers as donations.\" Members of this food bank started setting aside whatever little they could manage in 2018. They now have 45 members and their savings crossed Tk 30,000. \"A few days ago, our family fell into a crisis. I borrowed eight kilograms of rice from the food bank and overcame the crisis,\" said Aduri Khatun, also a member of the bank. The bank does not charge any interest for such services, said Shumi Khatun, 28, one of the beneficiaries of the bank. Another villager, Rajib Siddique, 27, who recently completed his graduation, said, \"Kohinoor Khala [aunt] is an inspiration for all of us. Her lone initiative has saved us from extreme hunger.\" \"The food bank is a laudable example. They can now solve some of their problems from their own resources,\" said Romjan Ali, chairman of Ghorjan union of the district. \"At least 3,000 families were gravely flood affected in our union and the government budget hardly covered all the victims. In this situation, this type of a food bank is really beneficial,\" he added.  "

The initial estimate of those hit in Zimbabwe was 15,000 but World Food Programme (WFP) spokesman Herve Verhoosel told reporters in Geneva that the numbers had surged following an overnight assessment. Read more: Death toll exceeds 300; scores missing The situation in Zimbabwe's eastern district of Chimanimani on the Mozambique border \"is very bad,\" Verhoosel said. \"Some 90 percent of the district has been significantly damaged,\" he added. Zimbabwe's state broadcaster ZBC has also raised the death toll to 139, up from 100 on Wednesday. Five days after tropical cyclone Idai cut a swathe through Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi, the full extent of the devastation is not yet clear. In hardest-hit Mozambique, an estimated 400,000 people have been displaced, according to the UN. As of now, the number of people in Mozambique affected by the storm and floods is 600,000, Verhoosel said, citing government figures. But \"that number will definitely go up,\" he told reporters. The WFP believes it is possible that a total of 1.7 million people in Mozambique will need assistance as a result of the weather-related disasters, Verhoosel added. Aid workers are racing to locate survivors, some of whom may still be stranded on rooftops or in trees. About 15,000 people still need to be rescued from floods after central Mozambique was pounded by a cyclone last week, Land and Environmental Minister Celso Correia said today. \"Yesterday we had counted 15,000 people that still need rescue today -- 15,000 people who are in bad shape. They are alive, we are communicating with them, delivering food, but we need to rescue them and take them out,\" he told reporters. He said around 3,000 people have been rescued so far since Tropical Cyclone Idai struck the flood-prone impoverished southern African country. \"The bad news is that we have lost already 217 lives,\" he said. \"There's still a lot of people on the ground in need of rescue. We are working with 120 specialists and a lot of teams to keep on rescuing.\" \"Our priority now is to make sure we take food, shelter and medicine to the people that are isolated in small islands or in big islands and villages. \"We are working 24 hours to make sure we are taking the food and medicine to those people to make sure we avoid live losses because of sickness,\" the minister said at Beira airport, which has become the humanitarian relief coordination hub. The cyclone made landfall last week in central Mozambique before hitting neighbouring Zimbabwe where at least 139 have been killed."

The chairman of the Tribal Council of the Seminoles, James E. Billie, perched high above the hull at the controls of the airboat, touched a switch and a beam of light sprang from the band encircling his wide brow.\nMIDNIGHT, a canal near Alligator Alley in the preserve adjacent to Everglades National Park in southern Florida. The chairman of the Tribal Council of the Seminoles, James E. Billie, perched high above the hull at the controls of the airboat, touched a switch and a beam of light sprang from the band encircling his wide brow. He pointed a visitor into a seat in the prow. An airplane engine and propeller contained in concentric steel circles eight feet in diameter formed an imposing backdrop.\n''Hang on and don't let go,'' he warned. In seconds the boat was skimming across the tar-black channel at 45 miles an hour, past literally hundreds of gold-gleaming alligator eyes. Negotiating narrow sloughs, accelerating over sawgrass hummocks, gliding through shallow water, stopping on a dime: Mr. Billie's reputation as an ace pilot of both watercraft and aircraft was not exaggerated. Nor was his skill as a frog catcher.\nZooming alongside each tiny prey, discernible only by the emerald of its eyes, Mr. Billie plucked it from the canal with a flick of the wrist, unerringly pinioning it with a long four-pronged pole, a gig, the frogger's traditional tool.\nFrog hunting is becoming rare in the Everglades, a vanishing wetland that represents the last bastion of the Florida panther (population less than 50) and other endangered species, along with the Seminole Indians (population 1,700), the Independent Seminole (50 to 75 people) and Miccosukee Indians (300).\n''No one can really make a living catching frogs any more,'' Mr. Billie said. ''This is still the only way to get them, one at a time in the middle of the night. It takes too much time and energy and isn't well paid.'' The primary domestic source of edible frogs is the Everglades, but most of the legs consumed in America are imported.\nBeginning in the 1940's real-estate developers, citrus growers, cattle ranchers and produce farmers encouraged the diking and draining of most of Florida's frog country, according to Foster Crippen, owner of the Frogleg Ranch, the major Florida supplier of frogs' legs. ''Compared to cattlemen - sales, profits, net worth - froggers are nothin','' he said.\n''That's the truth. And compared to real estate, we're double nothin'.''\nFrom November through February, when water levels are up in the Southeast, the Frogleg Ranch ships 500 to 2,000 pounds of legs a day, primarily to restaurants in Florida, though some also go to Louisiana, Illinois, Texas, New York, Michigan and California. Frogs' legs are sold in nine sizes, ranging from a hefty two pairs per pound to a minuscule 25, which, Mr. Crippen said, go to Detroit to be deep-fried, bones and all, for sandwiches. In the off-season he ships 100 to 300 pounds a day.\nIf these numbers sound substantial, consider that in the 1930's there were 23 frog farms in southern Florida.\n''And I guess we'll be the last, since we're the only one left,'' said Mr. Crippen, who has been in the business for close to 25 years.\nDr. Dudley Culley, a professor of fisheries at the School of Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries at Louisiana State University and the author of numerous works on frog farming, said little chance of cultivation exists in the United States, mainly because pesticides have reduced the number of insects, frogs' primary food.\n''Add to that the fact that they are extremely vulnerable to many diseases and that they require live food,'' Dr. Culley said. The situation, however, is not hopeless. Dr. Culley noted: ''Frog people are strange. We get hung up on frogs and can't stop.'' One such dauntless frog person is Bill Seefeldt, owner of Life Cycles Research Company. At his 10-acre ranch in Dade County, Fla., Mr. Seefeldt, a self-taught ''practical geneticist with endless curiosity, not a marketing man,'' raises fish, frogs, turtles, geese, plants, insects and more. Frogs, however, are his true love. ''My first pet in school was a tadpole,'' he explained.\n''Because frogs in captivity present so many breeding problems,'' he continued, ''95 percent of eating frogs are caught in the wild - in Africa, India, Bangladesh, China or the United States.''\nThe Federal Government does not collect any statistics on domestic frog production or consumption. The only figures it collects are on imports. Most of the frog-eating world (West Germany and France are foremost consumers) prefers bullfrogs, but these don't last in the Everglades.\n''They're territorial,'' Mr. Seefeldt explained. ''They just sit and croak in one spot even if it takes a year to find a mate, which makes them perfect edible targets. And they're poorly designed aerodynamically. They have these fat faces. Alligators and snakes nail 'em in a millisecond.'' Through unscientific tastings, Mr. Seefeldt has determined that many Americans love frog meat - it's the idea of the feet they can't stand. So over the last 15 years he has developed a species of meaty, farm-raised albino bullfrogs with small heads and long legs. Mr. Seefeldt plans to have them ready for market by 1990.\nDiners who think of frogs' legs as a specialty of fine French restaurants may be surprised to find that in the Florida national park area they appear in many restaurants that are cozy, down-home, gas-station simple - or just plain ratty. Generally deep-fried, the mild-tasting meat may appear as the ''Everglades Special'' or ''Jumper Plate'' - as at the Coopertown Restaurant, where locals and tourists drop in. More a shack with a lunch counter and tables than a restaurant, the place was built in 1945 at the edge of Highway 41 (the Tamiami Trail), a hot, flat strip where turkey buzzards circle overhead.\nSally Kennon, the owner and cook, receives fresh frogs' legs early each day from her regular froggers. She coats the legs with eggs blended with what she calls her ''secret seasoning mix,'' dips them in bread crumbs, fries them until they turn crunchy, and serves them from 8 A.M. until dark at $6.95 a plate.Nearby, the Miccosukee Village\nRestaurant, an airy coffee shop, features an Everglades Frog Legs Dinner ($10.95) in which the legs are coated in plain flour and fried.\nBy contrast, only a few luxurious restaurants in Miami Beach, Boca Raton and other south Florida cities serve frogs' legs, usually in the classic French style with garlic, or with a few contemporary twists. The Down Under in Fort Lauderdale, for example, for $18 offers a choice of frogs' legs with mushrooms and green peppercorns; with buttery basil sauce atop tomato linguine, or poached, boned, chilled and arrayed on a salad of barley, cucumbers and tomatoes with lemon and cilantro.\nIf the small size of the domestic frog harvest is a problem, importing frogs' legs is an unpredictable business at best, since sources, supplies and prices vary dramatically from season to season. Of the 1,389,734 pounds of fresh, chilled and frozen frogs' legs imported into the United States from January though May this year, 1,261,596 pounds came from Bangladesh. The remainder, in order of volume, came from reshippers in the Netherlands, and from India, Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.On July 7, however, The Journal of\nCommerce reported that ''Bangladesh, which supplied 76 percent of the delicacy consumed in the United States last year, has joined India and China to ban frog leg exports for the next three years.'' The ban was instituted in May because the Bangladesh insect population had exploded after large numbers of frogs were killed for their legs. Insecticides are costly, as well as toxic to the remaining frogs. Moreover, as nations industrialize, few workers are willing to undertake the laborious job of hunting frogs in the dark for little money.\nDr. Culley of Louisiana State University said he had assisted in the recent establishment of a frog farm in Belem, Brazil that raised 700,000 bullfrogs in 1987. But since frogs' legs are popular among Brazilians, ''There isn't much incentive for the Brazilians to send the frogs out of the country,'' Dr. Culley said. He also noted that the market for frogs to be used in research is more profitable than that for frogs' legs.\nAlthough frozen frogs' legs are still being shipped from warehouses in Bangladesh, they are in short supply.\nPrices have risen, but may not go higher, since the demand in this country is not enough to support such an increase. Those who are fond of frogs' legs, it seems, must either stock up, visit Europe, Asia or the Everglades, or prepare for a dry spell. Fried Frogs' Legs (Adapted from the Miccosukee Village Restaurant) Preparation time: 5 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes 1 cup vegetable oil 1 cup self-rising flour 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste 1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper, or to taste 1 cup milk 16 pairs frogs' legs, about 2 ounces each. \n1.Heat the oil in a wide skillet or electric skillet to 375 degrees. \n2.Blend together the flour, salt and red pepper in a shallow bowl. Place the milk in a large bowl. Rinse the frogs' legs in water and dry them. Dip into milk, then into flour to coat rather heavily. Place on wax paper. \n3.Slip eight pairs of frogs' legs into the hot oil. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes longer. \n4.Transfer to a baking sheet covered with paper towels. Set in a very low oven. Dip, coat and fry the remaining legs. \nYield: 4 servings. Frogs' Legs With Mushrooms, White Wine and Green Peppercorns (Adapted from the Down Under) Preparation time: 1 hour soaking, plus 10 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes 8 pairs frogs' legs, about 2 to 3 ounces each 1/2 cup milk 2 tablespoons oil 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 pound mushrooms, cut in slices 1/4-inch thick Salt and pepper to taste 2 tablespoons flour mixed with 1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt 1 teaspoon drained green peppercorns, crushed with knife blade Y cup dry white wine 1 tablespoon lemon juice. \n1.Soak the frogs' legs in milk 1 hour or more, refrigerated. \n2.Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in an 11-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat. Add mushrooms and toss over high heat until golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate; add salt and pepper. \n3.Drain and dry the legs thoroughly. Toss four pairs at a time in a paper bag with the flour and salt, until coated well. Tap off the excess. Repeat with the remaining legs. \n4.Add the remaining butter and oil to the pan and melt over moderate heat. Add the frogs' legs (they should fit easily in one layer; if not, divide into two batches). Brown on both sides over moderate heat, 5 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a serving dish in a warm oven. \n5.Pour any fat from the pan. Add the peppercorns, wine and lemon juice to the pan. Bring to a boil, stirring. Boil until a bit syrupy, or reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Add the mushrooms and toss to heat through. Pour over the legs and serve hot. \nYield: 2 servings. FINDING THEM \nFROGS' legs vary widely in size. For most recipes, allow four pairs of legs, 1 1/2 to 2 ounces each, per serving. Because of the size variation, cooking times may have to be adjusted. For deep-frying, the legs need to swim freely in the oil, which means making adjustments there too.\nAlthough supplies of frogs' legs vary, the stores listed here, all in New York City, report that they often have them. If the legs are frozen, as is usually the case, defrost them in the refrigerator for about 48 hours before rinsing, drying and cooking.\nPisacane Midtown Corporation, 940 First Avenue, between 51st and 52d Streets, telephone 212-355-1850, $7 per pound.\nCatalano's Fresh Fish, 1652 Second Avenue, near 85th Street, 212-628-9608, $8.99 per pound.\nFulton Market Retail Store, 11 Fulton Street, between Front and Beekman Streets, 212-608-2920, $6.95 per pound.\nHung Fish Market, 93 Mulberry Street, off Canal Street, 212-608-1022, sells frogs' legs only on special orders at $24 per 5-pound box.\nDe Martino, 821 Ninth Avenue, between 54th and 55th Streets, 212-265-3813, $5.99 per pound.\nBalducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas, between Ninth and 10th Streets, 212-673-2600, $11.99 per pound."

      "text": "Life in Bangladesh Delta: On the Edge of Disaster\n1987-06-21T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen the tide comes in, life pauses on the little silt islands that dot the great river delta of Bangladesh, and for miles around it seems that herds of cattle are standing up to their knees in the Bay of Bengal.\nAs the ocean rises, pushing a wall of water as high as a man up the riverways ahead of it, the people who make their precarious lives here between the land and the sea retreat, pulling their boats into sheltered creeks.\nBut when the annual cyclones roar in, in spring and early summer, there is no retreat. Each year, hundreds and sometimes thousands or tens of thousands of people are swept away.\nIn the floods of 1985, 10,000 to 20,000 people died. The ''great cyclone'' of 1970 killed a half million to a million.\nIn the endless harsh struggle for land in one of the world's most densely populated nations, the survivors return within days, ''rebuilding their houses,'' as one Bangladeshi put it, ''over the graves of their children.''\nOn thousands of alluvial islands, known as ''chars,'' the pressure of the world's expanding population is played out in starkest terms as crowding drives millions of people deeper into more perilous portions of the delta, where they battle for survival against nature and one another.\nIn the competition to cultivate these shifting, inhospitable spits of land, hundreds die each year as they battle each other with knives and clubs for homesteads. A Case Study In Too Many People\nOne hundred million people live in Bangladesh, an area about the size of Wisconsin, and one-fifth of that area is water, as two great river systems, the Ganges and Brahmaputra, converge to form the largest delta in the world.\nIf trends continue, the nation's population is expected to reach 160 million by the end of the century, increasing problems already at a crisis level. Experts on the problems of worldwide population growth are studying Bangladesh as an example of what might lie in the future for many nations.\nIt is agreed throughout the country, and among the char dwellers themselves, that life in the shadow of disaster has bred a race of tough, fierce men and women.\n''Their very existence on those shores depends on their being ferocious,'' said Salahuddin Ahmed, whose family migrated to the capital city, Dhaka, from an island area. ''They are closer to nature than we are, and in nature there is no sentimentality.''\nEach year, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, joining in the middle of Bangladesh to form the broad Meghna River, flush what the World Bank has estimated at 2.4 billion tons of silt through the country from as far away as the melting snows of the Himalayas.\nAs deforestation has brought increased erosion in the Himalayas, the volume of silt flowing through Bangladesh has also risen. Beginning in summer, as the current eases, silt forms uncounted thousands of chars along the rivers and around the ocean's edges. Shifting Landscape: Maps Can't Keep Up\nMost of Bangladesh is geologically recent, a gigantic, shifting char formed over the millennia. Rivers slice through the soft land, changing their courses constantly, and little islands appear, disappear and sometimes reappear over the years.\nErosion can eat away as much as a mile of riverbank in a year, and sometimes entire towns are imperiled.\nThe city of Sirajganj is today fighting off the encroachment of the Brahmaputra River, known in Bangladesh as the Jamuna. The city has already lost its main marketplace, its railroad station and several schools. Yet some maps do not even show it to be on the river's edge.\n''There is no such thing as an up-to-date map of Bangladesh,'' a Western relief-agency worker said. ''The rivers and chars are moving about all the time.''\nThe nation's difficulties have increased since the opening in 1974 of a Ganges River diversion system just across the border in India.\nNow, less water flows from India into Bangladesh during times of drought, and more is released during flood season. A reduced current has raised silt deposits and caused flooding upriver.\nThe shifting landscape of Bangladesh increases the hardships of an impoverished population.\nAt least 30 percent of the people of Bangladesh - or 30 million people -cannot find paid work or are underemployed, mostly as agricultural laborers. Some 50 percent are considered landless by the Government. And 60 percent are underfed by the minimum standards of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Where Statistics Don't Tell the Story\nAccording to Government projections, this predominantly agricultural nation could become self-sufficient in food grains by the end of the decade. But experts here, both within and outside Government, dismiss this as a largely meaningless statistic.\nOne reason is the huge difficulties in food distribution in a country fragmented by shifting, often flooded rivers.\nA. R. S. Doha, a former foreign minister who left the Government of President H. M. Ershad three years ago, said: ''Almost every day we see Ershad flying about the country in his helicopter. There's not half a dozen helicopters in Bangladesh. He's the one man who can move about the country.''\nThe other reason that self-sufficiency could be viewed as a mere statistic is the poverty that makes it impossible for most Bangladeshis to afford enough food.\nIn a recent study of life on the chars, Atiur Rahman of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies described a common practice of ''calculated starvation,'' in which poor people cut down on meals and substitute a rice fluid for solid food.\nHe said rural women fare the worst, sometimes working for the equivalent of 3 cents a day and eating just one meal of rice in a week. Law of New Land: Survival of the Toughest\nPoverty is harshest for people whose homes are swept away by floods or erosion and who suddenly find themselves with no source of food.\nThus, the struggle for each new spit of land, as it surfaces above the brown waters of the rivers, becomes a fight for survival.\nBy law, each new char belongs to the Government, to be apportioned among the landless families on official waiting lists. But the law is a distant presence in much of Bangladesh.\nLong before the slow bureaucracy can apportion the islands, local warlords have seized them in land battles known as ''char dhakhal.''\nMeanwhile, legal battles can last decades or even generations. Landowners sometimes pay tax on water to insure rights to a char that slipped below the river but might resurface.\nThe first step in claiming a disputed char is to set cattle to graze on its sparse vegetation and compact the loose silt, said Badsha Mia, an assistant to the commissioner of Munchiganj district, which administers Char Kishoreganj.\nBushes and trees are planted to hold the land against the pressures of currents. After about two years, if the char has held against the river, farmers can begin to plant rice, vegetables and jute.\nIt is when the first harvest is ready that the fiercest fights for possession can take place, said M. Mokammel Haque, the Government's Secretary of Land Administration.\nMeanwhile, erosion continues, and even as the char grows, its edges are being washed away, and the farmers, with their new fields, retreat.\nThe silt washes from char to char without a permanent resting place, like the char dwellers themselves.\nAbdul Motalib, 25 years old, is one of these drifting island men, born on a long-gone char upriver and now fighting against the erosion of his rice field at the edge of Char Kishoreganj.\n''It is the natural process,'' he said. ''If this char washes away, we will look for another one. That is our destiny. We are poor men, and we have no choice.'' An Established Area: No Schools, No History\nHere on Char Kishoreganj, in the Dhaleswari River only 30 miles south of Dhaka, there are no schools, no doctors, no policemen, no trade, no government and no history.\nYet among chars, it is relatively well developed, with portions dating back 30 or 40 years. Although the interior is flat and sparsely populated, small groups of people are busy with fish or crops at its crumbling edges.\nSmall punts ferry towering loads of hay, and men pull fishing boats, like Volga boatmen, by long cables fastened to the masts. Women in their saris soap themselves, and then fill aluminum urns with muddy water to take back to their homes.\nIn the broad river beyond, ancient cargo boats with tattered brick-red sails drift by in the rain, with rows of sailors on their decks sheltering under large black umbrellas.\nMr. Motalib said he and other settlers had fought for their right to cultivate Char Kishoreganj. Residents said that 12 years ago, when the Government brought a group of legal settlers to their fields, the squatters fought back, killing seven people. Most-Feared Adversary: The Sudden Storms\nThe weather remains the most feared adversary of the island dwellers.\nEarlier that morning, a sunny sky had suddenly turned black. Lightning sliced down from fast-moving clouds, and the brown water became choppy as fat pre-monsoon raindrops splattered down. Farmers hurried for cover, and boats raced for shore. An hour later, all was peaceful again; the storm had not grown to full force.\nOn a sandy spit not far upriver lies the mass grave of 200 people who drowned last year when a sudden squall caused one of the country's frequent ferry disasters.\nBut for all their hardships, the char dwellers are the envy of Bangladeshis that possess even less.\nShahida Begum has lived in a burlap-and-cardboard hovel on a muddy street in Dhaka for 10 years, since a typhoon swept away her home on a char in the southern district of Noakhali.\n''After the storm, we returned to our land, but it had been seized by strongmen in a char dhakhal,'' she said.\nToday, Mrs. Shahida, a widow at the age of 30, supports a family of 11 on about 70 cents a day by chipping bricks for gravel on a construction site.\nAbdul Barik Howladar, a neighbor from Noakhali who is now Mrs. Begum's neighbor on the streets of Dhaka, said, ''Please tell the Government to let us have a char so that we will have some place to live.''"

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-07 00:00:00      \nAt the end of April, at a joint conference that included Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association (BELA), Bangladesh Institute of Planners (BIP), Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) and other groups came together to share the findings of a study spanning the last nine years on how there has been a systematic degradation of Dhaka's overall environment to benefit business. The study covers six areas including the Thana(s) Savar, Roopganj, Keraniganj, DAP (2010), the Gazipur part under DAP and the Dhaka metropolitan area. We learned that since 2010, the city has lost around 43,200 out of the total 187,958 acres of wetlands that Dhaka had. That means we have lost 22 percent of our wetlands over the span of nearly a decade. When we look at wetland, there are three types: flood flow zones, water retention areas and water bodies like rivers, canals, lakes and beels. In the DAP area alone, we are losing 2,500 acres of wetland every year. Breaking down the overall loss over the nine-year period, we find that 27 percent of 141,069 acres of free flow flood zones, around 34 percent of 10,419 acres of water retention areas and eight percent of 36,497 acres of other wetlands were grabbed or filled up. In the main city, we have areas like Basila, Bashundhara residential area, Beraid, Amin Bazar, and North Uttara that have been severely affected. The conversion of wetlands which should have been conserved has been done in the name of development and urbanisation, but the reality of course is that such massive violation of DAP has been made possible because of a lack of good governance and oversight. When we look at the fact that Dhaka has been a magnate for economic activity and that has been drawing people by the millions hailing from diverse backgrounds, it is easy to imagine why the realtors have cashed in on a building boom to support an expanding economy. As put by Professor Adil Mohammed Khan, General Secretary, BIP, \"conservation of water bodies like rivers and canals, wetland, retention areas and flood flow zones are all vital to making development and urbanisation sustainable maintaining an ecological balance.\" This is where policymakers got it wrong. By touting Dhaka as the premier investment hub without thinking about developing townships or smaller towns in the periphery of the capital city, we have been left with demand for housing that far outstrips the availability of land. The irresponsible planning and development of the city which simply ignored the DAP and where Rajuk has turned a blind eye to the all-out grabbing of water bodies was highlighted during a thought sharing episode back in 2017 between Rajuk and realtors where the latter basically told Rajuk that it is ludicrous for Rajuk to try and reclaim what has already been grabbed. They went on to state that Dhaka is actually better off without its wetlands because the only purpose water bodies serve is to increase the mosquito population. Experts contend that without these water bodies, the city faces many problems, one of which is water-logging. Back in April, 2018, the city had witnessed 55mm of rainfall in six hours which was enough to produce knee-deep water in major residential and commercial areas. Although city authorities had been working on a major overhaul of the drainage system, the fact of the matter is that today, the city is lacking in enough canals and lowland to let the water run out. But because we have been lacking in foresight, Dhaka's lowlands and canals are being filled up at an unprecedented rate and it simply cannot handle any heavy deluge. That explains why Dhaka has only two percent area dedicated to water retention against a requirement of 12 percent for a city of this size and when we factor in that nearly 90 percent of Dhaka is covered in concrete, the rainy season water has no way to drain out to water bodies and we end up with water-logging on city roads. Filling up wetlands in violation of DAP has been made possible because the custodians of the city turned a blind eye to the syndicate of businessmen backed up by political influence, working with corrupt officials over the years. The bad practices have now become institutional and with no accountability to speak of, laws are violated at will for profit is king and there is enough money to go around superseding the need for a balanced approach to city development.

The leaders of the organisation appeal to the workers to devote themselves to the task of reconstruction of the war-ravaged economy by increasing production in industrial units. The Convention demands Tk 200 as minimum wage for workers. They also urge the government to take immediate action to resume operation of the closed mills and factories.

On Friday afternoon, a BSF  patrol team from Amit camp under the Shitalkuchi police station of India stopped the construction of Keramatia Boro Mosque when its windows were being installed. BGB 61 Company Commander Subedar Ibrahim Molla said: \"After the obstruction by BSF, construction work has been temporarily halted. We are discussing the issue with BSF.\"  Locals say, in Mughal times a darbesh (holy man) by the name of Keramatia Hujur built a mosque in the Dolpara area. By the side of the mosque, a shrine was later built around his grave and the mosque was developed further over time.  During the partition of India in 1947 the mosque and the shrine fell in no man's land, where thousands of Muslims go to pray every Friday. The mosque committee's secretary, Alimuddin said: \"The reconstruction of the mosque was approved in 2011 by the authorities of both Bangladesh and India and construction work began on April 29 that year.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-25 00:00:00      \nThe White House and Senate leaders of both parties announced agreement early Wednesday on unprecedented emergency legislation to rush sweeping aid to businesses, workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus pandemic. The urgently needed pandemic response measure is the largest economic rescue measure in history and is intended as a weeks- or months-long patch for an economy spiraling into recession and a nation facing a potentially ghastly toll. Top White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. It still needs to be finalized in detailed legislative language. \"Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,\" Ueland said. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidised loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. \"After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,\" said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, a key negotiator. \"It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\" At the White House on Tuesday, even as the public-health crisis deepened, President Donald Trump expressed eagerness to nudge many people back to work in coming weeks and held out a prospect, based more on hope than science, that the country could be returning to normal in less than a month. \"We have to go back to work, much sooner than people thought,\" Trump told a Fox News town hall. He said he'd like to have the country \"opened up and just raring to go\" by Easter, April 12. But in a White House briefing later, Trump said that \"our decision will be based on hard facts and data.\" Medical professionals say social distancing needs to be stepped up, not relaxed, to slow the spread of infections. At the White House briefing, the public-health authorities said it was particularly important for people in the hard-hit New York City metropolitan area to quarantine themselves for 14 days, and for those who have recently left the city to do the same. Dr Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, said pointedly at the briefing, \"No one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City.\" On Capitol Hill, five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. Even before the deal was reached, news of the likely but elusive agreement had sent the stock market rocketing on Tuesday. The emerging rescue package would be larger than the 2008 bank bailout and 2009 recovery act combined. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at the insistence of Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, while Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salary of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. \"It ensures that all workers are protected whether they work for businesses small, medium or large, along with self-employed and workers in the gig economy,\" Schumer said. Republicans won inclusion of an \"employee retention\" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies who retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. Democrats pointed to gains for hospitals, additional oversight of the huge industry stabilization fund, and money for cash-strapped states. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters -- including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program bank rescue, officials said. Trump in recent days has sounded a note of frustration about the unprecedented modern-day effort to halt the virus' march by essentially shutting down public activities in ways that now threaten the US economy. Even though Trump's administration recommended Americans curtail activities for 15 days, starting just over a week ago, the president said he may soon allow parts of the economy, in regions so far less badly hit by the virus, to begin reopening. He continued on that theme Tuesday as he weighed a relaxation of social distancing guidelines after the 15-day period is up. His suggestion that the pandemic could ease and allow a return to normalcy in a mere few weeks is not supported by public health officials or many others in government. On Tuesday, top defense and military leaders warned department personnel that the virus problems could extend for eight to 10 weeks, or longer. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a Defense Department town hall meeting that the crisis could even extend into July. Trump has balked at using his authority under the recently invoked Defense Protection Act to compel the private sector to manufacture needed medical supplies like masks and ventilators, even as he encourages them to spur production. \"We are a country not based on nationalizing our business,\" said Trump, who has repeatedly railed against socialism overseas and among Democrats. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-17 00:00:00      \nIn light of lockdowns and social distancing measures, most farmworkers are isolated in their homes The sudden outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic is worrying farmers ahead of the Boro paddy harvest season in Jessore, with farmers facing a shortage of workers to bring home their ripe crops in hundreds of acres of land.  In light of lockdowns and social distancing measures, most farmworkers are isolated in their homes, as a result, the upcoming harvesting season is threatened by impediments to harvesting. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) of the district has announced that it will help farmers by providing them with harvester machines at nominal value to harvest crops with less manpower. However, most farmers are unaware of DAE's plan to assist, so they are coming up with awareness campaigns to relieve farmers of their worries, according to district DAE sources. Farmers said the Boro harvest season has begun and they have to begin harvesting their crops in the next 15-20 days. They are facing a manpower shortage and they are not themselves allowed to work due to the lockdowns in place. They fear that their crops will either rot or the annual flood in the upcoming monsoon will ruin their year-long toil. According to the Agricultural Department of the district, over 54,615 hectares of lands are booming with Boro paddy and due to pleasant weather, this year farmers are expecting a good yield. The deputy director of the district DAE, Dr Md Akhtaruzaman, said the authorities had also taken up a scheme to provide 44 harvesters and 18 reapers to the farmers to lessen the need for manpower. He said: \"The Combine Harvester and Reapers will significantly reduce the work and cost of farmers. It can harvest around 1.5 bigha land per hour.\" The official added that the DAE was ready to provide additional farmworkers from other districts if needed, making sure of course that measures were also taken to prevent a spread of the coronavirus virus as well. When asked about the aid promised, most of the farmers said they did not know about the assistance but did appreciate the move. Dr Md Akhtaruzaman said: \"The scheme will only cost Tk250 in every two bigha land. And even if we face a shortage of machines we will employ farmworkers from Satkhira and other districts after consulting medical professionals regarding the necessary safety measures.\""

Emergency services tackled thousands of calls from people overnight around the city of Townsville, where evacuation centres were filling up. Crocodiles were even spotted in suburban streets, pictures on social media showed. \"Once in a century event happening here. I have never seen the likes of this before,\" Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp TV, in a state often hit by cyclones and flooding. Palaszczuk said there could be thousands of homes affected by the flooding. A record 1.16 metres (3.8 ft) of rain has fallen across the Townsville area over the past seven days, with another 100 millimetres expected to be dumped over the area on Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Major flood warnings have been posted for several rivers. The weather bureau warned of \"dangerous and high velocity flows\" along the Ross River after the flood gates were opened fully at the Ross River dam on Sunday, releasing about 1,900 cubic metres of water a second. Even after the release, as of Monday morning, the dam was still at 229 percent capacity, holding about 532,000 gigalitres of water, or roughly as much as Sydney Harbour. \"We're hoping to see an easing trend from tomorrow,\" bureau spokeswoman Jess Gardner said, adding that the rains could move further south, towards Mackay, a major coal exporting area. Townsville, a major port for northern Australia, is the country's top exporter of copper, zinc, lead and sugar. The Port of Townsville remains open, but cargo loadings have faced interruptions due to heavy rain, a port spokeswoman said. She did not have details on specific shipments held up. Global miner Glencore Plc, which exports copper, zinc and lead from Townsville said as of late last week there had been no impact on its operations."

Other Bangladeshi officials said they feared the death toll would be in the thousands. Hundreds of thousands of people were reportedly left homeless and millions of tons of crops were said to have been destroyed. Winds to 120 Miles Per Hour\nThe cyclone struck Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, as it was continuing its recovery from the worst flooding in its history; the flooding in August and September covered three-fourths of the country and caused damages now estimated at more than $1 billion.\nThe storm, with winds of 60 to 120 miles per hour, whipped 10-foot-high tidal waves as it swept across the Bay of Bengal and through the southern and southeastern districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Byrguna, Barisal, Patuakhali, Bhola, Chittagong and the town of Cox's Bazar. Electrical power and communications in those areas were cut off.\nAt least 275 fishermen were reported missing, and officials said they expected many more deaths as reports come in from the hundreds of tiny islands in the Bay of Bengal.\nA relief ministry official said that about 80 percent of the crops and mud and thatch homes in the two hardest-hit districts, Khulna and Satkhira, had been destroyed. Warnings Were Broadcast\nBut he said that human casualties had been minimized by an efficient early warning system that helped people evacuate vulnerable areas. This official predicted the final death toll would be no more than ''a few thousand.''\nGiven the record of previous cyclones in Bangladesh - the most recent in 1985, which killed an estimated 10,000 people - that prediction seemed to a remarkably low figure. More than 300,000 people died in 1970 in the worst cyclone in Bangladesh's history."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-01 00:00:00      \nImagine a Japanese man in Dhaka in the first decade of the twentieth century bent on being employed in the town and ending up marrying a Bengali Brahmo woman, the daughter of a soap factory owner, who has offered him a job. Think of the woman later going to a village near Nagoya with her husband (now a soap factory owner himself in Dhaka) to visit her in-laws, a few years before the First World War erupts. Imagine next the woman accompanying her husband to Japan once more at the outbreak of the Second World War, since the Japanese man is afraid of being jailed in British India. There she meets Netaji Subhas Bose and is thrilled by his vision of an independent homeland liberated from the British with the help of the Japanese Army. Picture, if you will her broadcasting in Bengali on Netaji's behalf on wartime Japanese radio. Consider now the prospects, years after her death, of the discovery of two manuscripts of the woman's visits, one published in her lifetime, but the other surviving only in manuscript form, recovered from oblivion and published devotedly by successive scholars/editors, and even a film made on her by an eminent Bangladeshi filmmaker.  And imagine finally a book in English that gathers almost everything available by and on this remarkable Brahmo woman so that readers can piece together her life and see it in its proper context. As readers of the book under review will agree once they have finished with it, truth is at times stronger than fiction! The Journey of a Bengali Woman to Japan is a noteworthy work centering on Hariprabha Mallick Takeda, a Bengali woman (1890-1972), who was married off to Oemon Takeda, a Japanese national employed in her father's soap factory in 1907 by her enlightened Brahmo father. At the time of marriage, she was looking after a home for abandoned girls and destitute women in Dhaka's Nimtali. She and Takeda visited Japan for four months in 1912-13; her account of the trip was published as Banga Mohilar Japan Jatra in 1915. The couple had no children but was happily settled in Dhaka, where Takeda had done well as the owner of a factory manufacturing glycerin soap. Her third trip lasted seven years (there was a second trip in 1924 that has gone unrecorded) and shows a Japan first being devastated by its war efforts, and in real bad shape afterwards The rediscovery of Hariprabha's writings has been a continuous affair. The Bangladeshi scholar Monzurul Huq located a copy of the first and only book published by her sister, Santiprabha Mullick in 1915 in London's Indian Office Library and later on, brought out an edition of it in 1999; two more editions were published later in Delhi (2007) and Kolkata (2009) by others. The handwritten manuscript of her experience in Japan at the time of the Second World War was discovered after her death by Surojit Dasgupta, the nephew she lived with in the final years of her life, and was published with the book on her first trip by Manjushree Sinha from Kolkata in 2009. Sinha's edition also contains another hitherto undiscovered work in Bengali by Hariprabha titled \"Child Rearing and Women's Education in Japan,\" originally published in the journal Bharatbarsha in 1949. What Somdatta Mandal has done so well is not only to translate these three manuscripts into English but also append them with a translation of an essay by Monzurul Huq introducing the first two works, an original essay by Kazuhiro Watanabe titled, \"The Japan that Hariprabha Saw,\" a translation of select compilation of articles by Swapan Prasanna Roy that he had written for his 2007 Delhi edition of the first two works, and a translation of the Introduction Sinha had written for her 2009 Kolkata edition. Obviously fascinated by everything she was finding out in the research she had undertaken to bring out her translations of Hariprabha's writings, Mandal follows up her translations and the contextual comments of previous editors and Watanabe with further translations of the \"Reminiscences\" of Hariprabha's nephew Surojit and his wife Manju Dasgupta of their \"Baro Mashi\" (eldest aunt). For good measure, Mandal also includes a review of Tanvir Mokammel's 2012 documentary Japani Bodhu (\"Japanese Bride\"), and reprints a scholarly piece by Gautam Neogi on the home for abandoned and destitute women Hariprabha managed till 1908. Of the works by Hariprabha, the first and longest is a fairly straightforward account of the voyage she took on shipboard with her husband to Japan and the people she met during her extended stay with her in-laws. She clearly has an eye for details and a mind that can organize them as well as the capacity to write simply. As a Brahmo, she takes occasional metaphysical leaps that stand out in her narrative. For example, when the ship she is in is leaving the river and entering the sea, she is impressed by the time it takes the vessel to reach blue water and views it as the wait humans are destined to experience in uniting with the Almighty.  In a Japanese temple she is eager to see the \"idol-less God [that] resides in this huge temple.\" There are things in Hariprabha's narratives clearly meant to be seen as exemplary for her Bengali readers. When she visits a girl's school she notes that the little children there are \"not taught with the aid of books\" but are \"given basic ethical training through stories\" and made to learn through activities like clay modeling and drawing. She obviously liked seeing Japanese women spending no more than half a day doing house work. She is also impressed here (and in the second account) by the cleanliness of the Japanese, observing their addiction to taking frequent public baths, their obsession with keeping public places clean, and not littering anything anytime anywhere. She records too how the Japanese, for their part, are fascinated by the presence of a Bengali woman in their midst, who, for her part, was obviously \"basking in the love and attention of everyone.\" While I liked reading the account of her first trip, I must confess that I found her description of her stay in war-torn Japan much more appealing. Her depiction of a people scarred mentally and having to undergo endless hardship because of war-time scarcity, of landscapes being devastated by enemy bombings, and of unending deaths can be quite moving as when she writes, \"The houses of the ordinary people of Japan were full of sorrow--husbands and sons dead, children dead of starvation, no food, no clothes, no roof above their heads.\" And yet she notes the courtesy and kindness with which she and her ageing husband are treated by the Japanese, as when they queued for food rations. At one point she and her increasingly infirm husband are forced to live in the corner of a godown. The second account attracted me a lot more than the first one also because of the glimpses it affords of Netaji and the Azad Hind in Japan. We find him sitting with Hariprabha in his car in Tokyo, hear him declare that his group would fight for India's independence till the end, and learn of the death of Netaji himself on a plane on the way (presumably) to India from Bangkok. True, what we have in Hariprabha's unpublished memoir are only such scattered references, but they seem to me to be, nevertheless, invaluable. As for Hariprabha's third work where she writes on Japanese women and children, one notices the implicit criticism of Bengalis in this regard and her admiration for the Japanese. This seems to be the case when she notes the use of diapers by mothers and the way they carry their children on their backs or avoid hitting them, transmitting well their \"nurturing instincts\" to the young ones. She obviously admires the schooling in politeness girls receive in schools. In this post-war essay, however, there is also an indication of her regret in the manner Japanese women were beginning to imitate American ways. Somdatta Mandal has done admirable work not only in translating Hariprabha's works so lucidly but also in her intelligent selection of selected contextual comments of other translators and scholars. Her translation and scholarship are evidence of her admiration for the unique experience of this Bengali Brahmo woman from Dhaka in Japan. My only regret after ending the book is that although Mandal and Jadavpur University Press appeared to have done their best to bring out a very attractive edition, there are no clear photos/portraits of Hariprabha in Dhaka, Japan, or West Bengal (where she lived after partition and her return from Japan) in The Journey of a Bengali Woman to Japan. But that could be because of a flood in Darjeeling which ruined whatever the widowed woman had in her trunk in the last stage of her life.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-18 00:00:00      \nInclement weather. Lack of buyers. Shortage of workers. And impending flashfloods. These very real developments, coupled with a belief that prices of their harvest are set to fall, have Boro farmers in Sylhet's haor region looking down the barrel. The government-declared stimulus package and assurances of buying up a huge amount of paddy and rice, which are meant to help, also ring hollow to many farmers. They are yet to see the benefit of the injection and are also worried about the strictness in maintaining the maximum humidity paddy is allowed to have. Benu Chandra Sarkar, a marginal farmer of Sukhair village of Dharmapasha upazila in Sunamganj, said, \"The weather is not favourable for harvesting paddy as the sky remains cloudy all day and it's raining periodically. If such weather continues, we will not be able to dry the paddy properly to sell to the government.\" There are also concerns that only a lucky few would be able to sell to the government. The government has decided to buy 54,278 tonnes from Sylhet division, but this is 2.10 percent of the production. Additionally, the paddy's maximum humidity has been set at 14 percent. While previously this was relaxed for haor farmers, it is not the case this time around. \"I do not want to sell paddy to the government as is not possible to maintain the humidity in this current weather,\" said Rahim Uddin, a farmer of Moulvibazar's Kulaura upazila. Meanwhile, in the haor region, paddy collectors (middleman), who used to work for large businesses, visited farmlands and made contracts with farmers before harvest. They even paid some money beforehand, which was used to hire workers and when drying the paddy. But this year, no such middlemen can be seen, farmers said. Sadek Miah, a paddy buyer of the area, said, \"This year large businesses are not interested to pay before and we are not sure what to do.\" Somor Biswas, a farmer of Kulaura upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"More buyers would mean increased prices. But this year the price will collapse, I think.\" The department of agriculture extension (DAE) in Sylhet division has estimated 25,83,115 tonnes of cultivation this year as Boro harvest begun last week. But, till Friday, only 5 percent of the Boro had been harvested, according to the Sylhet DAE. Early rainfall and the possible flash flood forecasted by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board recently added to the farmers' fears. All this comes amidst a shortage of workers due to the ongoing shutdown over the coronavirus pandemic. Mohammad Monsur, a farmer from Barlekha upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"I used to bring in workers from different areas but it's become impossible to bring them due to the nationwide shutdown\". \"I even contacted local workers, but they are already demanding more than Tk 500 per day, which was previously Tk 300-400 taka. If the cost increases, it would be hard to make profit by selling paddy,\" he said. To solve this, the government earlier declared a subsidy of 50 percent when buying harvesters and reapers, making the process more capital- than labour-intensive. Moreover, as per the instruction from the Ministry of Agriculture, the farmers can also get instalment facilities in buying them. But marginal farmers and even the well-off ones are balking at the still costly machines, especially given the sudden financial crisis everyone is finding themselves in. Joglul Haider, upazila agriculture officer of Kulaura upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"A combine harvester costs around taka 28 lakhs. Even if the government provide 50 percent subsidy, no farmers have enough money to buy it in this upazila\". Debol Sarkar, upazila agriculture officer of Barlekha upazila in Mouvibazar, also said, no farmer of the upazila shows interest to buy any harvester Talking about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's announcement of Tk 5,000 crore stimulus package for farmers, Shabbir Miah, a farmer from Kulaura upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"We saw that on TV, but we are not getting anything...\" Amid the gloom, however, some are still holding out for a ray of hope. Abdul Jalil, a farmer from Chhatak upazila in Sunamganj, said, \"I see good harvest this year, hope for good weather in coming days and a good price during this crisis.\" Srinibash Debnath, additional director of the department of agriculture extension in Sylhet, said, \"This year, the harvest seems very good. We are up for a very good yield.\" He also said many initiatives are being undertaken to support farmers and those will become visible in the coming days."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-02 00:00:00      \nAs part of a class assignment last semester a group of architecture students asked me a question: what makes a city inspiring? This set me thinking. It could very well be a policy question, particularly for countries that are undergoing accelerated urbanisation and envisioning the next phase of their social, political, and national evolution. As experts demonstrate, cities have become not only the drivers of economy but also sites of national soul-searching. I answered the students this way: a city is most inspiring when it is fair to all its inhabitants. A city is fair when it creates a culture of social justice across all its domains. A city ensures social justice when it offers equal opportunities to all its people. But fairness, social justice, and equal opportunity are abstract ideas. How does one institute them in the physical conditions of the city? Is it possible to transform the abstract idea of social justice into something that we can visualise, feel, and experience in the spaces of the city? As I pondered these questions, I recalled what the American poet and civil rights activist Maya Angelou once said: \"I always knew from that moment, from the time I found myself at home in that little segregated library in the South, all the way up until I walked up the steps of the New York City library, I always felt, in any town, if I can get to a library, I'll be OK. It really helped me as a child, and that never left me.\" A public library in the city--accessible to all, irrespective of their economic and social backgrounds--could be one of the most poignant symbols of a city that values social justice for all. Maya Angelou's racial discrimination in a segregated library in the American South could be mitigated by the robust publicness of the New York City library, where she didn't have to face the inhumanity of racism. She could walk up the steps of this library and feel that she could enter it without having to pass any discriminatory barriers. Angelou provided a most incisive physical portrayal of social justice in an urban condition with this simplest statement: \"... in any town, if I can get to a library, I'll be OK.\" The feeling that you can access any opportunity and facility in the city without any social and economic hurdle is a monumentally empowering condition. When that feeling is pervasive among the city's people of all ages, economic and social classes, gender, ethnicities, and physical abilities, a city is fair and practices social justice as its moral foundation. As the year ends, I have been thinking about the \"fairness\" measure of cities in Bangladesh. As I go around in Dhaka I keep wondering, is this city fair to all its people? Is this city guided by a basic philosophy of social justice? Again, fairness and social justice are abstract notions, and often ignored quietly and cleverly as left-leaning obstacles to a neoliberal worldview, typically rigged to favour the privileged and the powerful. But we need to decide how we develop our cities and what kind of humanity we institute in them. This is important for two main reasons. First, the middle-income status that we seek will be meaningful and sustainable only when that status is fair and achieved not at the expense of a vast majority of people. Second, around the world today, city administrators tasked with creating liveable cities are increasingly concerned with how to embody fairness in the city's planning. Liveability is not guaranteed by Smart City and its techno-glitz and seamless mobility. A Smart City could be liveable, provided it is fair to all its people, not just to its power-wielding CEOs and corporate executives. So, I ask: How do we qualitatively measure something as abstract as fairness in the city's infrastructure, roads, footpaths, buildings, water sources, public transportation, green spaces, shops, and public places? Let me offer an example before I address my key contention today. Consider public transportation from a fairness or social justice angle. Are we offering safe and gender-friendly mobility options for women in the public domain? If not, we are perpetuating patriarchy by means of public transportation, complicit in the creation of a biased social system that is inherently unfair. For me the most glaring case of unfairness in the city resides in the way we define, confine, and manage poverty in our cities. It is unhelpful that in Bangladesh urban poverty is still largely understood through the lens of slum studies. To frame urban poverty in terms of the inadequacy of urban amenities (such as toilets and piped water supplies) in slums alone is to ignore a deeper social question: What is society's attitude towards the \"poor\"? It is important to revisit this age-old question to disrupt the cycle of urban poverty in a sustainable way. Urban economists, social analysts, urban planners, and others produce a vast body of data on poverty in cities. But the big data can also overwhelm our compassion, our humane instincts. Any empirical study of the poor must be coupled with a fundamental ethical position that the poor is not the Other. The poor shouldn't be abstracted as a social category--a binary opposite of the bourgeois self--to be quarantined for research and experimentation. While empirical research is essential, without human compassion it bureaucratises the concept of poverty and dehumanises the poor. It is not that empirical knowledge of the poor is unnecessary. But without compassion as public policy, big data keeps on calcifying the poor as a category, one that is isolated from any decision-making power structures. Without any real agency, this category is on perpetual life support. In his work on gender justice, Amartya Sen argued that real societal progress is made when women's empowerment takes a strong hold on the public's ethical imagination. A similar argument could be made in the case of poverty studies. An ethically based view of the poor as fellow citizens, rather than as an objectified research category, is urgently needed for any sustained alleviation of poverty. It is time policymakers, municipal administrators, and urban planners rethought urban poverty as a problem of social justice, not just as a problem of economic development. The issue of urban poverty should be examined with a bit of moral quandary and introspection into how the class-conscious bourgeoisie defines itself as the opposite of the poor. This very definition constitutes the central problem of urban poverty. The poor must be seen with a human face, not as an abstraction. The problem is that the poor's social invisibility is very much embedded in how we define poverty as an unrelatable experience of the Other. And, big data tends to preserve the invisibility of the poor. Lest we forget, the idea of poverty has not been static in history. Both the idea and strategies for its relief have changed since the Industrial Revolution and industrial cities grew manifold in the modern era. Consider London, for instance. In the wake of the city's intense urbanisation in the 19th century, a highly divisive political and philosophical debate raged about reforming laws related to poor people. At the centre of this vexing debate was this question: would top-down \"help\" (from the state and wealthy private citizens) diminish the poor's ability to take personal responsibility? So intense a philosophical discussion was it that even Tocqueville and Hegel followed the English turmoil with much fascination. The dichotomy of state- and donor-driven top-down strategies of poverty alleviation and empathetic, bottom-up, and activist NGO efforts in capacity building among the poor continues to animate the urban poverty debate. In designing cities in our country, urban planners can begin by acknowledging that urban poverty is, first and foremost, a crisis of social justice. City professionals must debunk the urban mythology that the poor is a closed social group in need of an improved ghetto. It is important not to forget that the poor are typically stuck in spatial traps, often legitimised through official planning processes. These spatial traps are slums, unsanitary industrial zones, flood-prone river banks, and footpaths. By keeping the poor confined to the urban fringe and hazardous areas, cities often deny them social justice and access to networks of economic mobility. By ghettoising the poor in undesirable, environmentally precarious areas, both cities and capitalistic systems seek to fortify a false sense of social hygiene. To mitigate this problem, urban planners need to see the disenfranchised classes not as the poor but as fellow \"social citizens,\" who deserve, like anybody else, equitable access to healthcare, housing, education, and economic opportunities. But, at the same time, social citizenship comes with responsibility. All people of the city must accept the basic idea of the greater good--Greeks called it eunomia or good order--for the city to function as a fair place. An inclusive and liveable city treats all its citizens with fairness and humanity. Only when we agree with the moral argument of this hypothesis can we begin to overcome the tyranny of GDP-centric economic philosophies, in which the majority of the people don't have access to opportunities that cities offer. A just city is the most liveable.   Adnan Zillur Morshed is an architect, architectural historian, and urbanist.

The election could decide the control of parliament and shape President Moon Jae-in's ability to implement his agenda in the final two years of his administration, including looser fiscal policy aimed at creating jobs, raising the minimum wage, and continued re-engagement with North Korea. The National Election Commission set up eight polling stations for more than 3,000 coronavirus patients receiving treatment as well as 900 medical staff at treatment centres in hard-hit areas, including the capital, Seoul, and Daegu city. The election is on April 15 but officials are hoping that people will take advantage of early voting to reduce the numbers crowding polling locations that day. Polling stations were disinfected on Thursday and all voters were required to wear a mask, use sanitizers and wear plastic gloves. Officials checked temperatures and anyone higher than 37.5 Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit) was directed to special booths. Despite the coronavirus precautions, voters were enthusiastic. \"It was a little uncomfortable since I had to put on plastic,\" said Kim Ju-yeon, 22, who voted at a polling station at Seoul Station, referring to the gloves she had to wear. \"But because voting is a must, the experience was reassuring.\" There are 3,500 stations for voters to cast their ballots during two days of early voting starting on Friday. Moon cast his ballot at a polling station near the presidential office, known as the Blue House. \"There might be a long line of voters on the election day. I hope the early voting distributes that number,\" Moon said after voting. The government is also considering how some 46,500 people who have not tested positive but are in self-quarantine - most of them returnees from abroad - can cast their ballots. \"We are in consultation with related ministries on how to ensure the right to vote for those in self-quarantine on April 15,\" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters on Friday. Kim said the people in self-isolation could not take part in the early voting because of the risk they might be infected. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 new coronavirus cases on Friday, bringing the national tally to 10,450. The national death toll rose by four to 208. Candidates who began campaigning early this month have been wearing masks and exchanging fist bumps with voters in small meetings, shunning handshakes and big rallies. \"We're refraining from large rallies as much as possible and also limiting personal contact,\" said Lee Nak-yon, a former prime minister running for the parliament. The head of the main opposition United Future Party, Hwang Kyo-ahn, was spotted disinfecting residential areas. "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-28 00:00:00      \nMigration continues to be a serious issue for climate-vulnerable Bangladesh There are over 258 million migrants around the world living outside their country of birth. This figure is expected to grow for a number of reasons, including population growth, increasing connectivity, trade, rising inequality, demographic imbalances, and climate change. Globally, over 68.5 million people are forcibly displaced among which 25.4 million are refugees. To address the growing number of migrants and refugees in a way that upholds the principles of human rights, in 2018, the global leaders adopted two major reports to address issues related to refugees and migration. These are called the Global Compact on Refugees and Global Compact for Migration. Bangladesh is signatory to both the agreements will be addressing the agreements taking series of actions nationally and globally. To better understand the implications of these agreement in Bangladesh, it is important to look at what the compacts are about.  The Refugee Compact The Refugee Compact has four objectives: Ease pressures on host countries; enhance refugee self-reliance; expand access to third country solutions, and support conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity.  The Migration Compact The Migration Compact comprises 23 objectives for better managing migration at local, national, regional and global levels. It expresses states' \"collective commitment to improving cooperation on international migration.\" Both compacts were being questioned by various stakeholders especially with regards to how this will be delivered when there is less clarity about few definitions (such as refugee). It is widely agreed that the compacts will only make a difference to the lives of the refugees and migrants if there is enough political will of the government to live up to their commitments. While we continue demanding for better clarity and implementation of the compacts in line with Agenda 2030, it is important to also recognize that climate change and conflict-related displacement and forced migration are on the rise -- we can start thinking of supporting the proposal of the New NANSEN Passport as one of the response mechanisms. However, this doesn't take away the fact that we need take action to prevent displacement and forced migration to take place.  National response Bangladesh continues to be within the top 10 at-risk countries to climate change impacts and disasters in the world. There are a number of scenarios with linking the temperature raise trajectory, especially how this will displace and force people to migrate. There are a number of efforts made to understand the future scenario including efforts to track what is happening with regards to displacement and migration in recent years:  * Between 1980 and 2008, it experienced 219 natural disasters -- but not enough information about how many people are displaced. Cyclone Sidr alone impacted 9 million people and at least 3 million people were displaced (NRC)  * Between 2008 and 2014 it is estimated that 4.7 million people were displaced due to disasters in Bangladesh (displacement solutions). Some of the major events include Cyclone Aila (as many as two million people lost their home)  * In 2017, the majority of new displacements occurred due to sudden-onset disasters including Tropical Cyclone Mora in May and Monsoon flooding between June and August. A total of 946,000 new displacements due to these disasters. The South Asian flood (2017) impacted 8 million people in Bangladesh   * A recent RMMRU study found Dhaka receives three out of every five (59.2%) migrants from rural areas, with one in five (20.1%) preferring the port city of Chittagong  * RMMRU surveyed 1,431 internal migrant households of 20 districts and found other urban destinations included Gazipur (2.9% of all migrants), Sylhet (1.9%), Khulna (1%), Mymensingh and Narayanganj (0.6% each), and Satkhira (0.4%). The remaining 13.2% of migrants were spread among the other districts and towns of the country Dhaka alone receives about 500,000 people each year The silver lining Bangladesh has the potential to be the biggest mover in the global gross domestic product rankings in 2030. According to the latest report of HSBC Global Research, the country is becoming the 26th largest economy in the world from 42nd now. However, such growth is tied up with the migrant workers' hard earned money and how the entire economy will be impacted by climate change and development-induced displacement and migration.  It is crucial to recognize that the government is the primary duty bearer to address the issue of migrants and refugees while the civil society organizations and movements can support in developing policy instruments to field level implementation. It is absolutely critical, while implementing the commitments, to recognize the differentiated vulnerability and struggle of women and children as migrant and refugees. Therefore, the government must develop a safeguard mechanism for the most vulnerable and marginalized. Furthermore, the government can also consider the following:  * At the policy level in Bangladesh, the government can adopt a \"people's safeguard policy\"   * Establish a national tracking mechanism for displaced and migrated people   * Establish a safety-net mechanism/fund for displaced and forcibly migrated people  For civil society organizations addressing such massive issues is a collective responsibility. Furthermore, CSOs can support the government's position on compensation from polluter countries. As the government is planning to develop 100 economic zones, support developing skills, and of local communities who can be employed within the zone, therefore, reduce displacement and migration.

She came under fire following the questionable arrest, incarceration, and torture of Dhaka Tribune journalist Ariful Islam by a mobile court raid she approved. A circular from the Ministry of Public Administration announcing Sultana's removal from the post and attachment to the ministry was issued on Monday. Another circular, issued on Monday, said Mohammad Rezaul Karim, deputy secretary of the ministry, will replace Sultana as the new Kurigram DC and district magistrate. The ministry has also withdrawn three executive magistrates from Kurigram connected to the incident, by issuing another circular. The officials are - Senior Assistant Commissioner Nazim Uddin, and assistant commissioners Rintu Bikash Chakma, and SM Rahatul Islam of Kurigram. All three orders were effective immediately, said the circulars. Meanwhile, State Minister for Public Administration, Farhad Hossain, told Dhaka Tribune: \"There are allegations against them [the four commissioners] and they have been made officers on special duty [OSD]. \"We will initiate divisional inquiry, and punitive action will be taken against them if they are found guilty after investigation,\" he added. However, the High Court on Monday asked state lawyer, Deputy Attorney General Debashis Bhattacharyya, to collect and submit all documents related to Ariful's conviction and bail by March 23. The bench of Justice Md Ashraful Kamal and Justice Sardar Md Rashed Jahangir issued the order on Monday. Supreme Court Bar Association President, advocate AM Amin Uddin, and advocate Ishrat Hasan with Barrister Syed Sayedul Haque Suman, stood for the writ. During the hearing, the court made a comment stating that a single person does not represent the whole country. The state will not take responsibility for someone's mistake. On Sunday, the High Court ordered the state to submit before it a copy of the conviction and one-year imprisonment sentence of the journalist, issued by a mobile court. During the hearing, the bench also asked the state to respond to some questions over the mobile court's judgment. Responding to a question about whether the drive was conducted by a mobile court or a special taskforce, the state lawyer informed the court that it was a special taskforce and there were 13 people including six from police, five from Ansar battalion, one from the department of narcotics, and one executive magistrate. The drive was conducted around 11:45pm of March 13, 2020, and they found 450ml of local liquor and 100gm of cannabis, with a price of approximately TK150 and Tk1,000 respectively, the DAG informed the court. The DAG told the court that everything was done by law. Advocate Amin Uddin said to the court that a mobile court cannot hand out punishment this way. Mobile courts are appreciated and operations of all mobile courts are not being questioned, he said. Drawing an example of an abuse of power, he said a mobile court had punished a teacher earlier by asking him to \"perform squats holding his ears\" at an examination hall for using a mobile phone. Over the Kurigram incident, the lawyer mentioned that this too was an abuse of power. The way the mobile court operated has proven a mala fide intent. \"One can hand out punishment if a journalist commits an offence, but not in this way.\" The senior lawyer also appraised the role of the media in the country. The court asked the lawyer to bring in journalist Ariful as petitioner if possible and told the state lawyer that there is a gray area regarding how bail was granted to the journalist. Earlier on Sunday, advocate Ishrat Hasan filed the petition on behalf of online news portal Bangla Tribune's Executive Editor, Harun-Ur-Rashid. On March 14, Ariful Islam, Kurigram district correspondent of Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune , was sent to one-year in jail, soon after the mobile court, set up at the Kurigram DC's office, ended the trial proceedings. The mobile court in the dead of night jailed the journalist for a year, after law enforcement led by magistrates picked him up from his home in Kurigram town. The mobile court brought an allegation against the journalist that drugs and alcohol were recovered from his possession, which his family termed absurd. DC's comments contradictory with documents The Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sultana Parvin on March 14 told Dhaka Tribune that a task force was set up to apprehend the journalist as a routine drive against narcotics.  However, her comments in the documents, placed before the court by the state lawyer, contradict that statement. In the witness record, one of the witnesses, Md Arif, stated that Ariful was apprehended by mobile court and the task force while he was drinking liquor and smoking cannabis. Meanwhile countrywide processions were organized by journalists and civil society to seek justice and protest the abuse of power and torture of journalists. They were held in Comilla, Khulna, Natore, Nilphamari, Jhalakati, Joypurhat, Naogaon, Narsingdi, Thakurgaon, Rangpur, Netrokona, Sirajganj and Tangail, according to our correspondents. Our district correspondents Masud Alam, Comilla, Hedait Hossain Molla, Khulna, contributed to this report."

He resigned from his post to contest the mayoral polls. In his manifesto for this election, Taposh unveiled plans to turn Dhaka south into a tourist destination, including making the old central jail into an amusement park. \"If elected, I will construct museums and art galleries in collaboration with everyone and revive both Old Dhaka and the city,\" Taposh had said, appealing to cultural elites. Some roads will be dedicated for fast vehicles, some for medium-speed vehicles and some for pedestrians only, he had said. There will be roads for fire trucks and the city corporation will have its own team of firefighters, he pledged. He also promised enough women's hostels equipped with round-the-clock helplines and an app for service seekers. In a welcomed pledge, he said, \"We will not allow any service providing organisation to dig up a road until three years after it was repaired.\" He said the footpaths would be free from hawkers and illegal occupants. He also promised not to raise holding taxes and said proper management could generate revenues for the DSCC.  "

He said both the countries need to expedite harmonization the data of water flow of the rivers so that water sharing can be finalized as early as possible. Shringla made the statement while addressing a seminar on Bangladesh-India relations as the keynote speaker at a Dhaka hotel on Monday, reports BSS. Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) and Indian High Commission in Dhaka jointly organized the seminar titled \"Bangladesh and India: A Promising Future.\" The Indian foreign secretary, however, appeared to be uncertain about the deal on Teesta River saying an agreement on water sharing of this particular stream could only be finalized on the basis of consensus of all the stakeholders, an apparent reference to India's West Bengal state. Prime Minister's International Affairs Adviser Dr Gowher Rizvi attended the program as the chief guest. Shringla, who previously served as Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka, however, said the Indian side was working on concluding the process of the agreement as early as possible. \"We know this is an emotive issue on both side of the border but there is no diminution of the commitment of our government,\" he told the seminar. In August last, Bangladesh and Indian agreed on preparing a framework on interim water-sharing agreements on seven rivers -- Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla, Feni and Dudhkumar. Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Riva Ganguly Das and BIISS Chairman Fazlul Karim also spoke at the program, among others. The Indian foreign secretary said India and Bangladesh recognize there is ample room for progress on each of the rivers that both the neighbours share while serious dialogue has resumed between the officials responsible for water sharing matter since August 2019. \"Let me assure our friends here that we remain committed to finding the best possible solutions to sharing scarcities and hardships fairly during the dry season,\" he said. He said good arrangements to share waters of the 54 transboundary rivers in fair and environmentally sustainable manner lies in broader national interests of the two nations. India sees no NRC, CAA impact The visiting Indian secretary said the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will have no impact on Bangladesh, reports UNB. \"These are purely internal to India,\" Shringla said. \"Let me clearly state here what our leadership has repeatedly confirmed at the highest level to the government of Bangladesh: this is a process that is entirely internal to India. Therefore, there'll be no implications for the government and the people of Bangladesh. You've our assurance on that count,\" he explained. Modi's visit India's top foreign ministry bureaucrat said Narendra Modi's Dhaka visit later this month would fully exemplify \"India's strong sentiment of goodwill, trust and respect for Bangladesh\". Indian Prime Minister Modi has been specially invited to participate in the inaugural ceremony of Mujib Year later this month. \"We are looking forward to this visit ... because Bangabandhu is just so iconic - as a globally-recognized statesman and iconic symbol of liberation for Bangladesh and for our subcontinent,\" he said. In India, he said: \"There is a special resonance to his name. He is as revered and as remembered in India, as he is here in Bangladesh.\" Rohingya issue The Indian foreign secretary said there is also often interest and sometimes \"uninformed speculation\" about their position on the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine State of Myanmar, and its impact upon Bangladesh. \"Let me clearly say that India is deeply appreciative of the spirit of humanism that motivated Bangladesh to offer shelter to nearly one million displaced people. And we fully recognize and sympathize with the enormous burden that you're facing. \"As the only country that's an actual neighbour of both Bangladesh and Myanmar, we're committed to offering the fullest support for any mutually-acceptable solution that'll enable the earliest possible return of displaced persons to their homes in Rakhine State and to a life of dignity,\" he said adding that this should be done in a manner that is \"safe, secure and sustainable\". Border killing Responding a question why border killings still took place after both border guards agreed to use non-lethal weapons the Indian foreign secretary attributed the incidents to cross-border criminal activities.  He claimed that the casualty figures of Indians was equal to that of Bangladeshis but acknowledged that the border killing issue was consistently coming up in Bangladesh-India relationship. \"It is the responsibility of border forces on both sides to ensure that the border is respected and the place is kept safe stopping criminal activities,\" Shringla said adding that \"every death on the border was something that was a problematic issue. Shringla suggested improving security, creating zero criminal activities, more cooperation, more joint patrolling and common border management plan, and bringing deaths zero level along the frontier. Trade issues Shringla said they are also working more closely to simplify and expand trade as easier and simpler trading systems offer them scope to generate wealth and create jobs on both sides. He said there is enormous untapped potential for businesses to establish footholds in each other's market. \"And we, as governments, must make extra efforts facilitate our businesspersons and entrepreneurs doing business in each other's country.\" Shringla arrived in Dhaka on a two-day visit on Monday morning and upon arrival at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, he was received by his Bangladesh counterpart Masud Bin Momen."

The press release, issued on Wednesday, instructs members of all Chhatra League units, nationwide, to help farmers with their harvest. These directives came amid protests by farmers--in villages, towns, districts, and Dhaka--as the farmers are facing great losses due to the very low price of paddy. Some farmers set fire to their harvests as they could not afford day laborers to  cut the paddy  -as this year's paddy price is the lowest of the last three years. Over the past three weeks, a bountiful harvest has been overshadowed by the grief of rice farmers throughout Bangladesh. Farmers are demanding purchases be made directly from farms, and that crops be sold at a fair price. Currently, paddy is sold wholesale at Tk450 to Tk500 for every maund (1 maund=40kg). Many farmers have said the cost of harvesting each maund of paddy is between Tk1,000 to Tk1,500. Other reports say that farmers will suffer a loss of at least Tk300 per maund if they sell paddy at the current market price."

''It is an aberration of nature in which 25 million people have lost their homes, and communications networks disrupted totally.''\n''Bangladesh will need about three million tons of additional food grains on top of what is already committed as regular assistance,'' he said, ''to feed nearly half of the country's population for four months before the next crop is expected.''\nMore than 50 people died today, putting the death toll above 500, officials said. Some unofficial estimates put the toll at more than 1,200, but the collapse of communications has made it virtually impossible to get an authoritative assessment. Mr. Chowdhury said there was no sign of any easing of the flooding crisis, adding: ''All major rivers are flowing above danger marks. The human misery and suffering are unbearable.''\nFloods engulfed more than half of the capital, drenching the homes of a third of the city's six million residents.\nOfficials said earlier that thousands of families huddling on river embankments or clinging to their submerged houses could starve to death unless supplies reached them soon. An estimated 10 million people faced starvation or death from poisonous snakes and disease, they added.\nBangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, has so far received promises of more than $600,000 worth of rice and cash from Pakistan, the United States and Australia. Britain has pledged $800,000 in immediate relief."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-22 00:00:00      \nWe must remain united in tackling the coronavirus The Covid-19 is wreaking havoc on the world. Bangladesh is yet to be hit hard, but if the rest of the world provides any indication, the threat of the coronavirus is serious, real, and exponential.  And an exponential crisis deserves an exponential response. The number of calls coming into the national information hotline 333 and Shastho Batayon 16263 has gone up tenfold in the last few days, crossing 100,00 per day. How do we handle such volume with a few call centre agents and a few doctors who used to handle these calls? Enter an uber-doctor model where the calls will be routed to hundreds of doctors who have registered their availability to take calls. This will not only calm a lot of panicked callers but also will reduce pressure on our healthcare system. This is the beginning of Bangladesh's exponential response to dealing with the coronavirus challenge. As calamitous as coronavirus is, it is forcing us to rethink how we live, work, and learn. Beyond the imminent healthcare challenge, as we face the possibility of small and large lockdowns -- both self-imposed and state-imposed -- for indefinite periods of time, like many megacities and advanced countries are going through now, citizens are asking important questions. How do my children continue their education during the outbreak? How does food get transported to cities? How do medicines get delivered across the country? How do we make payments for goods and services? How do we make goods? Bangladesh's quest for digitization is well-documented. It has been a cornerstone of the government's transformation drive since 2009, and remarkable achievements have been made. Sometimes, breaking the status quo, and bringing true change, requires a crisis. While this crisis may not be in any way welcome, it forces us to adopt an alternative, often at breakneck efficiency. Innovations during World War II occurred at an astonishing pace for the two opposing sides. With the added competition, the need to rebuild and retaliate brought out incredible innovations such as nuclear power, penicillin, jet engines, radar, and the first computer. All these have changed our lives for the better. The coronavirus threat is accelerating our adoption of a digital lifestyle. It is also greatly increasing the speed with which certain initiatives are getting done. The coronavirus has naturally increased the necessity to have trained medical professionals to test and combat it. As I write this, there are 2,000 doctors who are being certified to fight the coronavirus using the government's e-learning platform MuktoPaath. Under normal circumstances, this would have taken weeks of correspondence, the formation of committees to approve content, delivery of most of the content through old-style physical classrooms, and procurement of a fraction of the content in audiovisual format for e-learning. A process spanning 9-12 months. Optimistically! Compare that with the two days that it took in the time of coronavirus. All digital with no cost to the exchequer. Simultaneously, the government's information 333 hotline was made \"corona-ready\" in one day and is now being used as a mass initial triage tool for high-risk cases. Call the number, and you immediately get asked a series of questions about whether you are high risk or not. This has been possible for two reasons. One, we are using tools and technologies that already exist by just integrating and repurposing them. Two, all types of public agencies, private companies, civil society organizations, academia, startups, student groups have come together to fight together.  Bangladesh is probably unique in the way a crisis unites the entire society. It happened in 1971 and it happens during every flood and every Rana Plaza-like incident. Over 30 healthcare organizations have immediately responded to the government's call to action to find healthcare response. Tens of education companies are working with the government to scale up e-learning. Over 50 innovative logistics and e-commerce companies are coming up with how food, medicines, and other necessities will move across the country.  The telecom industry is doing its part by working very closely with the government to identify high-risk cases. Suddenly, Bangladesh, a country notorious for its lack of speed and initiative, is being forced to be effective and efficient, and each sector is working parallelly to fight the coronavirus. On March 20, the country saw its first digital press conference. In an unprecedented event, 100 participants including tens of journalists came together, not physically, but over video conference, with the session conducted by the ICT Minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak. Certainly a model in the time of social distancing. All of these initiatives are being made possible because of the great leaps Bangladesh has made in digitization, where the technological and human building blocks -- much like those of a child's lego set -- are coming together to create an avalanche effect.  I am confident that this avalanche effect will continue to grow, and Bangladesh will successfully navigate the threat of the coronavirus and come away as a better, more impactful nation.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-08 00:00:00      \nAt the end of the Cold War, political scientist Francis Fukuyama wrote a celebrated essay called \"The End of History?\" Communism's collapse, he argued, would clear the last obstacle separating the entire world from its destiny of liberal democracy and market economies. Many people agreed. Today, as we face a retreat from the rules-based, liberal global order, with autocratic rulers and demagogues leading countries that contain well over half the world's population, Fukuyama's idea seems quaint and naive. But it reinforced the neoliberal economic doctrine that has prevailed for the last 40 years. The credibility of neoliberalism's faith in unfettered markets as the surest road to shared prosperity is on life-support these days. And well it should be. The simultaneous waning of confidence in neoliberalism and in democracy is no coincidence or mere correlation. Neoliberalism has undermined democracy for 40 years. The form of globalisation prescribed by neoliberalism left individuals and entire societies unable to control an important part of their own destiny, as Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has explained so clearly, and as I argue in my recent books \"Globalisation and Its Discontents Revisited\" and \"People, Power, and Profits\". The effects of capital-market liberalisation were particularly odious: If a leading presidential candidate in an emerging market lost favour with Wall Street, the banks would pull their money out of the country. Voters then faced a stark choice: Give in to Wall Street or face a severe financial crisis. It was as if Wall Street had more political power than the country's citizens. Even in rich countries, ordinary citizens were told, \"You can't pursue the policies you want\"--whether adequate social protection, decent wages, progressive taxation, or a well-regulated financial system--\"because the country will lose competitiveness, jobs will disappear, and you will suffer.\" In rich and poor countries alike, elites promised that neoliberal policies would lead to faster economic growth, and that the benefits would trickle down so that everyone, including the poorest, would be better off. To get there, though, workers would have to accept lower wages, and all citizens would have to accept cutbacks in important government programmes. The elites claimed that their promises were based on scientific economic models and \"evidence-based research\". Well, after 40 years, the numbers are in: growth has slowed, and the fruits of that growth went overwhelmingly to a very few at the top. As wages stagnated and the stock market soared, income and wealth flowed up, rather than trickling down. How can wage restraint--to attain or maintain competitiveness--and reduced government programmes possibly add up to higher standards of living? Ordinary citizens felt like they had been sold a bill of goods. They were right to feel conned. We are now experiencing the political consequences of this grand deception: distrust of the elites, of the economic \"science\" on which neoliberalism was based, and of the money-corrupted political system that made it all possible. The reality is that, despite its name, the era of neoliberalism was far from liberal. It imposed an intellectual orthodoxy whose guardians were utterly intolerant of dissent. Economists with heterodox views were treated as heretics to be shunned, or at best shunted off to a few isolated institutions. Neoliberalism bore little resemblance to the \"open society\" that Karl Popper had advocated. As George Soros has emphasised, Popper recognised that our society is a complex, ever-evolving system in which the more we learn, the more our knowledge changes the behaviour of the system. Nowhere was this intolerance greater than in macroeconomics, where the prevailing models ruled out the possibility of a crisis like the one we experienced in 2008. When the impossible happened, it was treated as if it were a 500-year flood--a freak occurrence that no model could have predicted. Even today, advocates of these theories refuse to accept that their belief in self-regulating markets and their dismissal of externalities as either non-existent or unimportant led to the deregulation that was pivotal in fuelling the crisis. The theory continues to survive, with Ptolemaic attempts to make it fit the facts, which attests to the reality that bad ideas, once established, often have a slow death. If the 2008 financial crisis failed to make us realise that unfettered markets don't work, the climate crisis certainly should: neoliberalism will literally bring an end to our civilisation. But it is also clear that demagogues who would have us turn our back on science and tolerance will only make matters worse. The only way forward, the only way to save our planet and our civilisation, is a rebirth of history. We must revitalise the Enlightenment and recommit to honouring its values of freedom, respect for knowledge, and democracy.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-30 00:00:00      \nOn March 25, listening to a briefing on the then available latest global statistics about the COVID-19, I learnt that the global total of recorded cases was then a little over 400,000, spread across over 169 countries. Of these, the first 100,000 cases had taken 67 days, the second 100,000 about 11 days, the third 100,000 about 4 days, and the last 100,000 less than 4 days. We were told in no uncertain terms that this was the first great pandemic, of truly global proportions in a hundred years, after the so-called \"Spanish flu\" of 1918-20, (which had afflicted over 500 million people or a quarter of the world's population at that time, and inflicted a death toll of between 17-50 million). The entire world today is in a dire economic situation, a global recession worse than the recession of 2009 is inevitable, only this time it would be somewhat different in nature: there would be a very big hit on the services sector, in which there are typically no rebounds; supply chains are standing fractured or not available any longer; there would be a very likely rise in food prices because of severe disruptions to the logistical or other chains on which assured availability of food depends; social safety measures would prove woefully inadequate; and domestic and external shocks would reinforce each other, perhaps exponentially. Three days later, on March 28, 2020, the number of globally recorded cases was nearly 600,000 with the numbers increasing steadily by the hour. In other words, the number jumped from 400,000 to 600,000 in about 3 days. Of these, currently infected patients number over 436,000, of whom over 23,000 are in serious or critical condition. The United States has now surpassed Italy (and China) with the highest number of cases (over 104,000). Mr Trump can now boast of presiding over the new epicentre of this pandemic. I am willing to bet that by the time this article is published all the numbers will be higher. This situation will get worse, given the now well-established trajectory globally. While experts everywhere, from different nationalities and different disciplines in science, are near unanimous in agreeing that the crisis will become worse, much worse, and all countries (including the United States), are either woefully inadequately prepared or ill equipped, or both. Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly reached out to President Trump and offered help in sharing knowledge (gleaned from its own experience) and equipment to tackle the critical situation. However, because of stonewalling and sheer cussedness on the part of some, the G-20 virtual summit ended in a fiasco. Mr Trump kept insisting on publicly labelling this disease as the \"Chinese virus/Wuhan virus\", to which the Chinese objected with injured ego. Mr Trump would do well to delve into some history of his own country, and recall that the so-called \"Spanish flu\" of 1918 is now thought by many as actually having originated in an obscure farming community in Haskell county in Kansas, USA where a farm worker caught the infection from a pig, and then carried it to Spain where it ballooned among an unsuspecting population from where it travelled to the World War-I theatre (in which Spain, ironically, was not a protagonist), and then travelled back to the United States, in two successive waves, from Summer, to Fall and then Winter. The Spanish flu should therefore be correctly renamed today as the American flu of 1918. Perhaps this will satisfy the respective egocentricism of the respective world leadership today, who should instead buckle down to addressing the crisis and putting in place institutional arrangement to deal with the current pandemic, and its resultant fallouts on food and employment security and ensure that more such pandemics do not recur. We should assume that more such unexpected pandemics will very likely occur, because there are countless strains of coronavirus among other animals, birds and reptilian species than we know of, and with spaces of separation between species and homo sapiens ever shrinking (or basic principles of ecological equilibrium having been ignored and shattered), the intervals between such pandemics could well also dwindle, alarmingly. Pandemics jump over time and space, across peoples, countries and cultures, ballooning exponentially. Despite all indications to the contrary, people worldwide took the onset of the current pandemic complacently, almost smugly, holidaying on beaches when governments advised them to go into social distancing and self-isolation. When Saudi Arabia and some Gulf states advised their nationals that they should abjure from going to mosques and instead remember God and offer their prayers in the isolation of their respective homes, we have had examples of people in some of the most densely populated Muslim countries (including in Bangladesh and Indonesia) congregating in very large numbers for congregational prayers or \"waz mahfil\" sessions (in which there could have already been some infected people, but quite unaware of their being so). In Malaysia, one such event resulted in notable community transmission of the disease.   In Bangladesh, the officially announced total number of cases today is 48, with 5 fatalities. The official statistics does not necessarily reflect the accurate statistics, because of the very tiny number of the population having been tested, even among the several thousand returnees from China, Europe or elsewhere who were allowed to go home on condition of \"self-isolation\" which was merrily (and most irresponsibly) largely not observed. The Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) announced its detection two days ago of the first community transmission of the disease. I await with considerable trepidation to what the figures will exponentially translate into in, 7 days, 14 days or 21 days from today.   In my last missive on the subject published in this newspaper a week ago (\"Implications of coronavirus for regional and global cooperation\", The Daily Star, March 22, 2020) I had advocated that we needed to shift our focus away from viewing our security within the traditional paradigm only, but consider our overall security as contextually nested in what I describe as ecological security that includes a host of non-traditional causes all of which would at some stage, sooner or later, translate into a traditional security threat as understood conventionally. Ecological and non-traditional security may be defined as maintaining a dynamic equilibrium not only among human societies (friction among whom used to be the traditional source of conflict) but equally, if not far more importantly, between humans and nature, humans and other species and humans and pathogens. Any disruption to this dynamic equilibrium between any two or more component sets of actors or factors integral to this equilibrium would translate into a disturbing, risk-fraught disequilibrium endangering all. Man, as the dominant species with a steadily burgeoning population, has a greater ability today than ever earlier to affect how this equilibrium is maintained. Changes in the complex intertwined relationship between man, nature and other species can be destabilised by changes in nature or in human behaviour. As resources needed by man for his sustenance and development steadily dwindle, fierce competition has already increased among peoples for control over decreasing resources that sustain human societies. In this struggle for control, non-state actors have increasingly emerged as posing by far the greater threat to societal security than conventional military threats by other state actors. Maintaining ecological equilibrium in any given geo-space has, therefore, emerged as increasingly integral to not only ensuring the overall wellbeing of the peoples who inhabit that space, but to ensuring their continuing security, traditional and non-traditional. But this requires exponentially increased cooperation and collaboration between states. Most of the NTS threats need a well-thought out systemic and institutionalised response, in a pan-Westphalian context. I have earlier advocated for establishment of a regional Authority called South Asian Regional Ecological and Environmental Authority (SAREESA), which would have several sectoral bodies under it to address different NTS threats, one of which would be addressing pandemics. Now that we are wading ever deeper into, and increasingly floundering in, a pandemic and we are assured by experts that more such pandemics are very likely to afflict us unless we think in anticipatory mode, and not just to address pandemics--who is to say that some natural cataclysm like another great tsunami, or a mega volcanic eruption or a mega earthquake is not likely to occur anytime soon? I for one, would wish governments and peoples to be prepared for such unpredictable scenarios, however unlikely they might appear to be at cursory glance now. Such an organisation would be an authoritative umbrella body (rather than a toothless association or \"club\") with the mandate and authority to enforce adherence to its collective decisions. It should be headed by a ministerial-level Governing Council, that should meet periodically, at least once a year, by rotation in each member-country's capital. Decisions should be arrived at by a simple-majority consensus. Decisions once taken, are mandatorily binding on every member state. Its decisions are like laws passed by the national parliaments, but where the decisions are in conflict with national laws, they over-ride the latter. The body will derive its funding through mandatory contributions from each of its member states, the amount proportional to its population but weighted by its GDP. Where necessary, it may dictate levying of taxes on income according to income slabs to meet sudden emergencies. For wildcard events, (like the current COVID-19 pandemic) it will maintain an emergency fund of a predetermined amount raised through taxes as well as central funding. Money for this fund is to be raised through levying taxes on specific/related activities, like travel, entertainment, retail sales, etc. While the amount of the levy would be relatively very small, since it is collected on a daily basis from a wide swath of the population across the entire region, cumulatively it would translate into a considerable amount which would be sufficient to cope with an extraordinary emergency in its immediate aftermath. This umbrella body will have at least six sectoral cells to deal with food security, water security, energy security, employment security, health security, and environmental security, respectively. For the moment, let me present only three of these sectoral cells: wildcard events, health security and food security--these are the specific areas where I foresee immediate problems likely to confront us all in the wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic. At the first signs of an event occurring (like current pandemic, or a major tsunami, flood, drought, earthquake or volcanic eruption), it would trigger off a regional warning system that keeps vulnerable populations informed and evacuates endangered populations where deemed necessary. It also activates across the region emergency related services to go into standby mode to cope with health and food security. Ensuring health security With global and regional movements of people and all sorts of goods, including flora and fauna, and particularly microbial or viral passengers having become easier with the communication revolution and induction of super jumbo aircraft, ensuring regional health has become a greater challenge than ever. The contemplated authority's mandate would include regional health management issues linked particularly to communicable diseases (cholera or other diarrheal diseases, typhoid, etc.) that may escalate into epidemics or pandemics. For the purpose, it maintains a central information system of networking that links all national/or designated hospitals to a regional information centre. It monitors the instances of communicable diseases that are known to spread easily, and tracks movements of such diseases if they occur. The centre also maintains a regional health registry, where it stores and updates on a continuing basis, data from its network of hospitals across the region, information on supplies of protective gear for medical personnel and patients, testing kit and life support equipment. Certain industries may be designated and tasked with being geared to produce such kits/equipment/gear on an emergency basis to cater to national and regional emergencies, as well as to replenish stock. It will also monitor animal diseases linked to poultry and livestock on a similar basis and will exercise the authority to impose very strict quarantine regulations in order to forestall spread of man or animal borne diseases across borders. Ensuring food security The authority will require each member state to maintain a minimum reserve of food grains stock (rice, wheat or maize, etc.) sufficient to meet consumption requirements of its nationals for four months, at any given time. This is to meet national emergencies within its own domestic jurisdiction. The cost of this buffer stock is met from the domestic national budget of each member state. Additionally, a pre-determined quantum of food grains, pulses, powdered milk, bottled water, salt and sugar is also stored along centrally designated locations, (close to airports/railway stations/ports) and along the borders with adjacent countries for fast movement to disaster areas in times of extraordinary trans-boundary emergencies. Both categories of the above reserve stocks will have specifically designated shelf lives. These items will be put on the market at least two months before expiry of such shelf life but also be replenished simultaneously with new stock with new shelf lives. The cost of these emergency buffer stocks will be raised through a system of food security tax/levy raised monthly at a rate not less than a minimum percentage of an individual's regular income (say a monetary unit per person irrespective of par value of that unit vis-a-vis the strongest unit in the region). This principle of compulsory contribution will instil a sense of value and participatory ownership that raises the importance of this scheme in the public perception. In case of a disaster outside the region (another region located near or far away, in the same or another continent), individual countries will be required to contribute in aid to the afflicted outsider region from its own domestic reserve, provided it has the capability or a viable plan for replenishment of its own stock in a timely manner. Similar contribution may be made from the regional reserves mentioned above also, provided replenishment is lined up within a reasonable timeframe. The regional authority should be able to requisition multi-modal transportation vehicles (marine, air, riverine or road) from any or all of its member-states' civil and military resources. For this purpose, it can maintain a database of all such available transportation, listing what is available and where at any given time. And for this, the national civil and military bureaucracies will be required to update a centralised database on a regular, continuous and real-time basis. While most ideally, we need to have a regional body for such an unprecedented emergency, (and I had hoped in my last article that this crisis would have impelled us to move towards such a dynamics), if that does not happen, Bangladesh should take the lead in instituting measures envisaged above on a national basis and set an example of good governance that might nudge others to emulate. As Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore famously exhorted: \"if no one heeds your call, walk alone\". Sooner or later, others will be compelled to join, inspired by the example you set.

      "text": "TV Review; 'Politics of Food,' on Channel 13\n1988-01-06T05:00:00.000Z\n''THE Politics of Food'' examines worldwide hunger and finds it's the fault of the West. Western creditors and governments, particularly the United States, have joined to choke off world food supplies. The two-hour documentary, on Channel 13 at 10 o'clock tonight, is provocative, but it doesn't have much breadth.\nThe documentary - produced by an international consortium headed by Britain's Yorkshire Television, and narrated by Martin Sheen -visits Minnesota, Brazil, the Sudan, Bangladesh and India. Dispossessed farmers in Minnesota, it finds, have conterparts in the third world; they are all burdened by debt, manipulated by creditors and forced off the land by big business.\nConsequently, much of the world goes hungry, even though there is ample food. The world distribution process, the documentary says, is faulty. Grain and other surpluses pile up in the West, while millions of people starve to death or suffer from malnutrition.\nThe documentary is persuasive about this. How could it not be? The West does indeed have food surpluses, and much of the world does starve. Why does this happen? The documentary suggests that a principal villain is the World Bank, which forces debtor nations to grow cash crops, rather than food that will feed their people.\nNonetheless, the documentary does seem a shade simplistic. Revolutions and wars, one thinks, have done at least as much to disrupt third-world food supplies as bureaucrats in Washington or on Wall Street. At the same time, ''The Politics of Food'' is ambivalent about centralized economies. Are they good or bad? The documentary wants it both ways.\nThus it pleads for family farmers the world over; it argues for rural economies, where governments and banks stay off the farmers' backs. That's decentralization. On the other hand, the only bright spot the documentary seems able to find is a region in India that makes grants to the poor, practices land reform and regulates food prices. That's not decentralization.\nOn television, however, the region is prettily filmed. Mr. Sheen says the inhabitants even elect Communists to office, and that the system is such that ''everything is shared more equally.'' Well, perhaps, but surely world hunger is more complicated than that.\nThe documentary concludes with a warning about ''antidemocratic structures.'' It says they ''are the main cause of hunger.'' That's sufficiently vague to include many things, but whatever they are, they all have their roots in the West. ''The Politics of Food'' is interesting, but it never looks beyond its own horizon."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-14 00:00:00      \nForeign critics of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan deride him as a quasi-dictatorial megalomaniac. But Erdogan--who was Turkey's prime minister for 11 years before being elected president in 2014--is now a reckless gambler, too. In short order, Turkey will send troops to Libya at the request of the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), which has been besieged in Tripoli for the last eight months by the advancing forces of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). This will be a military and diplomatic folly. Erdogan already has the distressing example of the Syrian conflict on Turkey's own doorstep. Does he really imagine that sending a few hundred--or even many thousand--Turkish troops to aid the beleaguered GNA will somehow resolve Libya's tragic and bloody turmoil, itself the result of the 2011 intervention by foreign powers that toppled Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime? If Erdogan expects either a GNA victory or an imminent peace settlement, he is deluding himself. Haftar's well-equipped LNA has the support of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and (at least covertly) France. With mercenaries from Russia and Sudan on his side, Haftar must feel rather more optimistic than Fayez al-Sarraj, the GNA's prime minister. Support for the GNA from Turkey and Qatar, along with the fig leaf of UN recognition, weighs rather less in the military balance. So, what explains Turkey's entry into Libya's dreadful conflict as yet another proxy warrior? One factor, often baffling to outsiders, is the ideological and political influence throughout the Middle East--or at least its Sunni Muslim parts--of the Muslim Brotherhood. Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Brotherhood favours a transition (peaceful, it has always maintained) to theocratic government. As its slogan proclaims, \"Islam is the solution.\" That is a problem for the ruling families of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain, all of which regard the Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation seeking to undermine their power. So, too, does the oppressive Egyptian regime led by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who mounted the 2013 military coup that ended the Brotherhood's disastrous year governing the Arab world's most populous country. Only Turkey--specifically, Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP)--and tiny Qatar (very much at odds with neighbouring Saudi Arabia) view the Brotherhood with enthusiasm rather than alarm. On the almost frivolous premise that my enemy's enemy is my friend, the fact that Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt support Haftar is excuse enough for Turkey and Qatar to support Sarraj and the GNA. The bigger reason for Erdogan's adventurism in Libya, though, is that it fits his desire for Turkey to play a determining role in its region for the first time since the demise of the Ottoman empire (of which Libya was once a part). On the surface, that ambition sounds reasonable enough. Turkey has a population of more than 80 million, the second-largest military in NATO, and a relatively developed economy. It deserves to be treated with respect--which is why the European Union's obvious reluctance to advance the country's membership bid is a blow to Turkish pride. But Turkey's pursuit of its regional leadership ambition has come at a high cost. When the AKP came to power in Turkey almost two decades ago, Erdogan's mentor was Ahmet Davutoglu, an academic who then became foreign minister and eventually prime minister. Davutoglu was keen to expand Turkey's influence abroad, but under the slogan \"zero problems with our neighbours.\" How ironic, then, that Erdogan has created problems with almost all of his neighbours. The EU cannot accept Turkey's appalling record on human rights, especially following the military's failed coup attempt of 2016. Israel cannot abide Turkey's support for Hamas (which is aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood) in Gaza. And virtually everyone is exasperated by Turkey's policy in Syria, which features attacking the Kurds--the most effective fighters against the Islamic State--and ambivalence towards several jihadist groups. Significantly, Davutoglu has broken with Erdogan and formed a rival political party. True, Erdogan's supporters can justifiably argue that Turkey has become a regional player to be reckoned with. The EU has to be financially generous, or else Turkey may let hundreds of thousands of Syrian and other refugees from war and poverty flood into Europe. Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, recognise that a settlement of the Syrian conflict will depend on Turkey's acquiescence--hence the continuing three-party peace process that began three years ago in Astana, Kazakhstan. Even the United States under President Donald Trump has had to eat a slice of humble pie: Turkey, regardless of NATO sensitivities and American economic threats, stands by its decision to buy a Russian air-defence system. But the Libyan venture may be a step too far. On December 5, the Turkish parliament ratified an agreement between Erdogan and Sarraj that sets a maritime border between their two countries. The Turkish-Libyan deal ignores international law--as the EU, Cyprus, Greece, and Egypt have pointed out. It also ignores geography, because the Greek island of Crete lies halfway between the two countries. And it threatens the January 2019 agreement between Egypt, Israel, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority to exploit the gas reserves of the eastern Mediterranean. Erdogan is the epitome of today's strongman political leader. But by the time his Libyan gamble sours, as it inevitably will, he will have run out of both luck and friends.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-14 00:00:00      \nLocal farmers are worried about their yield as adverse weather conditions are threatening their crops   Farmers of Moulvibazar's Hakaluki, Kauadighi, and Hail haors, along with other haors, have started harvesting their Boro paddies--ahead of schedule--due to adverse weather conditions and heavy rain. Whenever thy sky turns black with thick clouds, the hearts of the local farmers fill with fear, and panic strikes among them, as they worry about whether they will be able to collect this year's harvest without losing some to unfavorable weather conditions. According to the Moulvibazar Agriculture Extension Department, farmers cultivated Boro paddy on 130,031 acres of land against the target 131,252 acres, in the whole district.  Expressing great worry, local farmers Selim Ahmad, Laikujjaman, and Kamruzzaman have already started harvesting as they fear that heavy rain and adverse weather conditions, will cause them extensive loses despite a bumper Boro yield in the area.  It has been observed that due to the heavy rain in the area, water levels of the local rivers and canals have risen to alarming heights. Hailstorms are also responsible for causing immense damage to the Boro yield of the district. Anfar Ali, Abdul Khaliq, Majnu Miah--all Boro paddy farmers from the Bhukshimoil union--told the reporter that they are fearing a flood this year, which could take away all of their yield and leave them empty-handed. \"We have started harvesting. Despite the pesticide attacks on our crops, we expected a good yield, but bad weather has forced us to worry a great deal about the harvest and profit.  \"We are very concerned\"  Commenting on the situation, Haor Bachao, Krishak Bachao, Krishi Bachao Sangram Parishad President Siraj Uddin Ahmed Badshah said: \"People of the haor region have been neglected for a very long time. The government has not implemented their promises to develop the haor areas.  He added: \"The government needs to come forward to save all the haors and rivers of the district, as well as the people living here, from the verge of destruction. Only then--along with natural resources here--the haor will live, agriculture will live, and the local farmers will be able to live.\" Kulaura Agriculture Officer Jagalul Haider said, \"The crop is good. Boro paddy harvesting began in a different way in the haor. Rice is rotten in many places. It will take another week for Boro. There is nothing to worry about. There will be some rain during Chaitra and Boishakh.\" Addressing the issue Moulvibazar Agriculture Extension Department Deputy Director Mohammad Shahjahan told Dhaka Tribune: \"The amount of rainfall in area till now has caused no damage to Boro paddy cultivation in the district. \"Farmers in Hakaluka have already started harvesting their crops. I hope the farmers will be able to collect their harvest without any interruption.  Responding to a question about farmers harvesting their crops ahead of schedule due to the fear of rain and adverse weather conditions, he said: \"Why would the farmers harvest partially-ripened paddy? No-one does that.   \"According to the correct scientific methods, farmers should harvest their cultivation when 80% of their whole yield is ripe, but our farmers wait even longer.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-09 00:00:00      \nIf you go to Motijheel and look for the proverbial \"jheel\" the financial hub of the capital is named after, you will be disappointed.  But after putting in some effort and asking around, you will find a waterbody behind Bangladesh Water Development Board where ferrying service is still in operation. The waterbody (at present resembling a pond) stretches over an area of about one acre, and has two boat services -- benefitting hundreds of people who take the route. This \"pond\" is the last remaining vestige of the fabled jheel in the area which supposedly linked Buriganga and Shitalakhya rivers to Sengunbagicha, Arambagh and Gopibagh canals, said locals. Many used to commute to Motijheel using boats, they claimed. Gopibagh canal was turned into a road in the 1990s and most parts of the jheel were filled up around that time, says Jahangir Alam, a resident of Gopibagh. Buildings and roads were constructed on it (parts of the jheel), said a former Wasa official. As tragic as the death of the many waterbodies in the city is, many still use the pond that remains as a shortcut and save 10-15 minutes to go to Motijheel from Kamalapur, Gopibagh, Tikatuli and other adjoining areas. Fare is Tk 2 during peak hours, and Tk 5 after 9pm and in weekends. Enamul Haque, an official of Bangladesh Water Development Board, who was in a hurry to cross the pond on a Monday morning, said that in the morning even five minutes are crucial to office-goers. Logically, a huge number of them use the boat services to get to work within a short time. The route is so popular among office-goers that queues form at both ends of the waterbody during peak hours every workday, he said. Ripon Ali, a first-year student of Kamalapur Sher-e-Bangla Railway School and College, said every day he goes to school on foot and takes this shortcut on a boat. \"It takes only a couple of minutes to cross the waterbody. I can reach my school in 10-15 minutes,\" said Ripon, a resident of Tikatuli. \"It would cost Tk 30-40 if I take a rickshaw to school,\" said Ripon. Kholilur Rahman, a resident of Gopibagh, said there was a huge waterbody named \"Matimia'r Jheel\" in the area and several thousand boats would come to the gudaraghat (where people embark and disembark) every day from different areas like Demra, Nandipara, Isapur, Trimohoni and Razarbagh. The jheel was linked to rivers at that time, he said. \"We had taken relief materials on boats from here to Demra, Madartek and Bashabo during the 1998 flood,\" he added. Encroachers started filling up the waterbody in the 1990s, which sped up in the early 2000s, said locals. At present, some individuals are claiming ownership of the pond -- putting up signs -- though it is government khas land, they alleged. Heju Miah, a boatman at the ghat, said there are two boats on the small waterbody. Ferrying service starts very early in the morning and continues till 11pm. Ekhlamul Islam, a resident of Gopibagh, said though it is still a vital waterbody in the area, it remains neglected by the authorities concerned. The water of the pond looks polluted and a big part of it has been occupied, he said. Authorities should take immediate measures to beautify this area -- as done with Hatijheel -- as it is the last remaining waterbody in the heart of Motijheel, he urged.

      "text": "Misery Rises With Rivers In Bangladesh\n1988-09-06T05:00:00.000Z\nWad-ing through waist-deep water late last week in the Muhammadpur residential district of the capital, Iqbal Ahmed, his few belongings on his shoulder, headed for the school on the Mirpur Road, which was still unaffected by the devastating floods.\nA few hours later, Mr. Ahmed, 45 years old, waded back 300 yards from the school to his home at the refugee camp where he was forced by the flood, to pick up his ill 5-year-old daughter.\nAt first he could not find her. Then, Mr. Ahmed, groping in the flooded shack where he lives with his family, discovered her lying dead in a pool of water into which she apparently fell in her sleep. There was some solace: at least Mr. Ahmed was able to bury his daughter, while bodies of many flood victims in Bangladesh are being put on makeshift rafts - there not being enough dry space for burial.\nEmaciated, unfed and without sleep for 24 hours, Mr. Ahmed mumbled: ''What will I do now? I'll go mad.''\nSuch poignant uncertainty seems to have gripped much of this country as flood waters cover the land, leaving at least 550 people dead and 25 million homeless. And the toll could go much higher, officials fear. One-third of Bangladesh is reported to still be under water.\n''The situation is beyond any description, any definition,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman told reporters today.\nFlooding during the monsoon season is an annual event in this nation and is highly beneficial to agriculture. But the 1987 floods, which killed 1,600 people, were described as the worst in 70 years, and President H. M. Ershad has called this year's devastation ''far worse than last year's.''\nThe Brahmaputra and the Ganges, two of the major rivers in Bangladesh, a nation whose geography is delineated by rivers and deltas, had fallen since Sunday night, but the situation remained grave. Heavy rain fell again this afternoon, and the Dhaka weather bureau predicted that rain ''may continue intermittently, further swelling rivers already flowing above their danger levels.'' Prices Soar\nIn the capital, prices of such necessities as rice, cooking oil, salt and kerosene shot up anywhere from 30 percent to 200 percent. Kerosene to light lamps was in the shortest supply, with electricity cut off in most areas.\nMr. Rahman, the Information Minister, said today that 21 million homes had been washed away and that more than 30 million of the country's 110 million people were directly affected. He added that the actual losses will be known only after the water recedes.\nMr. Rahman said three more districts have been flooded, raising the number affected to 50 out of 64 districts in the country.\nCommunications in most areas affected remained disrupted or nonexistent, making it all but impossible to obtain food, medicine and other relief goods. Lack of pure drinking water is reported to have caused an outbreak of diarrhea and other stomach ailments. A senior Health Ministry official, Taslim Ahmed, said the number of people suffering from dysentery is also rising. The Matter of Starvation\nAlthough the Government denied that anyone had yet died of starvation, witnesses said a man died today at a relief center in the Kishalaya school, in the Zigatala district of the capital.\nOfficials said the United States, Britain, Japan, Australia, Canada, India, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia have responded to the Government's appeal for help.\nThe devastation has forced the authorities to abandon their efforts to rescue an estimated two million people marooned in remote areas. They are inaccessible because of the lack of small boats.\nRoad and rail communication in the flooded areas collapsed 10 days ago.\nIn some districts like Faridpur, Madaripur and Sariatpur in the south, helicopters carrying relief supplies cannot land for lack of dry space.\nRelief Ministry officials acknowledged that their efforts are being severely hampered. ''We have food in our stock,'' President Ershad said, ''but the question is how to deliver it.'' It has similarly become all but impossible for the authorities to accurately assess the extent of damage and the loss of life.\nAerial photos showed village after village leveled by flood waters. Panic in Capital\nIn Dhaka itself, where flooding is unusual, a panic seemed to have spread among the estimated two million out of five million city dwellers affected.\nMen, women and children by the thousands - with a few essentials on their heads and babies tightly held to mothers' breasts - are wading through water in search of shelter. Older people unable to walk are being piggybacked.\nThey are mostly the poor; others who are better off, were seen escaping by boats and rafts that now ply most of the streets of Dhaka.\nThe powerful are not immune. The state television network has showed pictures of President Ershad's official residence under knee-deep water. Airport Also Flooded\nDhaka, severed a week ago by road and rail link from the rest of Bangladesh, is cut off from the outside world, as well. The international airport was closed on Friday, its runway flooded.\nAll schools have been shut down in the affected areas, and inmates of hospitals and prisons evacuted.\nGas for cooking is in critically short supply, and the wells, now under water, have become contaminated with sewage.\nFor some, though, the picture is not altogether bleak. Boatmen are doing a brisk business. And some children, too young to fathom the magnitude of the disaster, are enthusiastic. They can be seen splashing and frolicking in the water."

The small scale fire that caused no casualties forced the students use windows to climb down from the second and third floor of the building with the help of outsiders who extended their helping hands with bamboos. Later, firefighters joined the locals and rescued the rest of the students trapped inside. The students could have suffocated from toxic fumes if the help had not come on time as there were no fire escapes in the building except for a narrow staircase. The fire originated from an electric short circuit around 11am and the flames were doused after one and a half hours, said Fire Service and Civil Defence officials. Abdullah Al Mamun, a fireman of the Mohammadpur Fire Station, said Daffodil Polytechnic Institute never conducted any fire drills to create awareness in case of a fire emergency. Seeking anonymity, a student of the Daffodil Polytechnic Institute, said: \"There aren't any emergency exits in our campus. As the fire originated from the main switch board installed beside the main staircase on the ground flood, the smoke quickly travelled up and prevented students from getting down. So, the students who were trapped used the windows to escape with help from locals and fire service officials.\"   \"We had found only one fire extinguisher for each floor, but when we tried to use them, we found them to be defective.\"  \"If a bigger fire breaks out in the future, there will be massive casualties and damages. The administration should take necessary fire safety measures as soon as possible,\" he added. According to Arif Miah, an office staff of the campus, the institution uses four floors of this five storey building and every floor is 2,500 square feet. Around 350 students attend classes regularly in this campus. Many students were in their classes when the fire broke out. Arif showed this correspondent five fire extinguishers which were all defective and lying beside the main switch board, where the fire had originated.  According to the Fire Service and Civil Defence, the building safety protocol dictates that at least two fire extinguishers have to be installed for every 1,000 square feet of a floor besides emergency exits and other fire safety equipment. At least one fire drill every month is mandatory for educational establishments, says the Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC). When contacted, the administrative office refused to make any statement regarding this matter."

People of the city were reminded of the unfulfilled pledges yesterday, after a downpour left numerous areas waterlogged and led to major gridlock on the streets until well after evening. Following approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), Dhaka Wasa had initiated two projects to tackle the issue and improve the water logging situation. But their progress is very slow to make any significant headway. On June 28, 2018, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, then LGRD minister, had blamed development projects around the city for its water logging problem. He had also expressed hope that the problem would end by 2019 -- which has not happened. As a result, the perennial waterlogging scenario in Dhaka is still unchanged. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) recorded 46mm rainfall in the city between 12pm and 6pm yesterday. Just within half-an-hour of thundershowers a little after 12pm, citizens were seen posting on social media videos of waterlogging in a number of areas. Dhaka Tribune correspondents during visits also found many streets and areas inundated. The areas that suffered most include Mirpur's Rokeya Sarani and Kazipara, Jahangir Gate, Green Road, parts of Indira Road, Tejgaon, Panthapath, Shukrabad, Kalabagan, Dhanmondi, Jhigatala, Shankar, Jatrabari, Bashundhara Residential Area, Motijheel, Gulistan, Paltan, Bijoynagar, Fakirapool, Karwan Bazar, Arambagh, some areas in Mohakhali and Gulshan, and many places of Old Dhaka. Talking to Dhaka Tribune, many said waterlogging was still occurring as the drains that are supposed to take the rainwater out are clogged with garbage. At the same time, heavy gridlock on major roads, which were inundated, made it extremely difficult for city dwellers to commute. Sufferings Many people were seen wading through the water to reach their destinations. Sarjin Sharif, a resident of Shankar area, told Dhaka Tribune: \"The road in front of my house is completely submerged. \"I need to go to work, but I cannot even get out of the house to find a vehicle.\" Dhanmondi's Road No 27 also went under knee-deep water very quickly, leaving many including students suffering amid heavy rain. Nafisa Nazmul, a former student of Brac University, said: \"I cannot find transport to go to Panthapath from Mirpur 10. The roads are completely underwater.\" East Jurain resident Awenim Rahman also told Dhaka Tribune that the main streets in his area were fine, as they were rebuilt and their heights increased recently. \"But the branch lanes, which are still low-lying, are completely inundated.\" He said he also faced horrible traffic jam on his way to the office later in the afternoon. \"I found all the roads leading from Gulistan to Paltan, Shahbagh, Kakrail, Dainik Bangla, and Farmgate via Banglamotor and Karwan Bazar absolutely gridlocked,\" Awenim said expressing frustration. Independent University Bangladesh faculty member Kazi Mubinul Hasan said: \"I live in the Bashundhara Residential area. On a usual day, it takes me less than an hour to reach Shukrabad. But today [Tuesday], it took me nearly two hours.\" Nilkhet and New Market areas, Elephant Road and Mirpur Road also saw major gridlock after the rain stopped a little after 3pm. The rain even left the roads leading from the main entrances to archways in the Bangladesh Secretariat, adjacent to Zero Point in Gulistan, under knee-deep water for at least three hours. Officers and outsiders both suffered while going from one building to another. Many were even seen entering the offices barefoot. Those turning up at the secretariat without cars were among the worst sufferers. Many said the secretariat had seen a similar problem on Sunday. More rains incoming BMD Meteorologist AKM Ruhul Quddus told Dhaka Tribune that they recorded 45.3mm of rainfall in the capital between noon and 3pm yesterday. Between 12pm and 6pm, a total of 46mm rainfall was recorded. Meanwhile, BMD also recorded the highest rainfall in Sylhet - 120mm. According to a Met Office weather bulletin, light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind over the country was likely again in the next 24 hours as of 9am today. \"There is a chance of light rain on Wednesday in Dhaka, Khulna and Chittagong regions, and in the rest of the country it will rainless,\" said Ruhul. The bulletin added that light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind is likely to occur at most places in Dhaka, Mymensingh, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, many places in Khulna and Barisal divisions, and a few places in Rangpur and Rajshahi divisions during the time. Moreover, it said, some places in Barisal, Chittagong, Mymensingh and Sylhet divisions may see moderately heavy to very heavy falls until this morning. Slow progress of master-plan Aiming to fix the perennial problem, the Ecnec last year had approved two projects -- \"Expansion of Drainage Networks and Development of Canals Project in Dhaka City\" and \"Land acquisition, excavation and re-excavation of Hazaribagh, Baishteki, Kurmitola, Manda and Begunbari canals.\" But both, being implemented by Dhaka Wasa are advancing at a snail's pace. One of the projects has registered only 8.25% progress in the past one year, while the other just 1.5% over the span of 14 months. Regarding the extremely sluggish progress, urban development expert Prof Nazrul Islam said such projects, after being passed, advance slowly due to many issues. \"But in course of time, their progress gained pace. But these two projects seem to be progressing very slowly. Only the authorities implementing them can explain why,\" he said. Dhaka Wasa Managing Director Taqsem A Khan was unavailable for comment over phone. However, engineer Nuruzzaman, former member of Dhaka Wasa Board, told Dhaka Tribune: \"Wasa is trying to solve the waterlogging issue by implementing some projects. It is visible that once areas used to remain waterlogged for five to six hours, but this year the water cleared from roads in two to three hours. It is a significant improvement.\""

Shirin Begum, Shariyat's wife alleged they are living in fear of security, while the police failed to pay heed to their concerns. \"We have been shunned-off by the village arbiters for 15 days. They are also influencing the locals so they do not interact with us.\" \"My children were forced to stop going to school as we receive death threats every day,\" she added. Nayan Miah, Shariyat's uncle, hoped the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina would soon intervene to ensure the safety of their family members as well as Shariyat's. \"The Matbar (Village Arbitration Chief) held a meeting at the local mosque premises on Saturday, and declared us as outcasts.\" Mirzapur police station OC Syedur Rahman said necessary measures have been taken to ensure the safety of Shariyat's family members. We are watching over their concerns as soon as they arise.\" \"The family is regularly paying visits to Bayati Shariyat,\" he added. Meanwhile, Tangail Qawmi Ulama Parishad on Thursday held a press conference, and demanded death sentence for Shariyat Bayati over his anti-Islamic remarks. They urged the government to pass a blasphemy law that ensures death penalty to Shariyat and other anti-Islamists. They have asked singers, actors, and directors not to endorse anti-Islamic content. Bayati Shariyat Sarker, a folk singer, was arrested on Saturday over his alleged anti-Islamic remarks at a program, and sent to jail on Tuesday after a three day remand. Cultural activists from all over the country, including Dhaka, Manikganj, Rajbari, Rajshahi districts are holding processions, human chains and demonstrations asking for Bayati's prompt release."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-05 00:00:00      \n\"Nah, bhalo lage na. Duijon injured hoia gese,\" said the Bangladesh karate team's Japanese coach Tetsuro Kitamura in clear, if colloquial, Bengali following the women's team's close defeat to Pakistan in the final of the women's kumite event of the 13th South Asian Games in Kathmandu yesterday. It was nice to hear a Japanese coach speaking such fluent Bengali, but it felt nicer when he spoke of his affection for Bangladesh and its people. Kitamura first came to Bangladesh in 1985 as a karate coach under a JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) project. It is mandatory for every JICA representative to have a basic three-month training on the language of the country to which he or she is sent. That helped him get a grasp of the basics of the language, but his numerous trips and stays in Bangladesh since has made him as fluent as a regular Bangladeshi, as well as fall in love with the local culture. \"This is my first home. I like the people here and the family bonding. People have a good heart. It's not like this in Japan where people are too busy and too self-centred,\" said the veteran coach, who also represents a Japanese crab-exporting company that collects crab from hatcheries in Satkhira. Kitamura, who makes trips to Japan every three months to see his wife, is not the only Japanese coach who has made Bangladesh his home.  Takahiro Taguchi is an adviser of the swimming team who, like Kitamura, has been coming to Bangladesh for coaching stints since the late 1980s. He too can read and speak Bengali fluently, and does not shy away from cracking a joke or two every often.  When asked for an impromptu interview, Taguchi jokingly said, 'Taka lagbe (will give interview for money)', before gladly obliging. \"I came here first in 1987 and I witnessed the flood of 1988 and the cyclone of 1991. I feel at home here, maybe more than in Japan. I like working here,\" said Taguchi. While Japan and JICA have been one of the closest friends of Bangladesh in their development activities, things took a tragic turn after a string of terror attacks on foreigners, culminating in the Holey Artisan Bakery attack in 2016 which took the lives of 24 people, including seven Japanese citizens, who were working here. JICA contemplated stopping their activities in the country but continued with those as the situation improved, thanks to anti-terror drives by the government.  The overall situation of safety and security has also improved much since the time the two coaches first arrived in Dhaka in the late '80s, according to them. \"Earlier people used to steal valuable items. Things are a lot better now. We can move around safely these days and go out on our own at night without any worry,\" Kitamura said. Both coaches felt that there were obvious disadvantages of living in Bangladesh rather than in Japan, but the warmth they get from the people keep them returning to Bangladesh and making it their home.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-23 00:00:00      \nClimate vulnerability depends not only on climate change, but also on how we develop Recently, the country experienced several major cyclones (eg Sidr and Aila), indicating that climate change is already impacting Bangladesh, and future effects would further aggravate this already bleak situation. Although there will be stronger tropical cyclones (TCs) observed in the Bay of Bengal, the total number is not expected to vary much. The stronger TCs will have particularly serious impacts on our nation's forestry. The country's coastal forests, such as mangroves and coastal plantations -- including charland plantations -- will be at the forefront of climate change. Sea rise due to high temperatures may submerge coastal forests and settlements, resulting in climate refugees. In the winter, high evapotranspiration combined with low water flow will increase the salinity of the forest soil and coastal waters. These conditions adversely affect freshwater-dependent flora and fauna, in particular, and forest productivity and biodiversity in general. This will eventually shift the character of forest boundaries and vegetation as the species that provide dense canopy cover will be replaced by non-woody shrubs and bushes.    Climate change projections Climate change may affect the country's forest eco-systems, which may result in negative consequences for forest-dependent communities. However, like any other natural systems, forest eco-systems are generally able to tolerate some level of climate change and so will continue to persist in the short term.  In the long term, whether their resilience will be sufficient enough to tolerate future anthropogenic climate change, is not known. Using climate change, including adaptation, as a driver to undertake activities with multiple benefits can catalyze progress in achieving a country's sustainable development goals. Many countries are starting to take action towards adapting to climate change. Such actions need to be expanded and integrated into national and sectoral planning to ensure that sustainable development and adaptation are mutually enhanced. Climate change-based information has the following advantages on a longer time-scale adaptation planning:   * Enhancing the scientific basis for decision-making for adaptations  * Strengthening methods and tools for the assessment of adaptation  * Education, training, and public awareness on adaptation, including for young people  * Individual and institutional capacity-building  * Technology development and transfer; and promotion of local coping strategies  * Appropriate legislation and regulatory frameworks, which promote adaptive-friendly action  * An adaptive planning process that covers different time-scales and levels (eg national, regional) and sectors  We have also experienced the impacts of inter-annual time-scale climate variability El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). From our review, we are fairly confident that ENSO variations will continue to occur and influence global climate in the coming decades and centuries. Therefore, climate change projection combined with a future ENSO event may provide improved perspective for capacity-building efforts in the forestry sector of Bangladesh. Also, future vulnerability depends not only on climate change, but also on development pathways. The implementation of adaptation needs to be integrated into national and international sustainable development priorities, as well as into national and sectoral development plans in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has already started to take concrete action towards adaptation to climate change. However, such action needs to be expanded and integrated into national and sectoral planning to ensure that sustainable development and adaptation are mutually enhanced. Recommendations for improvement Future trends are becoming clear, insofar as there is a need for more quantified spatial specific information, especially on future changes in extremes. This information is needed for improved flood and drought risk analyses. Therefore, we propose a climate change micro-level downscaling analysis of the future climate scenarios for Bangladesh. The output of this downscaling exercise is necessary for future water availability, food security, flood risk analyses, and forest eco-systems. The other major issue that needs to be seriously addressed is the inter-annual variability ENSO. One of the biggest El Nino related threats is forest fire. Forest fires threaten many ecologically-important areas, including habitats for rare species like tigers, and the smoke they give off is a serious threat to local people's health. Improved longer-term projection based on El Nino variability is essential for adapting to forest hazards in Bangladesh. It is also important to improve our understanding of emissions from fires in the region, which would ultimately help improve climate models. It will also contribute to initiatives like the United Nations Collaborative Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation program.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-13 00:00:00      \nIn Bogra, flower sellers are concerned as flower sales have fallen compared to previous years In a unique turn of events, Bangladesh will celebrate the Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun, the first day of Bangla calendar month Falgun, on the same day -- today -- this year. The exceptional situation, however, is not the bearer of good news for the country's flower merchants, who make huge profits every year on both of these days that generally falls on consecutive days in February. Pohela Falgun used to fall on February 13. But after the Bangla Academy adjusted the Bangla calendar last year, the day will be celebrated on February 14 from this year on, alongside Valentine's Day. With one day of the celebrations gone, the local flower markets in different districts -- from which florists also sell flowers to the traders in capital Dhaka -- have already reported a slump in retail flower sales.  Also, the absence of buyers -- who are mostly students -- because of the ongoing SSC and equivalent examinations will play a role in this, fear the businesses. In Bogra, flower sellers are concerned as flower sales have fallen compared to previous years. Bogra Flower Merchant Association General Secretary Laxman Das Amit said: \"We have received a smaller amount of flowers from the wholesalers as the prices are high.\" \"Also, as both Pohela Falgun and Valentine's Day will be observed on the same day, we are expecting a fall in our business, otherwise these occasions are generally the most profitable days for us every year, now we have only one day for both,\" he told our district correspondent Nazmul Huda Nasim. In Meherpur, flower demand and price have both gone up; however, florists are expecting a one-third drop in their sales target, reports our correspondent Ashraful Islam. Local trader Tutul said: \"This year, the Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun have fallen on the same day, which is also Friday. So, a dip in sales is very likely.\" In Sirajganj, flower sellers are already experiencing a loss in business. Usually, they sell around 70,000 flowers during the Pohela Falgun-Valentine's Day celebrations every year, but there is doubt whether they would sell even one-fourth of that today. Local merchants said they would surely face a slump because most of the schools and coaching centres are also closed due to the SSC exams, reports our district correspondent Aminul Islam Khan Rana. In Comilla, florists have also reported a slump in sales, and a hike in prices, despite a rise in demand. Apart from citing the same reasons, they said the prices have gone up as they could not import flowers due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, reports our correspondent Masud Alam. Still, there is hope Meanwhile, in Chuadanga, florists expect to sell flowers worth of Tk30 lakh between today and the International Mother Language Day, which would be observed on February 21, reports our correspondent Mehedi Hasan. Local flower merchant Akul Hossain said roses, tuberose, marigold, gerbera daisy and gladiola flowers are trending and are on high demand in the market. \"We hope to make a good profit during Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun. \"Hopefully, the sale will also be high on February 21.\" Demand for flowers along with the cost has also gone up in Nilphamari ahead of Pahela Falgun and Valentine's Day. Local florist Ajgar Ali said he sold flowers worth Tk1.25 lakh since February 1 and expects his sale to go up today, reports our district correspondent Md Taieyb Ali Sarker."

Inhabitants in the area have been living in anxiety of losing their houses and properties to the river's erosion in the last one month. The worst affected villages are Khanurbari, Kostapara and Bhalkutia under Govindasi union where over 300 dwellings and a large swathe of croplands have disappeared in the Jamuna over the last three weeks. A large number of the affected people from the villages have taken shelter on different roads and houses of others. Last week, Firoza Bewa, a widow with four children, lost her house on eight decimals of land in Kostapara village to the erosion. Since then, they have been living in a makeshift structure by the river. \"My husband, a rickshaw-van puller, died in cardiac arrest few months ago. Now where will I go with my children? Who will give us shelter?\" wondered Firoza. Many others like her are now living in the open after losing everything including their crops and belongings to the river. Jhoton Chanda, upazila nirbahi officer in Bhuapur, said, \"We are preparing a list of the erosion victims in order to provide them with necessary assistance.\" Meanwhile, Water Development Board (WDB) workers were seen dumping geotextile bags along a 75-meter-long stretch at Khanurbari village. Obhijit Ghosh, a resident of Kostapara village, said finding the steps taken by the WDB inadequate for checking the erosion, villagers in many areas were seen dumping bags filled with dirt.   Contacted, Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of WDB in Tangail, said water in the Jamuna was flowing 15 centimetres above danger level at Bhuapur point yesterday. \"Since it's tough to get a big project passed, we are taking smaller projects in phases to check the erosion. Preparations are ongoing to dump geo bags along another 75 meters of the affected area,\" he added. In Faridpur, at least 11 houses and 2,000 bighas of croplands were lost to erosion of the Arial Kha river in five villages of Sadarpur upazila in the last three days, reports our correspondent in the district. The affected villages are Amir Khanar Kandi, Zajira Kandi, Charbondorkhola, Kazi Kandi and Adel Uddin Mollah Kandi village in Char Manair union. Ayub Ali, chairman of Char Manair Union Parishad, said the erosion of the river started last Friday and so far, at least 11 houses and 2,000 bighas of croplands were devoured. Although the WDB in Faridpur has been dumping geo bags to check the erosion, strong current of the river is washing those away. Even the building of Char Manair Union Parishad and Char Bandarkhola Madrasa are now under erosion threat, he added. Kulsum Bibi, an elderly resident of Zajira Kandi village, said, \"The rampage of the Arial Kha has distressed us enormously. The river has devoured our ancestral homestead.\" After losing 10 bighas of land to the erosion, Kamal Hawladar, another resident of the same village, said he and his family were bracing for further sufferings in future. Kazi Kandi village resident Abdul Karim Hawladar said in only two days' time, the river devoured 20 bighas of his land. Sadarpur Upazila Nirbahi Officer Purobi Goldar said the higher authorities were made aware of the situation. She also said, \"WDB has been dumping geo bags in the affected areas and we engaged an officer from our upazila administration [to oversee the work].\" WDB Executive Engineer in Faridpur Sultan Mahmud said as a temporary measure to contain the erosion as well as ease sufferings of people, they have been dumping geo bags in affected areas."

State Minister for Water Resources Zahid Faruk, attending as chief guest, said the Delta Plan will improvise Bangladesh's GDP and make it two digits, impacting economical-social development, said a press release. The discussion topics covered a wide range of water-related areas such as flood control, flood forecasting, irrigation and drainage, river morphology, salinity and sediment transport, coastal hydraulics, port, coast, and estuary management, environmental impact assessment, bridge hydraulics, and related infrastructure. According to Prof M Monowar Hossain, executive director of IWM, their mathematical model has played a significant role in solving various complex water problems in the country and abroad. \"IWM can play a significant role in implementing the Delta plan 2100 by using these methods,\" he suggested. Many government institutions including the Water Development Board, LGED, etc partners with IWM to verify the feasibility of many projects, he added. Within the coming 100 years, Bangladesh needs to fight against challenges such as temperature rising, heavy rainfall, flood, disintegration of river, drought, rising sea level caused by climate change. To combat these challenges; a long-term Delta Plan-2100 in Water Management and Flood Control is prepared for implementation by using limited resources all together in area-based planning will develop the economic state of Bangladesh."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-24 00:00:00      \nRajuk is set to turn land originally earmarked for education and environment preservation into commercial and business plots in its 6,227-acre Purbachal New Town project in the city's outskirts. Since it launched the scheme in 1995, between Kaliganj and Rupganj with the Shitalakkhya to the east and the Balu to the west, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) has so far altered the layout plan five times.   According to documents produced before the High Court to get the fifth layout revision endorsed, Rajuk intends to reduce 269 acres dedicated to 157 educational institutions to 119 acres.   The 150 acres gained from the reduction will be used to create more plots -- residential, commercial, and for more institutional plots that include schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, clinics and clubs. Rajuk insiders said that the existing institutional plots have been split to increase the number of plots and to allot them to more applicants.  \"In this process, some indispensable standard characters and features of an institutional plot have been compromised, capacity was reduced and future higher population density was ignored,\" said an urban planner requesting anonymity. As an instance, it could be seen that instead of institutes having their own playgrounds, as needed, they would now have to share common neighbourhood playgrounds. Rajuk also intends to create 75 more residential plots reducing 49 acres, kept aside for nursery schools, down to 22 acres. The commercial and residential plots are being created to accommodate wealthy, influential, and politically connected people, said sources in Rajuk who wished to be unnamed. Rajuk wants to reduce the space for community centres by five acres and take extra 22 acres from land earmarked as administrative areas. Rajuk is doing this so that it could have an additional 65 acres for commercial plots and 19 acres more for shops, markets, and kitchen markets. As per the proposed fifth revised layout, they have already allotted 110 acres for a 142-storey iconic commercial tower, for which no land was earmarked in the fourth revision. After Rajuk sought endorsement of the fifth revision, the HC, in an order issued in January, observed that the proposed conversion of a huge quantity of land was \"by way of a smart trick\" by \"rearranging\" and \"compromising\" playgrounds of educational institutions.                 Apart from the iconic tower, the HC declined to approve other alterations. Meanwhile, the project cost increased by 135 percent. NOT PLAYING BY THE RULES? Following a public interest litigation in 2013, the HC in March the following year endorsed Rajuk's fourth revision of the plan. It directed Rajuk not to \"efface, subtract, vary or modify the forest, lakes, canals, urban green, parks, playgrounds\", as shown in the fourth revised layout plan, without the court's permission. But there has been widespread allegation that Rajuk in mid-September last year secretly allotted 84 institutional plots taking land from areas earmarked for schools and their playgrounds, violating the 2014 HC judgment. Even though Rajuk usually publishes the list of such plot allotments on its official website, in this case it did not make the list public even after six months. When asked, Project Director Ujwal Mallick said he did not know anything about altering the project layout plans or creation of new plots. He directed the correspondent towards Sheikh Shahinul Islam, Rajuk director for estate and land. Asked over the phone about the allotment of 84 plots, Shahinul on March 4 asked this correspondent to meet him face-to-face. When the correspondent met him that very day, he said, \"I cannot talk about this issue, the Rajuk chairman can. I just wanted to be acquainted to you.\" When The Daily Star correspondent spoke to Rajuk Chairman Md Abdur Rahman on March 10, he said, \"I can't say why the layout had to be revised five times. \"According to the government's education curriculum, we have to reduce the number of nursery schools.\" About the rationale for reducing educational plots and playgrounds and increasing commercial land, the chairman said, \"I need to know in details to respond.\" He said the fourth revised layout plan had 263 institutional plots, of which they had allotted 197, including the latest 84, with the remaining yet to be allotted. Asked why they did not make public the list of allotment of 84 institutional plots, he said he had just heard from this correspondent that it was not published. When asked for the list, he said, \"I have to think about it.\" Later in the day, the chairman said the list had been uploaded on Rajuk's official website. This correspondent, however, could not find it even yesterday and he informed the chairman of the matter. Abdur Rahman had earlier told The Daily Star that Rajuk would not implement the fifth revision of the layout but yesterday he said Rajuk would appeal to the HC in a day or two to have the revision endorsed. The Rajuk chairman said the Rajuk chief architect, who went into retirement around a year ago, had agreed to all the revisions and creation of new plots. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela), said Rajuk had argued before the court that they had allotted all available plots and the court should endorse the fourth revised layout plan. She said if they had adhered to the fourth revised plan in allotting the 84 controversial plots, then why do they want a fifth amendment? Rizwana also wondered why the list of allotment was not made public. To understand the extent of environmental damage caused in the process of executing the scheme, one must note that Rajuk had to pay more compensation for trees and forests than what it had to pay for land acquisition, said Rizwana. Bela in 2015 filed an appeal opposing the 2014 HC judgment, which endorsed the fourth revision of the layout. Bela argued that implementation of the fourth revision would imply felling of 11 lakh trees. The Appellate Division in a February 2017 order observed that \"Rajuk had been implementing Purbachal scheme by felling trees and filling up canals and this sort of work should not be allowed to continue\".  The court directed Rajuk to obtain environmental clearance to implement the scheme. The court also observed that rampant felling of trees and indiscriminate filling up of various water bodies would certainly threaten the ecosystem and biodiversity of the project areas. Khondaker M Ansar Hossain, an urban planner who worked as a technical expert on Dhaka city's Detailed Area Plan, said the entire area where Purbachal was being developed was originally comprised of extensive flood flow zones, rural homesteads, arable land, and forests. Dhaka's master plan forbids execution of this scheme because only rural homesteads could be there, he said. Still, the Purbachal scheme went ahead showing it as \"overlay\", meaning an entity already existing, but actually execution of the scheme took place after the Detailed Area Plan was made. Rajuk launched the scheme branding it as a model, self-contained, smart and largest planned township in the country."

The coastal district saw an average of 55-millimetre rainfall in the 12 hours, which can be considered as this year's highest in the area, said officials of the Department of Agricultural Extension. A number of roads, vast crop fields and many fish enclosures in Bagerhat Sadar, Mongla, Rampal, Sharankhola, Morrelganj and Kachua upazilas have been badly damaged. Farmers are worried as the water level rises during high tides. Bagerhat Sadar Upazila Fisheries Officer ASM Russell said fish from at least 250 enclosures have been washed away due to the flooding caused by continuous rain. Thousands of fishermen will suffer huge losses if there is further downpour, he added. Nakib Ohid, chairman of Badal Union Parishad in Kachua upazila, said at least 2500 crop farmers and several owners of shrimp enclosures in the union face serious losses due to the flooding. \"People's movement is badly disturbed as roads are under knee-deep water in our area. Many shrimp enclosures are flooded,\" said Musfikul Islam of Karapara village in Bagerhat Sadar union. \"The excessive rain caused rotting of the roots of some vegetables. However, the damage would not be that much if there is no further rain,\" said Rustom Sheikh, a vegetable grower of Kachua. Talukder Abdul Baki, panel mayor of Bagerhat municipality, said survey work has started as a project is going to be implemented to reduce waterlogging in the municipality. Aftab Uddin Ahmed, deputy director of the Department of Agricultural Extension in Bagerhat, said, \"The heavy rain resulted in the flooding that caused damage to betel plantations and vegetable fields. However, the losses will be minimum if water recedes quickly.\""

Officials warned that thousands could die before help arrived.\nThey said the number of known deaths from floods, snakebites and disease rose to a minimum of 520; however, unofficial estimates put the toll at more than 1,000.\nDoctors warned that thousands of families taking shelter in relief camps in Dhaka, huddling on river embankments or clinging to their flooded homes, are threatened by starvation and disease.\nAs the flooding disaster grew worse, pledges of foreign aid continued. Japan, responding to an appeal for international assistance, pledged $13 million today, Bangladesh's press agency said. Pakistan, the United States, Britain and Australia have already promised nearly $1.5 million in rice and cash.\nOfficials here point out, though, that supplies from abroad cannot reach the country in quantities until Dhaka airport can be reopened.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-03 00:00:00      \nShe was addressing the 'national standard' handing over ceremony in Rajshahi Cantonment Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has directed members of Bangladesh Army to keep a constant vigil to face any \"internal and external threats\" for safeguarding Bangladesh's constitution and sovereignty. \"You will have to always remain ready to face any 'internal or external threats' united for protecting the sacred constitution and sovereignty of the motherland,\" she said on Sunday. The prime minister was addressing the \"national standard\" handing over ceremony of the Bangladesh Infantry Regiments (BIR)-7th, 8th, 9th and 10th at Shaheed Col Anis Parade Ground in Rajshahi Cantonment. She handed over the national standard to the commander of the respective regiments. A smartly turned out contingent of Bangladesh Army gave salute to the prime minister through a spectacular parade. Along with Chief of Army Staff Gen Aziz Ahmed and the parade commander, the prime minister reviewed the parade riding on a decorated open jeep. Describing Bangladesh Army as an \"asset\" of the country and a \"symbol\" of the confidence and the trust of the people, the premier also asked its members to be more \"professionally-efficient\" and \"welfare-minded\" with social and religious values. \"Bangladesh Army is our asset and a symbol of confidence and trust of the people. So, you will have to be even more competent, efficient, honest, and welfare-minded being imbued with social and religious values to achieve desired standard of professionalism,\" she said.  Noting that her government always received constant support of the army to serve the people, Sheikh Hasina expressed her firm belief that the army will stand beside the people whenever it will be necessary during the running of the state by the present government. The premier said the members of Bangladesh Army played an important role in upholding democratic trend of the country by performing their responsibilities with utmost sincerity in the 11th general election. \"I extend my thanks to you for it and I also express gratitude to the countrymen for getting a scope of formation of the government for the fourth time and the third consecutive term,\" she said. The premier said her government always wants to run the country as the servants of the people, never rulers. Mentioning that the government is pledge-bound to build a modern and all-round armed forces, Sheikh Hasina said for this, the government has framed the Forces Goal-2030 which is being implemented in phases. As part of it, she said, new infantry divisions, brigades, units and training centres have been established. Besides, three new divisions have been formed in the army, she also said. The prime minister said her government has established para commando brigade for the first time, while MLRS and Missile Regiment have also been added to the army for further strengthening the country's air defence system. Besides, the present government has strengthened operational capability of the army to a great extent through inducting various modern war equipment, helicopters and modern infantry gazettes to keep pace with the developed world, she added. Referring to her government's steps for women empowerment, the prime minister said the government took an epoch making decision to get female officers and soldiers admitted to the army. Sheikh Hasina said in continuation of the initiative, appointing female pilots for the first time in the history of the army initiated a new horizon. The premier recalled that despite economic constraints, Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman took steps for establishing strong armed forces in the country. At the directives of Bangabandhu, she said, Bangladesh Military Academy was founded in Comilla Cantonment in 1972. Sheikh Hasina said Bangabandhu framed the defence policy in 1974 by realizing the necessity of a developed and professional army. The premier said in the light of Bangabandhu's far-reaching defence policy, a process for modernization of the army is underway. Today, Bangladesh Army has been elevated to a dignified position at home and abroad, she said. Sheikh Hasina said to infuse more dynamism into the Infantry Division, her government for the first time realized to establish its second regiment alongside the East Bengal Regiment. \"I approved in principle the formation of Bangladesh Infantry Regiment in 1999 and formally hoisted its flag in April 2001,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh Infantry Regiment is the first regiment established after independence. There are 43 units including two para commando battalions in the regiment, she said. \"The members of the regiment are working with reputation at home and abroad and I hope that they will continue work to uphold this reputation,\" she added. Sheikh Hasina said her government has taken all kinds of steps to build Bangladesh Infantry Regimental Centre as a modern training centre. The work on increasing training and administrative facilities is underway, she said. Besides safeguarding the country's independence and sovereignty, she said, the army has engaged themselves in the nation-building programs. \"Due to your professional efficiency, the important responsibility for supervision work of the Padma Bridge and the construction work of Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Marine Drive, the Hatirjheel Project in Dhaka, and Mohipal Flyover in Feni was given to you,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the army members in different foreign missions are bringing honour and dignity through sacrifice, dutifulness and professionalism which have further brightened Bangladesh's image abroad. She said the flag is a symbol of independence, sovereignty, honour and dignity. \"So it's a responsibility of all soldiers to protect the dignity of the flag,\" she said. The premier said earning ability of getting the national flag by any unit is a matter of rare honour and pride. \"The national flag, a symbol of independence and sovereignty, has been handed over to you and I extend my heartiest congratulations to BIR-7,8, 9 and 10 for achieving this honour and glory,\" she said. \"You will have to always remain prepared to protect the dignity of the flag which you've got as recognition to your work with efficiency, hard exercise and dutifulness,\" she said. Earlier on her arrival at the venue, the prime minister was received by Chief of Army Staff Gen Aziz Ahmed and GOC and Area Commander of the army and the Commandant of the Bangladesh Infantry Regimental Centre. Ministers, advisers to the prime minister, parliament members, the chiefs of navy and air force, former army chiefs, foreign diplomats and high civil and military officials were present on the occasion."

Nine Pages of Concern\nThe environment takes up nine pages of the 24-page, double-spaced document - far more than any other subject.\n''This is an idea whose time has come,'' a senior Bush Administration official said. ''When an idea comes in politics, it comes with a bang.''\nThe declarations at these annual gatherings of chiefs of state are more often statements of desire and determination than commitments to change policies. But they often lead to, or reinforce, changes in the countries' domestic economic policies.\nThe draft makes no explicit comment on the level of the dollar, usually a sensitive topic for meetings of the Group of Seven ministers. West German and Japanese officials said they did not intend to mention the currency, and the Americans had no wish to.\nInstead, the statement said the countries agreed to pursue, ''in a mutually reinforcing way,'' established policies that are aimed at keeping the dollar stable. In the ministers' most recent comment on the dollar, at a meeting in April, they said they wanted no further rise nor an excessive decline.\nAfter continuing to rise in May and June despite the ministers' wishes, the dollar has receded to the April levels, so the absence of comment implies that the April statement remains in effect.\nThe countries also give an unequivocal endorsement of the Bush Administration strategy for dealing with third world debt. That strategy involves banks and debtors working to reduce the debt burden with a minimum of taxpayer involvement. The draft flatly rejects approaches that would require infusions of more taxpayer money, a tack favored by the host of the summit meeting, President Francois Mitterrand of France. A Statement on Bangladesh\nBut in a concession to Mr. Mitterrand, the countries single out one impoverished country, Bangladesh, to receive help in controlling floods that last September wiped out whole villages, although they did not go so far as to propose any spending for the ambitious system of dikes that Mr. Mitterrand wants.\nOne developing country, Mexico, has weighed heavily on the deliberations here because it is seen as a test of the debt policy of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. The Administration has been hoping that a debt-reduction agreement between Mexico and its foreign bankers, in effect validating the Brady policy, will be reached in New York before the meetings here end.\nSo far no such agreements have been made with any debtor, and it is possible that none will be reached with Mexico.\n''I think we're very close,'' Mr. Brady said in an interview with a few reporters today. Mr. Brady, former chairman of the Dillon, Read investment banking firm, added: ''I've been doing deals for 35 years, and you can't tell exactly when a deal is going to close. But I think we're very close.'' Resolve on Drug Traffic\nAmerican officials said they were pleased with one result of their meetings, a strengthened commitment to stop world production of and traffic in illegal drugs.\nAmong other things, the draft says the Group of Seven will convene experts to ''consider means to prevent the utilization of the banking system and financial institutions for the purpose of money laundering.'' France would call the first meeting.\nCurtailing money laundering, the process by which drug traffickers disguise the origins of their money as it moves through the world banking system, ''is a very important way to attack the drug problem,'' the senior Administration official said. Optimism on World Inflation\nWith respect to economic performance, the summit countries note that inflation has been contained in many of the countries but requires vigilance where it is still rising.\nIn interviews, however, officials of several countries said that they were even more sanguine about inflation than the draft statement implies and that they were moving toward Mr. Brady's position that the worst of inflation is past and interest rates could start falling.\nThe West German Finance Minister, Theodor Waigel, said he expected inflation at home to fall to 2.5 percent next year from 3 percent now.\nThe United States incurred implicit criticism in the meetings, the statement shows, over its decision in April to single out Japan, Brazil and India for possible trade sanctions for domestic policies that obstruct American access to their markets. Other countries have called the step a violation of multilateral cooperation in resolving trade disputes.\nThe statement says the countries will ''avoid any discriminatory or autonomous actions'' (an implied criticism of countries that protect their markets), but it adds, ''We also are pledged to oppose the tendency toward unilateralism, bilateralism, sectoralism.'' Call for Environmental Research\nOn the environment, the countries called for more research on issues but added that ''the persisting uncertainty on some of these issues should not unduly delay our action.''\nSignificantly, the countries went beyond the multinational Helsinki accord of earlier this year. That agreement called for an end to production of chlorofluorocarbons, used in refrigerators and air-conditioners, which contribute to the depletion of the world's protective ozone layer.\nThe statement says attention should also be given to other substances that deplete the ozone layer, presumably including carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform.\nThe countries also support further use of nuclear power in energy production as an alternative to burning fossil fuels, which are thought to contribute to global warming.\nThey raise the possibility of establishing a ''framework'' or ''umbrella convention'' to set out guidelines for combatting climate change. The statement is a gesture toward establishing an international body to regulate the world environment.\nThe countries also accepted an Italian Government proposal to serve as the host of a forum on international law for the environment."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-11 00:00:00      \nThe new charge of \"sexual battery by restraint\" will form part of a separate trial he faces in Los Angeles  Disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was charged by Los Angeles prosecutors on  Friday with  sexually assaulting a third woman, as authorities there build their own case against the convicted rapist. Weinstein, 68, is already in prison in New York state after being sentenced to 23 years in jail for rape and sexual assault. The new charge of \"sexual battery by restraint\" will form part of a separate trial he faces in Los Angeles over allegations he assaulted multiple women in local hotels, with extradition proceedings under way. \"We are continuing to build and strengthen our case,\" said Los Angeles prosecutor Jackie Lacey. \"If we find new evidence of a previously unreported crime, as we did here, we will investigate and determine whether additional criminal charges should be filed,\" she added. The new charge alleges Weinstein sexually assaulted an unnamed woman in Beverly Hills in May 2010 -- just within the 10-year statute of limitations.  He has already been charged with the rape and sexual assault of two other women on consecutive nights in 2013.  Two additional Los Angeles cases against Weinstein are no longer being pursued as those accusers did not want to testify. It is not known when the trial will begin, but Los Angeles prosecutors confirmed Friday they have initiated a request for Weinstein's transfer. \"Upon his arrival, he will be arraigned on the amended complaint. Once a court date is set, the public will be notified,\" a statement read. If convicted in all the California cases, Weinstein could face an additional 29-year prison sentence. For decades a towering figure in Hollywood whom Meryl Streep famously called \"God,\" the \"Pulp Fiction\" producer was expelled from the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences that awarded his films several Oscars after a flood of accusations broke. Tinseltown A-listers Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek were among nearly 90 women to have come forward alleging decades of vile predatory behaviour by Weinstein. Weinstein has repeatedly denied wrongdoing."

Addressing a Seratunnabi gathering at Baitul Mukarram, Bangabandhu says that the four basic principles -- nationalism, democracy, socialism and secularism -- are compatible with the teachings of the Prophet and a happy and prosperous nation could be built on these four principles. Addressing the large congregation, the prime minister says that the Prophet loved all human beings irrespective of their religion and taught people to resist all oppression carried out in the name of religion. He says that the struggle for the realisation of justice, truth and honour are compatible with the teachings of Islam. Bangabandhu urges the Muslims of Bangladesh to practise Islam and abide by the teachings of the great Prophet to prove themselves better Muslims than others. He says as Bangladesh is the second largest Muslim nation in the world, the Muslims of this new state will surely display their love for Islam by following the teachings of Islam. In Bangladesh there will be no attack on any religion and the citizens of Bangladesh will be completely free to practise and profess their respective religions. WE CAN'T IGNORE BANGLADESH, SAYS INDIRA Bangladesh has an important role to play in the sub-continent and we can certainly not ignore Bangladesh, says Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi while talking on major Indian and world problems to the press today. Asked about prisoners of war in India-Pak talks, Indira Gandhi says, \"We are not the only party.\" ACCORD ON FLOOD CONTROL MEASURES The India-Bangladesh talks for mutual cooperation on sharing of water and power resources reach complete accord over cyclone and flood control measures. The representatives of the two countries discuss in detail the terms of reference and the composition of the Joint River Commission. VOTERS' AGE LIMIT MAY BE LOWERED Bangladesh government is considering a proposal for reducing the age limit of voters from 21 to 18, enabling young people to have the opportunity of greater participation in the affairs of the state. Recalling the Awami League pledge embodied in the party's election manifesto to reduce voters' age limit, the Local Government and Rural Development Minister Shamsul Huq says that this decision will amount to the fulfillment of a promise the party had made to the people.

The erosion of the river bank began on last Thursday, causing suspension of vehicle movement on Koterkuna-Hazipur road for one week, reports our Moulvibazar correspondent. Local people fear that the embankment may collapse any moment as a crack in it keeps widening. Earlier, the river damaged the embankment in the first week of last month. According to local sources, the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) repaired the crack with wooden pillars and sand sack structures in an attempt to curb damage from the escalating erosion, but the repair works failed to contain the river and were washed away in last few days. Ali Hosain, a resident of Koterkuna village, said that due to heavy rains for the last one month the flood control embankment at Koterkuna area got damaged twice. Persistent rains and water from the upstream hills have turned the river dangerous, he said. \"I have two acres of land near the embankment and I run my family with the income from selling the crops. I won't be able to maintain our livelihood if the embankment collapses,\" said Sadhon Das, a resident of Monu village. Abdus Salek, a farmer of the same village, said erosion also hit the embankment last year and villagers contained the damage by erecting corrugated iron fences and dumping sand bags. The locals also demanded alternative road for the 30 villages as vehicles movement on the Hazipur-Koterkuna road get suspended every time the embankment is damaged, This important embankment has been facing erosion threat due to mindless sand lifting by a section of local influential people, locals alleged. \"How can we celebrate Eid when we are tensed if the embankment collapses again? If it will collapse in Eid time then we will lose all our assets and crops,\" said Nargis Banu, a resident of Monu village. Hazipur Union Parishad Chairman Abdul Bachhit Bacchu said the 30 villages near the embankment and the Koterkuna market will not survive if action is not taken immediately. \"We have marked 67 points in the Sadar, Kulaura, and Rajnagar upazilas which are at risk due to river erosion,\" BWDB Executive Engineer Ranendra Shankar Chakrabarti said \"A Tk 1,000 crore development project will soon be proposed to build permanent boundaries around the river embankments which will contain the river waters in the rainy season,\" he added."

However, with advice from agriculture officers, farmers found a solution in the floating seedbed technology. This year the Brahmaputra river rose 150 centimetres above danger mark, the highest in two decades, and inundated croplands including aman seedbeds. According to district agriculture extension office, aman seedlings on 2,881 hectares of land in Gaibandha went under five to seven feet of standing water, damaging all prospect of transplanting the seeds in the next phase of aman cultivation. Instead of waiting for the water to subside for preparing regular seedbeds on land, the agriculture department advised farmers to prepare floating aman seedbeds on the floodwater. This way the saplings will be ready for transplantation in time within the aman cultivation season and also not get damaged if another flood occurs.  While visiting the flood ravaged unions of Sundarganj upazila, farmers were seen sowing aman seeds on floating beds made from heaped up water hyacinths and mud. \"I have prepared two floating beds as suggested by our upazila agriculture officer and sowed seed of BRRI- 51 aman variety. The seedlings can later be transplanted to cover four and half bighas of land,\" said Raju Mia, a farmer of Ramjibon union in Sundarganj upazila. BRRI- 51 aman, a flood tolerant variety suitable for flood prone areas, specially char lands along river basins, survives for two weeks under water, said SM Sarower Hossain, sub-assistant agriculture officer of Ramjibon union. Another farmer Rafiqul Islam of Bochagari village in Kapasia union, said \"My aman seedbed on five decimals of land, which could have been transplanted on five bighas of land, got damaged in the recent flood. The land would remain fallow if I do not arrange aman seedlings in time\". When asked why Rafiqul did not prepare floating seedbeds, he said, \"I don't know how to do so but I will talk to the agriculture department and try to start it soon.\" Syed Reza-e-Mahmud, Upazila Agriculture Officer (UAO) of Sundarganj said at least 32 floating seedbeds have already been prepared in different areas of Sundarganj Upazila, some people have leased water bodies to prepare floating seedbeds to sell saplings commercially. Deputy Director S M Ferdous of the Agriculture Extension Directorate, Gaibandha, said, \"As per instruction of the agriculture ministry, we have selected 56 farmers of seven upazilas of the district, trained them, and gave each of them an incentive grant of Taka 1165 to prepare floating seedbeds.\" This will encourage other farmers to follow suit, he hoped."

The Russians refused United Nations mediation. The Afghan guerrillas would not deal with the Soviet-backed Government in Kabul at all and Pakistan, which agreed to represent the insurgents, would not share a negotiating table with it.\nThe innovative Mr. Cordovez, a 52-year-old Ecuadorean lawyer who has worked for the United Nations since 1963, started by talking to each side separately. It was uphill work. Shuttle Diplomacy\nThen he hit on the idea of ''proximity talks'' - putting each side into a separate room and ''shuttling'' back and forth between them, while the United Nations disarmament talks droned on in an intervening conference hall.\nAlthough progress remained slow, there were reasons to laugh. Overzealous guards, told to keep the warring factions apart, regularly locked delegates in the lavatory for fear they might bump into a member of the opposing camp. Mr. Cordovez took to limping through the corridors to signal that his talks were still limping along, despite everything.\nThroughout all the disappointments and frustrations, Mr. Cordovez remained cheerful and persistent, maintaining that what was needed most was time and plenty of it. He was right. It took three years to persuade Kabul to cut the timetable for pulling out Soviet forces from Afghanistan from 43 months to 9.\nEven now, Mr. Cordovez is banking on time, the great healer, to make his agreement a success. The accord provides for Soviet forces to leave Afghanistan but not for the Afghans to stop killing each other.\nBut Mr. Cordovez remains hopeful that once Afghanistan's warring factions see the provocative Russians leave, they will bury their Kalashnikovs and compromise. ''It takes time for them to understand their fate is in their own hands now,'' he said.\nA stylishly dressed, plumpish man with horn-rimmed glasses, Mr. Cordovez is almost always laughing at something, occasionally himself. Enjoys Tinkering\nHe was born in Quito on Nov. 3, 1935; he and his wife, Maria Teresa, have a son, Diego. Mr. Cordovez enjoys carpentry and tinkering (he uses the French word bricolage) with broken things - useful hobbies for a United Nations bureaucrat.\nA lover of good food, wine and Cuban cigars, Mr. Cordovez also enjoys reading biographies of the famous. Not even his closest friends would call him modest.\nMr. Cordovez was appointed an Under Secretary General by Kurt Waldheim a few months before he stepped down as Secretary General.\nIn 1965 he was sent to the Dominican Republic when it was in the throes of revolution. Six years later he was involved in the violent birth of the nation of Bangladesh. In 1980 he was the senior official accompanying a mission to Teheran that failed to resolve the United States Embassy hostage crisis. He had better luck later that year when he helped settle a dispute between Malta and Libya over seabed rights.\nDespite his optimistic temperament, Mr. Cordovez's friends say he suffers occasional fits of gloom. A few days ago, with the Afghan talks on the verge of collapse, he said he was through with diplomacy and would go back to Ecuador to manage his family's horse ranch when this job was over. That seems unlikely now.\nHis job as Under Secretary General for Political Affairs includes settling the Persian Gulf conflict, too, so another odyssey lies ahead.\nMr. Cordovez plans frequent trips to Afghanistan in the coming months to oversee compliance with the treaty and to encourage the country's factions to reach a political settlement.\nHe is preparing seriously for the task.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-19 00:00:00      \nThousands of people have begun to leave Dhaka for their village homes ahead of Eid, ignoring the risks of contracting coronavirus and spreading it to many others. There were so many people on the ferries on the Padma yesterday that the authorities, in a bid to prevent crowding, suspended the services on Shimulia-Kathalbari and Paturia-Daulatdia routes for hours. In the absence of public transport because of the ongoing shutdown, the holiday-makers travelled by pickups, motorcycles and battery-run three wheelers. Many had to spend two to three times the usual fare. The Dhaka-Chattogram highway witnessed a 25-km tailback in Daudkandi, caused mainly by thousands of cars leaving Dhaka. The Covid-19 outbreak had hit Dhaka and its adjacent areas the hardest in the country. Experts said this rush of thousands of people will further spread the deadly virus and delay the reopening process. After observing the crowds that have been getting bigger for the last few days, the Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity in a statement yesterday urged the government to announce a 10-day curfew around the Eid to slow the spread of the outbreak. Around three crore people used to leave Dhaka and other major cities ahead of Eid, it said. And many people have started leaving the cities for their hometowns this week. The shutdown began on March 26 and the government later extended it six times. Before May 30, most of the private and public offices will not reopen and transport services will not resume. In a circular on May 14, the cabinet division said movement of people will be restricted from May 17-May 28 across the country. The circular also said that no one would be allowed to leave the city where they work. The local administration and law enforcers were supposed to enforce the restrictions during the period. Police on Sunday stepped up measures to restrict the movement of people. They set up check posts across the country to prevent people from travelling from one district to another during Eid unless there is an emergency. But the number of people leaving Dhaka increased yesterday. Eid-ul-Fitr will be celebrated on May 24 or 25, subject to the sighting of the moon. CROWDING AT FERRY TERMINALS The number of people leaving Dhaka has been increasing since Friday, a day after the government announced the extension of the Eid holidays. Ferry operators on the Shimulia-Kathalbari route said they have been transporting several thousand people across the Padma every day this week. The authorities reduced the number of ferries from 14 to just four early yesterday to prevent crowding. But from 6:00am to 10:00am, the operators had to carry only people across the river, because there was no room for vehicles, said an employee. As the day progressed and the crowd became larger, the authorities suspended the services around 3:00pm. The services did not resume as of 9:00pm. Ferry terminal staffers said there were thousands of people there. At Paturia and Daulatdia terminals, the situation was similar. As the number of small vehicles increased in the last few days, the authorities stopped transporting small vehicles from 11:00pm on Sunday, Zillur Rahman, BIWTC deputy general manager at the terminal, told this newspaper. When the number of small vehicles like cars kept rising, they stopped operation of all five ferries from 11:00am yesterday, he said. \"We will resume operation after getting permission from higher authorities and will only carry goods-laden vehicles now.\" Rifat Rahman Shamim, superintendent of police in Manikganj, said police were struggling to control the movement of people. Police on Sunday set up a check-post at Golra on Dhaka-Aricha highway in Manikganj, he told our Manikganj correspondent. But people have been reaching Paturia Ghat at night, using bypass roads, he added. The terminals witnessed similar crowds when the government on March 23 announced the shutdown from March 26. DHAKA-CTG HIGHWAY The long tailback from Eliotganj to Daudkandi took shape yesterday morning. The situation became normal around 4:00pm. As the number of private vehicles increased, police intensified their checking activities, causing the gridlock, reports our Cumilla correspondent. Abdullah Al Mamun, officer in charge of Daudkandi Highway Police Station, said they have been working to maintain the \"lockdown\" strictly. Vehicles carrying goods and emergency transports were only allowed to move towards Dhaka. Lorry driver Shafikul Islam, however, said when police forced the cars to return to Dhaka, they caused the jam. WHAT HEALTH EXPERTS SAY Prof Dr Shah Monir Hossain, one of the eight members of a government-formed expert committee to supervise, monitor and support the coronavirus response, said: \"It's clear indication that we are going towards a worse situation. \"In a nutshell, I can tell you that the way people... are returning to their village homes.... we are heading towards a more serious crisis.\" The government should immediately take measures to stop the flood of people leaving Dhaka, he added. Prof Muzaherul Huq, former World Health Organisation regional adviser for Southeast Asia, said, \"I think the death rate from coronavirus may increase if the government fails to prevent people from going to their homes. \"We are yet to know who tested positive or negative for Covid-19.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-22 00:00:00      \nAmid the coronavirus scare and threat of impending flash flood, farmers in the haor region of Sylhet Division are expecting a bumper Boro harvest this time. Many of the farmers, who have been busy harvesting Boro paddy over the last one week, said they were happy with the market prices for their produce. They, however, said a shortage of farm labourers made it difficult for them to harvest Boro, the main crop in the region. According to the Department of Agriculture Extension, Boro has been cultivated on 447,195 hectares of land in Sylhet Division with a production target of 23.71 lakh tonnes. Srinibash Debnath, additional director of the department in Sylhet, said, \"This year, the harvest seems very good. No disease hit the paddy. We are expecting a very good yield.\" Till yesterday, 31 percent of the produce was harvested in the haor areas against 21 percent in the whole division, he mentioned, adding that the progress was satisfactory. The official, however, voiced worry that flash flood may hit the region any time. According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board, flash flood may hit the haor region at the end of the week due to excessive rainfall in the north-eastern part of the country and in the Indian states of Assam and Meghalaya. Shyamal Sarkar, a farmer of Bagbari village of Dharmapasha upazila in Sunamganj, said, \"The weather is still favourable and the Khurma river is flowing below the danger mark. We hope to finish harvest before the flash flood hits the area.\" Upesh Sutradhar, a marginal farmer of Mahdi village in Chhatak upazila, said he had already harvested paddy on one acre of his three-acre land and was happy with the produce. \"I have already harvested around 30 maunds of paddy and sold those for Tk 650 a maund. I am happy with the harvest and the price,\" he said. Last year farmers sold Boro paddy for around Tk 400 a maund. This time, farmers are happy with the prices ranging from Tk 650 to Tk 750 per maund. Many of them said they were facing a shortage of farm labourers. But thankfully, idle labourers of different sectors joined them to harvest paddy. Tamij Uddin is one such labourer from Moulvibazar's Kulaura upazila. He along with his brother is now harvesting paddy in Hakaluki Haor area. Ekhlasur Rahman, a labourer of Chanpur village in Chhatak upazila, said, \"There is a bit of crisis of farm labourers, but the wages of labourers have not gone up that much\". However, Abdur Razzak, a farmer from Dugnoi village in Dharmapasha upazila, said, \"A farm labourer is now charging Tk 700 a day. The amount usually hovers around Tk 500. \"The virus scare and a lack of transport are deterring labourers of other districts from coming here,\" he mentioned. Another Farmer, Shyamal Sarkar, in the same upazila, said, \"There are different ways to pay a labourer. Some labourers take one of every seven sacks of paddy they harvest, while some charge Tk 1,800 to 2,000 per kiyar (37 decimals).\"  "

A large number of farmers cannot prepare their fields for Aman cultivation due to deposition of sand and garbage during the floods. Those who are trying to start farming have to count additional cost for removing the garbage, said local farmers. Nur-un-Nabi Sarker, project implementation officer of Sundarganj, said the recent floods caused an estimated loss of Tk 41 crore 47 lakh 13 thousand 550 in the upazila. It includes Tk 33 crore 59 lakh 78 thousand 550 in rural infrastructures like roads, bridges, culverts and cluster villages, Tk 4 crore 83 lakh in agriculture, Tk 1.80 crore in roads, bridges and culverts under Local Government Engineering Department, Tk 50 lakh of secondary education department, Tk 18 lakh of primary education department, Tk 43 lakh of fisheries department, and Tk 13.35 lakh of livestock department. \"I took shelter on the embankment after the flood washed away my two huts used for dwelling. The water has receded but I am still staying here as I can't rebuild my home due to hardship,\" said Afsar Ali, a farm labourer in Belka of Sundarganj. \"My three bighas of land got covered with a thick layer of sand as surging water inundated the area after breaches in the embankment. Normally it would take at least two years for the land to regain fertility,\" said Solaiman, a small farmer of Belka. Many of the croplands in char areas are still under knee-deep water and so, Aman farming there still remains uncertain, said Faridul of the same area. Farmer Rafiqul Islam of Kapasia union said they are worried about the next Aman cultivation as the three-week-long floods damaged seedbeds in large areas. Road communications are still in disarray as floods damaged roads, culverts and bridges at different places. \"Without special allocation from the government, it would be difficult to renovate damaged roads and culverts in the area. Besides, many of the flood-affected people need financial help for rebuilding their damaged houses and removing sand from croplands,\" said Nafiul Islam Jimy, chairman of Haripur union parishad. Md Solaiman Ali, upazila nirbahi officer of Sundarganj, said a list with estimated damage in flood affected areas have been sent to respective ministries, urging for immediate allocation to start rehabilitation work as early as possible."

      "text": "By the River, Refuge but Little Relief\n1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nClustered on a riverbank, more than 8,000 residents of this town in Bangladesh, about 100 miles south of Dhaka,were forced today to take shelter any way they could.\nIn outlying areas, those displaced by the floods took refuge in treetops and on tin roofs - survival having become a matter of ingenuity and improvisation.\nNo relief had reached this town in Bhola district today, 10 days after the start of the extensive flooding that has taken at least 550 lives and left much of Bangladesh under water.\n''How long will I survive with my family if this continues?'' asked one of those living on the embankment, Abdul Haq, 55, head of a family of nine. An Annual Event\nThe overall flood situation in this south Asian nation remained basically unchanged, though the levels of most rivers had dropped further after the devastation wrought by the monsoon, the wind-driven torrential rain that occurs annually in this part of the world. The monsoon is both devastating and beneficial: the death and destruction it brings is repetitive, yet agriculture -and particularly rice cultivation - depends on it.\nDuring a two-hour helicopter trip to and from Bhola today, vast sheets of water stretched as far as the eye could see.\nIn the affected districts - Narayangang, Munshigang, Faridpur and Chandpur - the treetops and tin roofs still protruded above water. Some communities, and the district headquarters of Narayangang and Munshigang, 11 and 20 miles south of Dhaka respectively, measured the flooding at knee-deep levels. Boats were seen plying the roads along with rickshaws. Many Are Cut Offs\nA helicopter pilot, flying over vast areas during the last few days, said he has seen many people trapped by flood waters asking for food.\nInformation Minister Mahbubur Rahman said that about 1,700 relief centers were in operation throughout the country. On one such place in Narayangang hung a sign reading ''Ershad Gruel Kitchen.''\nIn Nichkasia, Mr. Haq and about 200 other flood victims rushed toward three journalists today, having mistaken them for relief officials.\n''They don't care about us,'' said Mohammad Musa, 60 years old. ''They show up only when such great disasters befall us.''\nNaziur Rahman Mia, Minister of State for Local Government and Rural Development, said that more than 200,000 of of the district's 1.4 million people had been affected by the flooding and that about 70,000 had lost everything they owned.\n''Now the main problem is erosion of the river,'' said Mr. Mia, who is from this district. ''Already, 22 square miles have been gobbled up by the Meghna, leaving thousands homeless.''\nHe said he would assess the damage and provide relief as it is needed. Surviving on Biscuits\nStanding nearby was an 11-year-old girl, who gave her name as Fajilatunnesa, who said she had received a small package of biscuits four days ago, but nothing after that.\nThe Bhola area becomes nearly inaccessible in the rainy season. The five-mile road to the district headquarters is mostly unpaved and full of potholes and deep ruts. It took about half an hour to travel those five miles by jeep.\nHealth officials throughout the country continued to express concern both over hunger of flood victims and disease in places where there is little or no pure drinking water.\nA daily newspaper, Ittefaq, reported large-scale outbreaks of diarrhea and other intestinal ailments. Health Minister Abdul Munim said 2,250 medical teams are now working in the flooded areas."

Badargonj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Nabirul Islam confirmed the matter to Dhaka Tribune around 8: 30pm on Wednesday. The 30-year old man, who returned from Malaysia to the upazila recently, went to Narayanganj where he stayed for one month. Few days ago, he came back from Narayanganj and started suffering from fever, cough, and respiratory problems, prompting health authorities to collect samples. They were later sent to Rangpur Medical College Hospital for testing.  On Wednesday, his reports came back positive, said UNO Nabirul Islam. The UNO also added that 10 houses around the patient's residence and a residential quarter of Badargonj Upazila Health Complex, where his brother lives, were put under lockdown. With this, Rangpur reported three Covid-19 cases so far, according to health authorities. "

C. S. Hameed said Colombo welcomed the step.\nThe offer came two days after Indian transport planes with fighter escorts, on only 35 minutes' notice to Colombo, dropped food parcels over the Jaffna Peninsula, the stronghold of armed Tamil rebels who have been under Sri Lankan military attack. India, which has a Tamil population of over 50 million, said the supplies were intended for besieged civilians.\nFighting was still going on in the peninsula today. And in southern Sri Lanka seven Tamil prisoners were killed trying to escape from a center housing nearly 4,000 political detainees, the Government said.\nMr. Hameed said in an interview in his office that China and Pakistan had been among the nations offering support to Colombo after the Indian airdrop on Thursday. He called India's actions a ''naked violation of our independence and an unwarranted assault on our territory and sovereignty.'' Attendance at Parley in Doubt\nMr. Hameed said that in the light of the Indian action, Sri Lanka was reconsidering whether or not to attend a ministerial meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, scheduled to be held in New Delhi on June 18-19.\nMost members of the association, which besides India and Sri Lanka includes Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Bhutan, have condemned the Indian air drop.\n''Countries in the region and countries far and wide have expressed concern, expressed sympathy,'' Mr. Hameed said. ''Some have expressed very grave concern, and some countries have even said that if there is a shortage, if there is a need for any assistance, they would be very happy to help us.''\nHe declined to identified the countries offering material assistance. Press reports in the region have mentioned Pakistan.\nMr. Hameed said that last week the Government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi turned down a suggestion from Sri Lanka's President, J. R. Jayewardene, to hold the same kind of talks that New Delhi was proposing today. The proposal for talks came just after Sri Lanka's Navy stopped a flotilla of 19 fishing boats that had been trying to deliver aid.\n''There was no need for the so-called relief assistance,'' Mr. Hameed said. ''Still, my immediate response then was that we were prepared to receive it, and let us work out the modalities of supply and distribution. And they said no. They dodged that request and said the matter was very urgent.'' Indian Warning Recounted\nHe said that the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in New Delhi was summoned to the External Affairs Ministry on Thursday and that ''a demarche of 35 minutes'' was issued. He said the Sri Lankans were told that ''the planes would be accompanied by fighter planes, and should there be any resistance, we will not hesitate to use force.''\n''You are told: I am entering your home, and if you resist we shall use force,'' he added.\nIn the fighting on the Jaffna Peninsula today, according to the Government spokesman, troops engaged in a limited operation around the town of Achuvely that opened a link between two previously captured area. He said one officer, five soldiers and seven guerrillas had been killed.\nSouth of Colombo, the killing of the seven Tamils occurred when a riot erupted Friday night in the largest detention center for political prisoners, near the town of Boosa, according to the spokesman, Tilak Ratnakara.\nHe said 25 detainees had tried to overpower prison guards during dinner. After a struggle, Mr. Ratnakara said, the guards summoned troops, who fired on the would-be escapees. Four soldiers and a prison officer were wounded, one critically."

      "text": "India's Bleakest Corner Is Where All Hope Ends\n1989-09-11T05:00:00.000Z\nIn an era when it is common to talk of Asian economic miracles and a Pacific century, the Indian state of Rajasthan is a reminder that there are, in reality, two Asias. There are the economic tigers and would-be tigers from Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand, but also the struggling, crowded, volatile nations of South Asia, especially India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, where survival is difficult.\nIn many ways, Rajasthan reflects South Asia's problems.\nPopulation is a major contributor to the widening gap between the two Asias. India Today, the country's leading news magazine, has estimated, based on current population trends, that within decades India will be the world's poorest country. With a current population of 810 million and a growth rate of 2.1 percent a year, the magazine estimates that by early in the next century India will have well over a billion people, with the world's largest numbers of illiterates and homeless - 600 million in each category - and 400 million unemployed.\nRajasthan, a northwestern state on the Pakistan border, has the country's fastest-growing population with an annual increase of 2.8 percent. Land and vegetation are visibly running out. Urban areas, including Jaipur, the 18th-century ''pink city'' that was once a model of town planning, are overrun by the poor. Where India's Troubles Are Coming Together\nIn ecology, nutrition, culture and politics, Rajasthan is a demographer's laboratory, and some of India's most creative research into the complex problems of population growth, human development and adjustment to a changing environment is being done here.\nIn a region with a distinctive culture, art portrays the plight of the Rajasthani countryside and recently inspired a collection of short poems, ''Footprints in the Sand,'' by Amit Jayaram. One of the poems says: The animals' feet leave their print on the desert's face. Hunger is so real, so very real, that it can make you walk around a barren tree looking for nourishment. Not once. Not twice. Not thrice. . . .\nFormerly the domain of Hindu Rajput maharajahs whose courts and cultures had come under strong Islamic influence, Rajasthan, with 44 million people, is now statistically a part of the nation's largest demographic bloc: the Hindu, Hindi-speaking belt of northern states that also includes Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and parts of Haryana. The area dominates Indian politics, a source of irritation to parts of the country where social and economic advances have been greater.\nIn the Hindi belt, where 40 percent of Indians live, literacy and the status of women are lower than in other states. More and more Indians regard those factors as major causes of a national failure to curb population growth. Rajasthan Ranks Last In Almost Everything\nRajasthan has a literacy rate of 24 percent, the lowest of all the major states, according to the 1981 census (the next will be in 1991). Only 5 percent of rural Rajasthani women read or write, and fewer than 10 percent of girls from age 5 to 9 attend school. Between a ninth (in cities) and a third (in rural areas) of all Rajasthani workers are 14 years old or younger, often a reflection of their economic importance to families.\nChild marriage is the norm, in defiance of national laws that set the legal age for women at 18 and for men at 21. Many Rajasthanis see this practice as a social necessity. A girl married before or at puberty is considered safe from extramarital sex and the stigma of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which could result in her murder at the hands of outraged relatives.\nThirty-year-old Kamla lives in the village of Kotri, northeast of Ajmer and a few miles from Sambhar Salt Lake. The land here is not as good as it is farther north, where irrigation projects have been started, or as bad as the deserts to the west. The soil is not unlike the rest of north India's scrub land.\nFarming on a self-sustaining scale is not possible in Kotri, and families depend on sheep and goats. The dirt roads are choked by herds being led in search of food. Camels are harnessed to plows where arable fields exist. A camel can look after itself, the local people say, letting the men of Kotri concentrate on their wool-and meat-producing flocks.\nMrs. Kamla, the daughter of a Brahman who allowed her to learn to read and write, thinks for a few minutes when asked how Rajasthan's growing population has affected Kotri, a town with a few hundred families living in small houses of concrete or stone. Lacking Land, Many Are Forced to Leave\n''There is less and less land,'' she says in Hindi, through an interpreter. ''Every year the water in the ground is more saline. Water is a big problem.\n''More people have to migrate, and migrate farther and farther, to find enough food for the animals,'' she says.\nThe lengthening winter and spring migrations, sometimes involving treks of hundreds of miles to the neighboring states of Madhya Pradesh or Gujarat, uproot entire families. Birth control can seem pointless when a father needs extra shepherds to patrol the edges of the wandering flocks, Mrs. Kamla says.\nThere are other migrations, too. From villages like these, thousands of Rajasthani men and women go to cities as far away as New Delhi or Bombay in search of manual work, often on construction sites.\nIn Kotri, Mrs. Kamla, is trying to make changes. She is working through the Social Work and Research Center, a nongovernmental development organization in Tilonia, 40 miles to the south. She is a woman in one of India's most male-dominated states, where village women, approached by outsiders, cover their faces with shawls or bright-colored saris. But Mrs. Kamla's high caste gives her standing, and village men acknowledge her as a leader. A Different Concept Of Population Control\nMrs. Kamla is trying to promote population control in Kotri by persuading women to use family planning services available at Government clinics. The mother of two girls, she seems skeptical of experts who say Indians will continue to have children until they have had enough boys, usually two, to guarantee support in old age and a son to light their funeral pyres.\n''The women here say they have so many children because there is no health care here,'' she says over tea, with guests sprawled on the floor in her small office. In India, family planning means sterilization, and in more than 90 percent of the cases, the operation is performed on women. Conditions are often unsanitary.\n''Women in this village say they do not want to be sterilized after two children, boys or girls, because the nearest doctor is far away and the services there are not very good,'' she says. ''So they ask: 'What happens if one of the babies falls sick and dies? Or what if I become ill after the operation? Who will look after me?' ''\nIn Naul, a village east of Tilonia, another high-caste woman, Ratan, is also trying to promote family planning. Married off at puberty to an older man, she was widowed while still in her teens. Her parents then took the bold step of allowing her to reject another marriage, and she began doing community work, using a knowledge of traditional medicine learned from her husband.\nTold about community work being done in rural Bangladesh, where villagers are trained in nutrition, Mrs. Ratan said most families here live on flat breads and lentils, and teaching them to prepare balanced diets would be meaningless, she explained, since there are almost no vegetables or fruits. In Jaipur, Fading Glory Of the Raj and Nature\nWhen the Rajasthani capital of Jaipur was built by the Maharajah Sawai Jai Singh of Amber in the mid-18th century, it was an Asian wonder. There were broad avenues drawn on a grid, shady colonnaded walkways along wide pavements, and a unity of architecture in private, public and commercial buildings. There was a drainage system.\nIn 250 years, Jaipur, a city built to serve 500,000 people, has become home to 1.5 or 2 million - no one really knows - and its glory has all but disappeared behind the huts of squatters and sidewalk vendors.\nAs the population continues to expand with the influx of people from the countryside, who erect small houses on the desert around the city's perimeter, its services have been severely strained. Roads are potholed; its once-famous drainage pipes clogged.\nThe destruction of Jaipur's natural environment has also been rapid and drastic, says Professor G. S. Nathawat of the Indira Gandhi Center for Ecological, Environmental and Population Studies at Rajasthan University. He takes a visitor to hills near the campus to see the latest phase in the city's deterioration.\nThere, forests are being razed and quarries dug to provide the booming construction industry with granite. The hills are protected woodlands and the quarrying illegal. But the business is so profitable that local officials can be bribed to make exceptions.\nOnly one small part of the forest backdrop remains, a section that university students have claimed and fenced. It is the last piece of recreation land left to them in Jaipur's once-wooded hills."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-09 00:00:00      \nEid holidaymakers faced long delay on their way home yesterday due to disruption of ferry services, long tailbacks on highways and late departure of some trains. Heavy rain throughout the day added to their woes. People heading for south-western districts such as Khulna, Jessore and Barisal were among the worst victims, as they had to wait for hours, first at bus terminals and then at ferry terminals. Ferry services were disrupted because of strong current in the Padma river. Those bound for north-eastern regions were stuck for hours in tailbacks on Dhaka-Bogura, Dhaka-Rajshahi and Dhaka-Mymensingh highways. And as on the previous day, most intercity trains heading for north-western districts ran one to three hours behind schedule. \"The overall situation is very bad,\" said Osman Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation. Although the three-day public holiday for Eid will begin Sunday, a large number of government and non-government employees left Dhaka yesterday. Many of them took leave for Wednesday (August 14), the only working day next week, to make their vacation longer. FERRY TERMINALS  Ferry services at Shimulia-Kathalbari saw a huge pressure of vehicles yesterday as water vessel operation resumed after 17 hours of suspension due to rough wave and strong current in the Padma. More than 300 vehicles were waiting at Shimulia at 7:00pm, said Abdul Alim, manager (commerce) of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) at Shimulia terminal. Only four ferries were in operation in the morning due to bad weather. The authorities were able to operate all the 16 ferries only after 12:00noon, when weather became normal. Ferries are taking 20 minutes more than in normal time to cross the river due to strong current, said Alim. Rafiqul Islam, a private service holder, said his bus of Tungipara Express was supposed to start from Gulistan at 12:00noon but started at 2:30pm, because of huge jam at Shimulia-Kathalbari. The disruption at Shimulia-Kathalbari eventually affected the ferry services at Paturia-Dauladia terminals. At 3:00pm, some 300 light vehicles, 100 buses and 400 trucks were waiting at Paturia end, although the situation improved a little in the evening, said Azamal Hossain, deputy general manager of BIWTC at Aricha office. He said they were operating 17 ferries and that three more would join their fleet soon. Several bus operators at Gabtoli terminal said they were facing problems to maintain schedule as buses were taking more time to return to Dhaka because of the gridlock at ferry terminals. Rifat Hossain, a private university student, said, \"I came to the terminal at 9:00am defying rain, but my bus has not arrived yet [at 11:00am]. I don't know how much longer I will have to wait.\" JAM ON HIGHWAYS People heading for northern districts faced traffic jam after crossing the Bangabandhu bridge for hours in the morning due to the sorry state of the road at different points and poor condition of Nolka bridge. Vehicles have to cross the bridge very slowly due to its poor condition, causing traffic jam from Bangabandhu bridge west zone to Nolka point, said Sayed Shahid Alam, officer-in-charge of Bangabandhu bridge west zone police station. Besides, repair work was underway on Dhaka (Hatikumrul)-Bogura and Dhaka (Hatikumrul)-Bonpara highways for the last day before Eid, causing traffic congestion. Vehicles heading for 22 districts of north, west and south have to cross Hatikumrul point, said Akteruzzaman, officer-in-charge of Hatikumrul highway police station. People also faced problem on the 13km stretch from Tongi Bridge to Joydevpur Chowrasta on Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway because of construction work of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). Under this project, the government would construct a 20.5km dedicated bus lane from Dhaka to Gazipur. But in the absence of a proper drainage system, parts of the four-lane highway were submerged after rain, disrupting traffic movement, said Osman Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation. The Gazipur City Corporation Mayor had assured of deploying 500 volunteers to control the situation, but that gave little relief due to rain, he added. CROWD AT KAMALAPUR Commuters travelling on trains to northern and north-western regions continued to suffer as all but one intercity trains were late by one to three hours. According to the Train Tracking Monitoring System, Chilahati-bound Nilsagar Express, Rajshahi-bound Silkcity, Rangpur-bound Rangpur Express, Panchagarh-bound Ekata Express, Rajshahi-bound Dhumketu Express and Silkcity Express and Khulna-bound Sundarban Express were late by about two hours to nearly three and a half hours. Chapainawabganj-bound Banolata Express was 20 minutes late to depart Kamalapur. Operations of trains on other routes were on time. Asked about the delay, Station Manager Aminul Hoque told reporters that holidaymakers usually took a long time to embark and disembark trains, resulting in such delays. Meanwhile, train service through Santaher-Lalmonirhat route that connects Dhaka and northern districts resumed yesterday, 22 days after it was suspended due to flood. WATERWAYS  Pressure of passengers at the country's largest launch terminal at Sadarghat increased in the evening. \"Some 80 launches are being operated during normal time. Around 25 more launches will run tonight [Thursday],\" said Alamgir Kabir, joint director of BIWTA. Usually, 7,080 launches ply 40 routes, mostly to the country's southern region from Dhaka's Sadarghat. Some 130 more will join the fleet to carry 8-10 lakh people, who travel by waterways during Eid vacation, according to transport operators. Meanwhile, the BIWTA said it would not allow motorcycles on any passenger-carrying vessels from Sadarghat terminal during Eid rush.

On Monday, almost 40 meters of the embankment, surrounding the city, was damaged by the receding flood water coming from Padma, and Jamuna rivers. Areas under Harisabha, Madhya, and Paschim Sreeramdi are at a huge risk due to the renewed erosion.   Locals said, the receding whirling flood water is at its most dangerous form, and in a sudden strike the erosion devoured a large area, while they were able to transfer six buildings.  They confirmed that already four households were washed away, and there are ten other at risk, including a temple. Abu Raihan, deputy engineer of Chandpur Water Development Board (WDB) said: \"We had no idea that the erosion would hit this area again. The whole embankment is at risk right now. \"We are dumping sand bags to reduce the casualties, and another 3000 bags are ready to be used if necessary,\" he added. Visiting the area, Deputy Commissioner Majedur Rahman Khan, Superintendent of Police Mahabubur Rahman, and WDB Deputy Engineer Abu Raihan promised to take every necessary step possible to save the city. Earlier, two months ago, in another erosion strike of Meghna a 300 meter area of the embankment was washed away."

Four villages of Pratapnagar and Shriula unions went underwater as the 120 ft BWDB embankment of Zone-2 suddenly collapsed, locals said. Many local residents have started volunteering to repair the embankment with whatever materials currently available. They fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands. On a field visit, thousands of villagers were seen to have volunteered to construct a temporary embankment while the district administration is said to have been busy controlling the coronavirus outbreak in the area. Moreover, the Kopotakkho River embankment collapsed earlier on April 8, flooding 1,000 bighas of farmlands and fish enclosures in three low-lying villages of the same area, waterlogging around 50 families in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishti Nandan villages under Pratapnagar union.  Locals say the 100-ft dam was already in a risky state, so it naturally could not sustain the strong pressure of tidal current and collapsed into the bottom of the Kopotakkho River. Contacted,  Pratapnagar Union Parishad Chairman Jakir Hossain held the water development board responsible in this regard, saying it was their negligence that led to the collapse of the embankment every year. \"Despite repeated complaints and appeals seeking sustainable protection of the embankment, the water development board failed to acknowledge the urgency of the issue.  \"Now, due to this recklessness, farmlands and fish enclosures on around 2,500 bigha of land have been flooded in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishtinandan villages. Moreover, almost 50 families have become waterlogged after two back-to-back incidents of flooding.\"  Md Arifuzzaman, of the local water development board, after visiting the site said he had arranged sandbags for the temporary emergency repair of the damaged embankment to minimize the extent of damage and protect the remaining lands.  \"The higher authorities will be notified promptly so that the necessary steps may be taken to permanently repair embankment.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-21 00:00:00      \nBoat making charge has doubled this year in the district, much to the worry of char people, especially fishermen and boatmen. Boat is very essential transport for them in the upcoming rainy season, but many of them cannot afford boats due to its high prices. Meanwhile, boat craftsmen are also not happy as they are not getting expected orders this year, said locals. It is charged Tk 1.20 lakh for making a 50-feet length boat, Tk 1 lakh for a 40-feet length boat and Tk 80,000 for a 30-feet length boat according to sizes but it was charged Tk 30,000 to Tk 70,000 last year and more less in 2017, said boat craftsmen and fishermen. Meher Ali, 48, of Teesta River Char Bairati in Kaliganj upazila, said around 30 to 40 char people jointly buy a big size boat for carrying people and goods during flood. Besides, a number of affluent men buy new boats during the time but they are showing less interest in this regard this time due to higher prices. So, old boats are now being repaired, said Meher.  Shafiqul Islam, project manager of a local NGO working for char people's livelihood, said there are 95 char areas in the Teesta and Dharla rivers. There are 42 ghats and two or four boats are anchored at each ghat. Around 5,000 fishermen are dependent on the rivers. Four to six fishermen use a big size boat for netting fish in the rivers, said Shafiqul, adding that there are two or three big boats for the villagers in each char area. Many char people have also middle size boat for personal uses. Craftsman Nazrul Islam, 44, of Teesta river Char Gaddimari in Hatibandha upazila, said the charge of boat making jumped as the price of wood shot up at a rapid speed this year. Another craftsman Abdus Samad, 55, of the area, said boat making order has fallen drastically this year. He got order for making three boats only this year while it was six last year and eight in 2017, Samad said, adding that they all 60 boat craftsmen in Teesta and Dharla char areas are facing same situation.

Dhaka newspapers put the death toll from flooding at 1,451. The Government's count was 630.\nOfficials reported an outbreak of diarrhea in all areas affected by the floods. By Friday evening at least 160,872 people had been afflicted by the illness and 102 had died from it, the officials said. In Dhaka, a city of 6 million, 21,412 new cases of diarrhea were reported Friday by the Government.\nThe rains Friday and early today added to hardships already suffered by millions living on roofs and treetops and huddled together in thousands of camps nationwide without safe drinking water, cooked food or medical care.\nHealth Ministry officials said 30,035 health workers were working to aid victims of water-borne diseases.\nThe officials acknowledged that there was not enough medicine to help all of those affected by the flooding.\nA senior official at the Agriculture Ministry said that ''if the water does not recede in the next couple of days, most of the rice crop will be damaged beyond any recovery.''\nThe Government has 1.3 million tons of grain and has issued an appeal for 3 million tons to compensate for damage to the rice crop. FLOODS CALLED MAN-MADE\nROME, Sept. 10 (Reuters) - The disastrous floods sweeping Bangladesh are now an unstoppable annual event and largely man-made, a United Nations expert said. The official, Tom Elhaut, director of projects in Bangladesh for the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said Friday that deforestation and soil erosion in the Himalayas has removed natural barriers to the monsoon rains and that dikes built to shield development projects have only increased the devastation.\nLast year's severe flooding in Bangladesh was said to be the worst in decades, but was thought to be a freak occurrence. Mr. Elhaut said that catastrophic flooding may become the norm. 'Bound to Recur'\n''This phenomenon is bound to recur,'' he said. ''These are the first two years of a sustained series of catastrophic floods.''\nHe said that this year the problem has grown worse because snow continued to melt in the Himalayas longer than usual and rainfall has been particularly heavy.\nBut he asserted that the environmental havoc wreaked by the destruction of Nepalese forests has done the most damage. ''It is to a large extent manmade,'' Mr. Elhaut said.\nA population increase in Nepal has increased demand for wood faster than trees can be replaced, and growing numbers of animals are eroding the remaining grasslands.\nThe resulting deforestation insures that rain and silt will rush into Bangladesh unchecked.\nOn Thursday, the Dhaka Government called for an international conference on controlling the flood problem, but Mr. Elhaut was skeptical that immediate results could be achieved."

According to local sources, the erosion has taken a serious turn in Ghagha, Mollikpur, Shierbr, and Makrail areas along Madhumati's banks, and at 15 points including Kargati, Soto Kalia, and Suktogram, of Nabaganga banks. People  of the affected areas have accused the local Water Development Board (WDB) of its negligence as water from the rivers poured into houses in Kalia upazila. \"I have never seen Nabaganga rise so much in the last 35 years. My house was destroyed in a matter of seconds,\" said Ilias Ali, a resident of Sukragram. Many, who have lost their houses in river erosion, are living with their relatives, but some like Julmat Sheikh of Kalia upazila's Noragati village, have been staying under the open sky with their families as they have nowhere else to go. Locals accused the administration of doing little to help them. According to the locals, the WDB has failed to prevent recurring erosion because of their lackadaisical attitude.  Babra-Hachla Union Parishad Chairman Mojammel Hossain said the situation will be brought under control soon. The local contractors declined to perform the emergency work at the beginning of monsoon as WDB officials usually demand 10 percent bribe for such projects, alleged contractors. When contacted, WDB Executive Engineer Md Zulfikar Ali declined to comment over the issue. Meanwhile locals formed a human chain in the district yesterday protesting the  negligence of WDB. Among others, Monisha Ghosh, Profullo Barman, Liton Kumar Ghosh, Kalyani Barman, and Modon Ghosh of the affected areas spoke at the gathering. They urged the administration to take immediate steps to save the people from becoming victims of river erosion."

      "text": "FILM; Satyajit Ray Gives Ibsen A Bengali Spin\n1989-05-07T05:00:00.000Z\nSatyajit Ray, Sidelined for more than half a decade by heart disease, is about to return to the cinema world with his 26th feature film - and first screen adaptation of a play, Henrik Ibsen's ''Enemy of the People.''\nThe film will have its premiere at the Cannes Festival, which begins on Thursday. Called ''Ganashatru'' in Bengali, the picture has already been picked up by distributors in Britain and France.\nIt won't open here in Calcutta till next fall, however, because the 67-year-old Mr. Ray, always the perfectionist, doesn't want to subject it to the city's un-air-conditioned theaters during the suffocating summer. ''They keep the fans whirring all the time,'' he said. ''It ruins the soundtrack.''\n''Why I chose a play for the first time in my career,'' Mr. Ray explained, relaxing in his Calcutta apartment on a warm Bengali night, ''was that for five years I hadn't made a film because of illness. Then the doctors suggested that I could go back to making films provided I worked only in the studio, not on locations.\n''If it had to be confined within the studio, then I started thinking of a play,'' he said. ''I had read Ibsen as a young man in college, and 'Enemy of the People' I remembered. I read him again. It seems the play could be brought up to date, transplanted to Bengal and turned into a completely Indian story, relevant to modern times.\n''So I decided on Ibsen, and we got going,'' he said. ''I wrote a screenplay. I adapted it. Three or four writings, and there it was, ready to be filmed.''\n''An Enemy of the People,'' a five-act play Ibsen wrote in 1882, tells the story of Thomas Stockmann, a doctor in a Norwegian resort who falls afoul of vested interest when he tries to sound a warning that the town's mineral baths have been polluted by industrial wastes. Seeing their local prosperity threatened, even liberals turn against him, seeking to suppress his scientific report. He is hounded into isolation, a man of principle who has become an enemy of the people.\nThe play was thought to be Ibsen's sharp retort to Norwegian society's negative response to his previous play, ''Ghosts.'' ''An Enemy of the People'' portrays a hypocritical middle class, easily persuaded to trade in their idealism for security.\nMr. Ray, who casts the man he calls ''my favorite actor,'' Soumitra Chatterji, as his Dr. Gupta, the Bengali Stockmann, said the shooting of the film went very well and that his health seemed to improve in the process. The director comes close to being worshiped by Calcuttans, who save their highest regard for artists. In a city where people will pay for tape of Mr. Ray's voice, his health is a matter of great local concern.\nDressed in the white cotton shirt and trousers Bengalis call ''Punjabi pajamas,'' Mr. Ray said he feels very close to Calcuttans and would not want to work anywhere else. Sounds of the city drifted through the large open windows as he talked in his huge, high-ceilinged study piled with papers and books. The elegant old apartment, a virtual film set for intellectual Calcutta life, has had to make only one concession to modernization: an elevator has been installed outside in the hall to save Mr. Ray, who has had coronary bypass surgery, a climb up several flights of stairs.\n''Everything was made inside the studio in Calcutta,'' he said of ''Ganashatru,'' a film about 100 minutes long. ''We had a 45-day schedule; we finished in 28 days. We worked incredibly fast, particularly because I had a wonderful set of actors. It was O.K. on the first take much of the time, so I didn't even have to take a second take or third take.\n''I had an ambulance and a doctor in attendance,'' he said. ''My cardiologist would occasionally drop in. My family physican would come. You see, they were interested because it was the story of a doctor. Apart from taking my blood pressure and pulse, they were interested in what was going on and how the doctor was behaving in the circumstances.\n''Their verdict was that I kept better when I was shooting,'' he said with a low laugh. ''The adrenaline, or whatever, caused an improvement in my health. They said that I should certainly be making one film a year, and that in the next film, I could even include a few outdoor scenes.''\nMr. Ray calls his version of ''An Enemy of the People'' ''a free adaptation of Ibsen. ''People will recognize Ibsen,'' he said. ''The debt to Ibsen is there. The five-act structure is there. But apart from that, I've had to make changes. You inevitably have to make changes. People behave differently, you see.'' Mr. Ray says he dealt with the staginess inherent in a dramatic work by pulling it farther and farther out from under the proscenium as he went along. This attempt to give the story a cinematic feel has wrought additional alterations in the Ibsen work.\n''The first act has a lot of words, a lot of entrances and exits,'' he said. ''But it's as cinematic as I could make it.\n''Gradually, more and more, as the story develops, it departs more and more from Ibsen and becomes more and more cinematic,'' he said. ''Particularly, the public meeting that takes place in the film is very, very unlike the scene in the play. It's very mobile and free: lots of camera movements, cuts and this and that and not a plethora of dialogue.''\nMr. Ray said he knew that the Ibsen play would have contemporary appeal in India as well as abroad, apart from its novelty as an Indian's view of a Scandinavian theatrical work.\n''It deals with topical problems,'' he said. ''Pollution is still a problem, as much as it was a hundred years ago - more than that, much more than that.'' Mr. Ray is optimistic that this timeliness of topics, among other attractionss - not the least beings his reputation - will help India's National Film Development Corporation, the production's backers, to market the film in the United States.\n''There is considerable interest abroad, partly because it's Ibsen,'' he said. ''And then, Arthur Miller had an adaptation of the Ibsen play, which has been playing in London recently and is doing very well. So I'm sure there's an additional reason for interest in this film.''\nLike this film, Mr. Ray's previous work, ''Ghare Baire'' (''Home and the World''), based on a story by Rabindranath Tagore, was also shown abroad before being screened in Calcutta. But Mr. Ray, who has an international stature not shared by most of the rest of India's directors - Bengali or otherwise - dismisses brusquely the contention of some Indians critics that his films are made for foreign audiences.\n''I always make my films primarily for my own audience,'' he said. ''I've never known what kind of film will export well. I have never been able to fathom what goes down well with the Western audience.\n''You know, I made a film once called 'The Music Room,' which I thought was so Indian, because it had lots of Indian classical singing and dancing and music and whatnot,'' he recalled. ''It deals with problems which are totally Indian. I thought that film would never export. But it did very well abroad, and now in France, it's my most popular film. It's considered to be one of the great films of all time.'' He laughed heartily. ''I just don't understand.'' ''My first film was a success in Calcutta, a big success in Calcutta, even before it won a prize in Cannes,'' he said of ''Pather Panchali,'' released in 1955. ''It's wrong that people say that my success abroad eventually gave me a footing here. That's not true.\n''I've always made films with an Indian audience in mind,'' he said. ''In fact, I've often had great difficulties in translating the dialogues, because they were so Indian, and so Bengali. So if I had thought of the Western audience first, then I certainly would have thought of different films.''\nMr. Ray said his deep attachment to the state of Bengal has led him to reject foreign film-making offers all of his life.\n''I could have made films in Hollywood,'' he said.''I've had offers, many offers, which I turned down, because I don't have my roots there. I want my roots to be in the place where I work. I'm deeply rooted here, and I'm only interested in Indian subjects.''\nThe director acknowledges that with a relatively small - by Indian standards - Bengali market, and with a ban on Indian films in neighboring, Bengali-speaking Bangladesh, he has been grateful for his success abroad.\n''The international market helps me to survive as a film maker,'' he said. ''There's no question about it, because I have a small market in India. That is to say, it's a Bengali-speaking audience primarily. Now, of late, I have started putting in English subtitles for Bombay, Delhi and Madras, but that still is a small market.''\nSatyajit Ray has won dozens of prizes. This year, President Francois Mitterrand of France came to Calcutta to present him with the Medal of the Legion of Honor. But Mr. Ray has never won an Oscar.\n''I've won almost every other kind of prize, except the Oscar,'' he said, reflectively. ''But you see, my films have never been entered for the Academy Awards. I have no agents in America, and it's just not happened. But I'm quite happy with what I have.''"

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-15 00:00:00      \nThe private and public sectors must work together to pull the country out of this crisis Some regrettable politics is taking place in the name of distribution of relief for the poor. Firstly, the government has not provided a strong and adequate stimulus package to help the poor and the ultra poor to fight the novel coronavirus epidemic. Secondly, even where it has sanctioned relief materials, only those who are well-connected or are known to the powerful local officials are getting the relief; and also, relief materials are getting stolen by the powerful government officials and local leaders of the ruling party. Many of them have already been arrested for this crime as well.  This is a matter of great disgust. Even though the coronavirus is a novel epidemic, we are not observing novel tactics in fighting it from the government's side. All the tools and tactics that are being used are from the olden days. The government is just treating this like any other natural calamity like a flood or a cyclone.  As such, relief distribution, too, has boiled down to photo opportunities for the government officials. One upazila chairman, Mahiuddin Biswas, has even gone so far as hitting a poor person who did not want to take a photo while taking relief. But corona is an ongoing problem, not a cyclone that you can solve merely by giving out some token relief materials after the calamity. The work that is to be done now is not merely damage control, it is situation management.  And without a medium-term strategic approach to fighting this crisis, we have no hope of coming out of it. When the photo session is over, the government officials are leaving, even when hundreds in their relief distribution area are still not taken care of. This is adding insult to injury for the poor people who are calling their local aid centres and hearing that government aid has already been distributed in that area. It is heartening to see that the government has declared that those who steal relief materials will face court cases along with administrative punishment, but we are still to see that in action comprehensively.   We have seen some government officials getting punishment for stealing relief, but this is not enough. If the government can really bring all the wrongdoers to books for stealing relief goods along with those who fail to adequately distribute relief in their area, that would be a great step forward. What we need now is a medium-term national plan for re-emerging from this disaster that has already gotten a grip on much of the country. Both the private and the public sectors must do their part to help the country get out of this disaster.  The relief materials need to be distributed properly, without scope for stealing or wasting otherwise by only distributing to the well-connected.  Even the amount that the government can do at this time of crisis is limited. As such, it is necessary for a comprehensive plan-of-action so that we make proper use of the resources we have. The relief distribution needs to be need-based. Even the middle class and lower middle class people, who are too shy to ask for help in these dire times, need to be paid attention to, and be brought under the social safety net through relief operations that transcend the lower classes and access the middle class.  In these scenarios, the best method for distributing relief materials would be to access the homes of the people, alongside distributing relief on the streets. Some initiatives like this have been taken by the home minister and the mayors of Dhaka City North and Dhaka City South, among others, and I really appreciate their efforts.  This is how it should be done, but there also needs to be a comprehensive plan to tackle this crisis in the medium term, if we are to come out of the crisis any time soon. Without that sort of comprehensive planning, it will be hard for us to spring out of this disaster strong. Anupam Debashis Roy is an editor and organizer of Muktiforum."

A statement issued by the Chief Minister Office said the victims had attended the three-day religious congregation and contracted Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The state government said two had died while undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad, one each in Apollo Hospital and Global Hospital. Two other deaths were reported from Nizamabad and Gadwal. It also added that special teams under district collectors have identified those who came in contact with these people, and they were shifted to hospitals.  The authorities also urged people who attended the prayers in Delhi to contact officials. \"Telangana health department requests those who attended the congregation at Markaz to voluntarily report at hospitals,\" it said, adding that the government would conduct tests and offer treatment to them free of cost. Thousands of Indians and hundreds of foreigners had attended the conference that took place on March 9 and 10 in the densely populated Nizamuddin area of Delhi. Ten of the 17 confirmed cases in Tamil Nadu on March 30 were also of people who had participated in the congregation. India has recorded 1,251 cases of the coronavirus, with 32 deaths, but health experts say the country of 1.3 billion people could see a major surge in cases that could overwhelm its weak public health system."

The Dhaka met office recorded 48mm of rainfall from 12pm-2pm on Friday but the poor state of the capital's drainage system ensured that two hours of rain was enough to flood a considerable part of the city. Mirpur Road, Nayapaltan, Green Road, Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, Motijheel, Rampura, Banani-11, Tejgaon, Karwan Bazar, Monipuri para, Kazipara, Begum Rokeya Sarani, Mohammadpur, and Dhanmondi were among the areas flooded by the rain, with water even entering homes and business establishments in low-lying areas. The situation was even worse in areas such as Malibagh and Rokeya Sharani, where road renovation work and ongoing development projects, like the Metro Rail, pose further obstacles for commuters and residents.  However, the Gulshan area saw little to no water logging, following the revamp of the drainage system during the tenure of late Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) mayor Anisul Huq. 36% of Dhaka's water bodies filled up in 9 years At least 3,483 acres of water bodies and lowlands across the metropolitan area in Dhaka have been filled up in the last nine years, according to a recent study. Presenting the findings of the study at an event on April 25, the Bangladesh Institute of Planners (BIP) General Secretary Adil Mohammad Khan said 36% of the water bodies in Dhaka had been filled up, violating the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) for the capital adopted in 2010. The parts of the city under the jurisdiction of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkah (Rajuk) had 100,937 acres of water bodies and lowlands nine years ago, but 22% of those - 22,156 acres - have been filled up since then, greatly contributing to the perennial water-logging issue, he added. The report was prepared on the basis of satellite images. No immediate relief In Dhaka, the drainage system, water pump, canals, and rivers are maintained by a total seven government agencies:  The Bangladesh Water Development Board (WDB), Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakha (Rajuk), Dhaka District Administration, Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Dhaka Wasa), Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) and Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC).   Each of the organizations works separately to improve the drainage system in different parts of the capital. Dhaka Wasa works on the storm drain system, which handles surface water. Most drains in Dhaka are clogged by solid waste and plastic garbage, due to irregular cleanup and lack of awareness of city dwellers. Dhaka used to have 65 natural canals running throughout the city, but the number currently stands at only 26, as most of them are clogged by garbage and illegal occupiers. Urban planner and BIP General Secretary Adil Mohammad Khan said the city has been planned in a manner that does not consider the connectivity of the water management. \"There is no shortcut remedy. We have already blocked the natural connectivity to accommodate the high population density in this mega-city. We have made it a concrete jungle. Now, we have to improve the efficiencies of all existing water bodies first, and then immediately recover all the canals from grabbers and re-install their connectivity, to help the water drain from city properly,\" he added. Both Dhaka city mayors said illegally occupied city canals must be reclaimed to save Dhaka, as the blocking of the canals is largely responsible for the water logging.  DNCC Mayor Atiqul Islam said the water in Dhaka should reach rivers through canals and drainage lines of Dhaka Wasa.  \"However, the drainage lines are clogged and canals have been illegally occupied,\" he added. \"Dhaka was supposed to have 12% Aadhar (reservoir), which is now only 3%. All the ponds and water bodies have been filled up. Also, unplanned urbanization has put us in trouble, as 330 sq-km out of the total 400 sq-km area of Dhaka has already full of houses, hampering water flow routes,\" the DNCC mayor further said, adding that the authorities are in the process of mapping problem areas to find a solution. Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) Mayor Sayeed Khokhon said: \"Due to lack of proper maintenance of box culverts, water flows very slowly- at maybe at 5-10% the speed of the usual flow.\" Criticizing Dhaka Wasa, he said most city canals have been illegally occupied, and the few remaining ones are not even cleaned regularly. The DSCC mayor emphasized the need to increase the capacity of public service organizations and raise public awareness in order to address water logging. Dhaka Water Supply & Sewerage Authority (Wasa) Managing Director Taqsem A Khan could not be reached for comment as he is out of the country, while other senior Dhaka Wasa officials refused to speak on the matter."

Bangladesh's Mushfiqur Rahim and Tamim Iqbal, two of those who were witness to the incident, took to twitter to express their mental state. Other legends, like Virat Kohli, Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Akhtar joined the condemnation of such a heinous attack while breathing a sigh of relief at the safety of the Bangladesh team. Bangladesh batsman Tamim Iqbal was distraught as he was one of the players who were on their way to the Masjid AL Noor -- one of the mosques where the shooting took place. He wrote in his official twitter handle @TamimOfficial28: \"Entire team got saved from active shooters!!! Frightening experience and please keep us in your prayers.\" Wicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim wrote in his twitter handle @mushfiqur15: \"Alhamdulillah Allah saved us today while shooting in Christchurch in the mosque...we r extremely lucky...never want to see this things happen again....pray for us.\" Bangladesh team's performance analyst Srinivas Chandrasekaran described his experience @chinu1501: \"Just escaped active shooters!!! Heartbeats pumping badly and panic everywhere!!\" Ace all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan -- currently in Bangladesh nursing an injury which forced him to miss the New Zealand tour -- was relieved to learn that his teammates were safe. His official twitter account @Sah75official said: \"I have nothing to say about the active shooting in New Zealand that took place all I want to say is I'm grateful to almighty Allah for saving my brothers my teammates! Alhamdulillah.\" Pakistani legend Shahid Afridi spoke to Tamim over phone after the incident, enquiring about the team's safety. The popular all-rounder later posted this tweet @SAfridiOfficial: \"Horrifying tragedy #Christchurch. I found NZ one of the safest, most peaceful places, people are friendly. Spoke to Tamim big relief Bangladesh squad/staff is safe. World must together! stop hatred! Terrorism has no religion! Prayers for bereaved families. May Allah bless the departed.\" The scheduled third Test between hosts New Zealand and Bangladesh, which was scheduled to begin on Saturday in Christchurch, was cancelled after discussion between both cricket boards. International Cricket Council (ICC) praised the decision to cancel the Test. ICC CEO David Richardson was quoted in a press release: \"Our thoughts and sincere condolences go out to the families and friends of those affected by this horrendous incident in Christchurch. Both teams, staff and match officials are safe and the ICC fully supports the decision to cancel the Test match.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-13 00:00:00      \nDespite a court directive to stop the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics, the health authorities have taken no concrete steps in this regard, raising the spectre of superbugs, which cause some seven lakh deaths globally per year. Sale of antibiotics without requiring prescription from registered physicians is still high in the country, The Daily Star has found visiting over two hundred drug stores and talking to experts. Bacteria-fighting drugs known as antibiotics help control and destroy many of the harmful organisms that make people sick. But overuse and misuse of antibiotics prompt some strains of bacteria to make a small change in their DNA and become antibiotic-resistant \"superbugs\", experts say.  There is no data on deaths caused by superbugs in Bangladesh, but professors at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) say about 70 percent of the deaths at ICUs are caused by AMR [antimicrobial resistance] infections. AMR is a situation when microorganisms like bacteria, virus and some parasites resist medicinal interventions. \"Problem is people don't know which drugs are antibiotics. Around 15 lakh people are taking antibiotics daily and most of them don't have prescriptions,\" Prof Sayedur Rahman, chairman of pharmacology department at the BSMMU, told The Daily Star. A recent study, carried out jointly by the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) and the WHO, shows that antibiotics consumption in Bangladesh has increased by 30.81 percent in the last two years. The DGDA and the WHO used data from the pharmaceutical companies, and the study report was released on November 27 last year. Earlier on April 25, the High Court ordered the DGDA to take steps to stop the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics.  The ruling came after a writ petition was filed by Advocate Sayedul Haque Suman over the matter. The writ was spurred by a report in UK's The Telegraph, which cited a report this newspaper ran under the headline \"A big cause for health concern\" in April last year. High-ups of the DGDA -- the apex regulatory body for pharmaceuticals -- claimed they had done their best. But in reality, they only issued a notice in May to all district commissioners and civil surgeons, asking them to take steps in line with the court directive. The notice was followed-up by a reminder a month later. That was the extent to which the DGDA acted. DGDA Director Ruhul Amin told The Daily Star, \"Our drug inspectors are regularly advocating this issue at meetings with stakeholders.\" Queried further, he again mentioned that \"awareness was all important\" in this regard. People concerned, however, said the DGDA's action was \"just to save its skin\". Meanwhile, a laboratory analysis by the Department of Microbiology and Immunology (DMI) of BSMMU, conducted from 2010 to 2018, has found a sharp rise in the number of superbugs in the country. In 2010, superbugs and multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria were detected in 6.5 percent cases of all patients seen. But it increased to 11-14 percent in 2018, according to the study. Experts said it is the inappropriate and overuse of antibiotics which leads to the rise of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or superbugs, The AMR infections have become a global threat, with 10 million deaths predicted to be caused by it by 2050 if things go unchecked, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). But the country's authorities concerned seem to be taking the matter lightly. GROUND REALITY: PROFIT OVER PRESCRIPTION\n Recently, The Daily Star correspondents have visited drug stores in Farmgate, in front of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital in the capital. They have also been to pharmaceutical stores in both urban and rural areas in Savar, Rangpur, Khulna, Sylhet, Chattogram, Mymensingh and Rajshahi. The scenario was similar everywhere. At half a dozen drug stores at a rural market in Rangpur's Pirgachha upazila, this correspondent last month found antibiotics being sold either without prescriptions or as suggested by medicine sellers. \"As antibiotics work better and are more profitable, we sometimes do suggest it. People usually don't buy full dose of antibiotics. Besides, they are also reluctant to visit doctors because it would cost them additional money,\" a medicine shop owner in the village market told The Daily Star. Visiting at least 25 stores in Khulna's Hazrat Market, Moilapota intersection, Natun Rasta intersection and in front of Khulna Medical College Hospital, The Daily Star correspondents found customers buying antibiotic drugs without any prescription. Jalal Ahmed, owner of Afroz Medical Hall at Moilapota intersection, said he was not aware of any formal instruction from the authorities on not selling the drugs without prescription. There are more than a hundred pharmaceutical stores on the Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital Road. A medicine seller there said they make a huge profit from antibiotics sale. \"We have not got any direction in this regard,\" he said. The Daily Star correspondents witnessed the same situation in Chowhatta and Amberkhana areas in the city. Our Mymensingh correspondent and Rajshahi University correspondents also found antibiotics being sold over the counter in the two districts. Usually people suffering from dysentery, diarrhoea, food poisoning, common cold, cough, fever, toothache, and ear and throat pain use self-prescribed antibiotic, shows a 2014 study conducted in Rajshahi and published in the journal of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information. According to the DGDA website, there are 118,901 licensed retail drug shops across the country. A 2015 study by the System for Improved Access to Pharmaceuticals and Services, however, revealed the existence of approximately an equal number of unlicensed retail drug stores in the country, shows WHO website. A majority (68 percent) of the clients visiting these drug shops came by self-referral and without a prescription, the study showed. For another study, the Institute of Epidemiology, Diseases Control and Research (IEDCR) analysed some 14,669 samples collected from nine public hospitals across the country from 2017 and 2019. It found Ceftriaxone, a watch group drug, to be the most used antibiotics, and that the drug's effectiveness has gone down by 10 to 92 percent in killing several bacteria. According to the WHO, antibiotics are classified into three groups -- \"access group\" used for a wide range of primary level infection, \"watch group\" used against higher resistance bacteria, and \"reserve group\" only to be used when all alternatives fail. Imipenam, another watch group drug, has been found to be 10 to 76 percent ineffective. If these don't work, it only leaves to a few other antibiotics. \"It indicates we are rapidly going to exhaust rest of the available antibiotics in our hand,\" said Dr Zakir Hossain Habib, principal scientific officer at the IEDCR, who led the study. DGDA INITIATIVES -- NOT ENOUGH? On the DGDA directive on stopping the sale of antibiotics without prescriptions, several deputy commissioners said the DGDA initiative had a very little to no impact on creating awareness on the matter. \"We have held a meeting with all stakeholders. However, we haven't conducted any mobile court drive yet,\" Md Asib Ahsan, DC of Rangpur, told The Daily Star, adding that they were focusing on raising awareness first. He also said the issue deserves more campaigning and the DGDA needs to do more planning. Asked, DGDA Director Ruhul Amin couldn't even say whether the sale and consumption of antibiotics without prescription was a punishable offence. A DGDA official, however, said any medicine seller could be punished under the existing law for selling antibiotics without proper prescription. Such punishment, however, has yet to be meted out. BSMMU's Prof Sayedur Rahman said the DGDA can impose a fine of up to Tk 40,000 for the offence. He said cases can be filed against the owner of the drug store and it also can be sealed off. Contacted, Health Minister Zahid Malek apparently defended the DGDA, saying, \"It has a shortage of manpower. It is tough for them to monitor drug stores across the country.\" The DGDA has only 46 drug superintendents in its 54 district offices, said its sources. COORDINATION IS THE KEY Experts says the sale of antibiotics over the counter continues unabated mainly due to a lack of monitoring from the DGDA and coordination between the drug administration and the local administration. \"There are around 200 staffers, including 20 doctors, under the health ministry at each upazila. They can easily be involved in raising awareness on AMR [antimicrobial resistance],\" Prof Sayedur Rahman, who led the antibiotic DGDA-WHO antibiotic consumption study, told The Daily Star, adding that the DGDA cannot sit idly for the recruitment of manpower. He also said physicians often unnecessarily prescribe antibiotics \"due to a lack of facilities to carry out antibiotic sensitivity [ABS] test. Doctors in 55 districts do not have ABS test facility, he said. Dr Zakir Hossain Habib, principal scientific officer at the IEDCR, however, said the required tests could be done manually with the existing facilities as an alternative to the ABS tests. For that, the government must appoint enough lab technicians and ensure sufficient supply of reagents. Dr Muniruddin Ahmed, professor of clinical pharmacy and pharmacology at Dhaka University, suggested involvement of all local bodies in the fight against over-the-counter sale of antibiotics. He wants the DGDA to take the lead. Prof Sayedur Rahman suggested marking boxes of antibiotics red so that people can easily know they are prescription drugs.

Moreover, 34,999 houses were damaged completely and 5.47 lakh were damaged partially. Reportedly, relief materials for the affected people were also inadequate, although the government might have made sufficient allotment. These people are still struggling to find a livelihood and rebuild their houses. And as the flood water recedes, river erosion has started taking its toll in many areas, destroying schools and homesteads of people. While the state minister for the ministry of disaster management and relief has termed TIB's allegations as baseless, the fact remains that many of the flood victims have been left with no relief at all. We think the government should move away from its denial mode and conduct investigations into the allegations made by the corruption watchdog. The institutional limitations in the government's planning of relief distribution, rehabilitation programmes, emergency response and overall preparedness for such a disaster should be addressed properly for better management of floods in the future. Also, stringent action should be taken against those, including the public representatives, involved in corruption."

      "text": "Death Toll in India After Heavy Floods Is Reported at 1,000\n1988-10-03T05:00:00.000Z\nThe death toll from floods that have submerged many areas in India's northwest was nearing 1,000 today, according to reports from the region. Hundreds of thousands of residents in four states have been evacuated to higher ground.\nMost severely affected in more than a week of flooding has been Punjab State, where many acres of farmland have been inundated. A state government spokesman in Chandigarh said Saturday that at least 400 people had died in the state in nearly 9,000 affected villages and towns.\nLocal news organizations put the number of deaths in Punjab at about 600, with some areas still cut off and unable to report casualties. The districts of Ferozepore, Jullundur and Amritsar were among those hardest hit. Food Stocks Are Gone\nTens of thousands of farm animals have perished. Food stocks have been destroyed, prompting the Government to begin dropping relief supplies by air. [ A boat evacuating people from floodwaters in Pakistan's Punjab Province capsized and 35 people aboard were feared drowned, Reuters reported. It quoted the state-run Radio Pakistan as saying seven bodies had been recovered after the incident near Faisalabad. ] The states of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir have reported hundreds more casualties as rivers swollen by record monsoon rains have poured into the fertile plains and valleys of the northwest. In Rajasthan, officials said they were on the alert for rising water in rivers and canals that pass through Punjab. Flooding Near the Capital\nThe Jumna River, which runs along the eastern edge of the capital, has also overflowed, disrupting the lives of many poor Indians who erect makeshift homes on its wide banks. But apart from the flooding of some city roads, the functioning of the capital has not been badly affected.\nToday, flood waters were reported to be receding in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. But the rivers are still high in Punjab, a politically sensitive state where four years of violence has already damaged the economy.\nThis weekend, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi named a Cabinet committee to open talks with the legal political opposition in the state, which Mr. Gandhi visited on Sept. 21. The talks, announced before the floods, are intended to consider solutions for the state's political and economic deterioration.\nViolence, which has claimed at least 2,000 lives this year, began with a call for a separate homeland by Sikh militants, followed by an armed response by New Delhi. Terrorism is now no longer confined to the Sikh dispute, but has spread into general lawlessness, Punjabis say. Robberies and attacks occur daily.\nDeforestation in the Himalayas and their foothills is easing the rush of water into India's northern states, experts say. The barren, eroded hills along the mountainous roof of India and nearby Nepal are also thought to have contributed to recent heavy flooding in northeastern India and in Bangladesh, where several large river systems enter the Bay of Bengal. Cooperation With Bangladesh\nBangladesh has been seeking international support in studying the river systems and making recommendations for joint projects to control the waters. Bangladesh's President, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, visited India on Thursday to raise his concerns with Prime Minister Gandhi.\nThe Indians told General Ershad that New Delhi wanted to keep the discussions confined to an Indian-Bangladesh commission, and not involve other nations at this point. India, where politicians are sensitive to what they see as infringements on national sovereignty, has long resisted the ''internationalization'' of the rivers issue.\nIndia has proposed building a canal across Bangladeshi territory to link the Brahmaputra and Ganges systems to drain water from the former into the latter.\nIn Bangladesh, where the idea of an ''Indian'' canal has never been popular, a sense of desperation is growing, spurred by this year's devastating floods. The floods submerged nearly three-quarters of the country and left millions homeless.\nGeneral Ershad plans to go ahead with his plans to visit Nepal, Bhutan and China to discuss possible projects for managing the Himalayan rivers.\nHe is scheduled to go to Katmandu on Monday, less than a week after Indian officials made it clear that they did not want to involve Nepal in talks."

Hundreds of thousands of Muslim devotees braved a cold spell to take part in the final prayers on the banks of the Turag in Gazipur's Tongi on Saturday, amid heightened security measures. On the second day of the first phase's Ijtema, the second largest congregation of the Muslim community after Hajj, Islamic scholars delivered sermons on different aspects of Islam in the light of the holy Quran and Hadith on Sunday. The Muslim devotees have thronged the Ijtema ground under the open sky while more than 1,500 foreign devotees from 35 countries, including from Jordan, Libya, Africa, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Palestine, the USA, Turkey, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, England, joined the Ijtema from the first day of the second phase. People from all corners of the country started streaming into Tongi since Saturday evening to join the Akheri Munajat. Many made the journey to the venue on foot as a large part of Dhaka Mymensingh Highway was closed to traffic. Md Anwar Hossain, commissioner of Gazipur Metropolitan Police, said the plying buses will remain closed on Dhaka-Mymensingh highway from Gazipur Chowrasta intersection to Mohakhali in the capital from 4am for smooth movement of the devotees. Buses from northern districts will remain halted at Konabari in Gazipur while all link roads towards Tongi will be closed during the Akheri Munajat, he added. Besides, around 8,500 members of law enforcement agencies have been deployed for ensuring security in and around the Ijtema ground. Four more Muslim devotees have died at the Bishaw Ijtema venue in Friday, January 17. The total death tolls of the devotees in the 55th Bishwa Ijtema stood at 5 so far, , including 13 in the first phase. They passed away in their respective tents between Friday morning and Saturday evening, said Md Manjur Rahman, deputy commissioner of Gazipur Metropolitan Police. Bangladesh Railway (BR) has scheduled special trains for easy transportation of devotees on the occasion of the first and second phase of 55th Biswa Ijtema. Earlier, the first phase of the Ijtema was held on January 10 to 12 at the same venue. Followers of Moulana Zubair joined the first phase of Ijtema while the second phase is alloted to the disciples of Moulana Mohammed Saad Kandhalvi, a Delhi-based member of the Tabligh Jamaat Supreme Council. Tablig Jamaat has been organizing the Biswa Ijtema on the bank of Turag river since 1967. Now, Ijtema is being held in two phases since 2011 to ease the accommodation problem."

In Manikganj, ferry and launch services between Paturia, and Daulatdia have remained disrupted due to persistent heavy current on the Padma River. Swades Prasad, executive engineer of floating workshop at Paturia terminal, said: \"Of the 16 ferries, two are completely inoperable. Of the remaining 14, only four utility ferries, and two Ro-Ro ferries are in operation at present.\" Zillur Rahman, acting deputy general manager of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (Aricha), said: \"We were forced to suspend the operation of most of the ferries following the heavy current in the river.\" Visiting the area, this correspondent found around 500 vehicles stuck at the Paturia terminal waiting to cross the river. In Rajbari, a similar situation prevailed at the Daulatdia terminal, as terminal number 1, and 2 have remained shut due to strong current of the Padma River.  Rajbari Water Development Board (WDB) Engineer Arifur Rahman said: \"Debgram and Daulatdia area are at risk of erosion. If they are affected by the erosion the ferry terminals will be affected as well. In order to prevent erosion sand bags are being dumped in the banks of the river there.\" In Madaripur, as the water level of the Padma River started to recede, erosion on its banks has been taking an alarming shape in Shibchar upazila. Kathalbari Primary School was swallowed by the Padma River yesterday, and in the past week, a bridge, along with roads, shops, and numerous homes fell victim to the erosion. Shibchar UNO Md Asaduzzaman said: \"Relief materials will promptly be supplied to the affected, and alternative measures will be arranged for the students who have lost their schools.\"  WDB Executive Engineer Partho Pritom Saha said: \"To prevent erosion at Bandarkhola, Kathalbari, and Char Janajat unions sandbags are being dumped on the banks of Padma.\" In Narail, ever since the opening of Farakka Gates, the water level of the Modhumoti, and Noboganga rivers rose alarmingly, and new regions are being affected, waterlogging thousands of locals. Water levels of Padma, Mohananda recede in Chapainawabganj The water levels of Padma, and Mohananda rivers started receding in the district Saturday morning, reports UNB. According to the district WDB, the Padma water level fell by at least 5cm, and Mohananda by 2cm in the last 24 hours till yesterday morning. Padma was flowing 38cm, and Mohananda 16cm below the danger level. Abdur Rajib Raju, Durlabhpur UP chairman of Shibganj, said a large number of houses, and roads in ward 4 of his union are still under water. The water started receding two days ago, and if it continues the situation will improve soon, he added. Around 58,000 people in 16 unions of the district were stranded when Mohananda, and Punorbhaba rivers breached their banks. \"Some 11,300 hectares of cropland have been flooded,\" said Manjurul Huda, deputy-director of the Department of Agriculture Extension."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-09 00:00:00      \nIndia is going to draw around 51.54 litres of water per second from the Feni river once the deal between Bangladesh and India is implemented, but doubts remain as to how much impact it would have on Bangladesh.   The Feni water-sharing agreement was signed in the presence of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi on Saturday. Some experts say the drawing of water will have little impact on the downstream of the Feni river.  Yet, the deal regarding withdrawal of 1.82 cusec of water by India, to be used as drinking water for the people of Sabroom town in Tripura, triggered sharp criticism in Bangladesh.   The condemnation comes due to India dillydallying on signing the Teesta deal for last eight years even after finalisation of the deal and suspicions regarding the nature of the deal.  \"I think withdrawal of 1.82 cusecs of water will have very little impact in the downstream. After a series of discussions, we have agreed to provide them the water for drinking purpose. There is no shortage of water during the monsoon and during the lean period, the river has a minimum flow of the water around 110 cusecs,\" said KM Anwar Hossain, member, Joint Rivers Commission (JRC), Bangladesh. He explained the quantity of water in one cusec water was equivalent to 28.32 litres of water flow per second. So, 1.82 cusec will be equivalent to 51.54 litres water per second.  When asked when the water-sharing would start, Anwar said it would start soon as the MoU was already signed.   While there is optimism on a government level, questions remain regarding how much water is to be withdrawn and how it would be monitored.  Professor Saiful Islam of the Institute of Water and Flood management, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), said the discharge of Feni river was around 750 cusecs during the monsoon, while it was over 100 cusecs in winter.  \"That means they are going to withdraw around two to three percent of water from the river during the lean period, which would not be a problem.  \"But if they withdraw more than 1.82 cusecs, it may affect Muhuri-Feni irrigation project based on the water from Feni river,\" he said.  Around 230.076 hectares land area is under the Muhuri-Feni irrigation project. He, however, said it was necessary to sign deals on sharing of the water of all transboundary rivers.  Locals living by the Feni river in Khagrachhari said India had been withdrawing water from the Feni river \"unofficially\", by setting up small pumps at zero point.  Regarding the deal, many said there was confusion whether it was to draw 1.82 cusec of water or more.   \"If they withdraw 1.82 cusec of water, it will not have much impact downstream. But, if they withdraw 1.82 cumec instead, it will be a disaster for us because 1.82 cumec is 35 times higher than 1.82 cusec. So, the government should make it clear about the signed MoU,\" said M Inamul Haque, Chairman, Institute of Water & Environment.  According to the joint statement of Hasina's official visit to India, it is mentioned that 1.82 cusec of water will be withdrawn. A copy of the MoU, however, is yet to be made available on public domains. In regards to monitoring, JRC member Anwar said, \"Now India will invite Bangladesh to oversee the withdrawal activities jointly with them. They will set up water pumps to withdraw the water, while officials of Bangladesh and India will jointly monitor the activities,\" he said.  \"The officials will monitor some issues like whether the withdrawal activities cause any harm to the river, so it does not cause any erosion on the river bank,\" he said.

M. Ershad said on Wednesday that the death toll was 250, but the Government's count usually is considered low.\nDhaka, a city of four million, is virtually cut off from the rest of the country. The Ministry of Communications said 18 highways leading out of the capital were closed because of flooding. A fourth of the city was under water, at depths that ranged from a few inches to several feet. No deaths have been reported in Dhaka.\nMost of the flooding was in poor and middle-class neighborhoods, but by today the water had started seeping into districts on Dhaka's northeast side where foreign diplomats and wealthy Bangladeshis live."

      "text": "India's Drought Is Worst in Decades\n1987-08-16T05:00:00.000Z\nDawn broke in these parched farmlands today with gray clouds, raising a few hopes of rain. But by midmorning the sun was ablaze, once again burning farmers' hopes of relief from India's driest rainy season in decades.\n''I am 75 years old, and I have never seen anything this bad,'' said Naufat Mohammed, a white-bearded farmer, looking at the cracked earth around a well. ''This is God's will, but God is angry with us.''\nAfter weeks of false hopes that the summer monsoon rains would come, India faces the prospect of devastation to the national economy, the uprooting of hundreds of thousands of people and the need for a huge relief effort to distribute drinking water and prevent starvation.\nThe drought, which Government officials say is unprecedented in intensity, has already spread through most of the country, hitting hardest in the northern grain belts. There wells, reservoirs and water tanks are running at dangerously low levels or are already dry. Rain 75% Below Normal\nLess than a third of the country has received normal rainfall this year, with the hardest-hit areas as low as 75 percent below normal.\nAlthough the monsoon floods cause many deaths, the rains are normally one of the great life-giving forces in India, central to its culture and the expectations of its people. The monsoon season is incubated as heat in the subcontinent increases while the Indian Ocean to the south remains cool, unleashing a stormy mix of air that then pushes up from the south.\nAlmost nothing is anticipated as much as summer rains carried by winds heading northward starting in early June. The failure of the monsoon is a severe blow to Indian morale as well as to the survival of its people.\nThere have been no signs yet of death or starvation, but experts say they fear that a large-scale loss of cattle could wipe out the livelihoods of countless families. Milk production has already fallen sharply as the Government struggles to rush fodder such as spoiled wheat or sugar cane to drought areas. Driest in 80 Years\nNew Delhi, 50 miles northwest of here, is suffering its driest season in 80 years. Residents of New Delhi and other cities are suffering water shortages and widespread power cuts so electricity can be diverted to farm areas to run hard-pressed wells and irrigation systems. Other cities are experiencing the same thing.\nAgriculture experts say they fear that India's summer grain crop, once expected to be 90 million metric tons, could fall drastically short. This would force India to rush its 23 million tons of buffer grain, now in storage, throughout the countryside.\nSuch relief efforts helped to check starvation in the drought of 1979-80, which was described as the worst in this century nationwide. The army was called out to help distribute drinking water by train and military trucks, something many experts think could happen on an even larger scale this year.\nOn top of all these problems, the areas in eastern India that are not suffering from lack of rain are experiencing heavy rains and flooding. News reports say that more than 140 people have died in the northeastern states of Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. In neighboring Bangladesh, the death toll has been reported at 350. Emergency Committee Created\nFaced with a crisis that could dwarf all his other political difficulties, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi recently established an emergency committee, of which he is chairman, to oversee drought relief efforts.\nOfficials say a food distribution and rural employment program costing about $1.5 billion is about to be announced. A water distribution plan was announced in Parliament today. These and other steps are certain to worsen the national budget deficit and curtail other development programs.\nAides to Mr. Gandhi say they also fear that bureacratic problems could undercut Government efforts, creating unrest and disenchantment throughout the north. A senior member of the Gandhi Cabinet said he was afraid that on his next visit to his constituency villagers would throw stones at him.\nOfficials say that even if the monsoon were to come now at full force it would not save crops in most areas. The biggest fear is that for some reason the rains may never come at all this year. Although most of India depends on the monsoon of July and August, rainfall lingering into the fall is essential if farmers are to recoup this year with their winter crop of wheat. 'Cannot Image the Horror'\n''If the rain fails even in September, we cannot imagine the horror,' said a former Agriculture Minister, Rao Birendra Singh. He said that from all indications so far, the 23 million metric tons of reserve grain should be enough to prevent starvation - ''provided we do not lose our next wheat crop.''\nThe actual reason for the failure of the monsoon is unclear, although meteorologists say it appears to be part of odd global weather patterns this year, including unusually hot weather in Europe and the United States.\nTwo-thirds of India's annual grain crop is supposed to be grown during the summer monsoon. The problem is especially acute in the 70 percent of the country's farmlands that have no irrigation and depend entirely on rain. In these areas, fields that are normally iridescent-green with rice are bare, brown or stunted.\nBut even the developed farmlands of the north in Punjab and here in Haryana, where irrigation is extensive, are suffering. The Financial Development Commissioner of Haryana said the state had reached ''near-famine conditions.'' Grain Fields Should be High\nA canal running along the main road here was bone dry today. Farmers complained that a 60-foot well was useless because the water it pumped was brackish and salty.\n''This water would destroy any crops,'' said Jivan Singh, whose family members were plowing a nearby field with two oxen in the hope that at some point rain would come and something, perhaps vegetables, could be planted. A few scrubby sprouts of millet grew at his ankles. He said the grain in this field was normally several feet high at this time.\nThe drought has been most devastating in the sandy western regions of Gujarat and Rajasthan states, which have had unusually little rain in three or four years. In these areas, recent visitors say, whole village populations have begun moving in search of water for cattle and people."

The furious Jamuna has devoured his home, even the land on which his humble abode stood.  For over a month, Ahed, along with his family of five, and other flood victims, have taken shelter on a nearby field. They all have to pay a small sum of rent to occupy that space as well. \"The water started gushing in by the first week of July. There was no scope to stay back. Now, everything has been washed away. There is no land to rebuild my home and no money to start afresh either,\" he said. Anji Khatun, of nearby Dadaspanchi village, returned from the shelter to see that her home has been damaged. She had no choice but to borrow Tk 20,000 at a high rate of interest from a local money lender to repair her home. \"My daughters and I took shelter in the flood protection embankment for three weeks. Nobody is coming forward to help us, not even the government.\" Anji was lucky that she found someone to borrow money from. But Maleka Begum of Potajia Nishipara village in the same upazila, not so much. No one is willing to lend money to her. Tying up some bamboo sticks with rope, she has repaired her home. The wind or rain can blow away the repairs at any time, she said, as she continues to live perilously. \"My husband is a poor day labourer. He had no work in the last one month. We have no place to live, no food to eat even.\" All the victims said they lost everything in the last three weeks, but they did not get any help for rehabilitation. Md Chand Ali of Potajia village said, \"During the flood, we were given seven to eight kilograms of rice as relief material.\" It was enough to last a week for a family of five. \"We are in dire need of assistance to rebuild our homes.\" Over 3,079 families of 408 villages in five upazilas of Sirajganj were displaced by the recent flood. A total of 15,434 people have been hit hard, while 313,997 people were partially affected, according to Sirajganj Relief and Rehabilitation Office. A total of 6,505 houses were entirely damaged, while 44,013 were partially damaged. \"We have reported these figures to the ministry of relief and rehabilitation. They have allotted 1,570 bundles of corrugated iron sheets to rehabilitate the flood victims. The allotment is likely to reach Sirajganj soon,\" Sirajganj Deputy Commissioner (DC) Dr Faruk Ahmed told the Daily Star recently. Not just home, roads, culverts, croplands, ponds and many educational institutions have been battered by the flood. Officials concerned at the district administration have pinned losses at Tk 200 crore this year. Total actual losses cannot be ascertained yet, as many areas are still under water. \"Although the water level was dropped below the danger level now, flooding has not left yet. There are many areas in Belkuchi, Kazipur, Chowhali and Shahzadpur that are still water logged,\" said Md Rafikul Islam, Sirajganj divisional engineer of Water Development Board. The flood water is likely to remain till the end of September, which will add to the misery of the people in these areas, he added. A total of 21,000 hectares of croplands were inundated and crops on 14,000 hectares were completely damaged, said Md Habibul Haque, deputy director of Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in Sirajganj. He assumes the damage to agriculture to be worth Tk 134 crore. \"The agriculture sector has suffered the most due to the flood. We have submitted the flood loss report to the ministry, seeking rehabilitation funds.\" \"We are currently taking preparations for 30-acre seed beds and 56 floating seed beds in the district to assist the victim farmers after the water recedes,\" he said. Meanwhile, the district has lost eight primary schools to river erosion. There is no existence left of those institutions, said Md. Eusuf Reza, Sirajganj primary education officer. At the same time, 162 primary schools were partially damaged, he added. \"We could not calculate the total loss yet, but we are estimating it at around Tk 1.85 crore.\" All academic activities are stalled since July. \"We hope to resume studies after we complete the repair works after Eid,\" he added. Sirajganj District Educational Officer Md Shafiulla said 65 high schools and colleges have also been damaged. He expects repair work to start soon. Fish cultivation took a hit in Chalanbeel areas of Sirajganj. A total of 116.75 hectares of fishing areas were affected, washing away 110.73 tonnes of fish and 1.27 crore fish fry worth Tk 4.17 crore, said Md Shahed Ali, Sirajganj district fishery officer. \"We are expecting rehabilitation funds for the worst-hit fish farmers.\" The flood has destroyed 134 acres of hybrid grass fields. The loss can be estimated at Tk 75 lakh, said Akhteruzaman Vuia, district livestock officer. The flood claimed the lives of 4 cows and 3,885 chicken. Although the flood did not hurt the animals directly, the cattle farmers face massive losses for fodder crisis. Besides, a total of 55.34 kilometres of roads were totally damaged, while 180 km partially, said Md Mizanur Rahman, executive engineer of Sirajganj LGED. Twenty-nine culverts were also damaged. Several roads are still inundated, so the actual loss is still unknown, he said. Sirajganj is one of the biggest handloom and power loom producing areas in the country. Samen Ali of Saydabad Modhhyapara in Sirajganj Sadar upazila said, \"I set up a handloom factory by borrowing money from a local NGO a couple of years ago. But the recent flood destroyed my factory, taking away the lone source of income for my family.\" \"I don't know how I will repay the loan instalments now.\" Like him, most weavers in five upazilas are facing a crisis. Total damage to the sector is yet to be determined. As the flood water recedes, Jamuna river is devouring houses and crop lands at several points of Sirajganj Sadar, Chowhali, Shahzadpur, Kazipur and Belkuchi upazila, said Sirajganj divisional WDB engineer Rafikul Islam. This is casual river erosion, he added. \"According to the characteristics of Jamuna, the river banks erode both then the water level rises and drops. We have nothing to do at this moment. At the end of the flood, we can take steps to save damage for the next time.\" Sirajganj district administration has complied a flood loss report from different departments. But the fund allotment for rehabilitation is yet to be allotted. \"We will start rehabilitation work after getting the funds,\" DC Dr Faruk said."

      "text": "Long Island Q&A;: Robin Chandler Duke;\nSoldier in an Unpopular War: Population Control\n1989-02-05T05:00:00.000Z\nLEAD: FROM her Upper East Side apartment, Robin Chandler Duke may seem an unlikely soldier in what many consider a nasty battle: World population control and abortion rights.\nFROM her Upper East Side apartment, Robin Chandler Duke may seem an unlikely soldier in what many consider a nasty battle: World population control and abortion rights.\nBut for more than 40 years, Mrs. Duke, the wife of Angier Biddle Duke, former Ambassador to Morocco, Spain and Denmark and now president of Southampton College, has been fighting to make birth control an integral part of basic health care.\n''This is an issue that's not very popular,'' Mrs. Duke said in an interview in her Manhattan apartment (she and her husband also have a house in Southampton).\n''This isn't like fighting for the museum in your town or some great cultural endeavor that everybody wants to identify with. This is an issue that nobody much likes.''\nSince 1972, Mrs. Duke has been a national co-chairman of the Population Crisis Committee/Draper Fund, which finances the International Planned Parenthood Federation.\nMrs. Duke is also active in education, serving as vice chairman of the Institute of International Education, which processes student exchange programs in the United States, and is on the board of numerous organizations, including the Guggenheim Museum, International Flavors and Fragrances, the East River Savings Bank and the Rockwell International Corporation.\nOriginally a feature writer for The New York Journal-American, writing about what was then considered women's issues - fashion and society - Mrs. Duke, as a divorced mother of two, became one of the few female stockbrokers on Wall Street during the 50's, working for the firm of Orvic Brothers. Her subsequent years with Pepsi-Cola took her to Africa and the Soviet Union, where she met Angier Biddle Duke in 1959. \nQ. How did you become involved in family planning issues? \nA. I first became involved when I was a very young woman with two young children and lived in New York. I realized there were no girls' clubs, no facility for young girls to go off the streets of New York.\nI worked with another group of women to finance the first Girls Club, and became very interested in young girls and the aspects of their life in an urban area where they, even in those days, were from a one-parent family.\nI suddenly realized how these girls grow up in an environment where they are uneducated about fertility - ignorance is the bottom line. In those days, Margaret Sanger was alive and she was imprisoned on Rikers Island because she demonstrated, marched and was pushing family planning. Just think of it.\nIn my lifetime - I never thought of myself as being an antique, but I am 65 - this great lady, for the very fact that she prescribed artificial birth-control methods, was put in jail. It's amazing. \nQ. Do you think that things have changed much since the 40's in terms of the lack of education of poor women in matters of family planning? \nA. I'm ashamed to say that in the last eight years we've been set back quite critically. \nQ. You mean the Reagan Administration? \nA. Absolutely, and I hang a big black cloak around that Administration because of their fight against abortion rights. They supported this militant group who went out and demonstrated against Planned Parenthood and had people lying down in Planned Parenthood clinics where abortion services were offered. This kind of thing has set us back many decades.\nThey were against strong population policies within our Agency for International Development. That's where we provide foreign assistance money to inform, counsel and enlighten people about how to plan families. And these are in countries where they're overpopulated.\nThis whole movement was supported and abetted by the last eight years of a very, very poorly advised Administration as to what you should be doing in terms of foreign assistance and what you should be doing domestically for poor people. \nQ. Do you think things will improve under George Bush? \nA. Yes, I have high hopes. Mr. Bush is a man who has served in China as our representative and as a Congressman. During the days when he was in Congress, he was pro-choice on abortion. I don't know what turned him around. Maybe he felt he had to get that body of a minority to support him to get him elected, but he certainly wasn't anti-choice in the old days. \nQ. What areas of the globe face the greatest threat of overpopulation and, therefore, poverty? \nA. Africa is one of the more devastating continents in terms of hunger, environmental impact and overpopulation. Our very dear neighbors in Latin America have some of the highest incidence of illegal abortion in the world. That's because they can't get the access to family planning.\nThis is an ongoing battle with the church. If they can't get access to family planning, they resort to horrendous abortion techniques that very often render them ill and maimed and, very often, kill these women. \nQ. According to predictions, world population growth is going to be one of the big issues of the 90's. What are the implications for Americans? \nA. What we have to know in this sort of one-world concept is that, if the third world falls apart, it will have a direct impact on developed nations. The marketplace for all these great American corporations is ultimately that third world.\nIf that third-world element isn't going to develop, we have to bail them out. The third-world debt is monumental and this is a debt built out of enormous infusions of money, which they have had to borrow to keep going. Where, in fact, if they had basic education and health care, they would have the nucleus of the energy to get their economy rolling.\nYou have to have some other economic structures, and you have to get a hold on the numbers of people. If you don't, you are facing starvation, and the only people who are going to prop you up are the Western developed nations. \nQ. You mentioned that population is an environmental issue. How is that? \nA. Look at the great turtles of Indonesia. They're not coming back in such numbers along the shoreline to lay their eggs. Why?\nThe population of Indonesia has chopped down so much of the forest land in order to develop a little patch to grow their crops that they have practically killed off all the turtles and tigers that used to come there.\nThis is all a matter of too many people on a land base that can't support them. You could say the same thing for northern India and Bangladesh. They have chopped their forest lands down, and have created erosion and flooding, and then you don't have any agriculture because you've washed away your topsoil. \nQ. Even though much of your work has been focused on third world countries, how does America fare in terms of population control. Are we up to par? \nA. Our problem is not population control, it is education. Our problem is seeing that every child born has the fundamental rights, which are decent health care, to be nurtured and loved and to get an education.\nIn the United States, they have withheld important aspects of education because they won't Federally fund a system for sex education, which I think is vital. We keep hearing about the breakdown of the family in the United States, and there's no question that it's probably true.\nI think the schools have the responsibility, with Federal funding, to counsel young people about their sexuality in a constructive way. If they watch television and see salacious sex, then there must be something wrong with a society that isn't willing to deal with sex in an intelligent, normal way.\nContraception should be like toothpaste: it's basic to your health care. You brush your teeth and you use contraception. It ought to be in the medicine chest, and there shouldn't be any hiding under the rug and all this phony kind of nervousness about discussing sex. Sexuality is fundamental and it should be taught, starting with very young children. \nQ. Do you think it is the Federal Government's responsibility to step in and play a major role in family planning, or are birth-control and health issues up to the nonprofit, private sector? \nI think the private sector has a major role to play, and I think the Federal Government has a major role to play. We have a Surgeon General and we have a Department of Health and Human Services, and I think part of what you do for your people, when they cannot do it for themselves, is to have outreach from the Federal Government. \nQ. Do you believe in Federal funding for abortion? \nA. I certainly do. We have women who come in and can't afford anything, and it is my job as a private citizen to try to raise money so that those women will get those abortions if they can't afford it. \nQ. What do you think the future of legalized abortion is in this country? \nA. I think it's at a very high risk and we should be very worried about it. If it goes back to the states, it's going to be difficult to obtain an abortion. You're going to have some states that won't provide services at all.\nI've talked to a number of members of Congress who have told me, ''Well, you know I've been on your side, but basically it's too risky,'' and they don't want to get on this issue. And until people are courageous enough to be like Bob Packwood and others who have been our friends and supporters in the Senate, we lose out. \nQ. Are you planning to join the fight to keep abortion legal? \nA. We are mounting a very big campaign in the National Abortion Rights Action League about the ultimate effects of making abortion illegal, how it will impact on the poor and on the rights of women. These are fundamental rights we're talking about. I have people who are so angry with me about this, and they don't want to talk about it, and ''There goes Robin again - babble, babble, babble. I know what she's talking about. It's just distasteful, my dear.''\nIt's not distasteful. This whole subject matter should be part of health care. It is fundamental. Toothpaste in the medicine chest sitting right next to contraception."

Solitude holds me, makes my heart weep and drills a hole; every moment accumulates eternities.   Everyday, when dusk ceases, my existence is obscured in the darkness of the deep. I can hardly remember that I belong to this earth. Once had chores, had Springs, had a childhood on the wings of dreams, an urge to love and be loved by someone, a home of happiness, blessings from my mother.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-05 00:00:00      \nRenowned artist Jamal Uddin Ahmed  emphasises the need for spontaneity as an important aspect of art. The artist received the Ekushey Padak this year, for his outstanding contribution to fine arts. He is also famous for his artwork series on pigeons, horses, boats, gypsies, flood victims, fishermen, marine life and the mystic troubadours of Bangladesh. Ahmed's artworks have earned him many other accolades at home and abroad.   He uses soft pastel along with thin acrylic dust layers and charcoal as the background of his paintings. The acrylic and charcoal dust generate amazing textures, along with a mystique aura on the surface of the canvas. He often makes impromptu paintings with female models. \"A true artist always experiments with new techniques. Abstract art is easier to do while realistic art is hard to portray,\" says Ahmed. \"I do two types of paintings. Some of my works are meant to communicate with the general audience, while others are designed to satisfy the artist in me. At the end of day, an artist never truly retires. He lives on through his work.\" For Ahmed, painting is similar to composing music. \"People often become emotional while listening to melodious songs. However, singers who sing only with their voices and not with their hearts, fail to leave lasting impressions. The same is true for art,\" he says. \"Great artists always put their heart and soul into their creations.\" Referring to renowned artists Turner and Monet, he said that the forthcoming generation of artists should regularly go for outdoor projects. He also suggested the re-launching of compulsory art education in schools.   Ahmed was a visiting teacher and artist in residence in the Art and Design Department at the North Carolina State University in 1995. He is currently a Professor at the Department of Drawing and Painting of the Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka. He is also the current President of Bangladesh Charushilpi Sangsad.  "

Subhankar Sarkar, an Indian citizen, asked if the prime minister possessed citizenship documents under Right to Information Act, on February 17. In response to his question, Under Secretary of the Indian Prime Minister's Office, Praveen Kumar wrote: \"Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is a citizen of India by birth in terms of Section 3 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and as such the question of his having a citizenship certificate which is for citizenship by registration does not arise.\"  Amid ongoing turmoil over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across India, the statement has created quite a stir. Ever since the right wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government passed the CAA, protests against the controversial citizenship law have continued across India, with every citizen worrying over how to prove citizenship. Even Modi fails to show the citizenship certificate.  At least 42 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim violence in northeast New Delhi, amid mounting international criticism that authorities failed to protect minority Muslims. The clashes began over a citizenship law that Modi's Hindu nationalist government introduced in December providing a path to Indian citizenship for six religious groups from neighbouring countries - but not Muslims. Critics say the law is discriminatory and comes on top of other measures such as withdrawal of autonomy for Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir, that has deepened disquiet about the future of India's 200 million Muslims. Critics of the government however blamed this week's violence on members of Modi's BJP, which was trounced in local Delhi elections at the beginning of the month.  The violence morphed into street battles between Hindu and Muslim groups, with the police largely ineffective in ending the violence."

      "text": "BANGLADESH GETS PLEDGE OF MILLIONS FOR FLOOD RELIEF\n1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nDonor nations have pledged millions of dollars in aid to Bangladesh, where the worst flooding in 70 years has left much of the country under water and as many as 28 million people homeless or stranded.\nAfter an urgent international appeal for aid by the President of Bangladesh, Lieut. Gen. H.M. Ershad, the United States has initially pledged nearly $3.6 million in food, transportation and other emergency aid, the State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said today.\n''We continue to be in touch with Bangladesh authorities to see what other assistance we might be able to provide,'' he said. Japan Pledges $13 Million\nJapan, which has now surpassed the United States as the world's largest foreign aid donor, has pledged $13 million in food and money for the lease of two helicopters and medical equipment. A Japanese medical team has already arrived in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Embassy in Washington said.\nThe flooding, brought on by brutal monsoon rains that began in June, has brought even more misery to one of the world's poorest countries and, with 110 million people in a land the size of Wisconsin, one of its most densely populated.\nThe most common estimate of the amount of land still under water is 75 percent, the figure used by the State Department and the Bangladesh Embassy here. CARE, which is represented in 80 percent of the country's 65 districts, said 75 to 90 percent of the county was under water. A Village in Trouble\nOne flooded village is Nichkasia, south of the capital, Dhaka, where no relief had been distributed by today and more than 8,000 people were forced to take shelter on a river embankment. A helicopter trip to the area showed water stretching as far as the eye could see, interrupted by treetops and tin roofs, some packed with victims of the flooding. [ Page A8. ] So far, relief officials have been unable to get to most flooded areas, and communications between the capital and outlying regions are spotty at best. The devastation will take weeks to assess. Most relief officials agree that only as the water levels decline will the problems in aiding a homeless population exposed to waterborne disease become evident.\n''Bangladesh is one vast swamp and what you're confronted with is rebuilding a country,'' said Thomas Drahman, the Asia regional manager for CARE. ''I hate to sound hyperbolic, but this could be one of the largest natural disasters of the century.'' Casualty Figures Uncertain\nThere is no reliable estimate of what it will cost to feed, house and provide medical care to the population and rebuild roads, buildings and bridges, but $4.5 billion was the total estimate of damage for the flood last year, which was not nearly as severe.\nInformation is so unreliable that it has been impossible to estimate casualty figures. The official death count of more than 400, from drowning, house collapse and snake bites, is widely regarded as far too low.\nBecause so little is known about the condition of the country, some donors like the United States have been reluctant to pour in large amounts of money and aid until they can consult with relief officials on the most crucial needs.\nAccording to the Agency for International Development, Australia has pledged $241,000, Pakistan $568,000, Britain $927,000 and various United Nations agencies $115,000.\nCanada has pledged about $4 million for food aid and Denmark $275,000, according to the Bangladesh Embassy, which added that India and Saudi Arabia have each lent four helicopters and Kuwait has offered to send four jumbo jets filled with relief materials once the Dhaka airport fully reopens.\nWhy Japan has made such a generous initial pledge was unclear and embassy officials in Washington could not confirm the $13 million figure. But in recent months, Japan has emerged as a champion of the developing nations of Asia, by such actions as initiating its own plan for debtor nations at the Toronto summit meeting and sending money as well as personnel to United Nations peacekeeping operations in Iran and Afghanistan. Immediate Needs Listed\n''Our immediate requirement is ready-to-eat high-protein dry food because people have no cooking oil, kerosene or firewood and cannot cook,'' said Tajul Islam, press attache at the Bangladesh Embassy. ''We also urgently need water purification tablets, medicine for the prevention of diarrhea and anti-snake venom.''\nAfter that, officials in Bangladesh estimate, the country will need three million extra tons of food grains to make up for the lost harvests until January.\nAlthough no deaths by starvation have been reported, private relief agency officials fear that a sizable percentage of the country's 110 million people will suffer malnutrition and even starvation because of the flood, as well as life-threatening waterborne diseases such as cholera.\nFinally, the country will need construction materials for an unparalleled reconstruction effort, including homes, buildings, roads and bridges. Even Worse Conditions Feared\n''It's a major disaster,'' said Rene Bafalis, a spokeswoman for A.I.D.'s Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance, which is coordinating United States Government aid efforts. ''We expect it to get worse before it gets better.''\nOverall flood conditions in the country showed some signs of improvement today, Mr. Redman said, as water levels in two major northern river basins and in Dhaka showed declines. But he said that a number of tributaries feeding into major basins have risen in the last 24 hours, ''indicating that the situation could change rapidly.''\nIn addition, ''fuel and essential goods may become increasingly scarce,'' Mr. Redman said.\nThe nearly $3.6 million pledged in aid by the United States includes 10,000 tons of food valued at $2.5 million, more than 2,000 tons of corn and wheat seed valued at up to $1 million, $50,000 to CARE, $40,000 to Save the Children for food and water purification tablets and $25,000 to be used at the discretion of the United States Ambassador, Willard A. De Pree.\nA.I.D. is also preparing to send disaster management experts to Dhaka to advise on further ways the United States can help the relief effort."

Deputy Director Md Azhar Ali of Pabna Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) told The Daily Star, \"In the last season, farmers cultivated 44,000 hectares of land and produced 6.5 lakh metric tons of onions. This season, we have targeted to cultivate 49,800-hectare for producing 7.5 lakh metric tons of onions.\" If the weather remains dry and favourable, then this season's target will be the highest ever production in Pabna, according to officials of DAE. Deputy director Azhar informed that the total yearly demand for onion in the country is 24 lakh metric tons, and the nine upazilas of Pabna usually supplies 25 percent of it. Next year, they are hoping to supply 33 percent of the total demand of onion, he added. The deputy director noted that farmers, who could save their crop from flood during the last season, earned a lofty profit from the Mulkata variety selling it at the high market price. This motivated the other farmers to increase their cultivation for the current season. Since mid-September price of onion kept on rising from Tk 40/kg to the record high of Tk 250/kg, becoming somewhat steadier in the last two weeks selling between Tk 50 to Tk 100 per kg, as quoted on the website of the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. Sources at the DAE explained that Mulkata sown during September-October is harvested around December while the current variety sown now will be ready for harvest by March. This correspondent visited Santhia and Sujanagar upazilas, where most of the onions in the district are grown. An onion farmer of Sujanagar upazila Md Ishhaque Ali said, \"In last season, I cultivated 66 decimals of land but I did not get expected profit as most of the crop was damaged in sudden flood this year. I managed to save 20 mounds of onion and sold those for Tk 60,000. The handsome price of onion inspired me to cultivate again in more areas this season.\" Ishaque is cultivating onions on 165 decimals of land by leasing 99 decimals, expecting to earn Tk five lakh to Tk six lakh from sale of the crop, he said. He, however, is concerned about winter rain damaging his crop again. \"If it rains during winter, we may face loss again,\" he said. Forgetting the loss that he had incurred in the last season, retired college teacher Dulal Hossain of Narinda village in Santhia upazila cultivated five bigha of land for onion expecting to earn Tk five lakh. He, too, is worried about the weather.  \"The recent dense fog disrupts onion cultivation. At the same time, we are worried about rain during winter,\" Dulal said. Farmers also urged the government to stop importing onions during harvesting time, so that they can get expected profit."

Richard William Timm, the Superior of the Holy Cross Fathers in Bangladesh, was one of five recipients named last week to receive the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding.\nThe awards were created 30 years ago by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund as a memorial to the late Ramon Magsaysay, who was President of the Philippines. The awards are administered by the Magsaysay Foundation in Manila, created for this purpose by the New York-based Rockefeller Fund.\nEach recipient receives $20,000 and is to be honored at an awards ceremony in the fall in Bangkok, Thailand. Other Winners\nAmong the other winners was Dato Haji Hanafiah bin Haji Ahman, a Malaysian Government official, who was honored for helping to ease the hardships of the country's devout Moslems undertaking pilgrimages to Mecca.\nAnother winner, Hans Bague Jassin, director of Indonesia's Center for Literacy Documentation, received a Magsaysay award for public service, and Diane Ying, a Taiwanese editor and publisher of a business weekly, Commonwealth, received a prize in journalism. Dr. Aree Valyasevi, professor of pediatrics and director of the Institute of Nutrition at Mahidol University in Thailand, received a prize for community leadership.\nFather Timm, who is 64 years old, was born in Michigan City, Ind. He left the United States in 1952 to teach science at St. Gregory's College in East Pakistan, which became part of independent Bangladesh in 1971. Emergency Assistance\nAfter the country was devastated by a cyclone and floods that took 300,000 lives in November 1970, he gave up teaching to devote himself to emergency assistance for the disaster victims, mobilizing relief and rehabilitation activities.\nLater, he became involved in long-term rural development. He also undertook efforts to reduce communal tensions.\n''I have more hope in changed people than in changed structures and political systems,'' he said of his decision to devote his energies to improving life for the people of Bangladesh.\nIn 1974, he succeeded in inducing 130 relief agencies in the country to work together as the Association of Development Agencies. Last year, he helped establish the Coordinating Council for Human Rights in Bangladesh."

      "text": "High Cost of Deteriorating Environment Is Charted\n1989-02-12T05:00:00.000Z\nThe world can expect widespread economic decline and social disruption in the 1990's unless national leaders make a serious commitment to reverse the deterioration of the earth's environmental systems, a Washington-based research group said today.\nThe group, the Worldwatch Institute, said the major natural catastrophes of 1988 - further depletion of the ozone layer, the North American drought and the disastrous flooding in Bangladesh - provided a worrisome glimpse of a future in which environmental changes go unchecked. ''Unless the threats of climate change, ozone depletion, soil erosion, deforestation, and population growth are brought under control soon, economic decline may be inevitable,'' said Lester R. Brown, president of the institute and director of the study.\nThe report, ''State of the World 1989,'' recommends strategies for nations to reverse the most threatening trends. It focuses on four key areas: climate protection, reforestation, food production, and reducing population growth in the third world.\n''Time is not on our side,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We have years, not decades, to turn the situation around, and even then there is no guarantee that we will be able to reverse the trends that are undermining the human prospect, but if we do, it will be during the 90's. Beyond that it will be too late.''\nThe report recommended that national energy policies be directed to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels, the principal cause of the so-called greenhouse effect, or global warming. The burning of coal and other fuels such as oil and natural gas releases carbon dioxide that traps heat in the lower atmosphere, allowing temperatures to rise.\nMoreover, the large-scale clearing of tropical forests adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, hastening the greenhouse effect. ''If energy policymaking continues to be the domain of short-term thinking and narrow political considerations, there can be little hope,'' Mr. Brown said. The report suggested establishing international efficiency standards for automobiles, lighting systems, and electrical appliances. The report said that the world's 400 million cars currently average 20 miles per gallon of gasoline, emitting 547 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year. ''Setting a fuel standard for new cars of 50 miles per gallon by the year 2000 would be an important step toward climate stability,'' the report said.\nThe destruction of forests in many countries has caused several disasters, the report said. The dependency of millions on firewood for fuel has increased rainfall runoff and triggered widespread flooding in Bangladesh, India, the Sudan, Thailand and elsewhere. It has also speeded the extinction of plant and animal species.\nAs forests are cleared and burned, carbon is released into the atmosphere, speeding up the warming.\nThe report also found that the world's food production had dropped 14 percent per capita since 1984, and is now at the level of 1970. It named the North American drought, soil erosion, encroachment of desert in Africa, and scarce land and water as the main reasons for the slower growth.\nCopies of the report may be obtained from Worldwatch Institute, 1776 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. The price is $18.95 for the hard-cover edition and $9.95 for the soft-cover."
