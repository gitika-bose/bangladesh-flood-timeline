      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-31 00:00:00      \n\"I've got to do something for my country -- that's all I could think of. I have to free my country from Pakistan,\" Kina Kora reminisced about how he felt when the Pakistani occupation army cracked down on unarmed Bangladeshis in the dark night of March 25 in 1971. Now 68, Kina Kora can still vividly recollect those turbulent days of '71 when he was only nineteen years of age. Some time around the end of March or early April that year, Kina and three others left their village to join the war -- the war to liberate their motherland. One of the three was his 21-year-old brother Sattan Kora. The other two, Thopal and Gopal Kora, also 19 and 21 at the time, were also siblings. These four courageous youths belong to the Koras -- a timid but hardworking small ethnic community on the verge of extinction. Only 21 Kora families still live in the remote village of Haljay, in Dinajpur's Biral upazila. Before Bangladesh won independence in '71, there were around 200 Kora families in Haljay, now known as Korapara. With sparkle in his eyes, Kina continued the story. \"We were young and brave\" and driven by Bangabandhu's fiery speech of 7th March.  After leaving the village, on their way to receive training on guerrilla warfare in West Bengal of India, they somehow got separated. Sattan ended up in Siliguri's Panighatta, where he received his training. The other three got their training in Hamzapur, near the western border of Dinajpur.      Kina said, \"After the training at Hamzapur, I was stationed in Ghugudanga village of Dinajpur Sadar upazila, where the Pakistanis had a stronghold.\" \"A fierce battle ensued between the Pakistanis and us. We lost our comrade Alim Uddin there. Later, we engaged in heavy fighting with the Pakistanis in Jamalpur and Ramsagar areas of Sadar upazila.\" But around September, before the struggle for freedom of his motherland ended, Kina had to return home to stand by his family's struggle for survival.    \"My family was in a dire situation when I came home,\" Kina said, adding that his family and the villagers were suffering from a near-famine situation. Out of his three compatriots, Gopal, son of Papua Kora, died in 1973 and Gopal's brother Thopal is now incapable of talking perceptibly due to paralysis, said Kina, who still makes a living by working as an agricultural day labourer.     His brother Sattan, who passed away in India in 2018, was wounded during the war, he said, adding that Sattan had moved to the country in 1987 following a land dispute with villagers. Saleq Khokon, a Dhaka-based writer and researcher of small ethnic communities, said about 13 years ago, when Sattan Kora was visiting his village home, Saleq had the opportunity to interview Sattan and Thopal -- two among the four Koras who had fought in the Liberation War of 1971. Confirming that Sattan had sustained injuries during the war, Saleq said he could not interview Kina due to time constraint at the time.  Asked whether he or the other Koras, who fought in Bangladesh's War of Independence, ever received any formal recognition as freedom fighters, Kina said the four Kora fighters were given some sort of documentation by the then government after independence of the country. \"We were given some papers then. But, that got washed away during the devastating flood of 1987,\" he said helplessly. Ever since he returned home from the war 49 years ago, he and the other members of his community have been struggling to stave off hunger and poverty, Kina said. \"Thopal's and my family still live from hand to mouth.\" Even though they fought for the country's independence without expecting any return, said the Kora fighter, adding that formal recognition as freedom fighters during their lifetime would offer some solace amid financial hardship and illness."

The top brass of all the private commercial banks handed over cheques separately to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at an event at the Gono Bhaban in Dhaka on Tuesday. The banks that donated the money include Bank Asia, City Bank, IBBL, Mercantile, Mutual Trust, NCC, NRB, NRB Global, NRBC, One, Prime, Pubali, SIBL, UCB and Uttara. Of the 40 private banks, nine new banks donated Tk 25 lakh each, while the rest except ICB Islamic Bank contributed Tk 1 crore each. A devastating fire broke out at Old Dhaka's Chawkbazar on February 20, killing 70 people. Speaking on the occasion, the prime minister asked the directors of the banks to bring down the lending rate to single-digit, according to a meeting source. The directors explained that it was not possible at the moment because the private banks were facing liquidity crunch, the source said. However, the prime minister instructed the banks to take time to implement the single-digit lending rate. She, however, said banks would have to do it. Nazrul Islam Mazumder, chairman of the Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB), a forum of the directors of the private banks, was present. On June 20 last year, Mazumder on behalf of the BAB announced that the member banks would bring down the lending rate to 9 percent and the deposit rate to 6 percent. At that time, he had said the prime minister met all the demands of the directors of the banks through an amendment to the Bank Companies Act. \"Everyone should agree to the decision to reduce the lending rates to single-digit as per the prime minister's instruction,\" he had told reporters. The promise has not been materialised yet. In April last year, banks donated Tk 163 crore to PM's relief fund. They also provided Tk 85 crore in August 2017 to support flood victims."

Dhaka newspapers put the death toll from flooding at 1,451. The Government's count was 630.\nOfficials reported an outbreak of diarrhea in all areas affected by the floods. By Friday evening at least 160,872 people had been afflicted by the illness and 102 had died from it, the officials said. In Dhaka, a city of 6 million, 21,412 new cases of diarrhea were reported Friday by the Government.\nThe rains Friday and early today added to hardships already suffered by millions living on roofs and treetops and huddled together in thousands of camps nationwide without safe drinking water, cooked food or medical care.\nHealth Ministry officials said 30,035 health workers were working to aid victims of water-borne diseases.\nThe officials acknowledged that there was not enough medicine to help all of those affected by the flooding.\nA senior official at the Agriculture Ministry said that ''if the water does not recede in the next couple of days, most of the rice crop will be damaged beyond any recovery.''\nThe Government has 1.3 million tons of grain and has issued an appeal for 3 million tons to compensate for damage to the rice crop. FLOODS CALLED MAN-MADE\nROME, Sept. 10 (Reuters) - The disastrous floods sweeping Bangladesh are now an unstoppable annual event and largely man-made, a United Nations expert said. The official, Tom Elhaut, director of projects in Bangladesh for the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said Friday that deforestation and soil erosion in the Himalayas has removed natural barriers to the monsoon rains and that dikes built to shield development projects have only increased the devastation.\nLast year's severe flooding in Bangladesh was said to be the worst in decades, but was thought to be a freak occurrence. Mr. Elhaut said that catastrophic flooding may become the norm. 'Bound to Recur'\n''This phenomenon is bound to recur,'' he said. ''These are the first two years of a sustained series of catastrophic floods.''\nHe said that this year the problem has grown worse because snow continued to melt in the Himalayas longer than usual and rainfall has been particularly heavy.\nBut he asserted that the environmental havoc wreaked by the destruction of Nepalese forests has done the most damage. ''It is to a large extent manmade,'' Mr. Elhaut said.\nA population increase in Nepal has increased demand for wood faster than trees can be replaced, and growing numbers of animals are eroding the remaining grasslands.\nThe resulting deforestation insures that rain and silt will rush into Bangladesh unchecked.\nOn Thursday, the Dhaka Government called for an international conference on controlling the flood problem, but Mr. Elhaut was skeptical that immediate results could be achieved."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-02 00:00:00      \nFollowing approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), Dhaka Wasa had initiated two projects to tackle the issue and improve the water logging situation The water logging situation in the capital has not changed over the years, even after promises from Dhaka Wasa about implementing a master-plan and commitment of the government to find a solution to this problem. People of the city were reminded of the unfulfilled pledges yesterday, after a downpour left numerous areas waterlogged and led to major gridlock on the streets until well after evening. Following approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), Dhaka Wasa had initiated two projects to tackle the issue and improve the water logging situation. But their progress is very slow to make any significant headway. On June 28, 2018, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, then LGRD minister, had blamed development projects around the city for its water logging problem. He had also expressed hope that the problem would end by 2019 -- which has not happened. As a result, the perennial waterlogging scenario in Dhaka is still unchanged. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) recorded 46mm rainfall in the city between 12pm and 6pm yesterday. Just within half-an-hour of thundershowers a little after 12pm, citizens were seen posting on social media videos of waterlogging in a number of areas. Dhaka Tribune correspondents during visits also found many streets and areas inundated. The areas that suffered most include Mirpur's Rokeya Sarani and Kazipara, Jahangir Gate, Green Road, parts of Indira Road, Tejgaon, Panthapath, Shukrabad, Kalabagan, Dhanmondi, Jhigatala, Shankar, Jatrabari, Bashundhara Residential Area, Motijheel, Gulistan, Paltan, Bijoynagar, Fakirapool, Karwan Bazar, Arambagh, some areas in Mohakhali and Gulshan, and many places of Old Dhaka. Talking to Dhaka Tribune, many said waterlogging was still occurring as the drains that are supposed to take the rainwater out are clogged with garbage. At the same time, heavy gridlock on major roads, which were inundated, made it extremely difficult for city dwellers to commute. Sufferings Many people were seen wading through the water to reach their destinations. Sarjin Sharif, a resident of Shankar area, told Dhaka Tribune: \"The road in front of my house is completely submerged. \"I need to go to work, but I cannot even get out of the house to find a vehicle.\" Dhanmondi's Road No 27 also went under knee-deep water very quickly, leaving many including students suffering amid heavy rain. Nafisa Nazmul, a former student of Brac University, said: \"I cannot find transport to go to Panthapath from Mirpur 10. The roads are completely underwater.\" East Jurain resident Awenim Rahman also told Dhaka Tribune that the main streets in his area were fine, as they were rebuilt and their heights increased recently. \"But the branch lanes, which are still low-lying, are completely inundated.\" He said he also faced horrible traffic jam on his way to the office later in the afternoon. \"I found all the roads leading from Gulistan to Paltan, Shahbagh, Kakrail, Dainik Bangla, and Farmgate via Banglamotor and Karwan Bazar absolutely gridlocked,\" Awenim said expressing frustration. Independent University Bangladesh faculty member Kazi Mubinul Hasan said: \"I live in the Bashundhara Residential area. On a usual day, it takes me less than an hour to reach Shukrabad. But today [Tuesday], it took me nearly two hours.\" Nilkhet and New Market areas, Elephant Road and Mirpur Road also saw major gridlock after the rain stopped a little after 3pm. The rain even left the roads leading from the main entrances to archways in the Bangladesh Secretariat, adjacent to Zero Point in Gulistan, under knee-deep water for at least three hours. Officers and outsiders both suffered while going from one building to another. Many were even seen entering the offices barefoot. Those turning up at the secretariat without cars were among the worst sufferers. Many said the secretariat had seen a similar problem on Sunday. More rains incoming BMD Meteorologist AKM Ruhul Quddus told Dhaka Tribune that they recorded 45.3mm of rainfall in the capital between noon and 3pm yesterday. Between 12pm and 6pm, a total of 46mm rainfall was recorded. Meanwhile, BMD also recorded the highest rainfall in Sylhet - 120mm. According to a Met Office weather bulletin, light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind over the country was likely again in the next 24 hours as of 9am today. \"There is a chance of light rain on Wednesday in Dhaka, Khulna and Chittagong regions, and in the rest of the country it will rainless,\" said Ruhul. The bulletin added that light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind is likely to occur at most places in Dhaka, Mymensingh, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, many places in Khulna and Barisal divisions, and a few places in Rangpur and Rajshahi divisions during the time. Moreover, it said, some places in Barisal, Chittagong, Mymensingh and Sylhet divisions may see moderately heavy to very heavy falls until this morning. Slow progress of master-plan Aiming to fix the perennial problem, the Ecnec last year had approved two projects -- \"Expansion of Drainage Networks and Development of Canals Project in Dhaka City\" and \"Land acquisition, excavation and re-excavation of Hazaribagh, Baishteki, Kurmitola, Manda and Begunbari canals.\" But both, being implemented by Dhaka Wasa are advancing at a snail's pace. One of the projects has registered only 8.25% progress in the past one year, while the other just 1.5% over the span of 14 months. Regarding the extremely sluggish progress, urban development expert Prof Nazrul Islam said such projects, after being passed, advance slowly due to many issues. \"But in course of time, their progress gained pace. But these two projects seem to be progressing very slowly. Only the authorities implementing them can explain why,\" he said. Dhaka Wasa Managing Director Taqsem A Khan was unavailable for comment over phone. However, engineer Nuruzzaman, former member of Dhaka Wasa Board, told Dhaka Tribune: \"Wasa is trying to solve the waterlogging issue by implementing some projects. It is visible that once areas used to remain waterlogged for five to six hours, but this year the water cleared from roads in two to three hours. It is a significant improvement.\""

As in the past, Indian Army contingent comprising 170 personnel will participate in a joint training exercise \"SAMPRITI-8\" in Bangladesh from March 02-15, said the release, adding that the Indian Army contingent will arrive at the Hazrat ShahJalal International Airport on Friday in a special Indian Air Force aircraft.For the first time in the history of SAMPRITI series exercises, both armies will undertake exercises related to relief/response operations tied to natural disaster like earthquake, flood etc., it said.  The joint exercise was first held in Assam, India in 2011 and since then, both countries have been hosting the exercise alternatively. Last year, the training exercise was conducted at Counter Insurgency & Jungle Warfare School, Vairengte in Mizoram. After completion of the exercise, the Indian Army contingent will return to India on March 16."

      "text": "Micro-loans to the World's Poorest\n1988-02-21T05:00:00.000Z\nWITH the help of 5 of her 12 children and a son-in-law, Maria Alfonsa Lopez braids rope in La Colonia Independencia, one of the western hill barrios of Tegucigalpa, Honduras. It is an occupation her family has pursued for generations.\nThanks to four loans totaling $400 from a three-year-old community group called Asepade, a Spanish acronym for investment adviser, she has broken the grip of the local moneylender. He had been charging her 10 percent a day to finance her stock of rope, which she twists into clotheslines, hammocks and lassos.\n''The loans have helped me quite a lot, and I am now able to earn a profit,'' she said in a recent telephone conversation from Tegucigalpa.\nShe has used the profits to expand her business and to install a cement floor in the shack where she lives with her family in the dusty satellite community.\nMrs. Lopez is one of 2,500 individuals in the Tegucigalpa area who have received entrepreneurial loans from Asepade over the past three years.\nThroughout the third world, from Bangladesh and Senegal to Tegucigalpa, such loans, from a variety of donors, have helped several million small entrepreneurs - those who sell flowers, mangoes and papayas, braid rope, sew dresses, catch fish and perform other small-scale activities that are at the core of developing economies.\nThe practice of microenterprise lending began in the early 1980's and grew slowly, but from the experience to date, most experts agree that it works.\nNot only is there an excellent repayment record, but also a ''trickle up'' effect on the local economy. Profits from Mrs. Lopez's rope making, for example, meant an extra order for the local cement mixer who made her new floor. Prospering entrepreneurs may also hire additional help.\n''IT generates a flow of money,'' said Wayne G. Broehl, professor of administration at the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth. ''And as you heighten the money economy, then you make new opportunities for other people, providing a real multiplier effect.''\nA shortage of working capital is generally perceived as one of the biggest obstacles to third world development. ''The capitalist model depends on resources flowing easily to the opportunities,'' said Howard H. Stevenson, enterprise professor at the Harvard Business School. In developing countries, he added, ''what strikes me is how tightly controlled the resources are. It is impossible to pursue the opportunities.'' Microenterprise lending can break the logjam.\nThe local enterprises are not big enough to qualify for bank loans. To buy additional raw materials or a wider net to catch more fish, people who need cash must generally turn to local loan sharks who charge up to 20 percent a day in interest.\nThe ''trickle up'' programs, by contrast, usually charge interest rates of 2 to 4 percent a month, amounts comparable to commercial bank rates in the particular countries.\n''Once there is a source of credit at commercial rates, costs drop, income rises and there is more money for tortillas or rope,'' said Stephen H. Gross, associate director for Latin American operations of Accion International, a nonprofit development organization. ''Suddenly you are increasing buying power of a large number of people and recyling money into the economy.''\nAccion, which provides funds for Asepade, the community group that helped Mrs. Lopez, is among a score of organizations that are behind the entrepreneurial movement.\nTheir seed money comes from private and public benefactors, including multinational corporations, foundations, the Agency for International Development of the State Department, and multinational agencies such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the United Nations Development Program.\nA few third world banks, like the Commercial and Savings Bank of Somalia and the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, practice micro-lending and make it profitable by keeping transaction costs low.\nBoston-based Accion, an acronym for Americans for Community Cooperation in Other Nations, is financed by such organizations as the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Exxon, I.B.M. and the Agency for International Development.\nStarted during the Kennedy Administration, Accion also sends volunteers to work in Latin American slums.\nANALYZING its experience in 13 Latin American countries, Accion discovered that a loan of $30 can double a small merchant's family income in six months, according to William W. Burrus, the executive director. The group also found that every $1,100 lent to small enterprises generates one additional job.\nThe concept of helping cash-short entrepreneurs with small-scale loans appears to have originated in Bangladesh with an economics professor named Muhammad Yunus, who studied at Vanderbilt University and returned to teach at the University of Chittagong.\nHe founded the Grameen Bank in 1979 after arguing with conventional bankers that the 50 percent of Bangladeshis who are landless and the 80 percent who are illiterate could still be good credit risks.\nToday the bank, which is 75 percent-owned by its borrowers (who must be savers and, eventually, buy shares in the bank), with the remainder owned by the government, operates 330 branches serving 6,000 Bangladesh villages, and is handling 215,000 loans, more than half of them to women.\nThis and other small credit programs evolved in response to growing frustration with large-scale assistance projects.\nAccording to early economic development theories, the benefits of big investments in power plants, hydroelectric stations, irrigation works and highways were expected to ''trickle down'' through an economy and lift the living standards of the poor.\nBut after decades of commitments of many billions of dollars living standards have actually fallen in some countries. (This year alone the World Bank, the biggest of the multilateral lenders, will channel nearly $20 billion to about 80 countries.) Influenced by the spread of ''trickle up'' entrepreneurialism, development policy is increasingly shifting to programs that have a direct impact on peoples' lives, grass-roots projects that fill basic needs for food, shelter, education and health services.\n''The big infrastructure projects are still needed to improve overall economic performance,'' said John W. Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, a research organization specializing in third world issues. ''But these entrepreneurial programs - which really do demonstrate the magic of the marketplace - clearly deserve to be supported.''\nThe ''trickle up'' approach has also won strong backing in Congress, which late last year passed legislation instructing the Agency for International Development to direct $50 million in the current fiscal year and $75 million next year to finance third world small-credit programs.\n''It represents a dramatic new direction in foreign assistance,'' said Representative Edward F. Feighan, Democrat of Ohio, who introduced the legislation in the House along with Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York.\nDennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, one of 50 Senate sponsors, said that among other things he believes the small loans will counter the narcotics trade.\nHe said that in Bolivia cocaine depends on a cheap supply of migrant laborers to harvest coca leaves. Out of economic necessity, thousands of Bolivian workers migrate to the coca-producing lowlands to earn income from this harvest.\nHe cited studies by the Foundation for International Community Assistance (Finca) - an organization similar to Accion - showing that a $50 loan provides enough working capital to encourage such alternatives as making cloth or marketing vegetables.\nAll of the operators of the small loan programs report a high repayment rate. Mr. Gross of Accion says that fewer than 1 percent of the borrowers default. The Grameen Bank of Bangladesh reports a repayment rate of better than 97 percent. So does Finca, an acronym for farm in Spanish, which operates a network of 600 banks with 32,000 borrowers in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Costa Rica and El Salvador.\n''The poor are bankable,'' said Idriss Jazairy, president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, which provided $3.4 million to the Grameen Bank for its seminal village lending program in 1980.\nMost such programs are based on a solidarity principle. Although loans are made to individual entrepreneurs, each individual is in a group of four or five others who are in line for similar credits. Together they act as co-guarantors. If one individual is unable to make timely payments, credit for the entire group is jeopardized, which results in heavy peer-group pressure on the delinquent.\nIn the Grameen model an individual joins a group of five borrowers who meet weekly with an officer of the bank trained in small-scale financial activities. He provides management advice. All repayments take place at the group meetings.\nAt first only two members of the group are allowed to apply for a loan. Depending on their repayments, the next two borrowers can apply, and then the fifth.\nGrameen entrepreneurs have used their money for the purchase of cows, cycle repairing, weaving, pottery and even perfume making.\n''We are not doing any favors. We are in business,'' Mr. Yunus said in an interview with a New York Times correspondent in Bangladesh.\nAccording to Mr. Yunus and other experts, the small-credit activity offers exciting possibilities.\n''You could enter into a huge market of banking specifically oriented to profit-making loans to the poor,'' said Jeffrey Ashe, a Boston economic consultant. He envisions whole networks of small-loan shops. ''I'd love to see franchisable McDonald's or Burger King-type money stores accessing this particular market,'' he said.\nBut high transaction costs are a formidable barrier to financial institutions in developed countries.\n''IT'S very far afield for most commercial bankers,'' said Mary Houghton, president of the South Shore Bank of Chicago, which runs such programs in the United States through a nonprofit unit of the bank. For the past 15 years, South Shore's owners have wanted the bank to turn a profit, but also play a role in urban neighborhood redevelopment.\nIn the third world, however, village banking benefits from economies of scale. Since many of the loans are similar, a single bank representative may monitor the progress of thousands of loans weekly.\nIn countries with high unemployment rates, the job-making potential of microenterprise lending is particularly appealing to policy makers.\nRamon Uceta makes furniture in the Dominican Republic's capital of Santo Domingo. He borrowed $67 initially from the local Accion affiliate, and now 33 months and 13 progressively larger loans later, he employs 14 workers and lives in a new development in a house with running water and electricity.\nBefore he entered the program he was paying 20 percent a month to loan sharks. Now his interest rates are down to 1 1/2 percent a month.\nIn Cali, the third-largest city of Colombia, loans of about $50 enabled a group of women to start a business. They first bought sewing machines, then banded together to make baby clothes now sold in Colombian shops.\nAlthough there is a growing body of encouraging experience with small loans, many experts caution against excessively high expectations, noting that there is no single, simple answer to the problem of raising living standards around the world.\n''How do you cause small-scale enterprise to spread rapidly enough to make a difference?'' asked Robert L. Payton, scholar in residence in philanthropic studies at the University of Virginia and a former ambassador to Cameroon in West Africa.\n''The African economies are much more open to this activity than they used to be,'' when government-ownedengineering projects were in favor, he said. ''It's all very encouraging. But you can't throw money at it. You can't push it faster than it will go.''

      "text": "Rain Forest Worth More if Uncut, Study Says\n1989-07-04T05:00:00.000Z\nPROVIDING evidence that environmentalists and Brazilian officials say could slow the pace of large-scale clearing of tropical forests, a team of scientists has found that rain forests are worth more if left standing than if cut for timber or cattle grazing.\nThe study, reported in the current issue of the journal Nature, showed that revenues generated by harvesting edible fruits, rubber, oils and cocoa from 2.5 acres of tropical rainforest are nearly two times greater than the return on timber or the value of the land if used for grazing cattle.\nUntil now, environmentalists, in calling for a slowdown of deforestation in South America and other regions, have relied primarily on ecological arguments, mainly that clearing of forests releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, adding to the level of gases that contribute to global warming. 'A Bad Investment'\nMore than 28 million acres of forest and other woodlands are lost annually around the world, and at the current rate of deforestation it is projected that several countries, including El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast, will have destroyed all their forests in 30 years.\n''The study indicates that deforestation is a bad investment,'' said Charles M. Peters of the Institute of Economic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden, who headed the three-year study.\n''People who have wanted to save the forest using environmental arguments have not been very persuasive because many of these nations have a large debt,'' he said. ''But these findings offer a very powerful argument for forest conservation.''\nBrazilian Embassy officials in Washington said that while the study was being reviewed by scientists, the Brazilian goverment ''does not find the information surprising.''\n''Along with other reports like this and with work being done by our government, the study is likely to have an impact,'' said Vera Machado, counselor for environmental issues in the Brazilian Embassy. ''We expect that the deforestation will be decreasing.''\nSouth American governments, along with timber companies, miners and cattle ranchers, have been criticized by environmentalists, who contend that they have pursued large-scale clearing of forests to create farmland or sell timber without regard for the environmental impact. Brazil, for example, offered economic incentives to private entrepreneurs from 1965 to 1983 to invest in cattle ranching, a policy environmentalists say promoted the destruction of thousands of acres of woodlands. Link to Disasters Seen\nAmazon forests are regarded as among the richest and most diverse in the world and the source of hundreds of varieties of edible fruits, oils, as well as virtually untapped medicinal products, The clearing of tropical forests contributes to the warming of the atmosphere, and ultimately to the greenhouse effect, because the giant trees contain large amounts of carbon that are released when they rot or burn.\nIn addition, the destruction of forests in many countries has led to several disasters, says World Watch Institute, an environmental research group in Washington. Rainfall runoff, accelerated by deforestation, has triggered widespead flooding in Bangladesh, India, the Sudan, Thailand and elsewhere.\nThe new study showed that 12 products, primarily edible fruits and latex, found in one hectare, about 2.5 acres, of forest at the village of Mishana, in northeastern Peru near the Brazilian border, are worth $6,330 if sold in local markets over 50 years, with the cost of harvesting deducted from the market price.\nThe study also showed that the same land if used as a timber plantation would produce $3,184 over the same period, and that if converted to cattle pastures, it would be worth $2,960. 'A Way of Life'\nDr. Peters said people who live in the region harvest and sell all of the products that were detailed in the study, and for many it is their main source of income. The study was also based on the work of Alwyn H. Gentry of the Missouri Botanical Garden and Robert O. Mendelsohn of Yale University.\nSome researchers, while agreeing that the study provides important new data, said the value of edible fruits and other produce arrived at by Dr. Peters's group might be artifically inflated due to market conditions.\nIf the forests were managed and large quantities of produce were gathered and sold, the market price could drop significantly, said Susana Hecht, who specializes in economic and environmental development of the Amazon at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. First Detailed Accounting\nWhile scientists have believed for many years that the harvest produced in certain regions of tropical rain forests is economically valuable, the study provides the first detailed accounting.\n''The problem is that we have never been able quantify those benefits to convince these nation's ministers of this,'' said Raymond Rowe, a forestry adviser at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\nScientists and economists also said that as soil in regions of cleared forest has become fragile after short periods of use, farming has not produced the levels of economic success originally expected.\n''It apppears that keeping it as managed forests has greater economic value,'' said Lester B. Lave, an economist and environmental expert at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.\n''Brazil has a rapidly growing population and must look to the forest to provide them with a place of employment,'' he said. ''Instead of cutting it and using it for farmland, they now might consider developing it as managed forests.''"

      "text": "THE NOTORIOUS UNKNOWN INDIAN\n1988-11-13T05:00:00.000Z\nTHY HAND, GREAT ANARCH! India: 1921-1952. By Nirad C. Chaudhuri. 979 pp. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. $29.95.\nOn his wedding night, Nirad Chaudhuri, a man in his early 30's, sat beside his bride for the first time. He was in a state of high anxiety, but not because his previous sexual experiences had amounted only to gazing from afar at a young woman in a nearby house and studiously reading the classics of French pornography. What he was worried about was whether his new wife would permit him to pursue his passion for phonograph recordings of European classical music. Carefully he broached the subject: Could she spell ''Beethoven''? To his great relief she slowly responded: ''B,E,E,T,H,O,V,E,N.''\nNirad Chaudhuri is a fiction created by the Indian writer of the same name - a bizarre, outrageous and magical transformation of that stock character of imperialist literature, the Bengali Babu. Ever since Mr. Chaudhuri failed his M.A. examination in history at Calcutta University and threw over a secure post as clerk in the military accounts department, he has devoted himself to responding to the notion that Indians could not be truly learned in the civilization of Europe. As a man of culture - not, as he would put it, in the anthropological sense - he would beat the British at their own game.\nNow 91 years old and living in Oxford, England, Mr. Chaudhuri has written this monstrously long memoir - ''Thy Hand, Great Anarch!'' - as a way to settle scores not only with the British, but with India's nationalist leaders, that is, with those who opposed and finally defeated the Westernization of Indian civilization. He sees himself as the last survivor of the so-called Bengal Renaissance, the vital and creative cultural movement that was initiated by Ram Mohan Roy (c. 1774-1833) and that came to an end with the death of Rabindranath Tagore in 1941.\nAccording to Mr. Chaudhuri, the Bengali Hindu gentry lost their rightful role as the political and cultural leaders of modern India, partly as a result of their own moral limitations, but mostly because of a combination of British racism and the rise of democratic politics. To reverse the old colonial cliche, British imperialism was a fine thing except for the British, for they continually opposed the efforts of Indians to participate in the European way of life. But the real villains, the author says, were Nehru and especially Gandhi, who threw over the opportunity of their youthful experience in England to deny all that could have revitalized India.\nMr. Chaudhuri didn't have the advantages of India's leaders. Born in 1897, his knowledge of things European came almost entirely from the Imperial Library in Calcutta or from books purchased at great personal sacrifice. In 1942, with Tagore dead, with the Japanese just east of Bengal and the political leadership of Bengali Hindus eclipsed by Bengal's Muslim majority and, at the national level, by non-Bengalis like Gandhi and Nehru, Mr. Chaudhuri said his goodbye to all that and left Bengal. ''My people had no future,'' he decided, ''and I was not prepared to share their fate.''\nFor the previous five years he had been private secretary to an important leader of the Indian National Congress, Sarat Chandra Bose, whose younger brother, Subhas, drummed out of the Congress, had joined the Axis powers as leader of the Indian National Army. Always pro-British - Churchill, the fiercest antagonist of Indian nationalism, was his political hero - Mr. Chaudhuri accepted a position as a writer of propaganda (frankly so called in those days) for the Government broadcasting system in Delhi. In his previous career as a freelance journalist, editor and radio commentator, he had written in both Bengali and English; now he virtually gave up Bengali and along with it much of the Bengali style of living. For the first time in his life, he adopted English clothing, of course of the best material and cut. He also made the supreme sacrifice and started eating English-style food, having come to the conclusion that ''good English cannot be written on [ an Indian ] diet.''\nIn 1947, Mr. Chaudhuri set out to write ''The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian.'' That was also the year of India's independence and partition. Bengal was divided, with Mr. Chaudhuri's birthplace in what is now Bangladesh. His memoir follows the pattern of much Bengali fiction. There is a sensitive and lyrical description of early childhood and education in the rural heartland of Bengal, followed by an account of a painful uprooting to the city of Calcutta; in the end, the hero is cast adrift in tragic isolation - all this a romantic echo of the classical Hindu stages of life.\nThe ''Autobiography'' took Mr. Chaudhuri's life story and his account of India's modern development to 1921. ''Thy Hand, Great Anarch!'' is the continuation, ending the story in 1952 with the publication (in 1951) and reception of that first book. It was only three years later that Mr. Chaudhuri got to travel to his beloved Europe (the account of that brief trip is his best book, ''A Passage to England''). In 1970, thanks to the personal patronage of the American sociologist Edward Shils, he settled down in England, never to return to India.\nThe reception of ''The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian'' invalidated its title. Mr. Chaudhuri became notorious, celebrated in England and the United States, denounced in India. In his first book he had declared himself a failure, but here, for all his bitterness, the protagonist is characterized by immense self-satisfaction.\nMr. Chaudhuri deliberately had the ''Autobiography'' and most of his subsequent books published initially in England, on the grounds that only then would they receive attention in India. In ''Thy Hand, Great Anarch!'' he portrays himself as ''a Cassandra, giving warnings of calamities to come.'' It is only out of frustration that he has accepted the more comfortable role of shoring up the ethnocentric self-confidence of Westerners by debunking India. ''Even now my countrymen have not learnt to be afraid of me, and pay no heed to what I write.'' It is sad but understandable that Mr. Chaudhuri prefers what he calls ''my literary standing in the English speaking world.''\nThis book's title, derived from Alexander Pope's ringing conclusion to the ''Dunciad,'' announces the author's bitter satirical purpose, for he depicts both modern India and the modern world as mired in a reign of chaos. The subtitle, ''India: 1921-1952,'' makes the book sound like a history, and indeed much of it is made up of lengthy historical essays or high-flown disquisitions about the rise and fall of civilizations.\nAs a historian Mr. Chaudhuri is useful insofar as he recounts personal experience - for example, his accounts of the Bose brothers or of Hindu-Muslim riots at the time of partition. But much of the history in this book is second-hand at best. Great cascades of flowery erudition, allusions to the histories of ancient Greece and endless quotations of French poetry are of interest mostly as evidence of Mr. Chaudhuri's artfully constructed persona. Indeed, he points out the hollowness of the whole enterprise as a work of scholarship by saying at the outset that a history of the period cannot be written, since all the documents are false and all historians ignorant or dishonest. And only he is left to tell the tale. But he also says that the tale is not worth telling, that nothing was achieved by all the political events of the period, that Gandhi had nothing to do with the departure of the British, that the British left out of sheer exhaustion at the hands of Hitler. If one were to ask how he can know what he claims to know, the history would vanish into air. A good editor would have removed most of it.\nBut people have said the same thing about ''War and Peace.'' Although Mr. Chaudhuri may not be what Saul Bellow would call the Tolstoy of the Bengalis, he may remind many readers of Nabokov's Pnin."

      "text": "India's Bleakest Corner Is Where All Hope Ends\n1989-09-11T05:00:00.000Z\nIn an era when it is common to talk of Asian economic miracles and a Pacific century, the Indian state of Rajasthan is a reminder that there are, in reality, two Asias. There are the economic tigers and would-be tigers from Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand, but also the struggling, crowded, volatile nations of South Asia, especially India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, where survival is difficult.\nIn many ways, Rajasthan reflects South Asia's problems.\nPopulation is a major contributor to the widening gap between the two Asias. India Today, the country's leading news magazine, has estimated, based on current population trends, that within decades India will be the world's poorest country. With a current population of 810 million and a growth rate of 2.1 percent a year, the magazine estimates that by early in the next century India will have well over a billion people, with the world's largest numbers of illiterates and homeless - 600 million in each category - and 400 million unemployed.\nRajasthan, a northwestern state on the Pakistan border, has the country's fastest-growing population with an annual increase of 2.8 percent. Land and vegetation are visibly running out. Urban areas, including Jaipur, the 18th-century ''pink city'' that was once a model of town planning, are overrun by the poor. Where India's Troubles Are Coming Together\nIn ecology, nutrition, culture and politics, Rajasthan is a demographer's laboratory, and some of India's most creative research into the complex problems of population growth, human development and adjustment to a changing environment is being done here.\nIn a region with a distinctive culture, art portrays the plight of the Rajasthani countryside and recently inspired a collection of short poems, ''Footprints in the Sand,'' by Amit Jayaram. One of the poems says: The animals' feet leave their print on the desert's face. Hunger is so real, so very real, that it can make you walk around a barren tree looking for nourishment. Not once. Not twice. Not thrice. . . .\nFormerly the domain of Hindu Rajput maharajahs whose courts and cultures had come under strong Islamic influence, Rajasthan, with 44 million people, is now statistically a part of the nation's largest demographic bloc: the Hindu, Hindi-speaking belt of northern states that also includes Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and parts of Haryana. The area dominates Indian politics, a source of irritation to parts of the country where social and economic advances have been greater.\nIn the Hindi belt, where 40 percent of Indians live, literacy and the status of women are lower than in other states. More and more Indians regard those factors as major causes of a national failure to curb population growth. Rajasthan Ranks Last In Almost Everything\nRajasthan has a literacy rate of 24 percent, the lowest of all the major states, according to the 1981 census (the next will be in 1991). Only 5 percent of rural Rajasthani women read or write, and fewer than 10 percent of girls from age 5 to 9 attend school. Between a ninth (in cities) and a third (in rural areas) of all Rajasthani workers are 14 years old or younger, often a reflection of their economic importance to families.\nChild marriage is the norm, in defiance of national laws that set the legal age for women at 18 and for men at 21. Many Rajasthanis see this practice as a social necessity. A girl married before or at puberty is considered safe from extramarital sex and the stigma of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which could result in her murder at the hands of outraged relatives.\nThirty-year-old Kamla lives in the village of Kotri, northeast of Ajmer and a few miles from Sambhar Salt Lake. The land here is not as good as it is farther north, where irrigation projects have been started, or as bad as the deserts to the west. The soil is not unlike the rest of north India's scrub land.\nFarming on a self-sustaining scale is not possible in Kotri, and families depend on sheep and goats. The dirt roads are choked by herds being led in search of food. Camels are harnessed to plows where arable fields exist. A camel can look after itself, the local people say, letting the men of Kotri concentrate on their wool-and meat-producing flocks.\nMrs. Kamla, the daughter of a Brahman who allowed her to learn to read and write, thinks for a few minutes when asked how Rajasthan's growing population has affected Kotri, a town with a few hundred families living in small houses of concrete or stone. Lacking Land, Many Are Forced to Leave\n''There is less and less land,'' she says in Hindi, through an interpreter. ''Every year the water in the ground is more saline. Water is a big problem.\n''More people have to migrate, and migrate farther and farther, to find enough food for the animals,'' she says.\nThe lengthening winter and spring migrations, sometimes involving treks of hundreds of miles to the neighboring states of Madhya Pradesh or Gujarat, uproot entire families. Birth control can seem pointless when a father needs extra shepherds to patrol the edges of the wandering flocks, Mrs. Kamla says.\nThere are other migrations, too. From villages like these, thousands of Rajasthani men and women go to cities as far away as New Delhi or Bombay in search of manual work, often on construction sites.\nIn Kotri, Mrs. Kamla, is trying to make changes. She is working through the Social Work and Research Center, a nongovernmental development organization in Tilonia, 40 miles to the south. She is a woman in one of India's most male-dominated states, where village women, approached by outsiders, cover their faces with shawls or bright-colored saris. But Mrs. Kamla's high caste gives her standing, and village men acknowledge her as a leader. A Different Concept Of Population Control\nMrs. Kamla is trying to promote population control in Kotri by persuading women to use family planning services available at Government clinics. The mother of two girls, she seems skeptical of experts who say Indians will continue to have children until they have had enough boys, usually two, to guarantee support in old age and a son to light their funeral pyres.\n''The women here say they have so many children because there is no health care here,'' she says over tea, with guests sprawled on the floor in her small office. In India, family planning means sterilization, and in more than 90 percent of the cases, the operation is performed on women. Conditions are often unsanitary.\n''Women in this village say they do not want to be sterilized after two children, boys or girls, because the nearest doctor is far away and the services there are not very good,'' she says. ''So they ask: 'What happens if one of the babies falls sick and dies? Or what if I become ill after the operation? Who will look after me?' ''\nIn Naul, a village east of Tilonia, another high-caste woman, Ratan, is also trying to promote family planning. Married off at puberty to an older man, she was widowed while still in her teens. Her parents then took the bold step of allowing her to reject another marriage, and she began doing community work, using a knowledge of traditional medicine learned from her husband.\nTold about community work being done in rural Bangladesh, where villagers are trained in nutrition, Mrs. Ratan said most families here live on flat breads and lentils, and teaching them to prepare balanced diets would be meaningless, she explained, since there are almost no vegetables or fruits. In Jaipur, Fading Glory Of the Raj and Nature\nWhen the Rajasthani capital of Jaipur was built by the Maharajah Sawai Jai Singh of Amber in the mid-18th century, it was an Asian wonder. There were broad avenues drawn on a grid, shady colonnaded walkways along wide pavements, and a unity of architecture in private, public and commercial buildings. There was a drainage system.\nIn 250 years, Jaipur, a city built to serve 500,000 people, has become home to 1.5 or 2 million - no one really knows - and its glory has all but disappeared behind the huts of squatters and sidewalk vendors.\nAs the population continues to expand with the influx of people from the countryside, who erect small houses on the desert around the city's perimeter, its services have been severely strained. Roads are potholed; its once-famous drainage pipes clogged.\nThe destruction of Jaipur's natural environment has also been rapid and drastic, says Professor G. S. Nathawat of the Indira Gandhi Center for Ecological, Environmental and Population Studies at Rajasthan University. He takes a visitor to hills near the campus to see the latest phase in the city's deterioration.\nThere, forests are being razed and quarries dug to provide the booming construction industry with granite. The hills are protected woodlands and the quarrying illegal. But the business is so profitable that local officials can be bribed to make exceptions.\nOnly one small part of the forest backdrop remains, a section that university students have claimed and fenced. It is the last piece of recreation land left to them in Jaipur's once-wooded hills."

According to local sources, the erosion has taken a serious turn in Ghagha, Mollikpur, Shierbr, and Makrail areas along Madhumati's banks, and at 15 points including Kargati, Soto Kalia, and Suktogram, of Nabaganga banks. People  of the affected areas have accused the local Water Development Board (WDB) of its negligence as water from the rivers poured into houses in Kalia upazila. \"I have never seen Nabaganga rise so much in the last 35 years. My house was destroyed in a matter of seconds,\" said Ilias Ali, a resident of Sukragram. Many, who have lost their houses in river erosion, are living with their relatives, but some like Julmat Sheikh of Kalia upazila's Noragati village, have been staying under the open sky with their families as they have nowhere else to go. Locals accused the administration of doing little to help them. According to the locals, the WDB has failed to prevent recurring erosion because of their lackadaisical attitude.  Babra-Hachla Union Parishad Chairman Mojammel Hossain said the situation will be brought under control soon. The local contractors declined to perform the emergency work at the beginning of monsoon as WDB officials usually demand 10 percent bribe for such projects, alleged contractors. When contacted, WDB Executive Engineer Md Zulfikar Ali declined to comment over the issue. Meanwhile locals formed a human chain in the district yesterday protesting the  negligence of WDB. Among others, Monisha Ghosh, Profullo Barman, Liton Kumar Ghosh, Kalyani Barman, and Modon Ghosh of the affected areas spoke at the gathering. They urged the administration to take immediate steps to save the people from becoming victims of river erosion."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-15 00:00:00      \nThe private and public sectors must work together to pull the country out of this crisis Some regrettable politics is taking place in the name of distribution of relief for the poor. Firstly, the government has not provided a strong and adequate stimulus package to help the poor and the ultra poor to fight the novel coronavirus epidemic. Secondly, even where it has sanctioned relief materials, only those who are well-connected or are known to the powerful local officials are getting the relief; and also, relief materials are getting stolen by the powerful government officials and local leaders of the ruling party. Many of them have already been arrested for this crime as well.  This is a matter of great disgust. Even though the coronavirus is a novel epidemic, we are not observing novel tactics in fighting it from the government's side. All the tools and tactics that are being used are from the olden days. The government is just treating this like any other natural calamity like a flood or a cyclone.  As such, relief distribution, too, has boiled down to photo opportunities for the government officials. One upazila chairman, Mahiuddin Biswas, has even gone so far as hitting a poor person who did not want to take a photo while taking relief. But corona is an ongoing problem, not a cyclone that you can solve merely by giving out some token relief materials after the calamity. The work that is to be done now is not merely damage control, it is situation management.  And without a medium-term strategic approach to fighting this crisis, we have no hope of coming out of it. When the photo session is over, the government officials are leaving, even when hundreds in their relief distribution area are still not taken care of. This is adding insult to injury for the poor people who are calling their local aid centres and hearing that government aid has already been distributed in that area. It is heartening to see that the government has declared that those who steal relief materials will face court cases along with administrative punishment, but we are still to see that in action comprehensively.   We have seen some government officials getting punishment for stealing relief, but this is not enough. If the government can really bring all the wrongdoers to books for stealing relief goods along with those who fail to adequately distribute relief in their area, that would be a great step forward. What we need now is a medium-term national plan for re-emerging from this disaster that has already gotten a grip on much of the country. Both the private and the public sectors must do their part to help the country get out of this disaster.  The relief materials need to be distributed properly, without scope for stealing or wasting otherwise by only distributing to the well-connected.  Even the amount that the government can do at this time of crisis is limited. As such, it is necessary for a comprehensive plan-of-action so that we make proper use of the resources we have. The relief distribution needs to be need-based. Even the middle class and lower middle class people, who are too shy to ask for help in these dire times, need to be paid attention to, and be brought under the social safety net through relief operations that transcend the lower classes and access the middle class.  In these scenarios, the best method for distributing relief materials would be to access the homes of the people, alongside distributing relief on the streets. Some initiatives like this have been taken by the home minister and the mayors of Dhaka City North and Dhaka City South, among others, and I really appreciate their efforts.  This is how it should be done, but there also needs to be a comprehensive plan to tackle this crisis in the medium term, if we are to come out of the crisis any time soon. Without that sort of comprehensive planning, it will be hard for us to spring out of this disaster strong. Anupam Debashis Roy is an editor and organizer of Muktiforum."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-28 00:00:00      \nDozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment At least 33 Turkish soldiers were killed as violence escalates in Syria's Idlib province after an air strike blamed on Damascus, with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemning \"indiscriminate\" attacks by the Assad regime and Russia. Dozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment, Rahmi Dogan, governor of Turkish Hatay -- bordering Syria -- said Friday. The heavy losses in northwestern Idlib come after weeks of growing tensions between rebel supporter Ankara and Damascus ally Moscow. Stoltenberg \"urged all parties to de-escalate this dangerous situation and avoid further worsening of the horrendous humanitarian situation in the region\", his spokesman said Friday. In a phone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the NATO secretary general \"condemned the continued indiscriminate air strikes by the Syrian regime and its backer Russia in Idlib province\", according to the spokesman. Turkey has urged the Syrian regime to withdraw from Turkish observation posts in Idlib, while Moscow has accused Ankara of aiding \"terrorists\" in Syria. Under a 2018 deal with Russia meant to bring calm to Idlib, Turkey has 12 observation posts in the region -- but several have come under fire from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hastily convened an emergency meeting in Ankara after the Idlib attack. Erdogan's top press aide, Fahrettin Altun, said Turkey's military retaliated against all known positions of the regime after the air strike. In a statement, Altun called on the international community to fulfil its responsibilities to end the violence in Idlib and the regime's \"crimes against humanity\". The latest attack means 53 Turkish security personnel have been killed in the province this month. There was a flurry of diplomatic activity as Turkey's presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin spoke with US national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, state news agency Anadolu reported without giving detail. More civilians killed  Jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels on Thursday re-entered Saraqeb, a key Idlib crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government's devastating offensive. The counteroffensive could, however, be short-lived as Russian-backed Syrian troops continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities. Seven civilians, including three children, were killed in regime and Russian bombardment of Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December. The UN Security Council, where Moscow has systematically vetoed truce initiatives, met again Thursday amid growing concern Idlib is witnessing the nine-year-old war's worst humanitarian emergency. State news agency SANA acknowledged there were \"fierce clashes\" between the army and \"terrorist groups on the Saraqeb front\".  An AFP correspondent accompanied the rebels into Saraqeb, where he found a ghost town of bombed out buildings. The counterattack temporarily reverses one of the key gains of the government since its offensive against the country's last rebel enclave in December. Refugee fears  The cash-strapped government had been keen to fully secure the M5, a highway that connects Syria's four main cities and passes through Saraqeb. The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes were carried out by Assad government ally Russia, heavily criticised by the West for the high civilian death toll from its bombing campaign. State media accused the \"terrorists\" of launching car bombings and other suicide attacks against government forces attempting to retake the town. It said the army had inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, despite the military support it said they had received from Turkey. Some 950,0000 civilians have fled the government offensive, raising fears in Ankara of a new influx of refugees. Turkey already hosts the world's largest number of Syrian refugees -- around 3.6 million people -- placing an increasingly unpopular burden on public services. The country's ruling party spokesman Omer Celik told CNN Turk broadcaster Friday Ankara was not in a position to \"hold\" refugees any longer and called on the European Union to do more. More than half a million of those displaced since December are children, tens of thousands of whom are sleeping rough in northern Syria's harsh winter. UN powerlessness The Turkish president vowed Wednesday Ankara would not take the \"smallest step back\" in the standoff with Damascus and Moscow over Idlib. Erdogan warned the Syrian government to \"stop its attacks as soon as possible\" and to pull back by the end of the month. The UN has repeatedly warned the fighting in Idlib could potentially create the most serious humanitarian crisis since the civil war's start in 2011. Nine out of 15 members of the Security Council on Wednesday urged Secretary General Antonio Guterres to step up his involvement in efforts to restore peace in Idlib. Russian vetoes, often backed by China, have chronically crippled UN action in Syria."

      "text": "At Bengali School: Slates, Then Land to Till\n1988-04-14T05:00:00.000Z\nIt took just five minutes to memorize her homework poem, said Nazma Akhtar proudly, and she can recite it so fast that the words run together in a flash of 10-year-old enthusiasm: Orange flower, orange flower, Flower of orange, Orange flower will get married With emeralds in her ears.\nNazma, a second grader, barefoot like the other children but with shiny brass bangles in her ears and a delicate brass ''nose flower'' in her nose, wants to be the first person in her family to finish all five years of elementary school.\nBut her mother says she will probably have to drop out soon, as her two brothers did before her, to help the family in the fields.\nIf she does drop out, Nazma's story will be the story of most children in this struggling nation, where poverty perpetuates itself and daily hardships leave little time for school or poems.\nBangladesh is typical of the poor nations of the world, foreign aid workers say, where children are seen as an economic asset to hungry families.\nFew families can sacrifice their children's labor for the uncertain future benefits of an education.\n''We go around to their houses and beg them to let their children stay in class,'' said one of the school's four teachers, Mumtaj Begum. ''I tell them stories of famous people and say, 'These people were just like you and they have become great people because they went to school.' ''\nGulshanara Begum, the young headmistress, said that of 852 school-age children in the area, just 238 were enrolled in the little Aingan school at the edge of the rice fields 30 miles northeast of Dhaka.\nMost children, she said, drop out to help their families after just two years of schooling, not really enough to become literate.\nOn one recent school day, only half of those enrolled were at class. The others, Mrs. Gulshanara said, were busy watering the fields, weeding, fishing and gathering firewood. 'Who Knows the Answer?'\nInside Nazma's classroom, her teacher, in a threadbare white shirt and trousers, gripped his bamboo rod and demanded angrily, ''Two plus two, who knows the answer?''\nIn the rice paddy outside, a child with a basket of pumpkins on her head walked by, her image reflected in the bright water of the paddy fields.\nA boy with a bamboo stick just like that of the teacher brought two thin cows to graze in the small field beside the schoolhouse.\nAlmost as far as the bamboo trees that shelter Nazma's house, the voices of the schoolchildren could be heard as they learned the numbers: ''One god, two worlds, three earths, four caliphs.''\nGiven the poverty and lack of education of the villagers, Mrs. Mumtaj described the role of a teacher as extending well beyond the school's walls. Advice on Health and Land\n''They come to me for advice on things like health care and land questions,'' she said. ''They even ask my opinion on marriage questions.''\nThe headmistress, Mrs. Gulshanara, said she had taken short courses in nutrition and family planning, and spent much of her time talking to villagers on these subjects.\nIn the classroom, she said, she tries to engage the children's minds and to teach them to think.\nIn an innovation of her own, she said, she has divided her classes into groups for debates on such subjects as literacy and small families. Poverty Hampers Work\n''Of course, they are young,'' she said. ''They have trouble articulating their ideas. But at least they try.''\nShe said her work is hampered by the poverty of the school.\nHer bare, concrete-floored classroom was furnished with a water jug, an umbrella, whisk brooms and a blackboard that hung from the wall on fraying ropes.\nThe children, who write on small slates, have no rulers or maps or toys or musical instruments, she said, and the school has no ball for sports."

According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) of the district, at least 3500 hectares of land have been used for cultivating tobacco in six upazilas . However, a group of people who deal with tobacco in the district said the figure was almost 10,000 hectares. Agricultural officers have said they are discouraging farmers not to grow this crop as it is harmful for both health and soil. However, the farmers are not paying heed to them as tobacco cultivation brings them huge profits every year. They also added several tobacco companies, including multinational companies, were luring tobacco growers with seeds, fertilisers as well as technical support free of cost. This correspondent visited several villages- Itakhola, Kochukata, Tupamari, Panchapakur, Gorgarm , Charcharabari and Kanaikata Bamondanga - of Sadar upazila and observed that farmers, including women and children, were passing busy times in the tobacco fields. Farmer Nazrul Islam of Charcharabari village of Sadar upazila said tobacco companies had set up many purchasing centres and warehouses of tobacco in the district for the advantage of farmers . They are collecting produce from the fields directly. Even supervisors and officials of tobacco companies are regularly assisting them with various facilities. Farmer Arzina Begum of Kanaikata Bamondanga village of Kishoreganj upazila said she had cultivated tobacco on two bighas of land that cost her Tk 8,000. She added, \"Akij company provided me with fertilizer, seeds free of cost.\" Another farmer, Mukta Akhtar, said: \"I have cultivated tobacco on two bighas of land, costing me Tk 10,000. I would sell the crops at Tk30,000-35,000. \"Had we cultivated rice, potatoes and green chillis, we would not be able to make much profit,\" she added. Some farmers of the district alleged that agriculture offices were not sincere in encouraging farmers to grow other crops. Farmers do not get advice from agriculture officials when their seed beds and crops get damaged. Nilphamari Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) Deputy Director Nikhil Chandra Biswas said: \"Profit in cultivating tobacco is more than the cost. For this reason, farmers, disregarding health risks, are cultivating tobacco in huge quantities. As a result, families of tobacco growers are getting exposed to various diseases and cropland is losing fertility gradually.\" \"However, we are trying to create awareness among farmers,\" he added."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-19 00:00:00      \nAs a makeshift arrangement, a wooden bridge with bamboo poles on the Sumeswari river in Netrakona's Durgapur upazila has been made for the first time to ease people's longstanding sufferings.  People of some 100 villages in Kullagara and Gaukandia unions have been suffering for years for want of a bridge on the river at Birisiri point in the upazila. Especially schoolchildren and critical patients are the worst sufferers due to the communication problem. The villages include Ranikhong, Khujiura, Kullagara, Shasharpar, Gaukandia, Dhanipara, Boheratoli, Charpara, Boroikandi, Jagotkura, Chhondhara and Maizpara. Shubra Sangma, chairman of Kullagara Union Parishad (UP), said as there is no bridge in the area, the lease holders of Birisiri Ferry Ghat made the 500-metre-long wooden bridge in November last year for the first time. It took around 15 days to complete construction of the bridge. Earlier, the villagers had to face various trouble to reach the upazila and district headquarters but the bridge will now ease their sufferings during the dry season, said Shubra Sangma, adding that motorcycles and CNG-run auto-rickshaws can also ply the bridge.  Some 20 years ago, a fund was sanctioned for construction of a concrete bridge at the point but the authorities concerned are yet to take any steps to build a bridge there, said the UP chairman.  At least the makeshift wooden bridge has brought a sort of relief to thousands of commuters, he said. Each person has to pay around Tk 10 to cross the bridge, said local people. Md Bakul Mia, a toll collector of the ferry ghat, said they made the makeshift bridge at a cost of Tk 7 lakh to ease longstanding sufferings of people in the villages. Mohammd Al Amin, a resident of Dakhhin Bhawanipur village, said \"The wooden bridge will be used for four months from December to March and during monsoon, we have to use engine-run boats to cross the river.\" Villagers aid during the rainy season, it becomes difficult for them to cross the area due to strong current in the river. The situation worsens when hilly waters from across the border flood the area. \"Due to lack of easy communications, the villages are separated from the Durgapur upazila headquarters. The areas are still underdeveloped due to poor communication system\", said Rasel Mia, a student of Susang Durgapur Government College. During the rainy season, the problem turned so serious and they have to cross the river on boat amid risk of accident, said Sanjida Akter, an HSC examinee from the same college. Nazrul Islam, a farmer of Bhawanipur village, said the people of the area are mainly dependent on agriculture, but they are facing serious problems to bring their produces to the markets of the town for years for want of a permanent bridge at the point. Talking to this correspondent, Executive Engineer of Roads and Highways Department in Netrakona Didarul Alam Tarafder said they are doing feasibility studies for construction of 870-metre-long concrete bridge on the river at Birisiri point."

      "text": "THE WORLD; An Election's Approach Brings Out the Indian in India\n1988-10-16T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE formation of a new Indian political party last week was a reminder that sometime in the next year -maybe as early as February - the people of India will go to the polls to cast their votes in a national parliamentary election and in so doing make some important decisions about the country's future.\nShould Rajiv Gandhi, a grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru and son of Indira Gandhi, be given an opportunity to continue the political dynasty that has dominated the nation since independence 40 years ago?\nIf Mr. Gandhi wins convincingly, will this be a mandate to continue his modernization drive, which has brought India to the brink of becoming a modern society with greater links to the West and to Japan and other industrialized free-market Asian nations?\nAnd if he goes, should India withdraw more into its nationalist, protectionist self and choose a more solitary and self-reliant path that many believe would better safeguard the nation's traditions and character?\nIt was significant that India's newest political organization, the centrist People's Party, fell into bickering within moments of its creation over the last-minute change of its name from the Socialist People's Party.\nPerhaps more than any other genuinely democratic nation, including the social democracies of Western Europe, India has socialism with a small ''s'' in its heart and in its blood. It is an Indian socialism, a not strictly orthodox creed woven into the homespun nationalism of Mohandas K. Gandhi. Indian socialism is summarized in the emotive word ''swadeshi'' - ''from our own land'' -and symbolized by the egalitarian costume of white kurta, dhoti and sandals worn from the village well to the halls of power.\nIndian socialism was strengthened and internationalized by British and Indian Fabians and by Communists who shared in the country's struggle for independence and still play a political role today.\nIn foreign policy, Indian socialism has been encouraged by four decades of close association with the Soviet Union, and by involvement in third world organizations espousing nonalignment but often siding with the Soviet bloc against the West.\nWhen neighbors such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh began to accept free-market economic policies (not to mention closer relations with the United States), Indians seemed to become more, not less, convinced of the rightness if not righteousness of their ways.\nWhen an election approaches, politicians say, parties in India often tend to veer back to their nationalist, Indian socialist roots. The rhetoric of self-reliance and self-assuredness - pitched in earthy terms to millions of Indian villagers and cloaked in anti-Americanism for a traditionally left-of-center intellectual elite - wins votes.\nAlready, Kamalapathi Tripathi, a longtime politician of Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party, has made an overture to Indian Communists to bury differences and to join to counter the potential strength of the new middle-of-the-road People's Party, which is still framing its domestic policies, and the larger opposition National Front, to which it belongs.\nHe was rebuffed; the leader of India's Communist Party dismissed Mr. Gandhi as a ''class enemy.'' Indian Communists, in their zeal to upset Mr. Gandhi, are welcoming the formation of an oppositon coalition to the right of them because it would attract more conservative Congress (I) voters while Communists seek to draw off the party's leftists. Criticism From All Sides\nThe main strength of the People's Party -many of whose leaders, including its president, V.P. Singh, a former Finance and Defense Minister, were members of the Congress (I), is that it could offer a viable, broad-based alternative to Mr. Gandhi's Government. Parties of the Marxist left or radical right could not do this and therefore could not bring down the Gandhi Government alone.\nOpposition politicians are now in the process of working out the policies and strategies that they hope will achieve this.\nRajiv Gandhi, who stepped into power within hours of his mother's assassination in 1984 by Sikh members of her bodyguard and then won the election that followed, is being criticized from almost every side these days. But central to much of the discussion is his apparent pragmatic tilt toward the West.\nMr. Gandhi's supporters say that openings to the industrialized world are necessary if India is at last to make the leap into the high technology and large-scale industrial development and raise its standard of living.\nHis critics, pointing to a recent multimillion-dollar deal that will allow Pepsico Inc. to enter the Indian market, accuse the Prime Minister of succumbing to ''economic imperialism,'' selling out the national heritage and endangering domestic industries that will not be able to compete with the soft-drink and food processing plant that it is setting up.\nPepsi is almost certain to be an election issue, with some opposition politicians pledging to abrogate the contract if the Prime Minister is defeated. One of them, George Fernandes, threw Coca-Cola out of India when he was a minister in an opposition Government in 1978.\nBut much has changed in 10 years. Many veterans of the independence generation are gone. Their grandchildren attend American, not British, universities. ''American-returned'' prospective spouses are in demand for a generation accustomed to unisex beauty parlors, discotheques and aerobic dance classes, which came late to India and are regularly excoriated as symbols of decadent foreign influence.\nIn the coming months Indians with new outlooks will be asked to decide who they are and where they want to be led. Decades ago, Nehru, the first Prime Minister, sensed the same searching mood.\n''Sometimes as I reached a gathering, a great roar of welcome would greet me: Bharat Mata ki jai! - Victory to Mother India!'' he wrote in ''Discovering India.''\n''I would ask them unexpectedly what they meant by that cry, who was this Mother India whose victory they wanted? My question would amuse them and surprise them, and then, not knowing exactly what to answer, they would look at each other and at me.''"

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-01 00:00:00      \nImagine a Japanese man in Dhaka in the first decade of the twentieth century bent on being employed in the town and ending up marrying a Bengali Brahmo woman, the daughter of a soap factory owner, who has offered him a job. Think of the woman later going to a village near Nagoya with her husband (now a soap factory owner himself in Dhaka) to visit her in-laws, a few years before the First World War erupts. Imagine next the woman accompanying her husband to Japan once more at the outbreak of the Second World War, since the Japanese man is afraid of being jailed in British India. There she meets Netaji Subhas Bose and is thrilled by his vision of an independent homeland liberated from the British with the help of the Japanese Army. Picture, if you will her broadcasting in Bengali on Netaji's behalf on wartime Japanese radio. Consider now the prospects, years after her death, of the discovery of two manuscripts of the woman's visits, one published in her lifetime, but the other surviving only in manuscript form, recovered from oblivion and published devotedly by successive scholars/editors, and even a film made on her by an eminent Bangladeshi filmmaker.  And imagine finally a book in English that gathers almost everything available by and on this remarkable Brahmo woman so that readers can piece together her life and see it in its proper context. As readers of the book under review will agree once they have finished with it, truth is at times stronger than fiction! The Journey of a Bengali Woman to Japan is a noteworthy work centering on Hariprabha Mallick Takeda, a Bengali woman (1890-1972), who was married off to Oemon Takeda, a Japanese national employed in her father's soap factory in 1907 by her enlightened Brahmo father. At the time of marriage, she was looking after a home for abandoned girls and destitute women in Dhaka's Nimtali. She and Takeda visited Japan for four months in 1912-13; her account of the trip was published as Banga Mohilar Japan Jatra in 1915. The couple had no children but was happily settled in Dhaka, where Takeda had done well as the owner of a factory manufacturing glycerin soap. Her third trip lasted seven years (there was a second trip in 1924 that has gone unrecorded) and shows a Japan first being devastated by its war efforts, and in real bad shape afterwards The rediscovery of Hariprabha's writings has been a continuous affair. The Bangladeshi scholar Monzurul Huq located a copy of the first and only book published by her sister, Santiprabha Mullick in 1915 in London's Indian Office Library and later on, brought out an edition of it in 1999; two more editions were published later in Delhi (2007) and Kolkata (2009) by others. The handwritten manuscript of her experience in Japan at the time of the Second World War was discovered after her death by Surojit Dasgupta, the nephew she lived with in the final years of her life, and was published with the book on her first trip by Manjushree Sinha from Kolkata in 2009. Sinha's edition also contains another hitherto undiscovered work in Bengali by Hariprabha titled \"Child Rearing and Women's Education in Japan,\" originally published in the journal Bharatbarsha in 1949. What Somdatta Mandal has done so well is not only to translate these three manuscripts into English but also append them with a translation of an essay by Monzurul Huq introducing the first two works, an original essay by Kazuhiro Watanabe titled, \"The Japan that Hariprabha Saw,\" a translation of select compilation of articles by Swapan Prasanna Roy that he had written for his 2007 Delhi edition of the first two works, and a translation of the Introduction Sinha had written for her 2009 Kolkata edition. Obviously fascinated by everything she was finding out in the research she had undertaken to bring out her translations of Hariprabha's writings, Mandal follows up her translations and the contextual comments of previous editors and Watanabe with further translations of the \"Reminiscences\" of Hariprabha's nephew Surojit and his wife Manju Dasgupta of their \"Baro Mashi\" (eldest aunt). For good measure, Mandal also includes a review of Tanvir Mokammel's 2012 documentary Japani Bodhu (\"Japanese Bride\"), and reprints a scholarly piece by Gautam Neogi on the home for abandoned and destitute women Hariprabha managed till 1908. Of the works by Hariprabha, the first and longest is a fairly straightforward account of the voyage she took on shipboard with her husband to Japan and the people she met during her extended stay with her in-laws. She clearly has an eye for details and a mind that can organize them as well as the capacity to write simply. As a Brahmo, she takes occasional metaphysical leaps that stand out in her narrative. For example, when the ship she is in is leaving the river and entering the sea, she is impressed by the time it takes the vessel to reach blue water and views it as the wait humans are destined to experience in uniting with the Almighty.  In a Japanese temple she is eager to see the \"idol-less God [that] resides in this huge temple.\" There are things in Hariprabha's narratives clearly meant to be seen as exemplary for her Bengali readers. When she visits a girl's school she notes that the little children there are \"not taught with the aid of books\" but are \"given basic ethical training through stories\" and made to learn through activities like clay modeling and drawing. She obviously liked seeing Japanese women spending no more than half a day doing house work. She is also impressed here (and in the second account) by the cleanliness of the Japanese, observing their addiction to taking frequent public baths, their obsession with keeping public places clean, and not littering anything anytime anywhere. She records too how the Japanese, for their part, are fascinated by the presence of a Bengali woman in their midst, who, for her part, was obviously \"basking in the love and attention of everyone.\" While I liked reading the account of her first trip, I must confess that I found her description of her stay in war-torn Japan much more appealing. Her depiction of a people scarred mentally and having to undergo endless hardship because of war-time scarcity, of landscapes being devastated by enemy bombings, and of unending deaths can be quite moving as when she writes, \"The houses of the ordinary people of Japan were full of sorrow--husbands and sons dead, children dead of starvation, no food, no clothes, no roof above their heads.\" And yet she notes the courtesy and kindness with which she and her ageing husband are treated by the Japanese, as when they queued for food rations. At one point she and her increasingly infirm husband are forced to live in the corner of a godown. The second account attracted me a lot more than the first one also because of the glimpses it affords of Netaji and the Azad Hind in Japan. We find him sitting with Hariprabha in his car in Tokyo, hear him declare that his group would fight for India's independence till the end, and learn of the death of Netaji himself on a plane on the way (presumably) to India from Bangkok. True, what we have in Hariprabha's unpublished memoir are only such scattered references, but they seem to me to be, nevertheless, invaluable. As for Hariprabha's third work where she writes on Japanese women and children, one notices the implicit criticism of Bengalis in this regard and her admiration for the Japanese. This seems to be the case when she notes the use of diapers by mothers and the way they carry their children on their backs or avoid hitting them, transmitting well their \"nurturing instincts\" to the young ones. She obviously admires the schooling in politeness girls receive in schools. In this post-war essay, however, there is also an indication of her regret in the manner Japanese women were beginning to imitate American ways. Somdatta Mandal has done admirable work not only in translating Hariprabha's works so lucidly but also in her intelligent selection of selected contextual comments of other translators and scholars. Her translation and scholarship are evidence of her admiration for the unique experience of this Bengali Brahmo woman from Dhaka in Japan. My only regret after ending the book is that although Mandal and Jadavpur University Press appeared to have done their best to bring out a very attractive edition, there are no clear photos/portraits of Hariprabha in Dhaka, Japan, or West Bengal (where she lived after partition and her return from Japan) in The Journey of a Bengali Woman to Japan. But that could be because of a flood in Darjeeling which ruined whatever the widowed woman had in her trunk in the last stage of her life.

      "text": "The Next Generation of Poison; An Issue for the No-Issue Campaign\n1988-10-09T05:00:00.000Z\nAmerica's air is mostly breathable. Its rivers don't catch fire anymore. Raw sewage usually ends up in treatment plants, not the nearest river basin. That much has been accomplished by the environmental laws of the early 1970's. Yet the campaign is only half won because tighter controls have been offset by the extra pollution from economic growth. Worse, society now confronts a new generation of environmental dangers, more insidious, far-reaching and intractable than the old.\nThe thinning of the life-protecting ozone layer in the high atmosphere is one such threat. Global warming - the feared greenhouse effect - is another. Air pollution, like acid rain and smog, is eroding the life of lakes and forests throughout North America and Europe. Pollutants draining off city streets and farms poison the coastal waters on which many estuarine and oceanic species depend. The world's richest nurseries of life, the tropical forests, are being destroyed at a horrifying rate: about six acres a minute.\nThe summer of '88 bristled with warnings, yet this second generation of environmental threats is not well understood. How can society find the money, courage and global cooperation to conquer them? There could hardly be a more urgent issue for debate in a Presidential campaign. Yet where are the ideas of the candidates, the men who profess to lead the way against the urgencies of the 1990's?\nThe old environmental problems consisted of visible threats to human health or comfort, often emanating from a single source like a plant or toxic dump. The remedies were clear enough: Make the offending industry pay to install pollution controls or clean up.\nThe new generation of problems is far harder to tackle. The sources are many and diverse, the damage often invisible or indirect. The victims are the ecology and atmosphere, with delayed damage to human well-being.\nPowerful interests inhibit the search for solutions. Just last week, under pressure from utilities and the coal and auto industries, Congress gave up once again on efforts to combat acid rain and smog through reform of the Clean Air Act.\nWhen Vice President Bush and Governor Dukakis talk environment, it's about barely relevant issues like Boston harbor and offshore oil drilling. Any remedies the candidates might propose are cramped by the immense debt run up by the Reagan Administration. Yet whoever wins cannot hope to escape the issue, any more than voters can escape thinking about it. Heat and Light as Killers\nHumans have always thought the atmosphere to be so vast, so imbued with counteractive forces, that pollutants could make only the most gradual changes. No longer. The ''ozone hole'' that was discovered over Antarctica in 1985 seems to have been caused by minuscule amounts of man-made chlorine that reached the high atmosphere.\nOzone, though hazardous to plants and animals at ground level, serves as a life-protecting shield, screening out the sun's ultraviolet light that would otherwise cause an epidemic of skin cancer. Aside from the ozone hole, which mercifully is so far limited to Antarctica, chlorine seems to have caused a 3 percent thinning of the worldwide ozone shield in the last 20 years.\nA corresponding surge in the ultra-violet light reaching earth has not yet been detected. But that's no reason for delay against so profound a threat to all forms of life. Last year, at the urging of the United States, several governments signed the Montreal Protocol, an agreement to freeze and then halve their production of CFC's, the industrial chemicals that carry chlorine up to the ozone layer. That's only a first step.\nCFC's take some 15 years to waft up to the ozone layer: destruction of ozone would continue that long even if all CFC's were banned tomorrow. A complete, worldwide ban on CFC's and the related halons cannot come too quickly. The next President has some hard diplomacy ahead.\nThe Montreal Protocol may be a model for addressing another worldwide threat, the greenhouse effect. A group of waste gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, CFC's and methane, trap heat from the earth's surface that would otherwise escape to space. Carbon dioxide, released by burning coal, oil and wood, has been steadily collecting over the last century. Theory suggests the world's atmosphere should already have started to warm.\nFour of the last eight summers have been the warmest in a century. The drought in the United States and the floods in Bangladesh are exactly the effects expected in a greenhouse-warmed climate. These are ominous warnings, but fall far short of proof that the global warming has begun. Yet if prevention is delayed until proof is irrefutable, a profound set of irreversible changes in the earth's climate will already have been set in motion. Rain patterns and crop ranges will shift toward the equator. The Gulf Stream may shift course, ceasing to warm Europe. If the West Antarctic ice cap melts, sea level could rise 20 feet, forcing the evacuation of New Orleans, New York, London and Beijing.\nWhat remedies are sensible to contemplate? There's little justification yet for the enormously costly step of abandoning the use of coal. But several insurance measures against greenhouse warming are worthwhile in their own right. Banning CFC's is one. Saving tropical forests is another, since trees absorb carbon dioxide. American cars, houses, and appliances could all use energy more efficiently, with fewer waste gases.\nNuclear power plants produce neither carbon dioxide nor the gases that form acid rain. Development of a new kind of nuclear reactor, inherently safe and affordable, is a practical priority -but one scandalously neglected by the Reagan Administration. Nature as Victim\nAmericans have no idea how much waste their life style engenders: a yearly 25 tons per person. Only 3 percent of that is household garbage; most comes from industry, agriculture, sewage plants and incinerators. Toxic waste is now sent to monitored dumps.\nBut much of the rest escapes, brutally testing the resilience of natural systems.\nNearest to crisis are the nation's coastal waters and estuaries. More than $300 billion has been spent on controlling water pollution since 1972. Yet with millions of people crowding the coastlines - by 2000, 75 percent of the United States population will live within 50 miles of shore - the deluge of waste is overwhelming.\nCoastal waters are being poisoned by pesticides flushed off farms and suburban yards. Nitrogen from treated sewage and fertilizer runoff stimulates algae blooms that suffocate fish. Chesapeake Bay, Long Island Sound and San Francisco Bay are all at grave risk. Urgent reform of farm practices is one remedy. Another is to upgrade sewage plants and combined storm-sewer lines like New York's, that overflow after heavy rainfall.\nEastern lakes and forests are threatened by acid rain. Injected into westerly winds by tall smokestacks in the Ohio valley, waste gases mingle with moisture and fall as mild acid in the Adirondacks, New England and Canada. Under the continual chemical assault, many lakes have died.\nForests are also beginning to show the first signs of widespread decline. In the Northeast, red spruce and maple are dwindling. Growth rates of yellow pines in the South have dropped by half over the last 30 years. The damage is even more serious in the industrial heartland of Europe. Air pollution is almost certainly to blame, with acid rain and ground-level ozone the leading suspects. The next President will have little time to prevent Appalachia's forests from going the way of Europe's. Tropical forests face a more immediate threat. Governments like Brazil's disastrously encourage settlers to clear forest land for agriculture. But the soil, despite the forests' luxuriance, is poor. It yields a few years' crops, then reverts to wasteland, and the settlers move on to burn still more forest. In Brazil's province of Rondonia, home to a fifth of the world's plant and animal species, 17 percent of the forest is already gone. The 170,000 fires counted last year in the western Amazon contributed a tenth of the world's production of carbon dioxide.\nThe richness of tropical forests is the fruit of 50 million years of uninterrupted evolution. That millions of species and their home should be destroyed so wantonly is a historic offense, even though no law recognizes it.\nPersuading countries with tropical forests to preserve them is an urgent duty for the next President.\nThere is little in either Presidential candidate's record that displays deep understanding of environmental issues, although Michael Dukakis passed legislation in Massachusetts to curb acid rain, and George Bush has now broken with the Administration in calling for an acid rain program.\nBut ready or not, the next President will have the issues forced upon him. Persuading Americans to endure immediate costs for a long-term benefit will take leadership. Negotiating with other countries jointly to avert unproven risks will require statesmanship.\nThe alternative is a steady, perhaps even catastrophic decline of the natural systems on which life depends."

The treaty of friendship, cooperation and peace between the two countries is signed at Bangabhaban by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for Bangladesh and Indira Gandhi for India. The treaty is similar to the one earlier signed between India and the Soviet Union.    The treaty affirms that each side shall respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the other and refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of the other side. Each high contracting party solemnly declares that it shall enter into or participate in any military alliance when the other is threatened or under attack.  In case one is attacked or threatened with attack, the two parties shall immediately enter into mutual consultation in order to take appropriate effective measures to eliminate the threat and thus ensure peace and security.  The treaty also provides for joint studies and joint action in the fields of flood control, river basin development, development of hydro-electric power and irrigation.  A joint declaration of the two prime ministers is also signed at the ceremony. The following are the highlights of the joint declaration: Bangladesh prime minister expresses admiration for the valiant armed forces of India for their supreme sacrifice. The two prime ministers decide to establish a joint rivers commission to carry out a comprehensive survey of the river systems shared by the two countries and formulate projects concerning both the countries in the fields of flood control. Both prime ministers approve the principles of the revival of the transit trade and the agreement on border trade and direct that these agreements, as well as the general trade and payment agreements, should be signed by the end of this month.    INDIA WON'T ACCEPT BIHARIS Indira Gandhi says at a press conference in Dhaka today that India will not absorb Pakistani nationals in her territory. An American correspondent asks her whether India will take back the non-Bengalis who came from India and settled in Bangladesh. In reply, Indira Gandhi says that the non-Bengalis living in Bangladesh went to Pakistan some 20 years ago and they are Pakistani nationals. It is up to the Biharis to decide whether they will go to Pakistan or stay in Bangladesh as loyal citizens, she adds.

Abdul Alim, while on the hospital bed, told Dhaka Tribune: \"Ariful Islam, Helal, Ashraf, who are accused in the rape case attacked me. Inspector Khairul sought my help to find witnesses of the rape case. The law enforcers were with me during the assault; my sorrow is, while I tried to help them no one came to my rescue when I was attacked.\" Police on Tuesday arrested Ashraf Hossain, 45, and Tofazzol Hossain, 42, in connection with the incident after a case was filed against 10 people by the victim's wife Ruma Khatun on Monday night. On Friday, the rape case investigation in-charge, Inspector Khairul Islam and a constable met Alim at the Gachhpara market. Just after the police officials left him, local men attacked him with blunt weapons that left him severely injured. Inspector Khairul Islam said: \"The assault took place after we left him and had already gone too far. As we saw people running from the distance, we informed the higher officials and requested backup. Locals took him to hospital after the incident.\" Pabna Acting Superintendent of Police (SP) Gautam Kumar Biswas said that a three-member probe committee was formed to investigate the incident. \"The probe committee will look if there was any negligence from police members. The committee headed by Additional SP Shamima Akhter has been guided to submit the report within seven days,\" added SP Gautam. On December 20, a woman was reportedly raped in Gopalpur village of the Pabna Sadar upazila. Two days after the woman's family filed a case against the prime accused Ariful Islam, younger brother of Maligachha Union Parishad Chairman Shariful Islam, and seven others."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-19 00:00:00      \nPakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan yesterday once again drew attention to the situation in occupied Kashmir, criticising Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for thinking he could \"get his agenda of annexation\" by using force to silence Kashmiris. In a post shared on Twitter, the premier said: \"Modi is riding a tiger -- he thought he could get his agenda of annexation by using 900,000 forces to silence Kashmiris. \"You don't need 900,000 troops to fight terrorism; you need them to terrorise 8m Kashmiri people.\" In a subsequent tweet, the prime minister said the Indian premier was now \"fearful\" because \"he knows the moment the siege is lifted, there will be a bloodbath -- which would be the only way to subdue the Kashmiri people\". Frustration, anger and fear have been growing in occupied Kashmir since August 5, when the Indian government stripped the region of its semi-autonomous status and imposed a curfew and a communications blackout. While some call and text services for mobile phone services were previously restored in the region, text messaging services were again blocked on Tuesday. The clampdown has now continued for over 70 days. According to Radio Pakistan, Friday is being observed as Kashmir Day across the country to express solidarity with Kashmiris. In this regard, sirens were rung at 3:00pm and people stood up to express solidarity with their Kashmiri brethren. A communications blackout in Kashmir region is fuelling a fake news war with Pakistan, as both sides unleash a deluge of disinformation to fill the vacuum and shape opinion. \"Both sides are stoking tensions, and both sides benefit from the information vacuum to fill the void with their own narratives and push them to domestic and international audiences,\" said Jan Rydzak, who has researched related topics at Stanford University. \"Pakistan cannot afford to let (the Indian) government's 'business-as-usual' narrative flood its citizens' social media feeds; India cannot afford to let reports of mass incarceration and chaos flood theirs.\" Disinformation has ranged from old photos from Gaza purportedly showing how India has turned Kashmir into a \"living hell\", to old images of happy children falsely claiming all is well in \"the new Kashmir\"."

This is not unique for Bangladesh,\" a spokesperson at the US Embassy in Dhaka said on Sunday, reports UNB. The spokesperson said this is a temporary measure and the US citizens will return to Bangladesh again once the situation improves globally.  The spokesperson also said the US Embassy in Dhaka will remain open.  The US Department of State and US Embassy in Dhaka have arranged a special chartered flight for US citizens who wish to return and their families.  The special flight will be departing from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday. The spokesperson said the aircraft will be full, but did not specify the exact number of returnees. The size of the commercial aircraft was also not disclosed.  The special flight will include a Dhaka to Doha, Qatar leg followed by a connecting flight to Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC, said the US Embassy in Dhaka. Passengers will remain on the aircraft in Doha.  All passengers must agree to reimburse the US government for the flight by signing a promissory note for approximately the amount of a full-fare economy flight, or comparable alternate transportation, to the designated destination that would have been charged immediately prior to this crisis, said the Embassy.  The note must be signed and presented before boarding. No cash or credit card payments will be accepted at the airport.    \"You will be responsible for any arrangements or costs (lodging, onward destination or local transportation, etc) beyond Washington, DC.  The US Embassy is unable to book any onward travel for you. The exact departure time and routing of this chartered flight are subject to change,\" said the Embassy.  Asked why US is shifting its citizens to the US despite the risky situation there, the Embassy spokesperson said it is true that the US has been hit very hard but everybody takes their own decision. In the US, over 120,000 cases of Covid-19 and more than 2,000 deaths due to the viral infection had been recorded as of Sunday evening. "

The flood control embankment construction project on the Padma river, flowing through Naria and Zajira upazilas of the district, has come to a halt with the recent outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic that has led to a nationwide lockdown. Over a lakh people living in the upazilas fear that if an erosion occurs again in the locality --which is highly likely as it happens every year-- it will be difficult for them to settle and earn their livelihood. The poverty-stricken locality had hardly any respite from the damage caused by the last erosion and yet there is now a threat of another. Over six thousand people --who lost their homestead and belongings in the last erosion-- settling in on others' land either through pity or rent are in a huge crisis. Roksana Begum, a resident of Naria upazila, lost everything to the river last year and now, when she and her husband both are jobless, the pandemic is making each day of their lives harder as the days go by. She said: \"We made a shed on a neighbour's land temporarily. We were hoping to get back to our normal life after the flood control embankment project was completed. But now erosion is coming towards us in one way and coronavirus has come in another. \"We have no money or anyone to help us. Either we will die of the disease or of poverty. It does not make much difference to us,\" Roksana added in sheer despair. Thousands of working class people, who lost everything in the regular erosion in the area like Roksana are facing the same difficulties. They are without work, income, food and scope for treatment.  Despite government-allocated ration goods, said another resident of the area seeking anonymity, people have been sleeping on hungry stomachs as they are not getting help or it would be correct to say that their goods are being looted by local representatives and political activists.  Mohadeb Das, a kitchen shopkeeper of Hindupara, said he used to own a large store. However, after the river devoured it, he was managing well with his single-shed kitchen shop by the riverside.  He said: \"I was waiting to see the embankment project completed. But now no one comes to my shop because of the disease and the river is closing in every day to consume my shop, my only means of livelihood again.\" Rashida Begum, who rented her neighbour's house after losing her home in the erosion, said: \"We were well off, with our daily jobs and income. It was not much but enough for a couple like us. \"But due to the coronavirus, we lost our jobs and did not have any help or rations from the authority. We do not know what will we do,\" said Rashida, who has been suffering from acute poverty due to the outbreak of the pandemic. Denying the allegations, Kazi Abu Taher, Deputy Commissioner of Shariatpur, told Dhaka Tribune that there was not a single house in his locality which had not been given proper help and not a single person was there who was hungry or had been deprived of rations. According to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), the flood control embankment project, stretching for 8.9 kilometres, was initiated in 2018 and was expected to be completed in 2021 at a cost of Tk1,097 crore. However, 33% of work remaining for the project has now come to a halt as workers have left for their homes with the outbreak of the pandemic. Stating that the project would be completed in due time, BWDB Executive Engineer Ahsan Habib said: \"The project is still ongoing in fractionally. Even if it gets halted overall, we will speed up the construction work later to complete it in due time.\""

      "text": "INDIA AIRLIFTS AID TO TAMIL REBELS\n1987-06-05T05:00:00.000Z\nDefying the Sri Lanka Government, India sent transport planes and jet fighters over the country's northern territory today and dropped 25 tons of food and medicine by parachute into areas held by embattled insurgents.\nThe airdrop, carried out by five Soviet-built cargo planes accompanied by five French-made Mirage 2000 fighters, swiftly accomplished what India had tried and failed to do Wednesday with 19 fishing boats that were stopped by the Sri Lanka Navy.\nSri Lanka, fighting the Tamil insurgency since 1983, angrily denounced the surprise airdrop as ''a naked violation of our independence'' and vowed to raise the issue at the United Nations. Military retaliation, however, was said to have been ruled out. An International Appeal\n''The only thing Sri Lanka can do against a giant military power,'' said Lalith Athulathmudali, the National Security Minister, ''is appeal to the international community, international organizations like the United Nations, the nonaligned movement and the good sense of the Indian Government.''\nNot since 1971, when India invaded what was then East Pakistan to help it become the nation of Bangladesh, has New Delhi so directly intervened in the internal affairs of a neighbor.\nIndia's action was seen as a reflection of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's anger over the blocking of the flotilla, which turned back after a tense five-hour confrontation Wednesday in the narrow Palk Strait separating India from Sri Lanka. Comments From India\nIn India the supply move was already being seen tonight as a bold step to assist Sri Lanka's Tamils, who have close cultural and ethnic ties with the 50 million Tamils living in south India. In addition, many Indians sympathize with the Tamils as fellow Hindus who say they are oppressed by Sri Lanka's Buddhist majority. The Tamils are fighting to create their own independent nation.\nSri Lankan newspapers today hailed the naval encounter as a kind of military victory, apparently not suspecting that Mr. Gandhi would feel it necessary to act to preserve what diplomats said was his credibility.\nAn Indian spokesman said the airdrop was also prompted by ''the continuing deteriorating of the conditions of the civilian population'' in northern Sri Lanka, which he said was of ''legitimate concern to India and a threat to peace and security in the region.'' Further Missions Possible\nIndia's stated objective was to provide ''humanitarian assistance'' to the northern Jaffna Peninsula, the scene of intense fighting last week as Colombo pressed a major offensive to secure a key stronghold held by Tamil rebels.\nAs the offensive progressed, Prime Minister Gandhi charged that hundreds of civilians were dying from intense shelling and air strikes, undercutting hopes of India's negotiating a political settlement.\nIndian officials refused to say tonight if the raid would be the last of its kind or a prelude to further ones. ''We will undertake relief missions again if it becomes necessary again,'' said an Indian diplomat.\nBut the officials said Mr. Gandhi's action should also be read in Sri Lanka as a warning against any further military offensives against Tamil separatists, risking civilian lives. Request for a Meeting\nSri Lanka, which has a population of 15 million, said last week that it had the right to recapture key territories taken by the guerrillas and that in any case, fewer than 50 civilians had died in the fighting.\nThere has been no independent verification of either country's claim.\nThe Associated Press reported that Sri Lanka's President, J. R. Jayewardene, sent a message this morning to Mr. Gandhi requesting a meeting to discuss how India's aid could be received by Sri Lanka.\nIndeed, officials here were warning tonight that India's latest action could be a prelude to ''liberate'' northern Sri Lanka as it did Bangladesh. Such talk also compelled the Indian High Commission to direct 100 of its staff members to move to hotels in Colombo, where they might be safer.\nIn its statement, Sri Lanka addressed the following comment to India: ''We shall hold you responsible for all the consequences.'' This was seen as a reference to earlier warnings that any untoward action could lead to a repetition of anti-Tamil rioting that swept Colombo in 1983. Ups and Downs in Relations\nRelations between Sri Lanka and India have had ups and downs in recent years. President Jayewardene has alternately denounced Mr. Gandhi as duplicitous and as the best hope of the region because of his role in mediating the Sri Lankan conflict.\nIn the last year, Tamil guerrilla spokesmen have several times rejected Sri Lankan autonomy offers that Mr. Gandhi termed acceptable. But after talks collapsed this spring, Sri Lanka moved to prepare for a ''final offensive'' to retake the Jaffna Peninsula, home of 800,000 Tamils. U.N. MEETING CONSIDERED\nUNITED NATIONS, N.Y., June 4 (Special to The New York Times) -Sri Lankan diplomats, threatening to call an emergency meeting of the Security Council to protest India's surprise airdrop, said today that they were awaiting instructions from Colombo. In a statement issued this morning the Secretary General appealed to both nations to act with ''restraint'' and find a ''negotiated settlement to Sri Lanka's internal problems.''"

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-23 00:00:00      \nYou get this problem when stomach acid moves into a tube called the oesophagus, which carries food from your mouth to the stomach. When that happens, you could have a burning pain in your chest. Your throat might burn, and you could have a sour taste in your mouth or a cough. You may also hear it called GERD (gastro-oesophageal reflux disease), which is heartburn that happens often. But other conditions can have similar symptoms. Angina: It is easy to confuse heartburn with angina, which happens when not enough blood flows to your heart. But heartburn tends to happen after meals or when you are lying down. Angina is more common after you have been active. The feeling in your chest is more like \"tightness\" or \"squeezing\" than the burning pain of heartburn. Angina symptoms mean you are at risk for a heart attack. Heart attack: While heartburn pain stays in your chest or throat, during a heart attack, a squeezing or aching pressure may spread to your arms, back, or jaw. Other heart attack symptoms include shortness of breath, a cold sweat, and feeling dizzy without warning. Women are more likely to also have an upset stomach or throw up. Gallstones: Gallstones are pebble-like bits of cholesterol or digestive fluids (bile) that end up in your gallbladder. If you have gallstones, after a fatty meal you may have heartburn symptoms that can last for hours. You will likely ache in the centre or right side of your belly and could feel pain behind your shoulders or rib cage. If this happens to you, see a doctor. Stomach ulcer: Sometimes a portion of the lining of your stomach or small intestine breaks down. An open sore, called an ulcer, forms. It can cause burning stomach pain and heartburn that is worse after you eat fatty foods. You will also have lots of belching and bloating. Your pain may be worse at night and between meals. If you have an ulcer, your doctor can prescribe medication to ease your pain and help your ulcer heal. Hiatal hernia: If the diaphragm, the muscle separating your stomach and oesophagus, thins or weakens, part of your stomach may push upward. This allows the acid of your stomach to spill into the oesophagus.  Acid and even food may come back up into your oesophagus and throat. Hiatal hernias can raise your chances of heartburn. Anxiety: Your brain and gut are closely linked. If you feel stressed or anxious, your heart rate can go up and your breathing can get faster. The flood of hormones that causes this reaction can also upset your stomach. Besides heartburn, you can feel queasy, have diarrhoea, or get constipated. Learning to manage your stress through counselling, meditation, or hypnosis may help. Oesophageal cancer: Long-term heartburn raises your odds of getting oesophageal cancer. If your heartburn keeps up despite treatment, your doctor will want to take a look inside your oesophagus. He usually does this with a procedure called an endoscopy. Other symptoms of oesophageal cancer include trouble swallowing and weight loss. Coughing and hoarseness are common, as is chest pain or pressure. If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away. Source: WebMD  "

Bevan said more than 400 homes in England had been flooded while at least 1,000 agency staff were working around the clock alongside emergency officials \"to protect and support those communities which have been hit.\" Major incidents declared More than 600 warnings and alerts - a record number - were issued on Sunday, extending from the River Tweed on the border of England and Scotland, to Cornwall in southwest England. After a day of torrential rain, major flooding incidents were later declared in south Wales and parts of western England. Some five \"severe\" warnings - denoting lives could be endangered by the flooding - remained active Monday on two rivers in Worcestershire and Herefordshire in west central England. Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue service on Sunday airlifted to hospital one man pulled from the River Teme, who was in a stable condition on Monday. But emergency responders suspended the search overnight for a missing woman also swept away by the floodwater near the town of flood-prone town of Tenbury, according to police. \"The search has continued this morning, including the use of the police helicopter,\" said Chief Superintendent Tom Harding, from West Mercia Police. \"Sadly, however, due to the circumstances of the length of time in the water and other conditions we believe that this will now be a recovery rather than rescue operation.\" Two rivers in south Wales burst their banks, prompting rescue workers to launch operations in several places to evacuate people and their pets trapped in their homes. Police said a man in his 60s died after entering the River Tawe, north of the Welsh city of Swansea but later clarified that the death was not \"linked to the adverse weather.\" On Saturday, the coastguard said the bodies of two men were pulled from rough seas off the south coast of England as the storm barrelled in. One is thought to have been the subject of a search triggered when a tanker reported that one of its crew was unaccounted for. 'More extreme' In northern England, the defence ministry deployed troops in West Yorkshire, which suffered badly from flooding caused by last weekend's Storm Ciara. There are fears rivers there could burst their banks later on Monday. Newly appointed environment secretary George Eustice said the government had done \"everything that we can do with a significant sum of money\" to combat increased flooding. \"We'll never be able to protect every single household just because of the nature of climate change and the fact that these weather events are becoming more extreme.\" France was also affected by the storm, especially northwestern Brittany where the Finistere and Morbihan regions were temporarily placed on orange alert for rain and flooding, according to the national weather service Meteo-France. Electricity provider Enedis said it had deployed 450 staff to restore power to 30,000 homes in Brittany. Power cuts also hit parts of northern and central France. The storm interrupted two high-speed TGV train services, one stopped by a fallen tree and the other by a power failure, the national rail company SNCF said."

Senior Information Officer of the ministry Abdul Latif Bakshi confirmed The Daily Star today that S Alam group is importing huge quantities of onions and the first batch will arrive through cargo planes on Tuesday.   Price of onion has continued to rise since September after India restricted its onion export after yield of the bulb-type vegetable was heavily damaged due to flood in a number of states of the neighbouring country. Each kilogramme of onion was sold for Tk 240-260 in the capital yesterday and the prices kept rising by the hour. Earlier this month, each kg of locally grown onion was sold for Tk 100-120 in the kitchen markets in the capital. But the price jumped to Tk 160 on Tuesday morning and then kept rising. The prices rose by Tk 30 to 40 every day since Wednesday. To boost supplies, the government and private companies are using cargo planes to import the essential spice within the shortest possible time. According to the National Board of Revenue (NBR), 50,191 tonnes of onion worth Tk 241.92 crore were imported from Myanmar, Egypt, China, Thailand, India, United Arab Emirate (UAE), Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Turkish and Australia in the last 45 days. A total of 926 consignments were imported by 186 importers though the seven land and sea ports. During the same period, another 15.73 tonnes of onion worth US$ 25,100 (Tk 21 lakh approximately) were imported by cargo planes mainly from Thailand, Egypt and UAE in 81 consignments, NBR data revealed. S Alam Group will import about 55 tonnes of onion out of 69 tonnes to be brought to the country by a total of 19 traders, as per data from the Plant Quarantine Center of Chattogram Seaport.  "

Weinstein, 68, is already in prison in New York state after being sentenced to 23 years in jail for rape and sexual assault. The new charge of \"sexual battery by restraint\" will form part of a separate trial he faces in Los Angeles over allegations he assaulted multiple women in local hotels, with extradition proceedings under way. \"We are continuing to build and strengthen our case,\" said Los Angeles prosecutor Jackie Lacey. \"If we find new evidence of a previously unreported crime, as we did here, we will investigate and determine whether additional criminal charges should be filed,\" she added. The new charge alleges Weinstein sexually assaulted an unnamed woman in Beverly Hills in May 2010 -- just within the 10-year statute of limitations.  He has already been charged with the rape and sexual assault of two other women on consecutive nights in 2013.  Two additional Los Angeles cases against Weinstein are no longer being pursued as those accusers did not want to testify. It is not known when the trial will begin, but Los Angeles prosecutors confirmed Friday they have initiated a request for Weinstein's transfer. \"Upon his arrival, he will be arraigned on the amended complaint. Once a court date is set, the public will be notified,\" a statement read. If convicted in all the California cases, Weinstein could face an additional 29-year prison sentence. For decades a towering figure in Hollywood whom Meryl Streep famously called \"God,\" the \"Pulp Fiction\" producer was expelled from the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences that awarded his films several Oscars after a flood of accusations broke. Tinseltown A-listers Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek were among nearly 90 women to have come forward alleging decades of vile predatory behaviour by Weinstein. Weinstein has repeatedly denied wrongdoing."

      "text": "BURMA: At a Glance\n1988-07-24T05:00:00.000Z\nEconomy\nDespite fertile farm land, rich teak forests and large deposits of petroleum and precious gems, Burma is among the world's poorest nations. It was once the world's leading rice exporter, but it experienced spot food shortages in 1987. Its economic decline is generally attributed to poor Government management and to a crippling war against several ethnic minorities seeking autonomy. Per capita income is less than $200 a year; firmer estimates are made more difficult by the existence of a vast black market, which is generally considered to be larger than the official economy. Japan and West Germany are major aid donors, and the United States has a modest assistance program, mainly directed at combatting the opium trade. People\nTwo-thirds of the 38 million people are ethnic Burmans. Important minorities include Chinese, Indians, Karens, Shans, Chins and Kachins. Burmese Communists form the largest rebel force; Karens lead the second-largest guerrilla group. The guerrillas have been active since independence in 1948, but riots involving Burmese under the Government's control are a recent phenomenon. About 85 percent of the people are Buddhists. The literacy rate is estimated at 66 percent. Government\nAfter independence from Britain in 1948, Burma had a parliamentary democracy. In 1958, the army chief, Gen. Ne Win, was asked to form a caretaker Government to resolve a political crisis. Elected government was restored in 1960. General Ne Win staged a coup in 1962 and has ruled since then, imposing an isolationist and socialist one-party state. A poorly equipped army of about 160,000 is responsible for internal order and for resisting rebel attacks. Land\nWith 262,000 square miles, Burma is nearly the size of Texas. It shares frontiers with Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand. Much of the country is mountainous and heavily forested. Most of the agricultural and population centers are clustered along the Irrawaddy River valley and its broad delta. Rangoon, with a population of 3.5 million, is the capital and the largest city. Mandalay, in the heart of the country, is the second-largest city and the center of traditional culture. (Sources: Associated Press, World Almanac, Europa Year Book)"

      "text": "DEBT, THE GRIM REAPER\n1987-04-12T05:00:00.000Z\nBEYOND OUR MEANS How America's Long Years of Debt, Deficits and Reckless Borrowing Now Threaten to Overwhelm Us. By Alfred L. Malabre Jr. 174 pp. New York: Random House. $17.95.\nTHE stock market and Alfred Malabre do not see the future the same way. For the past five years, the stock market has stood on its tail and moved like a rocket, though recently it has had some second thoughts. If the stock market had met Alfred Malabre, it never would have done that. Mr. Malabre has written a sober account of our fiscal and monetary sins that is scarier than anything by Stephen King. It may be the scariest tract since Jonathan Edwards. I couldn't put it down, and it's not that sexy; in fact it's full of numbers. What makes this book a real page-turner is sheer fear. I am sending it to some literate Congressmen I know, even though Mr. Malabre says it's too late to do much. They should issue this book to Congress before they issue parking stickers.\nAlfred Malabre is not one of the doomsday kooks we used to read in the 1970's - how to profit from the coming Armageddon, how to stock up for disaster. He is the economics editor of The Wall Street Journal, he writes well and he knows all the people he should know. What is coming, he says, is a hurricane, an economic hurricane, the first since 1929. ''No matter when it does strike, we are surely better off forewarned, with our bathtubs full, fresh batteries in our flashlights, and our portable radios nearby. . . . The main message here is that the hurricane can't be stopped, that we can only try to make things less nasty when it hits, and the first step in that modest effort is to understand the nature of the trouble.''\nThe nature of the trouble is not all that unfamiliar - it is debt, all kinds of debt, personal, corporate and governmental. The whole society has been on a binge, and because we have good credit, we have been able to run up bills like a drunken laird. And now the collateral for that debt, the tax base, may be shrinking.\nWe have heard ''budget deficit'' and ''trade deficit'' for so long that our eyes glaze over; the astonishing thing is that we haven't been called to account yet. As a country, we are now a net debtor, like Brazil and Argentina, and we will have to give up more and more of our income to pay interest.\nBack in the 1960's, we used to save over 8 percent of our income. Then inflation taught us that was stupid, and now we save less than 4 percent, and we borrow more. Our corporations invest less in capital equipment than any major nation except Britain, and far less than Japan. Corporate debt is up, not for factories or new processes, but for paper transactions: mergers, acquisitions, leveraged buyouts. Meanwhile our factories get older and more inefficient, our roads get more potholes, and our civilian spending for research and development is less than that of Japan and West Germany.\nAnd we pay ourselves too much. Smokestack America has cut back, manufacturing workers have taken pay cuts. Not enough. You can buy the same work abroad, cheaper, even in skilled lines. An electrical engineer in Houston makes twice what his counterpart does in Dusseldorf, far more than engineers in Asia. Bosses are even worse. Their pay has been increased by much more than the middle- and lower-level employees. An upper-level American auto boss makes 36 times the pay of his own blue-collar employee - a Japanese boss only seven times.\nYet even with aging factories and potholes in the roads, we live better than the rest of the world. We have more housing space, we have more telephones per thousand and television sets per thousand - more than the Japanese, who make many of the television sets we own. Our emphasis is on the short term and the consumable. We neglect factories and education because those require long-term commitments, which in our current myopia we cannot take on.\nNot only is our economy out of kilter, but there are no easy ideas to set it right. Lord Keynes is dead and so is fiscal policy - it never worked well anyway. As for monetarism, the controlled growth of the money supply, it ''is as simplistic as fiscalism,'' Mr. Malabre says. ''As the fiscalist Walter Heller has put it, 'Milton Friedman's ideas are wonderful, but unfortunately they work only in heaven.' '' Even if the Federal Reserve knew which money measures to regulate, ''it's exceedingly unclear that the Fed is up to such a task.'' As for the supply side, it has been one of the intoxicating ideas of the 80's. Cut taxes and people work harder, investors invest more readily, the economy grows, and deficits vanish because tax receipts go up when revenues go up. So keep cutting taxes. Mr. Malabre writes, ''the supply-side idea is really hokum.''\nSo far, this piling up of debt has been painless. But what happens if borrowers cannot pay their debts? The business cycle, after all, has not been repealed. What about the banks that have lent the money? We have seen oil-patch banks in Houston turning their tender white bellies to the sky - what if there are one, two, a hundred Houstons? Could our Federal agencies handle a hundred Houstons? Mr. Malabre quotes one economist: ''A breakdown of the insurance machinery would be the financial equivalent of a nuclear catastrophe.'' ''In brief,'' he writes, ''the jig is about up. . . . painless extrication seems impossible.''\nBut what is it that happens when the jig is up, when the bill is presented?\nOne scenario is hyperinflation - like Argentina, or like Germany in the 1920's. Prices go up every week. The trouble is, lenders have gotten sensitized to inflation, so they stop lending at the first sign of rising rates, or they mark up the rates - and then you get recession. A 20 percent chance of hyperinflation. A 30 percent chance of deflation. Not the nice disinflation we've just had, of prices slowing. This would mean prices falling, like the 1930's. The money supply shrinks in spite of the Federal Reserve because banks are collapsing so fast.\nAnd a 50 percent chance of neither, but a very different era. The Government takes over, the economy is highly regimented. The Federal Reserve loses its independence. All the banks and savings and loans are nationalized. Wages and prices are set by Washington. Taxes go up. Big firms gobble up little firms. Corporate managers are under Washington's thumb. And (this is the shocker) the deficit is erased by confiscation. If you hold Treasury bonds, you don't get your money back. You have to buy more Treasury bonds; you can redeem only a fraction.\nThese scenarios come late in ''Beyond Our Means.'' I wish they were longer. I wish there was another chapter - it was just getting really good. I can figure out a strategy for hyperinflation, I can figure another one for deflation, and I guess I could go to work on state socialism, but I can't solve them all simultaneously. And the United States not redeem its Treasury bills? Then what happens to us as a world power? Who pays the Navy? What happens to trade? What happens to foreign policy? Is the unredeemable Treasury bill the sign of America's rapid decline?\nFifty percent chance of ferocious Socialism, 30 percent of a deflation, 20 percent of hyperinflation - and not 1 percent chance of escape? This really is sinners in the hands of an angry God, Jonathan Edwards's text. Reading this book, one would hardly know that in the last five years interest rates have come down by half, the stock market has tripled, and America, alone among major countries, has been creating new jobs. TEN years ago the Club of Rome - and a number of other economic prognosticators - predicted shortages of everything. Oil would go up to $200 a barrel and the planet would starve. But the prognosticators were extrapolating current trends. They did not foresee, for example, the biotechnology revolution that allowed even China and Bangladesh to produce food surpluses, and now the planet is so awash in grain there is no place to store it. That's the problem with extrapolating.\nIt is possible to read Mr. Malabre's history and come out with different scenarios - and some economists do. Everyone sees an uncomfortable time ahead at some point, but there are some who think we will at least muddle through. There is no doubt of our fiscal sins, and no doubt that it will take serious leadership to mitigate the retribution for these sins. If Mr. Malabre is even half right, Ronald Reagan will not be remembered as another Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Great Communicator. He will be seen like Hoover, a nice fellow who blew our patrimony and who presided over a great fall. And his successor will have a very unenviable job. THE WHITE HOUSE THUMB\nOur main matter of concern . . . isn't hyperinflation or deflation but the prospect of greatly increased governmental control over all aspects of economic activity. This is what the future seems to hold. . . . In the sort of business climate that could well emerge, the Federal Reserve Board could lose its present independence and be placed under the firm thumb of the White House. All banks, indeed all thrift institutions, could wind up being nationalized. Foreign trade and capital transactions most likely would be government managed. Wages and prices would largely be set by people in Washington. Tax rates would be far higher than now and enforcement far stricter. Corporate managers would be under rigid governmental supervision that would make today's regulations seem blissfully relaxed.\nAll in all a new era would be upon us, a far less carefree one, whose roots trace back to the earlier decades of overindulgence. It's not a cheerful prospect, but it's a likely one. . . .\nThe best investment, under such circumstances, will be in one's affiliations. Individuals employed by large, powerful organizations with governmental ties and clout will surely fare far better than the self-employed person who hopes to build enduring financial independence through hard work and ingenuity.\nThe dream of the Reagan years and earlier - that we can go on indefinitely living beyond our means - will at last be dead. . . . Uncle Sam will be everywhere. - From ''Beyond Our Means.''"

Prime suspect Hasina Begum, wife of victim Abu Taher, confessed to police that she along with her next-door neighbor Mainuddin first killed her four-year-old daughter Bibi Fatema, and then her husband on Saturday morning. Additional Commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP) Amena Begum disclosed the matter at a press briefing at Dampara Police Lines in the port city on Sunday.

Previously on Saturday, police recovered the throat-slit bodies of Abu Taher, 35, a day labourer, and his daughter Bibi Fatema from their house in Nimtoli area of the city. Police also recovered a bloodstained knife from the spot.  Hasina killed her daughter Fatema after the little girl discovered her mother's illicit affair with Mainuddin in the morning, Additional Commissioner Amena Begum said. \"When Fatema threatened her mother that she would reveal the matter to her father, Mainuddin held the girl tightly, and Hasina slit her throat. After sometime, Taher entered the house, and they strangled him first, and then slit his throat,\" Amena said.  Immediately after the murders, Mainuddin went into hiding, and was arrested from Noakhali early on Saturday.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-29 00:00:00      \nIn an exclusive interview with Dhaka Tribune's Humayun Kabir Bhuiyan,  Danish Ambassador to Bangladesh Winnie Estrup Petersen discussed a wide range of bilateral issues with particular emphasis on cooperation to help enable green growth How do you describe the current bilateral relations between Bangladesh and Denmark? How could it be further enhanced? In one word, I would describe it as excellent. Our partnership has been growing over the years. Yes, I am proud that we have a good partnership. We cooperate with each other in a wide range of sectors, especially climate change and agriculture. The existing strategic cooperation between the labour ministries of the two countries is aimed at improving occupational, health and safety conditions for Bangladeshi workers through exchange of knowledge and experience. A number of Danish companies, businesses and NGOs are present in Bangladesh. Denmark also works closely with Bangladesh in several international forums. For instance, both countries are members of the Human Rights Council and look forward to opportunities to work together. Our relations are wide and deep and I am a proud Ambassador of Denmark in Bangladesh. With continued cooperation on the issues of mutual interest, the relationship will transform and only deepen as Denmark shifts its bilateral focus from aid to trade, which will result in increased emphasis on green growth and issue of sustainability in Bangladesh.  I reckon in every relation, there are areas for dialogues. As our bilateral ties are rooted in strong foundations any issues can be addressed through dialogue and consensus. What are the new areas of cooperation by which both countries can be benefited? I think we are looking to explore green growth in several sectors, especially the readymade garments industry. By green growth, I mean each company will manufacture its products organically, resulting in the use of less water and thus less pollution. To simply put it into words, Danish companies are coming to Bangladesh to offer green solutions for local manufacturers. Dhaka is a densely populated business hub of the country. Unprecedented fire hazards over the past several years have drawn quite a bit of attention. Hence, Danish firms are collaborating with Bangladeshi organizations to set up small fire fighting stations equipped with easy-to-use fire fighting devices. There is another option for efficient fire fighting we are considering --e.g., motorbikes equipped with fire fighting instruments, for quick responses to fire incidents. It is a flexible and good technology.  We are also looking forward to cooperating with Bangladesh with respect to wind energy.  Denmark has expertise in developing cities that are more liveable, green, energy efficient and adaptable to traffic regulations.  We are identifying Danish expertise, technologies and innovations that may benefit both countries. Are you satisfied with the current trade volume between Dhaka and Copenhagen? How can this be increased? I am pleased with the present-day trade volume between the two countries and yet more can be done. Trade between the two countries is clearly in favour of Bangladesh. We would like to see increased Danish trade with Bangladesh. Is Danish investment in Bangladesh satisfactory? What does Bangladesh need to do more to attract higher Danish investment? There are about 40 Danish companies engaged one way or another in Bangladesh, which is  rather an impressive figure from a small country like Denmark. Bangladesh is a good market with an impressive growth trend. The Bangladesh economy needs more foreign investment in strategic areas to continue its growth momentum in the coming years. There are opportunities to bring Danish investment and businesses to Bangladeshi market. However, Danish companies face steep challenges mostly related to predictability of policies and legislation. Danish companies work best in a rule-based business environment. Business climate has to be well-regulated. Danish companies are not accustomed to dealing with bureaucratic red tape and they have a zero tolerance to corruption. Do you think the international community is doing enough to solve the Rohingya crisis? What do you think the solution is to this protracted crisis? As long as the crisis is not resolved, we have not done enough. As things stalled in the United Nations Security Council, the international community, including Denmark, is exploring alternative routes, which include proceedings at the Human Rights Council, International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court.  Denmark, a big contributor in terms of providing humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya people in Cox's Bazar, is working with the Bangladesh government and other global partners to provide the necessary support in addressing current and emerging challenges centering on the crisis."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-23 00:00:00      \nMonirul islam says they are also yet to find any evidence to IS's claims of appointing a chief in Bangladesh The police counter-terrorism chief has said Bangladeshis returning to the country after having joined the terror group Islamic State (IS) in the Middle East, will face legal action. Additional Commissioner Monirul Islam, head of Dhaka Metropolitan Police's (DMP) Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit, was speaking at a Dhaka event yesterday. The event was organized by the Crime Reporters Association of Bangladesh (CRAB) and CTTC at the Cirdap auditorium. The CTTC chief was asked about several issues in light of the massive terrorist attack in Sri Lanka on Sunday, including if he had the exact number for Bangladeshis who had joined IS, and what would happen if they came back home. \"Young people began going out to join IS in late 2014,\" Monirul Islam said in response. \"We suspect that some were detained or arrested, some were killed and some of them were identified. But we do not have accurate statistics,\" he said. \"If they want to return home now, they have no alternative but to come via air. So they need passports. But people who left the country in 2014 no longer have valid passports. If anybody wants to return, they will have to apply for a travel pass,\" Monirul explained. \"When we receive an application for a travel pass, it is given a very serious scrutiny,\" he added. \"So, they cannot come in to the country without us knowing.Even if anyone wants to return, they will face legal action,\" the official said. Asked about the possibility of Rohingya refugees getting involved in militancy and extremism, the CTTC chief said that the refugees are a big problem for Bangladesh.  \"Rohingyas have lost their homes, lost family members; they may be involved in extremism in the future,\" he added. All intelligence agencies are keeping the refugees under strong surveillance, he said. Asked if there was any truth to IS's claims of appointing a chief in Bangladesh, the official said police had not found any evidence to support this. \"They may have appointed a Bangladeshi abroad,\" he added. The additional commissioner said that Afghanistan-returnees were the first to bring religious extremism and militancy into Bangladesh. \"Many of them have been arrested. Some have been hanged. Three or four are absconding but all of them have been identified,\" he said. Responding to a question about the spread of militancy in prison, Monirul said this is a global problem.  \"Many people become radicalized in prisons across the world. Bangladesh is at particular risk because incarcerations become lengthy due to slow trial,\" he said. He said two anti-terrorism tribunals have been established to speed up the trial of militants. CRAB President Abul Khayer, General Secretary Dipu Sarwar, DMP's Deputy Commissioner (Media) Masudur Rahman and senior officials of CTTC were present at the event. Public attention turned to the Bangladeshi Islamic State fighters from Syria and Iraq for the first time when they issued video messages hailing the Gulshan terrorist attack of 2016. At least 50 young men and a few women and children were reported missing after that."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-26 00:00:00      \nThe Supreme Court yesterday upheld its earlier verdict that had directed the authorities concerned to restore the wetland in Savar where Modhumoti Model Town, a housing project, has been developed. A seven-member SC bench, headed by Chief Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain, dismissed the five petitions seeking a review of its earlier verdict. The apex court verdict has brought to an end the legal battle that had dragged on for around 15 years. Now the project authorities have to remove all the earth from the area for keeping it as a free-flood flow zone, say legal experts. On July 11, 2013, the SC released the full text of its 159-page verdict directing the project owner, Metro Makers and Developer Limited, to restore within six months the wetland in Savar's Bilamalia and Bailarpur moujas. In September 2013, the private firm and buyers of plots in the project lodged five petitions with the SC, seeking a review of its judgment. Earlier, the SC in a verdict on August 7, 2012, upheld a High Court judgment that had declared illegal the Modhumoti Model Town near Aminbazar.  The apex court directed the authorities concerned to keep the area as a free-flood flow zone. Metro Makers and Developer Limited developed the housing project, filling up 550 acres of wetland identified as floodplain in the 1997 Dhaka City Master Plan. The HC on July 27, 2005, declared the project unauthorised, illegal and against public interest. It also said that the interest of the buyers must be protected. In August 2004, Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela) filed a writ petition with the HC as public interest litigation, challenging the legality of the project. It said the project was developed violating the Environment Conservation Act, Town Improvement Act and Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) rules. In its petition, Bela mentioned that if the project continued, the character of the area would be destroyed and the environment would be polluted. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bela, told this newspaper that following the SC order, the Metro Makers and Developer Limited must remove all the earth from the project area and restore the wetland within six months."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-22 00:00:00      \nAmid the coronavirus scare and threat of impending flash flood, farmers in the haor region of Sylhet Division are expecting a bumper Boro harvest this time. Many of the farmers, who have been busy harvesting Boro paddy over the last one week, said they were happy with the market prices for their produce. They, however, said a shortage of farm labourers made it difficult for them to harvest Boro, the main crop in the region. According to the Department of Agriculture Extension, Boro has been cultivated on 447,195 hectares of land in Sylhet Division with a production target of 23.71 lakh tonnes. Srinibash Debnath, additional director of the department in Sylhet, said, \"This year, the harvest seems very good. No disease hit the paddy. We are expecting a very good yield.\" Till yesterday, 31 percent of the produce was harvested in the haor areas against 21 percent in the whole division, he mentioned, adding that the progress was satisfactory. The official, however, voiced worry that flash flood may hit the region any time. According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board, flash flood may hit the haor region at the end of the week due to excessive rainfall in the north-eastern part of the country and in the Indian states of Assam and Meghalaya. Shyamal Sarkar, a farmer of Bagbari village of Dharmapasha upazila in Sunamganj, said, \"The weather is still favourable and the Khurma river is flowing below the danger mark. We hope to finish harvest before the flash flood hits the area.\" Upesh Sutradhar, a marginal farmer of Mahdi village in Chhatak upazila, said he had already harvested paddy on one acre of his three-acre land and was happy with the produce. \"I have already harvested around 30 maunds of paddy and sold those for Tk 650 a maund. I am happy with the harvest and the price,\" he said. Last year farmers sold Boro paddy for around Tk 400 a maund. This time, farmers are happy with the prices ranging from Tk 650 to Tk 750 per maund. Many of them said they were facing a shortage of farm labourers. But thankfully, idle labourers of different sectors joined them to harvest paddy. Tamij Uddin is one such labourer from Moulvibazar's Kulaura upazila. He along with his brother is now harvesting paddy in Hakaluki Haor area. Ekhlasur Rahman, a labourer of Chanpur village in Chhatak upazila, said, \"There is a bit of crisis of farm labourers, but the wages of labourers have not gone up that much\". However, Abdur Razzak, a farmer from Dugnoi village in Dharmapasha upazila, said, \"A farm labourer is now charging Tk 700 a day. The amount usually hovers around Tk 500. \"The virus scare and a lack of transport are deterring labourers of other districts from coming here,\" he mentioned. Another Farmer, Shyamal Sarkar, in the same upazila, said, \"There are different ways to pay a labourer. Some labourers take one of every seven sacks of paddy they harvest, while some charge Tk 1,800 to 2,000 per kiyar (37 decimals).\"  "

Who knows how many victims in floods of the Sudan and Bangladesh? Natural disasters of this kind have killed nearly three million people in the last 20 years and caused incalculable suffering and untold damage.\nThe news brings us a series of shocks: Hurricane Gilbert, toll as yet unknown; the earthquake in Nepal, maybe a thousand dead. Who knows how many victims in floods of the Sudan and Bangladesh? Natural disasters of this kind have killed nearly three million people in the last 20 years and caused incalculable suffering and untold damage. They've probably killed more people than the wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan or Iran and Iraq combined.\nAnd yet, many of these lives could have been saved through the use of the latest communications technology. Too often, it is either unavailable or just not applied.\nCommunication is essential not only for coordinating relief efforts and issuing warnings but also in preparing for calamities. Following a flood or earthquake, for example, relief agencies often operate in the dark, with no accurate idea of the terrain before the event, the nature and extent of the disaster, what help is needed and how to get it there. In countries with weak communications infrastructures, relief workers have no way of warning people of further problems, such as disease and pollution, and where they can get help.\nWith a little planning and common sense, much of the information gap could be closed. For instance, both the United States and the Soviet Union have deployed enormously costly satellite remote-imaging systems that could provide highly detailed maps of disaster areas before and after the catastrophe. These images would be far quicker and better than the pictures we are beginning to get from commercial imaging satellites, which are not usually available in time to be of much help.\nThe difficulty is that these intelligence systems are secret - so secret that even the discussion of how they might be useful is inhibited by the cloak of national security. Surely, the superpowers could figure out how to make data from their systems regularly available without compromising national security.\nThe media could make their contribution. Sometimes television companies deploy a communications ability far beyond what relief agencies can afford. In that case, prior agreement on the sharing of underused capacity ought to be routine.\nBut institutional and political problems get in the way. For instance, there is no international agreement expediting the free movement of emergency communications equipment across borders. A new international convention is needed to remove these administrative barriers.\nDespite tragic experience, there is still no recognized international clearinghouse of contacts, information and action in case of sudden disaster. There is no central data bank of available relief resources or maps of the world's terrain. Existing international agencies lack the assets and clout to coordinate effectively. And sometimes they don't really understand the new technology.\nRelief agencies need to know what the latest in communications can do for them, and satellite specialists need a real-world understanding of relief work on the ground. Much of the technology already exists and just needs to be adapted to additional tasks at reasonable cost. For example, there are sensors that can give early warning of impending disasters and small satellite earth stations that can be flown in during an emergency to re-establish national and international communication where local telephone systems have been destroyed.\nStill, little changes. Some of the barriers to action are political and some are just institutional drag. Some arise from a lack of understanding. Either way, the sad truth is that thousands of people will die in the next years, or even days, because we can't get organized to do all that we can to save them."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-13 00:00:00      \nDefying the government's request to stay home to stem the spread of  coronavirus, Sharif Hossain left his house in Sonargaon before the crack of dawn last Friday. In a shopping bag, he carried three Jamdani sarees made by him and his fellow weavers two weeks prior to the shutdown, enforced since March 26.  His destination was the wholesale market of Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) Jamdani palli at Rupganj in Narayanganj. Though Sharif knew that the market was closed, he wanted to try his luck. He was desperate to sell the sarees to earn something for the coming weeks and pay wages to his three weavers and three helpers.  For a Friday morning, the otherwise bustling marketplace was starkly deserted, with hardly any buyers. Only a couple of children were playing cricket, a group of four were chit-chatting under a shed and a person was selling masks and alcoholic hand rubs. \"Any other Fridays, I would bring three or four sarees and all would be sold in about only 10 to 15 minutes. But today, I have brought three sarees and sold only one in three and half hours, since I arrived here at 6:00am,\" Sharif said in a dismal tone.  The saree was sold only at half the normal price, he told this correspondent at the wholesale market around 9:30 am on April 3.   \"If the crisis centring coronavirus lingers and we cannot work, we will be forced to beg on the street,\" said Sharif.  His concern was echoed by at least 10 other weavers at the wholesale market. The coronavirus outbreak has bruised almost all businesses, but jamdani weavers are among the hardest hit. They claimed there are about 7,000 to 10,000 weavers in and around the BSCIC Jamdani industrial zone, which alone has 2,190 weavers and helpers working in about 274 plots. Each plot has an average of four handlooms. Normally every Friday, the wholesale market, commonly called the Jamdani haat, comes alive with a frenzy of activities as buyers from all over the country arrive at the place at dawn. The weavers said the weeks before Pohela Boishakh and Eid-ul-Fitr are the peak season for Jamdani sales, as demand for the exquisite clothing goes up on occasion of these festivals.  The marketplace, usually, sees sales of Tk 70 lakh to Tk 80 lakh on each haat day. However, sales of Jamdani sometimes exceed Tk one crore on the Fridays before Eid-ul-Fitr and Pohela Boishakh, according to BSCIC officials. Though the Bangla New Year \"Pahela Baishakh\" is only two weeks away, there were no signs of any buyers in the market. \"As the market is closed, buyers from outside the area are not here. Thus, weavers now have to sell their products at half price,\" said Anwar Hossain, member of ward no 7 of Tarabo municipality, where the Jamdani industrial area is located. The weavers, except for a few, were compelled to shut down all handlooms, said Muslem Uddin Musa, another Jamdani weaver of the area.  \"I am contacting the buyers. They tell me to wait till the normalcy returns. But this was our best time for business,\" he added. The nationally and internationally acclaimed Jamdani is a type of muslin, characterised by its geometric or floral designs. It was inscribed on Unesco's Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2013. The time-consuming and labour-intensive Jamdani weaving process often takes 15 days to a month, starting from tying and dyeing the threads, drawing the designs and finally weaving the saree in hand-operated looms with foot pedals. \"Even in February, we were toiling day and night with high hopes of good business during Pohela Boishakh in April and Eid-ul-Fitr in May, two of the largest festivals,\" said Jamdani weaver Azizul Islam. The third generation handloom owner said he can produce eight to 10 Jamdani sarees in a month using his eight handlooms. \"Man proposes, God disposes,\" Azizul muttered, adding that the 'monster coronavirus' is eating away their business. The 45-year-old weaver said they have never faced such a situation before. During the flood of 1988 and 1998, these craftsmen had to move their handlooms elsewhere but production was not badly hampered.  \"But this time, the crisis is unimaginable,\" he said. Weavers noted the urgency to sell sarees as soon as possible. Jamdani sarees cannot be stocked because they lose shine and quality in damp weather conditions, they explained.  They urged the authorities to stand by the weavers who are relentlessly working to keep the traditional art of Jamdani alive.  BSCIC Jamdani industrial zone accountant Abdul Awal said no one has contacted them for assistance so far.  He said they informed the head office that potential loss from March 26 to April 26  during the current coronavirus related shutdown will be around Tk 5.58 crore. \"The potential loss was calculated taking account of production and operation cost of Jamdani handlooms at the BSCIC Jamdani industrial zone,\" he said. \"Weavers are passing hard times due to coronavirus and heading towards a bleak future. But I think authorities would devise a plan for them as they are taking information of possible losses,\" he said.  \"If the coronavirus situation lingers, loss to the weavers will increase manifold,\" Awal predicts."

Explaining the salient features of the import policy, Commerce Minister MR Siddiqui says that there will be no import of luxury items for the period. Although the aim of the government is to arrange import through government agencies as far as practicable, it has been decided to allow import in the private sector since the government agencies are not fully equipped to handle all the import requirements and since there is also a need to rehabilitate the trading community engaged in import business. The government has also decided to induct newcomers in the import trade for a number of items. Preference will be given to those newcomers who suffered during the Liberation War including those whose shops and business establishment were damaged. The list of importable items contains essential consumer goods, industrial raw materials, spares and components.  TV CORPORATION ABOLISHED  The government of Bangladesh has decided to abolish Television Corporation. Television will become an attached department of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. FARAKKA WILL BE DISCUSSED BM Abbas, Chairman of WAPDA and adviser of Prime Minister Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on power and flood control, says that all aspects of the Farakka Barrage will be discussed at the high-level India-Bangladesh talks beginning in Dhaka on April 26, 1972 to safeguard the interest of Bangladesh. He adds that the interest of Bangladesh with regard to Farakka Barrage is to obtain from the Indian government a guarantee for a minimum quantum of water for use of Bangladesh. Referring to flood control, Abbas emphasises that joint action is essential to lower flood levels in Bangladesh and ensure increased dry weather flow in the rivers which may be possible through construction of storage dams in upper reaches of the major rivers lying in India. SSC EXAMS BEGIN The Secondary School Certificate examinations begin throughout Bangladesh today. The examinations were due to commence on April 22, 1971. The Pakistan occupation forces made an abortive attempt to hold the examinations in August 1971 in which a handful of candidates appeared. Results of the mocke of examinations were also published in October that year. However, the Bangladesh government declared the results of that farcical examination void in January 1972 and decided to hold the examinations afresh on the free soil of Bangladesh.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-22 00:00:00      \nThe ongoing infrastructure projects will definitely improve our transportation system. We need to assess this development from a historical perspective. At the time of Partition, the transport infrastructure in East Pakistan was very poor. There were only a few hundred kilometres of pucca roads. Due to our unique geographical setting, one has to cross rivers to travel from one place to another. At that time, as there were very few bridges people had to cross rivers through water transports such as ferry and boats. Basically, riverways and railways were the major modes of communication.  \n We notice some development after 1947. Some bridges were built but those contributed little to the overall improvement of our road network. In our case, a major barrier to the development of surface transportation network, e.g. road and railways, is the high construction cost. Since this is a flood-prone low-lying country, the roads and railways need to be built on embankments which incurs huge extra costs. Moreover, earthquakes need to be considered during designing of these surface structures. In hindsight, I strongly feel that we should have emphasised more on the development of waterways and railways. However, the current government has taken some initiatives to revive the water and rail transportation networks. To cut the long story short, the opening of Bangabandhu Bridge over Jamuna in 1998 was a milestone in the development of our transportation network. It enabled speedy movement of vehicles across the river. Although there was initial reservation from the co-financiers, particularly the World Bank, we added rail tracks to the bridge. Due to the late incorporation, there remain some weaknesses and concerns about the durability of the bridge with the rail line. Load and speed restrictions have been impasses. Recently, a decision has been taken on the construction of a separate railway bridge across Jamuna River. It will be a major improvement for the railway sector. Due to the overall weaknesses of our transportation infrastructure, we have not been able to achieve our development goals. Foreign investors also shy away from investing here. The good news is that the situation is improving. For example, the inauguration of two bridges--Second Meghna Bridge and the Second Gumti Bridge on the Dhaka-Chattogram route--has significantly reduced the travel time between Dhaka and Chattogram.  We are heavily dependent on our sea ports for both export and import. The capacity of the Chattogram port has increased lately, but it is still insufficient. The second sea port is the port of Mongla. We have already started the construction of the Payra Deep Sea Port, though there are some problems associated with the project. The channels of this port need to be dredged continuously. Once these projects are successfully completed our international communication will be hugely boosted.  Another important international connectivity network is the Asian Highway. Although our government has decided to get connected with this network, it has not been started yet. Earlier the government was a bit unsure about the route connecting Bangladesh to India. The route plan was revised later and it shifted towards Meghalaya through Shillong. The initial route map was designed mostly on flat terrain that was supposed to go through Karimganj in Assam, onwards to Monipur and then to Myanmar. There is another route plan for creating links between the south-east part of Bangladesh and Myanmar. Since the route is planned to pass through Rakhaine state (an area where Rohingya people live), Myanmar government is not interested to cooperate with the project. Therefore, currently it is feasible for us to establish road links in the north-eastern side for the Asian Highway. The biggest contribution to the Asian highway will be the inauguration of the Padma Bridge. It will directly open a road to Kolkata from the south-western part. Another road link can also be established between Bangladesh and Nepal on the north-western side. Now, coming to Padma Bridge. Earlier there were several complications associated with the project. One of the major problems was funding. Development partners like the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, JICA, Islami Development Bank had initially agreed to co-finance the construction of Padma Bridge. Later, they pulled out of the project citing corruption charges. In 2013, the government decided to construct the Padma Bridge with its own funds. It was undoubtedly a bold step as the government decided to execute a project worth USD 3.5 billion without the assistance of foreign development partners. The construction project began in 2014. Acquisition of land was a major challenge. Earlier, in the government funded projects people affected by the projects were involuntarily displaced and provided with a lump-sum amount of compensation based on prices reflected in the government records. But the policy for project affected people (PAP) used by the development partners stipulates that the PAPs should be rehabilitated in such a way that their living standards don't falter, rather it improves with the completion of the project. They also now get compensation comparatively easily. As for the Padma Bridge project, 70,000 people have been relocated and almost everyone appears to be happy. Though the project was supposed to end in four years, the contractors could not meet the deadline. It is also important to note that from engineering point of view, Padma Bridge is one of the most challenging projects in the world. We had to devise new construction techniques to cope with the unique geographical condition of the river. We have calculated the highest likely stream flow for the next 100 years to design the foundation and river training works of Padma Bridge. The bridge is being constructed in such a way that it would allow nearly 1,40,000 cubic metres of water to pass under the bridge every second. The water flow in Padma is considered to be one of the highest in the world. Therefore, we need to make sufficient openings. River training is another key challenge to implement this project. Approximately USD 1 billion is being invested in river training works on Janjira and Mawa banks to hold the river in its current position. The riverbed fluctuates a lot due to water flows. The riverbed may scour up to 62 metres or 200 ft. Therefore, we are building the foundation in such a way that it can sustain the load even if the riverbed scours down to 62 metres. We are also taking other disasters into consideration, such as earthquakes, cyclones, accidents like ship impact etc. So, it is crucial to make the foundation strong to carry the entire load of the bridge. We are using \"steel piles\" as foundation and driving those piles 124 metres deep into the riverbed. Most of these are non-vertical (flaring outwards from the pile cap at an angle of around 9.5%) so that the piles can resist lateral loads (from earthquake, wind, ship impact) better. The Padma Bridge was designed between 2010 and 2012. It was designed on the basis of soil test conducted during that period. However, it was difficult to mobilize equipment to collect samples from deep channels within the short time frame. Another round of soil test was carried out by the Contractor during the construction, and it was found that the soil under some piers was of different characteristics. Most of them are silt; some are sand and some are clay. We had to avoid resting the piles on clay as it would slip away under high pressure. It would put the whole structure at risk. Now our options were to either have the tip level above the clay layer or below the clay layer. Since it is nearly impossible to drive the piles below the clay layer, even using the strongest hammer available in the world, we have reduced the length of the piles and increased their numbers. Earlier the design was based on six piles under each of the 40 piers in the river, but now we are using seven piles under 22 piers. Even after following this method, we figured out that some piers are unable to withstand the load. Hence, we had to resort to another new technology using some chemicals for grouting. Due to such redesigns and adjustments, the completion of this project is being delayed. However, the good news is that we have resolved all the challenges. All the 262 piles have been driven to the desired depths. We expect the bridge to open for vehicle movement by December 2020. Undoubtedly, the construction of Padma Bridge will significantly improve the communication network of the south-western districts which are now heavily dependent on ferry services. The Padma Bridge Rail Link is another important initiative that will connect Dhaka and Jessore via the Padma Bridge. It will improve the railway connectivity of the south-western region of the country. Most of the funding is from loan from Chinese Government. Under the G2G process, there is no provision for competitive bidding. Therefore, it is difficult to find out the project costs if they are comparable to similar projects. One of my suggestions to the designers was to set up more rail stations in places in Bikrampur like Sirajdikhan, and Srinagar along the route up to Mawa, which are urbanizing rapidly. If the proposal is executed, many commuters would be able to travel to Dhaka every day from these places which will significantly reduce pressure on the capital city. However, this proposal has not been included in the project yet.  To address the severe traffic problem in Dhaka, the government, with the help of World Bank launched a study in 2003, known as Strategic Transport Plan (STP), for the period 2005-25. This plan includes Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). The capacity of a line of MRT is quite high as 60,000 passengers can travel per hour in MRT Trains. The STP was revised in 2010 to include a few more MRT Lines. It can be both underground and over-ground. Due to repeated revisions of the route for MRT-6, the project has been delayed in taking off. However, the construction of MRT-6 is now being implemented. It is expected to end by 2021-22. The major problem with the project is that its construction process is causing huge traffic congestion in the city. The contracts for construction of MRT-1 and MRT-5 have also been signed. These will basically be underground transportation projects. It is going to be the newest addition to our transport communication system. Bangladesh Bridge Authority is also contemplating about running two more lines. Ultimately, there will be at least eight or nine lines in Dhaka, which may take up a minimum of 12 years for implementation. Only then will there be some improvement in the traffic situation in Dhaka. STP has a recommendation concerning the implementation of the bus route franchise system. Under the bus route franchise system, bus services will be operated by different companies on particular routes with valid permits. Recently, we saw competition among bus drivers of different companies operating in the same route competing against each other to take the passengers from the spot. Due to their unethical practices, they block the road by making their buses stop on the road, leading to major accidents. In addition to solving the aforementioned problem, the government should implement the parking policy to create more space on roads. Through these management measures, the traffic situation of the city can be improved with less investment than that of projects like MRT. One of the policies in STP is to give priorities to pedestrians. Unfortunately, the footpaths, which are occupied by hawkers, shops and construction materials, cannot be used by pedestrians, who have to resort to use of the roadway, leading to further congestion.    The plan for Dhaka Elevated Expressway was adopted in 2010. It is the first public-private partnership project in our transport sector. Dhaka Elevated Expressway will connect Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport with Kutubkhali via several important places like Mohakhali, Tejgaon and Kamalapur. The government will share 27 percent of the costs of the project, while the private partner Ital-Thai will bear the remaining expenses. The land required for the project has been handed over to this private company, but it will take some more time to implement the project since there are some problems concerning land acquisition and resettlement payment to the private landowners. The circular navigation system around the city should also be introduced. Since there are several rivers around the city, this system will be of great help in minimising the traffic problem. It was launched earlier, but was not successful due to the deployment of improper type of vessels. If implemented, this system could bring changes in the overall traffic system. Finally, combined effort is the best solution to reduce the traffic problem of Dhaka city. For example, we see no coordination between organisations such as LGED, Rajuk, North City Corporation, South City Corporation, while constructing flyovers. Furthermore, Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority has limited authority to exercise their rules and regulations."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-22 00:00:00      \nWe must remain united in tackling the coronavirus The Covid-19 is wreaking havoc on the world. Bangladesh is yet to be hit hard, but if the rest of the world provides any indication, the threat of the coronavirus is serious, real, and exponential.  And an exponential crisis deserves an exponential response. The number of calls coming into the national information hotline 333 and Shastho Batayon 16263 has gone up tenfold in the last few days, crossing 100,00 per day. How do we handle such volume with a few call centre agents and a few doctors who used to handle these calls? Enter an uber-doctor model where the calls will be routed to hundreds of doctors who have registered their availability to take calls. This will not only calm a lot of panicked callers but also will reduce pressure on our healthcare system. This is the beginning of Bangladesh's exponential response to dealing with the coronavirus challenge. As calamitous as coronavirus is, it is forcing us to rethink how we live, work, and learn. Beyond the imminent healthcare challenge, as we face the possibility of small and large lockdowns -- both self-imposed and state-imposed -- for indefinite periods of time, like many megacities and advanced countries are going through now, citizens are asking important questions. How do my children continue their education during the outbreak? How does food get transported to cities? How do medicines get delivered across the country? How do we make payments for goods and services? How do we make goods? Bangladesh's quest for digitization is well-documented. It has been a cornerstone of the government's transformation drive since 2009, and remarkable achievements have been made. Sometimes, breaking the status quo, and bringing true change, requires a crisis. While this crisis may not be in any way welcome, it forces us to adopt an alternative, often at breakneck efficiency. Innovations during World War II occurred at an astonishing pace for the two opposing sides. With the added competition, the need to rebuild and retaliate brought out incredible innovations such as nuclear power, penicillin, jet engines, radar, and the first computer. All these have changed our lives for the better. The coronavirus threat is accelerating our adoption of a digital lifestyle. It is also greatly increasing the speed with which certain initiatives are getting done. The coronavirus has naturally increased the necessity to have trained medical professionals to test and combat it. As I write this, there are 2,000 doctors who are being certified to fight the coronavirus using the government's e-learning platform MuktoPaath. Under normal circumstances, this would have taken weeks of correspondence, the formation of committees to approve content, delivery of most of the content through old-style physical classrooms, and procurement of a fraction of the content in audiovisual format for e-learning. A process spanning 9-12 months. Optimistically! Compare that with the two days that it took in the time of coronavirus. All digital with no cost to the exchequer. Simultaneously, the government's information 333 hotline was made \"corona-ready\" in one day and is now being used as a mass initial triage tool for high-risk cases. Call the number, and you immediately get asked a series of questions about whether you are high risk or not. This has been possible for two reasons. One, we are using tools and technologies that already exist by just integrating and repurposing them. Two, all types of public agencies, private companies, civil society organizations, academia, startups, student groups have come together to fight together.  Bangladesh is probably unique in the way a crisis unites the entire society. It happened in 1971 and it happens during every flood and every Rana Plaza-like incident. Over 30 healthcare organizations have immediately responded to the government's call to action to find healthcare response. Tens of education companies are working with the government to scale up e-learning. Over 50 innovative logistics and e-commerce companies are coming up with how food, medicines, and other necessities will move across the country.  The telecom industry is doing its part by working very closely with the government to identify high-risk cases. Suddenly, Bangladesh, a country notorious for its lack of speed and initiative, is being forced to be effective and efficient, and each sector is working parallelly to fight the coronavirus. On March 20, the country saw its first digital press conference. In an unprecedented event, 100 participants including tens of journalists came together, not physically, but over video conference, with the session conducted by the ICT Minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak. Certainly a model in the time of social distancing. All of these initiatives are being made possible because of the great leaps Bangladesh has made in digitization, where the technological and human building blocks -- much like those of a child's lego set -- are coming together to create an avalanche effect.  I am confident that this avalanche effect will continue to grow, and Bangladesh will successfully navigate the threat of the coronavirus and come away as a better, more impactful nation.

The ambassador made the request when he made a courtesy call on the premier at Ganabhaban in Dhaka on Wednesday, said PM's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim, reports BSS. Recalling the long history and close relations between the two countries, Malikzad said his country is keen to promote trade and business relations with Bangladesh. Afghanistan was one of the first countries that recognized Bangladesh after its independence, he said, appreciating Bangladesh's economic progress and graduation from the LDC to the status of developing countries. Welcoming the newly appointed Afghan Ambassador in Dhaka, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stressed strengthening the trade relations between Dhaka and Kabul, saying that Bangladesh gives value to relations with its neighbours. Bangladesh imports a huge amount of dry foods from Afghanistan every year and Afghanistan can import high quality medicine from Bangladesh, she said. Congratulating Sheikh Hasina for her party's victory in the last general election, the Afghan envoy underscored the need for strengthening cooperation between the two countries, especially between its chambers of commerce. Sheikh Hasina said people voted for her party as they benefit when the Awami League comes to power. She said her government is running the country with commitment to meet the basic needs of people, as dreamt by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In this regard, the prime minister highlighted her government's social safety net program for the marginalized people, saying financial support is being provided for promotion of education of poor families and distressed people under the program. Sheikh Hasina also drew a line between the economic progress of Bangladesh and Pakistan after the independence.  \"After the independence, the exchange rate of Bangladeshi Taka and Pakistani Rupee was 1.56 and 1.00. Now the rate is 1.00 and 1.66,\" she said. The Afghan envoy informed the prime minister that the two countries are waiting to sign five memorandums of understanding (MoU). He also informed the prime minister that democracy in his country is progressing and expressed his willingness to import more pharmaceutical items from Bangladesh. Principal Secretary Md Nojibur Rahman and PMO Secretary Sajjadul Hasan were also present."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-18 00:00:00      \nBangladesh being the most downstream country in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins is faced with the double whammy of too much water flowing in transboundary rivers in the rainy season (causing deluge) and too little flow during the lean season (negatively impacting the economy, livelihood, and the ecosystems).  Currently, out of the 54 transboundary rivers, there exists only one treaty with upstream India to share the flow in the Ganges during the lean period. The lack of control over the flow of water in transboundary rivers puts Bangladesh in a very precarious situation. Being somewhat frustrated by the stalemate in negotiations over water flow in transboundary rivers, the policymakers in Bangladesh are considering the possibility to manage internal water resources to meet the demands, and not to look towards her upstream neighbours for availability of water. A decision to meet all water-related issues internally can set a very bad precedent for future negotiations on water-sharing agreements. Apparently, Bangladesh will manage its own water resources internally through dredging rivers and containing water in rivers to be used during lean season. As per international laws and the existing Ganges Treaty with India, Bangladesh, as a lower riparian nation, has a legitimate right on all transboundary rivers, as does India on all transboundary rivers with Pakistan, China, Bhutan, and Nepal. The very existence of Bangladesh depends on water and sediments carried by transboundary rivers. Only eight percent of water and sediments that flow through Bangladesh are generated within its own territory. Transboundary rivers are common wealth and resources that belong to all co-riparian nations and the ecosystems that those rivers support. It is expected that all civilised nations will settle their differences and agree on equitable and fair share of water and sediment resources in all transboundary rivers. Recently, Bangladesh adopted a long-term plan called the Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP 2100) to manage water and land resources in the country in the face of climate change. Under the BDP 2100, the entire territory of the country is divided into six \"hotspots\": coastal zones, Barind and drought-prone areas, haor and flash flood areas, Chittagong Hill Tracts, river systems and estuaries, and urban areas. The BDP 2100 is a water-centric plan. Freshwater availability was identified as the only cross-cutting and common challenge for each of the hotspots. It is hoped that once the BDP 2100 is implemented, all water-related problems will be solved one after another. But what the policymakers do not realise is the fact that the success of the BDP 2100 heavily depends on the availability of flow in all transboundary rivers. In the BDP 2100 documents, four future economic growth scenarios are projected based on the availability of water resources. As per the projection scenarios outlined in the BDP 2100, extreme water condition in the country will lead to stagnation in economic growth.   As per the BDP 2100, a total of 19 projects have been selected for immediate implementation, one of which is the construction of the Ganges Barrage and Ancillary Works that includes revival of the Gorai River flow. The success of the proposed Ganges Barrage will completely depend on the availability of water flow downstream of the Farakka Barrage. Although there exists the Ganges water-sharing treaty, a recent study carried out by scientists from Canada, Bangladesh (BUET), and the Netherlands reported that during the period of 1997-2016, Bangladesh did not receive its guaranteed share during critical dry periods with high water demand 65 percent of the time. The Abridged Version of the BDP 2100 document highlighted the importance of upstream development activities as follows: \"Being highly dependent upon developments at upstream, the diversion, use or storage of flows from the transboundary rivers is of major importance to Bangladesh.\" All six specific goals outlined in the BDP 2100 revolve around various aspects of water resource development. One such goal is to develop effective institutions and equitable governance for in-country and transboundary water resource management. The Ganges Treaty will expire in 2026. What will be the fate of Bangladesh if India does not allow any flow during the lean season, as is the case for the Teesta River? What about unilateral control of flow by China and/or India over the Brahmaputra or the Barak River? Would that too be okay for Bangladesh? So, how can the policymakers assume that Bangladesh will not depend on others for water flow in transboundary rivers? In a recent statement, Mamata Banerjee reiterated her position to not allow additional flow in the Teesta during the lean period. The policymakers in Bangladesh should continue to pursue the central government of India and convince them to resolve all transboundary river issues immediately for the sake of regional peace and friendship. Amidst the new political atmosphere in New Delhi, Dhaka needs to revive all negotiations on Teesta water-sharing. It is also high time for the Joint River Commission to work on the technical details for renewal of the Ganges Treaty. It is hoped that the new treaty on the Ganges water-sharing and all other future water-sharing treaties will have a guarantee clause similar to that of the 1977 agreement which ensured Bangladesh would receive a minimum of 80 percent of the scheduled flow during extremely low flow events at Farakka Barrage. In fact, it would be wise to sign a long-term treaty for all transboundary rivers involving all co-riparian nations in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins. The central government in India has been maintaining the position that they are ready to sign the Teesta water-sharing treaty but it is due to Mamata Banerjee's opposition that they are reluctant to do so. Now that Mamata Banerjee's grip on power does not stand on firm ground, the central government in India should press her to come on board and do the right thing.  In addition to negotiating for her fair share on all transboundary rivers, Bangladesh needs to better manage her water resources within the country. All rivers, canals, ponds, wetlands, and estuaries need to be properly demarcated and reclaimed from encroachers. The pollution in these water bodies has to be tackled. The High Court's recent ruling to recognise all rivers as legal entities can serve as a guiding principle in providing necessary protection to the rivers. PM Sheikh Hasina recently directed all district commissioners in the country to take necessary actions to remove all physical structures from rivers and canals that create an obstacle to the natural flow of water. The High Court's decision backed by the PM can usher a new dawn for stewardship of the rivers in the country. Bangladesh should also ratify the UN Convention on Non-Navigational Water Course (1997) and encourage other co-riparian nations to do the same. If all parties ratify the convention, then it can serve as a basis for fair and equitable negotiation for all rivers in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins.

      "text": "EUROPE SEEKS TO DAM A STREAM OF THIRD WORLD REFUGEES\n1987-05-10T05:00:00.000Z\nTHE doors of Western Europe are slamming shut on the poor, the persecuted and the merely adventurous from Africa, Asia and the Arab world.\nMore than a decade after calling a halt to importing cheap third world labor, to meet shortages and to do the dirty work of their industrial societies, the nations of Western Europe are starting to act in concert to stem the flow of asylum-seekers and ''economic refugees.''\nWest Germany, which last year absorbed 99,650 of 196,000 new refugees in Western Europe, has taken the lead. An agreement struck with East Germany to impose visa requirements for Sri Lankans arriving in East Berlin has stopped the flood of Tamil refugees into West Berlin; the measure has been extended to cover all nationalities.\nThe new Bonn legislation has meant heavy fines for airlines that transport passengers without visas into West Germany, where previously asylum-seekers needed only to demand refuge in order to stay. And an agreement among state interior ministers modified a hallowed policy of accepting any refugee from Communist Europe. Now Hungarians and Poles - who have been known to show up as ''refugees,'' work a bit, then go home - may be denied stays in the Federal Republic.\nIt is not fanciful to visualize the third world refugee influx as a stream pushing its way through open spaces between the rocks. Denmark and Sweden, for example, had reached understandings on restrictions with East Germany, accentuating the pressure on West Berlin. And when West Germany became less porous, the Netherlands noted a sharp jump in asylum-seekers from places like Bangladesh, Ghana and Turkey - 4,079 in February compared with a total of 5,865 in all of 1986.\nSo now the once-liberal Dutch have toughened their policies and are turning back refugees at airports. At West Germany's urging, European Community interior ministers have met and sketched measures that would avoid shunting refugees from one frontier to another.\nThe Europeans have not had happy experiences with amnesty measures like the one just being implemented in the United States. In 1975, the Dutch granted an amnesty for 15,000 illegal immigrants in the country, but the measure encouraged a surge in illegal immigration as newcomers expected it to be repeated.\nItaly has just been obliged to extend until the end of June an amnesty for an estimated 800,000 illegal immigrants. The number surfacing to be registered has been disappointing: In Rome only 17,100 of 150,000 illegals have come forward. Italians employing illegal immigrants save on social security payments and are not eager to pick up these costs.\nYet a hard line is toughening across Europe. In a referendum last month, the Swiss voted to oblige all asylum-seekers to register at 24 border-crossing points before entering the country; refugees will be told in 12 hours whether they will be admitted or not. The measure is aimed at stopping the smuggling of asylum-seekers.\nThe Swiss feel crowded because 900,000 of the Alpine republic's 6.5 million residents are foreign - though only 30,000 are refugees. Anti-refugee feeling is also palpable in Belgium, where a new broad-brush law enables the expulsion of anyone who might constitute ''a threat to public order or national security.'' In Norway, 600 refugees are being lodged in a ship docked at Oslo. Britain's gates are tightly shut. No Melting Pot\nThe ancient nations of Europe have never really come to grips with becoming, willy-nilly, multiracial societies. In contrast with the United States, there is no unifying myth of the melting pot, which, however imperfect in practice, enables Americans to recognize a national identity that transcends race and religion. The official rhetoric in Europe - such as Chancellor Helmut Kohl's dogged insistence that West Germany, with about 60 million people, is not an immigrant nation - lags well behind reality. There are 4.3 million foreigners in West Germany and of them 1.4 million are Turks. Most of them plan to stay. Yet by clamping down on refugees and asylum-seekers, Mr. Kohl and other European leaders hope to prevent an explosive issue from poisoning the political climate.\nIn France, which has 4 million immigrants in a population of 55 million, the far-right, anti-immigrant National Front won 9.7 percent of the vote in last year's parliamentary elections. Its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, warning that France's very existence is imperiled by a flood of foreigners, has become the first candidate to announce for next year's presidential elections. Mr. Le Pen has no chance of winning, but he hopes to extract concessions from the leading rightist candidate in the second round of the presidential contest. On Wednesday, he called for ''elegant'' expulsions of unemployed immigrants, without elaborating. Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's conservatives last autumn put forward a highly restrictive nationality law aimed at making it difficult for foreigners to become French citizens. The bill touched off an outcry, and it was attacked by a constitutional review panel and by President Francois Mitterrand. The Chirac Government has shelved it for the moment, drawing accusations of ''betrayal'' from the National Front. But last week Mr. Chirac was reported to be planning to revive the contested law in order to siphon off support from Mr. Le Pen."

In the much-anticipated elections of the Dhaka South City Corporation, Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh was unofficially declared the winner and voted mayor of DSCC today. Taposh secured 4,24,595 votes to beat his closest contender, BNP candidate Ishraque Hossain, by a margin of nearly two lakh votes. The AL mayoral candidate for the north city corporation Atiqul Islam is also expected to secure the post. WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE MAYOR IN THE SOUTH\n Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, a barrister by profession, was elected as lawmaker from Dhaka-10 constituency in the 2018 parliamentary elections. He resigned from his post to contest the mayoral polls. In his manifesto for this election, Taposh unveiled plans to turn Dhaka south into a tourist destination, including making the old central jail into an amusement park. \"If elected, I will construct museums and art galleries in collaboration with everyone and revive both Old Dhaka and the city,\" Taposh had said, appealing to cultural elites. Some roads will be dedicated for fast vehicles, some for medium-speed vehicles and some for pedestrians only, he had said. There will be roads for fire trucks and the city corporation will have its own team of firefighters, he pledged. He also promised enough women's hostels equipped with round-the-clock helplines and an app for service seekers. In a welcomed pledge, he said, \"We will not allow any service providing organisation to dig up a road until three years after it was repaired.\" He said the footpaths would be free from hawkers and illegal occupants. He also promised not to raise holding taxes and said proper management could generate revenues for the DSCC.  "

      "text": "INTERNATIONAL REPORT; Stock Exchanges Strong in Quarter\n1987-10-05T05:00:00.000Z\nThe world's stock markets continued to show strength in the sixth year of the bull market, although the pace of expansion slowed. In the quarter ending Sept. 30, stock prices worldwide rose by 5.7 percent, according to figures compiled by Morgan Stanley Capital International.\nThat compares with an 8 percent gain in the second quarter, and the first quarter's spectacular 22 percent surge. Those results are in dollar terms.\nMany analysts noted that third-quarter gains were trimmed in the last few weeks as several important markets retrenched. The American stock market, which had a summer-long rally right up to Aug. 25, when the Dow Jones industrial average hit a record high at 2,722.42, pulled back sharply, mainly because the dollar weakened and interest rates moved higher. The Dow has since recovered much of its lost ground. Other major exchanges abroad experienced similar September swoons. Mexico Has Biggest Gain\nThe Mexican stock market turned in the best quarterly performance of an established market, shooting ahead by 67.9 percent in dollar terms. When measured against the peso, the gain was a spectacular 94.7 percent.\nThe second-best showing was Australia's: equities moved 25.6 percent higher in American dollar terms and 27.7 percent higher in Australian dollar terms. Other markets that turned in 20 percent gains or better were Norway's, Spain's and Hong Kong's.\nThe poorest performance was in Italy, where stock prices slumped by 5.8 percent in dollar terms and 5.6 percent in lira terms.\nThe three biggest markets had middling performances: United States equities gained 5.8 percent, while, in dollar terms, Japan's gained 4.6 percent and Britain's, 4.5 percent. Vibrancy of 57 National Markets\nMore impressive, perhaps, than any gain is the general vibrancy of the world's 57 national stock markets, which are attracting international investors in increasing numbers as the global financial and communications networks consolidate. Perhaps $6 trillion in equities are now traded worldwide.\nThe vibrancy can be seen this week in Manhattan as the New York Stock Exchange plays host to the annual meeting of the International Federation of Stock Exchanges. Representatives of most of the world's stock exchanges will be in New York to meet with one another and with institutional investors. Some of the more aggressive of the exchanges are using the meeting, and all the attendant publicity and access, to drum up business.\nFor example, Dr. Robert Li, chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, is coming to New York with 400 brokers and representatives of 10 leading Hong Kong companies. The Big Board's extravaganza is but the last stop on Dr. Li's tour: he and his entourage have already dropped anchor in San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia. Effect of Large Equity Shifts\nIn any discussion of how individual stock markets performed in any quarter, one factor must be kept in mind: just as within a single stock market certain sectors (say, technology stocks) outperform other sectors because they find favor with institutional investors for a time, entire national stock markets often do well in a quarter.\nThat is because billions are rotated into them by huge international players. These international investors - large corporations, governments, pension funds, mutual funds and individuals - control huge pools of money that slosh from one continent to another, filling up one stock market at the temporary expense of another.\nAmerican investors who want to buy foreign issues can often find them traded on the Big Board, the American Stock Exchange or in the over-the-counter market as American depository receipts. And brokers such as Carl Marks & Company and Merrill Lynch can execute trades abroad. Investors who want to avoid the hassle of foreign transaction and settlement costs can even participate in tough-to-trade stock markets, such as Korea, through mutual funds that invest in a particular nation's stocks. UNITED STATES\nWhile overtaken in total market capitalization by the high-flying Japanese stock market, the American stock market still sets the world's standards. The United States is a bastion of political and economic stability, and the quality of its stocks, trading and executions tends to attract international investors, especially in times of world crisis. Even in calmer times, the relatively low price-earnings ratio of the average American stock - now about 20 - is a strong lure.\nAccording to Morgan Stanley, stock prices in the United States rose 5.8 percent in the third quarter, the 10th-best performance among the world's stock markets. That compares with the 6.9 percent rise in the second quarter. In the first quarter of the year, American stock prices rocketed ahead by 23 percent.\nThe key Dow Jones industrial average closed Friday at 2,640.99. The Dow, which closed at 1,895.95 on Dec. 31, 1986, is up 39.3 percent this year and down 81.43 points from its August high.\nOn Tuesday, Sept. 22, the Dow soared a record 75.23 points. Wide swings in the Dow have become commonplace; it often jumps or plunges 30, 40 or even 50 points a day. There are several reasons for these shifts. The Dow is made up of the big capitalization blue chips favored by institutional investors, including Japanese players who can throw billions into the market - and just as quickly pull billions out. And there is programmed trading.\nLeon C. Brand, an international analyst at Merrill Lynch Economics, believes the American market is now the place to go. ''The dollar is stabilizing,'' he said. ''As long as it holds, the Japanese will continue to buy.'' Mr. Brand said that the Dow may reach ''2,850 to 2,950, possibly even a little higher.'' JAPAN\n''I'd also go with Japan,'' said Mr. Brand.\nIn the third quarter, stocks traded on the Tokyo stock exchange gained 4.6 percent in dollar terms and 4.2 percent when pegged against the yen. In July, the Nikkei index pulled back to the 23,500 level, but recently, at 26,000 or so, it has been pushing near its historic highs.\nThe lofty price-earnings ratios in Japan (the average multiple is a Mount Fuji-like 70) discourages many foreign investors, but that has not hurt the market. ''People are still nervous abroad,'' Mr. Brand noted, ''but the Japanese are accustomed to it.''\nSome experts, such as Paul Aron of Daiwa Securities, argue that Japanese companies traditionally understate earnings, so the price-earnings ratios are misleading. Others, however, note that varying accounting measures can perhaps mitigate a ratio of 70 but cannot make it go away. BRITAIN\nThe British stock market rose 4.5 percent in dollar terms in the third quarter.\nWhen figured in pounds, the British market gained 3.8 percent.\n''The third quarter was probably a disappointment to the local British brokers,'' said Carl Adams, a Carl Marks analyst, ''but to foreign investors it was definitely positive.''\nMr. Adams does not expect a spectacular run-up in British equities like the one in August that pushed the Financial Times/Stock Exchange index to a record 2,443.4, ''but it will be higher than where it is now.'' He is recommending stocks in ''service and selected industrial groups.'' His stock choices for the next quarter include Metal Box, a packaging company; Next, a consumer retailer; Hawley, cleaning, security and food services, and Poly Peck, a transportation and shipping concern.\nPrice-earnings ratios in Britain are around 16.5, historically high by British standards. FRANCE\nStock prices on the Paris Bourse rose four-tenths of 1 percent in dollar terms.\nIn franc terms, the gain was 1 percent.\nWolodar Lysko, an analyst at Carl Marks, said that the French equity market has been turbulent, thanks mainly to relatively high interest rates. The turbulence, he said, may continue, ''especially as next April's elections approach.'' But, he added, ''the economy and the equity market continue to look good on a fundamental, long-term basis.'' He attributes this positive outlook to ''the equity market's increasing size, the privatizations and the series of technical and trading innovations.''\nAs far as individual stocks are concerned, Mr. Lysko said that the French Government's commitment to road and rail expansion - as well as the favorable outlook for the planned tunnel to Great Britain -bode well for construction, capital investment and auto companies.\nThe average price-earnings ratio of French stocks is about 19. WEST GERMANY\nFrankfurt's stock exchange gained 3.3 percent in dollar terms during the second quarter, or 4.3 percent in marks.\nStill, Mr. Brand of Merrill likes the German stock market. ''The underlying stock market is doing quite well; the chemicals are doing extremely well.''\nMr. Pokladok of Carl Marks said: ''Conditions are developing which might strengthen the market. There is a better tone of business activity. Inflation is under control. I could see the market rising 20 or 25 percent by the end of the year.''\nHe is recommending Henkel (detergents), Nixdorf (computers), Siemens (electronics), Conti Gummi (tires and rubber) and Deutsch Bank.\nMr. Pokladok said the average price-earnings ratio of German stocks is only about 12. And, he argued, the ratios of the stocks of German companies ''are probably much lower'' than that. CANADA\nIn United States dollar terms, the Canadian stock market rose 6.4 percent; in Canadian dollar terms the gain was 4.6 percent.\nJoseph DeSantis, a Carl Marks analyst, said that the Canadian stock market, like much else in Canada, is often held hostage to what goes on in its southern neighbor. Movements in American interest rates, especially, are mimicked in Canada.\nBut Canada offers foreign investors a great resource play, Mr. DeSantis noted. ''The stability of prices in metals, combined with corporate slimming down, could lead to higher profits,'' he said.\nHe recommends MacMillan-Bloedel and Domtar in forest products, Alcan in aluminum and Falconbridge in copper. Two ''special situation'' stocks he likes are Bombardier, a rail-car and transport company, and National Sea Products, a fishery.\nThe average Canadian stock has a price-earnings ratio of 19.7. HONG KONG\nThe Hong Kong stock market has been surging: in the past three months, equities have jumped 23.1 percent. (The colony's currency is pegged to the United States dollar.) The Heng Sang index is trading at record highs, near the 4,000 level.\nRobert J. Pelosky Jr. at Carl Marks said he expected ''more of the same'' in the fourth quarter, thanks to a continuing influx of foreign money into the colony. Much of the money is coming from Taiwan, he said.\nNoting that the typical Hong Kong stock carries a price-earnings ratio of 18, ''which in that part of the world is pretty cheap,'' Mr. Pelosky said he is a bit concerned that stock prices are being hyped somewhat by the local equivalent of Japan's ''zaitech,'' whereby Hong Kong's companies plow their profits into the stock market.\nStocks he thinks may do well are Hong Kong Land, Cheung Kong and Wharf Holding, all property companies, and Dairy Farm (consumer products), Hutchinson Whampoa (a trading company) and Windsor Industrial.\nDr. Li, the exchange's ebullient 58-year-old chairman, said that 272 securities are now traded, and the exchange ''is applying to the Government of Hong Kong to establish a second tier of the market, which would be the equivalent of the over-the-counter market.''\nAs for 1997, when China will regain political control over Hong Kong, Mr. Li said: ''The problem is already over. China has already signified that they approve of our activities.'' OTHER MARKETS\nSpain's stock market scored an impressive 29.6 percent gain, in dollar terms, in the third quarter. In local currency terms, the gain was 25.5 percent. The Spanish economy and stock market are being bolstered by the country's new ties to the European Community.\nThe Singapore-Malaysia stock market gained 9.1 percent in dollar terms and 7.5 percent when measured against the local currency. New settlement and commission rules are making the market more attractive to foreign investors.\nOther markets and their performance (local currency percentage in parentheses) include: Austria, up 19.5 percent (20.8); Sweden, up 14.2 percent (15.3); Switzerland, up 11.1 percent (12.4), and Belgium, up 4.7 percent (5.5).

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-17 00:00:00      \nThe birth anniversary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman is observed today in the country in simple fashion. The birthday of the father of the nation coincides with the arrival of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in Bangladesh. Indira Gandhi presents fruits and sweets to Bangabandhu on his birthday. The day begins with special prayers held at the city mosques, temples, pagodas and churches wishing Bangabandhu good health and a long, happy life. Awami League volunteer corps present a guard of honour to the prime minister at his residence in the early morning. The city newspapers, in their Friday supplements, carry special articles and features on the life and activities of Bangabandhu. Bangladesh Television telecasts an interview of Bangabandhu's parents on this special occasion. When Bangabandhu was in prison in Pakistan, his colleagues in Bangladesh government had declared this day a public holiday. But Bangabandhu in a statement says that he doesn't think March 17 should be a holiday in the future. He however adds that March 17 this year shall be observed as a public holiday as a token of love and admiration for the great prime minister of India, Sreemati Indira Gandhi. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi today flies into Dhaka to a hearty welcome carrying messages of goodwill and friendship of the people of India for the friendly people of Bangladesh. As her special twin-jet Rajhangshah rolls into the tarmac, loud applause welcomes the great friend of Bangladesh. Waiting to receive her were Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Begum Fazilatunnesa and their youngest son Russel, among others. Addressing the biggest ever public meeting in Dhaka at the Suhrawardy Uddyan a few hours after her arrival, Indira Gandhi says that people of Bangladesh and India will be one in sharing the burden of humanity's sufferings. They will together also continue the march in shaping their destinies and that both will live as good and friendly neighbours. \"Our friendship and unity are based on an unshakable foundation,\" she adds. Bangabandhu in his speech at the programme declares that Bangladesh, realised at a very high cost in terms of life and blood, believes in peaceful co-existence and malice to none. The entire Suhrawardy Uddyan shook to its depths with the full-throated affirmation from the mammoth gathering when Bangabandhu asks whether they support the Bangladesh-India friendship and are ready to take up arms to protect their freedom, which had been achieved through great sacrifice. Representatives from the Bangladesh and Indian governments hold substantive talks at four levels during which various subjects, including trade relations, flood control, travel facilities, war crimes trial and the international situation in the subcontinent are discussed.

Hundreds of thousands of Muslim devotees braved a cold spell to take part in the final prayers on the banks of the Turag in Gazipur's Tongi on Saturday, amid heightened security measures. On the second day of the first phase's Ijtema, the second largest congregation of the Muslim community after Hajj, Islamic scholars delivered sermons on different aspects of Islam in the light of the holy Quran and Hadith on Sunday. The Muslim devotees have thronged the Ijtema ground under the open sky while more than 1,500 foreign devotees from 35 countries, including from Jordan, Libya, Africa, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Palestine, the USA, Turkey, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, England, joined the Ijtema from the first day of the second phase. People from all corners of the country started streaming into Tongi since Saturday evening to join the Akheri Munajat. Many made the journey to the venue on foot as a large part of Dhaka Mymensingh Highway was closed to traffic. Md Anwar Hossain, commissioner of Gazipur Metropolitan Police, said the plying buses will remain closed on Dhaka-Mymensingh highway from Gazipur Chowrasta intersection to Mohakhali in the capital from 4am for smooth movement of the devotees. Buses from northern districts will remain halted at Konabari in Gazipur while all link roads towards Tongi will be closed during the Akheri Munajat, he added. Besides, around 8,500 members of law enforcement agencies have been deployed for ensuring security in and around the Ijtema ground. Four more Muslim devotees have died at the Bishaw Ijtema venue in Friday, January 17. The total death tolls of the devotees in the 55th Bishwa Ijtema stood at 5 so far, , including 13 in the first phase. They passed away in their respective tents between Friday morning and Saturday evening, said Md Manjur Rahman, deputy commissioner of Gazipur Metropolitan Police. Bangladesh Railway (BR) has scheduled special trains for easy transportation of devotees on the occasion of the first and second phase of 55th Biswa Ijtema. Earlier, the first phase of the Ijtema was held on January 10 to 12 at the same venue. Followers of Moulana Zubair joined the first phase of Ijtema while the second phase is alloted to the disciples of Moulana Mohammed Saad Kandhalvi, a Delhi-based member of the Tabligh Jamaat Supreme Council. Tablig Jamaat has been organizing the Biswa Ijtema on the bank of Turag river since 1967. Now, Ijtema is being held in two phases since 2011 to ease the accommodation problem."

The press release, issued on Wednesday, instructs members of all Chhatra League units, nationwide, to help farmers with their harvest. These directives came amid protests by farmers--in villages, towns, districts, and Dhaka--as the farmers are facing great losses due to the very low price of paddy. Some farmers set fire to their harvests as they could not afford day laborers to  cut the paddy  -as this year's paddy price is the lowest of the last three years. Over the past three weeks, a bountiful harvest has been overshadowed by the grief of rice farmers throughout Bangladesh. Farmers are demanding purchases be made directly from farms, and that crops be sold at a fair price. Currently, paddy is sold wholesale at Tk450 to Tk500 for every maund (1 maund=40kg). Many farmers have said the cost of harvesting each maund of paddy is between Tk1,000 to Tk1,500. Other reports say that farmers will suffer a loss of at least Tk300 per maund if they sell paddy at the current market price."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-19 00:00:00      \nStop discrimination and stand by farmers, demanded one placard. Buy rice directly from farmers, said another. Yet another screamed, \"Save farmers, save agriculture.\" Holding numerous such placards, farmers in different districts took to the streets yesterday, demanding higher prices for their produce. They formed human chains, held press conferences and blocked roads in Dhaka, Narayanganj, Sunamganj, and Gaibandha. They also burned their rice on the streets in frustration. A maund (37kgs) of rice is selling at Tk 500-600, which is much lower than the production cost. And farmers are incurring losses of around Tk 300 per maund, protesters claimed. Disappointed by the low prices, one farmer in Rangpur set fire to his standing paddy last week. Many other farmers are threatening to stop growing rice since they make hardly any profit from growing the staple. The prices of rice have dominated the mainstream as well as social media news since harvesting began last month.  In the capital, farmers held a press conference at Dhaka Reporters' Unity where they called on the government to ensure fair prices to save them. \"We can survive if the government fixes the price at Tk 800-1,000 per maund,\" said Sohrab Hossain, a farmer from Rangpur. \"We'll be forced to stop growing rice if we have to count losses,\" he said. Farmers also demanded that the government identify the real growers, offer them loan at 2 percent interest and reduce power bills for irrigation. In Gaibandha, farmers blocked the road at Dariyapur Bazar with paddy sacks for an hour, demanding fair prices. They want the government to set up procurement centres at each market. They also formed a human chain along the road, holding placards and banners with various demands written on them. Farmers would get a fair price if the government procured the rice directly from them, they said. Similar protests were held in Sunamganj, Sylhet, and Narayanganj. In many areas, farmers were getting Tk 400-450 for a maund of rice, less than half the production cost of around Tk 1,000. On the other hand, prices of agriculture inputs like fertiliser, seeds, diesel, and pesticide are rising every year, farmers said.  At the human chain in Sunamganj, protesters said the district's total Boro production this year was 13.12 lakh tonnes. Of the amount, the government will purchase just 6,508 tonnes, meaning farmers will have to sell them at a lower price and incur a heavy loss. Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque assured farmers and said the prime minister was worried about the falling rice prices. \"We're looking at various options to address the issue,\" he told a seminar in the capital yesterday. According to him, procuring paddy directly from farmers will not push up the price. \"It's very difficult to solve the problem immediately,\" he said. \"Export could be one solution. But this will create a problem in case of a natural calamities.\"  Meanwhile in Naogaon, a group of students, teachers, journalists, agriculture officials and members of different charitable organisations yesterday harvested paddy for Abdur Razzak, a marginal farmer, for free. Razzak, from Biharinagar, said he grew paddy on his 63 decimals of land borrowing money. But he could not harvest it because he does not have the money to pay the labourers. \"Labourers are charging very high,\" he said. Upazila Agriculture Officer Selim Reza learnt about this somehow and then discussed the matter with local charity and volunteer organisations. He then formed a team to harvest paddy of marginal farmers. \"Every morning, we will harvest paddy for one farmer in the upazila voluntarily,\" said Selim. Earlier, volunteer groups in Tangail did the same so that farmers could save the labour cost. [Our correspondents from Sylhet, Dinajpur, Gaibandha and Narayanganj contributed to the story.]"

      "text": "Misery Rises With Rivers In Bangladesh\n1988-09-06T05:00:00.000Z\nWad-ing through waist-deep water late last week in the Muhammadpur residential district of the capital, Iqbal Ahmed, his few belongings on his shoulder, headed for the school on the Mirpur Road, which was still unaffected by the devastating floods.\nA few hours later, Mr. Ahmed, 45 years old, waded back 300 yards from the school to his home at the refugee camp where he was forced by the flood, to pick up his ill 5-year-old daughter.\nAt first he could not find her. Then, Mr. Ahmed, groping in the flooded shack where he lives with his family, discovered her lying dead in a pool of water into which she apparently fell in her sleep. There was some solace: at least Mr. Ahmed was able to bury his daughter, while bodies of many flood victims in Bangladesh are being put on makeshift rafts - there not being enough dry space for burial.\nEmaciated, unfed and without sleep for 24 hours, Mr. Ahmed mumbled: ''What will I do now? I'll go mad.''\nSuch poignant uncertainty seems to have gripped much of this country as flood waters cover the land, leaving at least 550 people dead and 25 million homeless. And the toll could go much higher, officials fear. One-third of Bangladesh is reported to still be under water.\n''The situation is beyond any description, any definition,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman told reporters today.\nFlooding during the monsoon season is an annual event in this nation and is highly beneficial to agriculture. But the 1987 floods, which killed 1,600 people, were described as the worst in 70 years, and President H. M. Ershad has called this year's devastation ''far worse than last year's.''\nThe Brahmaputra and the Ganges, two of the major rivers in Bangladesh, a nation whose geography is delineated by rivers and deltas, had fallen since Sunday night, but the situation remained grave. Heavy rain fell again this afternoon, and the Dhaka weather bureau predicted that rain ''may continue intermittently, further swelling rivers already flowing above their danger levels.'' Prices Soar\nIn the capital, prices of such necessities as rice, cooking oil, salt and kerosene shot up anywhere from 30 percent to 200 percent. Kerosene to light lamps was in the shortest supply, with electricity cut off in most areas.\nMr. Rahman, the Information Minister, said today that 21 million homes had been washed away and that more than 30 million of the country's 110 million people were directly affected. He added that the actual losses will be known only after the water recedes.\nMr. Rahman said three more districts have been flooded, raising the number affected to 50 out of 64 districts in the country.\nCommunications in most areas affected remained disrupted or nonexistent, making it all but impossible to obtain food, medicine and other relief goods. Lack of pure drinking water is reported to have caused an outbreak of diarrhea and other stomach ailments. A senior Health Ministry official, Taslim Ahmed, said the number of people suffering from dysentery is also rising. The Matter of Starvation\nAlthough the Government denied that anyone had yet died of starvation, witnesses said a man died today at a relief center in the Kishalaya school, in the Zigatala district of the capital.\nOfficials said the United States, Britain, Japan, Australia, Canada, India, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia have responded to the Government's appeal for help.\nThe devastation has forced the authorities to abandon their efforts to rescue an estimated two million people marooned in remote areas. They are inaccessible because of the lack of small boats.\nRoad and rail communication in the flooded areas collapsed 10 days ago.\nIn some districts like Faridpur, Madaripur and Sariatpur in the south, helicopters carrying relief supplies cannot land for lack of dry space.\nRelief Ministry officials acknowledged that their efforts are being severely hampered. ''We have food in our stock,'' President Ershad said, ''but the question is how to deliver it.'' It has similarly become all but impossible for the authorities to accurately assess the extent of damage and the loss of life.\nAerial photos showed village after village leveled by flood waters. Panic in Capital\nIn Dhaka itself, where flooding is unusual, a panic seemed to have spread among the estimated two million out of five million city dwellers affected.\nMen, women and children by the thousands - with a few essentials on their heads and babies tightly held to mothers' breasts - are wading through water in search of shelter. Older people unable to walk are being piggybacked.\nThey are mostly the poor; others who are better off, were seen escaping by boats and rafts that now ply most of the streets of Dhaka.\nThe powerful are not immune. The state television network has showed pictures of President Ershad's official residence under knee-deep water. Airport Also Flooded\nDhaka, severed a week ago by road and rail link from the rest of Bangladesh, is cut off from the outside world, as well. The international airport was closed on Friday, its runway flooded.\nAll schools have been shut down in the affected areas, and inmates of hospitals and prisons evacuted.\nGas for cooking is in critically short supply, and the wells, now under water, have become contaminated with sewage.\nFor some, though, the picture is not altogether bleak. Boatmen are doing a brisk business. And some children, too young to fathom the magnitude of the disaster, are enthusiastic. They can be seen splashing and frolicking in the water."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-04 00:00:00      \nAs we bade farewell to the teens of this century, most of us--if not all of us--must have been looking back on our changes, gains and losses as a person, as a society and as a nation. While there will be many memories to fondly remember and many achievements to proudly celebrate on all three fronts, I cannot help but think that how we have felt about the ending decade will ascertain our aspirations for the next. As an economist, I'm supposed to now be quoting statistics and figures to make a point on how developed we have become as a nation, and I'm meant to draw a conclusion from the numbers on what have been our accomplishments and what have been our shortcomings. Ideally, I am supposed to talk about factors like GDP growth, per capita income, poverty rate, investment, labour force participation rate. But I don't feel like being \"ideal\", there are many qualified people to do that. Today, I am writing not only as an economist, but as an educator, a female, a youth, a citizen and as a hopeless dreamer of a Bangladesh that will be fair, just, equitable and safe. Yes, our statistics do tell a tale of glory and perhaps they are the bricks that are paving our path towards becoming a middle-income country in 2024. However, at the brink between these two eras, I could not help but ask myself some questions to which the answers that automatically came to my mind contradict the high aspirations of development that we are dreaming of. If we really have made so much progress, why can't I--as a woman of this city--feel safe and comfortable to walk in the city at night? Why can't girls safely and comfortably use public transport? I had restrictions on going out alone when I was a college student in 2009, and much hasn't changed now that I am an educator 10 years later. The only difference is that it's not my mother restricting me now, it is my own fear of what might happen and what I might face if I do. Why do our students still need to be scared in their own dormitories and have to be weary of getting beaten up on their own university campus? Why does it feel like we're breathing in toxicity--both literally and figuratively--when we're meant to be breathing in fresh air? Why is it that more and more of us are getting increasingly comfortable with remaining silent in the face of wrongdoing? Can a person with lesser mobility function independently, comfortably and safely in Dhaka? Has life changed for a rickshaw-puller who in 2009 had to struggle to feed his family and consider sending all his children to school at the same time? Whether we live in an apartment in Gulshan or in a slum in Mirpur, why can we not sleep without a mosquito net at night in fear of dengue? Why is it that we cannot put our faith in a glass of drinking water in a public place unless it is a sealed water bottle? How can we think of ourselves as living in a developing or developed nation when if in the case of emergency, there is no guarantee that we will get the proper medical care? At this point in time, why is it that we still haven't been able to bring in life-saving drugs? How come it is still unthinkable to use public restrooms, or most restrooms, for that matter in Bangladesh? Most of our people still do not know the basic etiquette or common sense in using restrooms in public places. For example, in aeroplanes. Then when it comes to flights, it's desperately sad that the migrant workers working so hard abroad to bring remittance into this country still have to ask others desperately to fill in their embarkation forms and are misbehaved with? So many more questions come to my mind, and in fact, these questions are important ones to ponder if we want to prioritise inclusive development and not just development and also if we want our development to be simultaneous with improvement in standard of living and quality of life. Our women are having to migrate abroad for work and then they return in tears after being abused and tortured. Anyone anywhere with some power is using the power to trap someone--who crossed them--in lawsuits with false claims. Families are being torn apart in continuous road accidents. Corruption is rising at all levels and ethics are at a demise. A talented but simple boy from a village doesn't turn up in the scholarship viva because he has no \"connections\" and knows he will never get the respect his qualifications deserve. Farmers cry in their prayers for better crops while the rest of us race on with our lives of restaurant food and luxuries. Our students are kept up all night to participate in political activities, yet we expect them to pass in their exams at 8 the next morning. Domestic help are beaten up while we bask in the drama of our Hindi serials. And our children--privileged and underprivileged--lose a bit of their childhood every day as we fail to set our priorities right and chase after the illusions of development. No matter how much someone harps on about the beautiful economic indicators and rising figures of progress, we cannot and should not ignore the fact that this country has become unliveable and even more so if you are poor, if you are marginalised, if you are different. Rich people at least have money, hence choices, but poor people have their hands tied and are forsaken to accept whatever fate comes their way--be it medical catastrophe, natural disaster, abuse or rape. Amidst all these questions without satisfactory answers, how can we still be daydreaming of graduation \"with distinction\" if we haven't even reached a pass mark yet on so many fronts? If we truly love this country and its people, we cannot just keep praising ourselves and patting ourselves on the back for our triumphs. We have far to go, but only if we prioritise the questions asked above. We have got to set our standards properly. Do we want development without well-being, progress without quality? If other countries, like Bhutan, can set their standards and achieve them, why can't we? Isn't it time we get our priorities straight? Are we so divided in what we want? Has it become our social norm to be indifferent, to be silent? In his new book \"How change happens\", Cass R Sunstein talks about social norms and how they can shape a society and affect social change. In answer to the question, \"How does social change happen?\", Sunstein postulates that \"One day, someone challenges the norm. After that small challenge, others may begin to say what they think. Once that happens, a drip can become a flood.\" In this regard, the consequent question for us becomes, do we care enough for the future of our society and nation to challenge the norms that are pulling us behind as we strive to move forward? How will our social change happen--the social change that will help us set our standards? On one hand, we need to be able to call a spade a spade. That doesn't seem possible until someone or something breaks our existing social norm of indifference and silence. So, in the meantime? Research, it all comes down to research. We need answers to our questions and we need valid and reliable ways of finding the answers. We need to understand and realise what steps we should take. We also need to develop an attitude to accept what the results of our research end up to be. That means that our well-being should always be the main priority, not business and commercialisation. But is that the case? Sorry to burst our bubble, but are we ready for the status we are yearning to attain? Do we want to continue as it is with improving statistics of growth and prosperity, or do we want the stories to matter too? For now, I for one am tired of feeling helpless and I want to do my part in bringing about social change. Let me appeal to the policymakers and the powerful on behalf of the cohorts I represent: teachers and researchers--forsaken academicians. You know, the future of this country may just lie in our classrooms and in our research. We have the expertise and the zeal, but we need the incentives--the funds--to survive and to be able to pursue original thinking. So, if you're looking for somewhere to spend, pour the funds into our institutions.  Give us the backing we need, and we will lead this nation out of danger. At least give us the chance to try.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-10 00:00:00      \nThe patient, who revealed his identity this week as Adam Castillejo, 40, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003  A second patient has been cured of HIV after undergoing stem cell transplant treatment, doctors said Tuesday, after finding no trace of infection 30 months after he stopped traditional treatment. The so-called \"London Patient\", a cancer sufferer originally from Venezuela, made headlines last year when researchers at the University of Cambridge reported they had found no trace of the AIDS-causing virus in his blood for 18 months. Ravindra Gupta, lead author of the study published in The Lancet HIV, said the new test results were \"even more remarkable\" and likely demonstrated the patient was cured. \"We've tested a sizeable set of sites that HIV likes to hide in and they are all pretty much negative for an active virus,\" Gupta told AFP. The patient, who revealed his identity this week as Adam Castillejo, 40, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and had been on medication to keep the disease in check since 2012. Later that year, he was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a deadly cancer. In 2016 he underwent a bone marrow transplant to treat blood cancer, receiving stem cells from donors with a genetic mutation present in less than one percent of Europeans that prevents HIV from taking hold. He becomes only the second person to be cured of HIV after American Timothy Brown, known as the \"Berlin Patient\", recovered from HIV in 2011 following similar treatment. Viral tests of Castillejo's cerebral fluid, intestinal tissue and lymphoid tissue more than two years after stopping antiretroviral treatment showed no active infection. Gupta said the tests uncovered HIV \"fossils\" -- fragments of the virus that were now incapable of reproducing, and were therefore safe. \"We'd expect that,\" he said. \"It's quite hard to imagine that all trace of a virus that infects billions of cells was eliminated from the body.\" Ethical dilemma  Researchers cautioned that the breakthrough did not constitute a generalised cure for HIV, which leads to nearly one million deaths every year. Castillejo's treatment was a \"last resort\" as his blood cancer would likely have killed him without intervention, according to Gupta. The Cambridge doctor said that there were \"several other\" patients who had undergone similar treatment but who were less far along in their remission. \"There will probably be more but they will take time,\" he said. Researchers are currently weighing up whether or not patients suffering from drug-resistant forms of HIV might be eligible for stem cell transplants in future, something Gupta said would require careful ethical consideration. \"You'd have to weigh up the fact that there's a 10-percent mortality rate from doing a stem-cell transplant against what the risk of death would be if we did nothing,\" he said. Commenting on The Lancet study, Sharon Lewin, an infectious disease expert at the University of Melbourne, said the findings could provide comfort to patients. But she advised caution. \"Given the large number of cells sampled here and the absence of any intact virus, is the London patient cured?\" she said. \"Unfortunately in the end, only time will tell.\""

The law dates to the British occupation.\n''The jobs, the businesses and other economic activities and precious land which rightly belonged to the indigenous people have been grabbed by the outsiders,'' the Chief Minister of Assam state, Prafulla Mahanta, said.\nThe request comes two years after Assam's leaders signed an accord with the Gandhi Government ending six years of agitation for the deportation of more than a million illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Restrictions on 'Outsiders'\nThe northeast is split off from the rest of India by Bangladesh, and the issue of immigration from that country, as well as from the rest of India, has inspired unrest. The new leaders in Assam captured power in elections in December 1985, and now have joined with other ethnic groups and regional political parties to demand restrictions on what they call outsiders. Protecting Ethnic Identity\nThe Assamese leaders also say they seek to protect ethnic identity in their region. They say that while they do not want to disturb citizens from other parts of India who have already settled there, they want curbs on any further migration.\nMr. Mahanta recently led a delegation of leaders from different tribes that met with Mr. Gandhi to seek the entry restrictions.\nThe demands of the regional groups, which are opposed to Mr. Gandhi's ruling Congress Party, also include a ban on the purchase and sale of land by Indian settlers and denial of business and job opportunities to them. A Curb on Investments\nSuch restrictions would be expected to sharply curb investment in the region, which is rich in resources like wood and oil and produces tea.\nMr. Gandhi was quoted last week by an Assamese official as saying that he would ask the Home Affairs Ministry to study the demands and report to him.\nAssam is the most populous state in the northeast, with 22 million of the area's 25 million people. People from other parts of India are said to make up about 15 percent of the region's population.\nMr. Mahanta also said that he had urged Mr. Gandhi to enforce the rule blocking other Indians from settling in the northeast. Special Visitor Permits\nThe central Government bars foreign nationals, including reporters, from much of the northeast. Indians who wish to visit the northeast need special permits from the border state of Nagaland, adjacent to Burma, and from two border territories - Arunachal Pradesh, which is adjacent to China and Tibet, and Mizoram, also on Burma's border.\nThe Indian Parliament voted recently to bar Indian settlers from running in elections in these areas and in Meghalaya state, also in the northeast. The Government said the law was aimed at reducing fears of local communities, which are of Mongolian descent, that they would be reduced to minorities in their own territories and lose political power.\nMr. Mahanta also said that monsoon rains and heavy flooding in Assam had stalled survey work for a proposed fence along the frontier with Bangladesh to stop the entry of illegal immigrants.\nHe acknowledged that identification and deportation of aliens was slow and blamed the central Government for failing to provide adequate police forces for the job.

A trader at the land port, Amir Hamza, confirming the matter said: \"Indian government previously gave 10% incentives to us traders to import more onions, which was lifted in June after the demand increased in the Indian markets.\" \"We have to buy per kg onion at Tk22 now, which we bought at Tk16 last month,\" he said.  Amir also blamed the new automation system at the Indian border, which lacked efficient workforce, therefore, was delaying the import process.  According to Bhomra Customs assistant commissioner's office, Bhomra Land port is the biggest channel for onion imports in the country. In April 48,000MT of onion were imported from this channel, in May, it was 26,000MT and in June it was only 8,617MT. Bhomra Land Port Export-Import Association Vice President Ferdous Alfa, said: \"Due to the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha, the  demand for onion in the country have increased a little, but the main reason of the price hike is due to onion fields going under water because of flood in India's Nasik.  \"Also, due to the automation system, trucks carrying perishable goods are not being allowed to pass before other goods laden trucks.\"   Bhomra C&F Association President Arafat Hossain said: \"Imports are getting delayed everyday due to online server problems, and less number of scales at the border, which must be fixed, if not, both countries will lose huge revenues, and the prices of onion will go beyond the customers' purchasing power.\" Assistant Revenue Official at the land port, Bikash Chandra Debnath, said: \"There were multiple reasons which caused the price hike, but it will soon be fixed, I hope.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-23 00:00:00      \nVarious NGOs have decried several sections of the draft as 'restrictive and unconstitutional' Non-governmental organizations, and civil society members have expressed grave concern over the draft of the Volunteer Social Welfare Organizations (Registration and Control) Act 2019.  Various NGOs have decried several sections of the draft as \"restrictive and unconstitutional\". According to the NGO Affairs Bureau, between March and June 2019, the government canceled the registration of 197 NGOs. There are 2,470 NGO's registered with the NGO Affairs Bureau for their foreign funding. Another 2,217 are registered as domestic NGOs, and 253 are foreign organizations. What does the draft say? Section 4 of the draft proposes that all NGOs will have to register with the Ministry of Social Welfare, but with the caveat that all NGOs with foreign funding will have to additionally register with the NGO Affairs Bureau. No NGOs will be allowed to set up or continue their operations without government permits. Section 10 introduces the most restrictive part of the law - all NGOs will be able to work in only one district, when they first register. After registration, NGOs can expand their scope of work, but only to five districts at a time. Section 11, sub-sections 1 and 2 stipulates that this law takes precedence over other existing laws regarding registration, and all NGOs have to register, and renew their registrations every five years. Failure to renew registration or rejection by the authority will result in the dissolution of the NGO. Section 14 requires NGOs to have an account with a state owned bank, and conduct all financial transactions via state owned banks. It requires the NGOs to submit their annual work plans, audit reports, activity reports, etc. It also requires NGOS to submit tri-monthly bank statements to the local social welfare office, and registration authorities. Section 16 says, the government can expel the executive committee of an NGO, and replace them with a five-member government appointed committee. Section 17 has the provision for dissolving an NGO, if the government authorities have reason to believe they are not in the best interest of the public, or have broken the law. Sub-section 2 says, the government can dissolve the NGO from the date an order is issued. Sub-section 3 says, an NGO will be declared dissolved from the day its registration is revoked. If an NGO wants to shut down its operations, Section 18 says it must meet a series of requirements. At least three-fourths of the members of the NGO will have to vote for its dissolution at a general meeting. Only then, they can appeal to the registration authorities to shut the NGO down. The authorities will scrutinize the request, and pass it to the director general with their recommendations. If the director general deems fit, a gazette will be issued to proclaim the dissolution of the NGO. After the gazette notification, there will be a three-month period to clear all dues, and if there are no complaints at the end of the period, the NGO will be declared closed. Section 21 lists the provisions for punitive measures, which clearly state that the government can fine an NGO Tk50,000, or issue a year-long prison sentence, or both, if any NGO member is found to be in breach of existing laws, or provide any misinformation in any public statements.  Sub-section 3 stipulates that no legal action can be pursued against authorities or individuals who have enforced the punitive action against the NGO. Sub-section 4 plainly states that no criminal or civil cases can be filed against the government or any government officers if their actions in good faith harm the NGO in any way. However, there is a clause to file a case with the court if there is any grievance with the NGO's financials. Opportunity for misuse On May 26, watchdog Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) expressed deep concern over the proposed law. In a press statement TIB Executive Director Dr Iftekharuzzaman said, the proposed law will create serious obstacles in NGO activities, cautioning that it will create too many chances for misuse.  He expressed his frustration with the provision that requires NGOs with foreign funding to register with two different government offices, emphasizing the risk of the boggy nature of the government bureaucracy to significantly curtail NGO operations. The statement demanded that the government change, modify, and cancel the sections which are unclear, repressive, and conflicting, and calling for a swift amendment to the draft. NGOs perturbed Khushi Kabir, coordinator of Nijera Kori, expressing her disappointment, said: \"When we expressed our anxiety with the draft, the concerned government authority said we (NGOs) will be consulted before the draft is sent to the cabinet, but that did not happen. \"NGOs are not working against the government, they are working for development. But if the government imposes any laws to impede our work, we would like to further discuss, and try to change the law.\"  TIB Chairperson Sultana Kamal said that various sections of the law will terribly diminish NGO activities which are highly-acclaimed, and served to develop the economy, society building, reducing poverty, empowering women, and implementing the SDG. She warned that it will discourage NGO activities not only because of the restrictions, but the nature of the law, which appears to reflect the government's attitude towards citizen rights organizations. Sultana Kamal decried the draft as \"unconstitutional and unacceptable.\"  She recommended the government to sit with stakeholders, and consider their opinion before drafting a law of this magnitude.  Government feedback AJM Ershad Ahsan Habib, deputy secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare said: \"We sent the draft to the cabinet with all the opinions we received. Any changes, replacements, or additions to the law can be made before vetting. The cabinet might even take into consideration the objections or statements by various NGOs.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-08 00:00:00      \nYouthMappers is a network of universities around the globe which provides students with the opportunity to learn mapping skills, develop leadership experiences and create new geospatial data for development projects in places that are vulnerable to natural and social disasters. Launched by the USAID GeoCenter and three universities in 2015, it has grown into a global network of 163 university chapters with over 5000 students. \"We don't build maps, we build mappers\" is their official motto, as they attempt to cultivate a generation of young leaders to create resilient communities. Their leadership fellow programmes, research fellow programmes and virtual internships are beneficial to both students and faculty members for self-development. Maliha Binte Mohiuddin from University of Dhaka began her journey with YouthMappers in 2016, shortly after she wrote a blog entry titled, \"Mapping is like a box of chocolates\", for one of their programmes. Consequently, she was selected as a Leadership Fellow in 2017 and attended a seven-day training session in Nepal, where she also received the Best Blog certificate. In 2018, she was selected for a five-month training programme in Manila, under the National NGO Program for Humanitarian Leadership, organised by Concern Worldwide. She was the youngest representative at International Medical Corps and Harvard Humanitarian Initiatives. YouthMappers works around mapping for humanitarian matters and projects like malaria prevention, food security and resilience against natural calamities. Everyone at YouthMappers is engaged with remote and field mapping sectors. Maliha regards mapping to be an exciting activity for young students, as it enables them to utilise different areas of knowledge and turn them into diagrams. Her current job as the Regional Ambassador is to aid in the process of creating new chapters through local communication with the youth in Asia. Maliha is also involved with their Let Girls Map campaign for bringing aspiring female mappers to the forefront. She recently organised a workshop at Daffodil International University where she taught the students about mapping and worked on a project based on flood resilience in Noakhali. \"We used the Kobo Toolbox, field paper and Mapillary app. With the help of two female volunteers from University of Dhaka, Nowshin Afrose and Sabiha Muna, the programme was a great success,\" she shared. Presently, there are twelve chapters of the network at different institutions across Bangladesh, including University of Dhaka, Dhaka College, Eastern University, Jahangirnagar University, Asian University of Women, Daffodil International University and State University of Bangladesh.  Maliha had Dr Patricia Soils, Director and Principal Investigator of YouthMappers, as her mentor, when she started out. She strongly believes that the platform has given her the encouragement and strength to pursue her goals as a humanitarian in the long run. She is grateful to YouthMappers for equipping her with valuable life skills. Maliha recently presented her paper, Elevating the Skills of Youth Through the Humanitarian Remote Mapping with the Thrive of YouthMappers Network, as one of the keynote speakers at the 3rd International Conference on Natural Hazards and Disaster Management, held in Japan. She has also contributed to the engagement of students at Keio University and Okayama University of Science, with the goal of affiliating them with the YouthMappers network."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-05 00:00:00      \n\"Nah, bhalo lage na. Duijon injured hoia gese,\" said the Bangladesh karate team's Japanese coach Tetsuro Kitamura in clear, if colloquial, Bengali following the women's team's close defeat to Pakistan in the final of the women's kumite event of the 13th South Asian Games in Kathmandu yesterday. It was nice to hear a Japanese coach speaking such fluent Bengali, but it felt nicer when he spoke of his affection for Bangladesh and its people. Kitamura first came to Bangladesh in 1985 as a karate coach under a JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency) project. It is mandatory for every JICA representative to have a basic three-month training on the language of the country to which he or she is sent. That helped him get a grasp of the basics of the language, but his numerous trips and stays in Bangladesh since has made him as fluent as a regular Bangladeshi, as well as fall in love with the local culture. \"This is my first home. I like the people here and the family bonding. People have a good heart. It's not like this in Japan where people are too busy and too self-centred,\" said the veteran coach, who also represents a Japanese crab-exporting company that collects crab from hatcheries in Satkhira. Kitamura, who makes trips to Japan every three months to see his wife, is not the only Japanese coach who has made Bangladesh his home.  Takahiro Taguchi is an adviser of the swimming team who, like Kitamura, has been coming to Bangladesh for coaching stints since the late 1980s. He too can read and speak Bengali fluently, and does not shy away from cracking a joke or two every often.  When asked for an impromptu interview, Taguchi jokingly said, 'Taka lagbe (will give interview for money)', before gladly obliging. \"I came here first in 1987 and I witnessed the flood of 1988 and the cyclone of 1991. I feel at home here, maybe more than in Japan. I like working here,\" said Taguchi. While Japan and JICA have been one of the closest friends of Bangladesh in their development activities, things took a tragic turn after a string of terror attacks on foreigners, culminating in the Holey Artisan Bakery attack in 2016 which took the lives of 24 people, including seven Japanese citizens, who were working here. JICA contemplated stopping their activities in the country but continued with those as the situation improved, thanks to anti-terror drives by the government.  The overall situation of safety and security has also improved much since the time the two coaches first arrived in Dhaka in the late '80s, according to them. \"Earlier people used to steal valuable items. Things are a lot better now. We can move around safely these days and go out on our own at night without any worry,\" Kitamura said. Both coaches felt that there were obvious disadvantages of living in Bangladesh rather than in Japan, but the warmth they get from the people keep them returning to Bangladesh and making it their home.

      "text": "INTERNATIONAL REPORT; India Apparel's Growth Woes\n1987-09-28T05:00:00.000Z\nIn 1970, Prem Kumar Pangasa won his first garment export order of 5,000 summer dresses and shirts for Macy's, the department store.\nAt that time, he had little capital and no factories or workers, and Indian garment manufacturers were virtually unknown in the international market.\nToday, Mr. Pangasa's company, Pangasa Exports, has annual income from overseas sales of about 70 million rupees, or about $5.5 million. He has buyers in the United States, Canada and Italy and is now diversifying into film production and the manufacture of jelly-filled telephone cables.\n''I have worked very hard,'' said Mr. Pangasa, whose success story reflects the boom in Indian garment exports. ''I have come up from scratch.''\nAlthough Indian garment exports have grown in the last year to $1.3 billion, from about $1 billion, there is concern that protectionism in the West, particularly the United States, will stall the expansion of the industry. Diversification Considered\nThis anticipated stagnation and the ever-growing market for synthetic-cotton blends is making both Government officials and exporters in India consider a major diversification of its garment industry. They say that India should now move toward the mass market, which is dominated by Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.\nAlready, Indian textile producers, impatient with Government regulations and quota restrictions, are exporting cotton fabric to neighboring countries including Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka and, in collaboration with local business executives, setting up garment export units there.\n''Prices have a long way to go before they can fill their quotas,'' said one executive, who set up a plant in Bangladesh. ''It's a flight of business, if not of capital.'' Indians have even set up production centers at Dubai and are winning large orders from Western buyers, industry officials said. Renowned Fabrics\nFor centuries, India has been renowned for the richness and variety of its cotton, with its vibrant colors and range of shades. Over the last 20 years, this reputation and a combination of entrepreneurship, cheap labor, good delivery schedules and ability to do small runs have pushed India's share of the world ready-made garment market from zero to 2.4 percent.\nNearly half of this is in fashion garments, manufacturers and exporters say. Small runs of 5,000 or 10,000 pieces of summer sportswear - cotton skirts, shirts and blouses, largely for the 15-to-25 age group - are normal, said Mohanjit Singh of Delfin Exports, who sells to Sweden and Norway. ''This is where we can score because a Japanese or Taiwanese manufacturer would not even look at this scale of stuff,'' he added. U.S. Manufacturers Critical\nThe Indian Government's subsidies of 10 to 15 percent on handlooms and ready-made garments is resented by textile manufacturers in the United States, who are hurt by lower-priced foreign products. The United States House of Representatives approved a bill on Sept. 16 that would set strict limits on imports of textiles, clothing and shoes. However, the House did not muster sufficient votes to override a promised veto from President Reagan.\nThe legislation could affect the five-year textile agreement between the two countries that allows for the expansion of India's ready-made garment exports and places handloom textiles outside the quota limit of Indian exports.\nThe system of national quotas on garment sales, evolved under last year's multi-fiber agreement, means that India is unlikely to go beyond a proposed export figure of about $2 billion in 1990.\nA law called the floor index, which sets the basic price for an item, has drawn particular criticism. The floor index requires exporters to sell a blouse piece, for example, for not less than 40 rupees, or about $3, even though it may cost less than half that to make it.\nThis law has soured relations with a number of buyers, said Dileep Chaddha, a representative for Beeba's Creation Inc. of San Diego, Calif.\n''My company is buying for next spring - especially the skimpy tops for women - from Bangladesh because it's cheaper,'' said Mr. Chaddha, who also complained of inadequate freight space in the airlines, especially in the peak period around the first of the year.\nCurrently, high import duties on raw material and the negligible growth of the domestic synthetics industry has meant that exporters cannot immediately go into the production of synthetics or blends. Manufacturers and agencies like the World Bank have been advising New Delhi to liberalize procedures for the import of raw material and to cut heavy duties on imports of sophisticated equipment.\n''We have advised the Government about the need for lower duties along the line,'' said an economist at the World Bank here. ''The textile industry is one of the largest in the world, but its production of synthetic goods is too expensive because of these factors.'' Policy Changes Studied\nGovernment officials say they are considering changes in the textile policy that would help modernize the industry and reduce customs and excise taxes. The National Textiles Minister, Ram Niwas Mirdha, said recently that the garment industry would be ''given a big boost soon.''\nA. K. Puri, a large exporter and vice president of the Government-supported Apparel Export Promotion Council, said that a move into the sythetic field would be the logical next step for the Indian garment industry.\nAnother area that he and other fabric producers want to explore and expand is that of non-quota goods such as swimwear, hospital gowns and work clothes. ''In this area and that of synthetics, the sky is the limit,'' Mr. Puri said.\nHe noted India's reputation as a reliable and quick supplier of goods, its large and inexpensive work force and low overhead.\nBut John Bissell, an American who runs a handloom export business here, cautioned against a move into synthetics, saying it would hurt the traditional handloom market and India's rich heritage in cotton.\n''It then becomes a game of manipulation and not of styling,'' said Mr. Bissell, who has been in India for more than 20 years."

The 11th parliament polls on December 30, which witnessed highest number of invalid votes ever recorded, is also a testimony that EVMs are fullproof as far as  rate of spoilt ballot papers or invalid votes is concerned.   In the election held on December 30 last year, a total of 881,619 votes were declared invalid by the returning officers of 299 constituencies.  Invalid votes have been seen in almost all constituencies (except Rangpur 6) where votes were cast manually, i.e. by stamping a seal on the ballot paper. But all the votes were declared valid in the following constituencies, where electronic voting machines (EVMs) were used: Dhaka 6 and 13, Chittagong 9, Rangpur 3, Khulna 2 and Satkhira 2. Muhammed Sohul Hussain and Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Sakhawat Hussain, who served the ATM Shamsul Huda-led Election Commission as election commissioners from 2007 to 2012, had suggested the use of EVMs to prevent invalid or spoilt votes. While talking to the Dhaka Tribune over the phone, Sohul Hussain said \"Hopefully Bangladesh will adopt EVMs for the whole electoral process in future.\" \"We introduced EVMs during our tenure. People will realize no vote-rigging can be done using these voting machines; rather votes are easily and safely cast. There will be no misconception in this regard,\" the former election commissioner added. While talking about how votes are counted as spoilt, he explained: \"Votes can become invalid on the off-chance that the voter did not intend to vote for that specific symbol. Sometimes, they might unfortunately stamp seals onto the wrong symbol during the manual ballot paper process. They then stamp the seal again on their favoured symbol. In these cases, ballot papers are announced invalid due to the double seal. \"But in EVMs, just pressing a button, the valuable vote is cast and then locked to count as a valid vote. People can easily go through this process. Furthermore, there is no chance to count any vote as invalid in EVMs,\" he further added. Former election commissioner Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Sakhawat Hussain told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Allegations of vote-rigging, like in the recently held 11th parliamentary election, would be reduced if EVMs are installed in all constituencies.\" He said: \"There is no issue of counting invalid votes in EVMs. I think the time has come to think about overall issues regarding this. Are we going to take votes by EVMs or not?\" \"As you are saying, the number of invalid votes in this election is not a small number. EVMs will be beneficial in the future, where everyone can cast their votes and no vote will be considered as invalid,\" the former election commissioner added. \"Regarding other allegations, I think party people seizing the election booths should be prevented,\" he said. In 2014's 10th parliamentary polls, the invalid vote count was 263,037; 636,294 in the 9th; 449,082 in the 8th; 462,302 in the 7th; and 373,322 in the 5th."

The country's Disease Uncontrol Centre run by Kooks (DUCK) came up with the brand new method even though THERE ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH TESTING KITS FOR ALL VIRUSES TM in the country. \"This virus is very easy to diagnosis. You don't even have to call our hotline. We hate all the calls we are getting. My social life has been in tatters ever since people started worrying so much about dying. It is the inevitable,\" Nawabzada Fauna, head of DUCK, told reporters outside her testing facility which has so many kits you would not even believe it. \"So your nose is blocked, you have a cough, and perhaps a little pneumonia. But have you recently been to a different country? Specifically these three countries? If not, then you do not have it. Take an aspirin and chill out,\" they said, adding that no one should panic if they are not tested considering the number of testing kits the centre has can flood the entire country. The new method of quick diagnosis has also instilled confidence in the country's people, with many now going out and about knowing they are not carriers of any virus. Asked if the situation was so much under control, then why were all modes of public transport being suspended, Fauna said it was because too many people were using those to come to the DUCK headquarters. \"We have asked people on numerous occasions not to come here. But they just don't want to listen. Why are they behaving in such an odd way? There is nothing to see here except the billions of testing kits that we have. I promise. I swear to you,\" they said, breaking down in tears. Fauna finally asked the reporters to leave and covered themselves with protective gear, including a bullet-proof vest and a very, very stupid looking hat.

      "text": "Two Key Opposition Leaders in Bangladesh Seized\n1987-11-12T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Government placed Bangladesh's two most prominent opposition leaders under house arrest today in an attempt to stop the spread of anti-Government riots in Dhaka and elsewhere.\nThe holding of the two women - the daughter of one assassinated leader of Bangladesh and the widow of another assassinated leader - came as rioters set fires, threw rocks and clashed with the police in downtown Dhaka in the second day of protests to drive President H. M. Ershad from office.\nMr. Ershad seized power in a mili tary coup in 1982 but was elected president last year while the opposition boycotted, calling the voting a sham.\nIn general, the number of protesters appeared to diminish today in the capital. In all, there were no more than a few thousand taking part, but they did extensive damage to some downtown buildings and also ransacked and burned a one-story building housing an audio-visual center of the United States Information Service.\n''They broke the door, got inside and looted the place,'' said an American official who saw the attack. ''The role of the police was pathetic. They simply witnessed the whole thing and didn't move in until it was over.'' He said there was no evidence the rioters were directing their anger at the United States, however.\nThe police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds, avoiding the use of bullets, which killed at least three protesters on Tuesday. The opposition said today that 12 members had died in police gunfire on Tuesday, but they said they could not identify more than three or four by name and did not have possession of any of the bodies.\nOnly minor injuries were reported today after scores were wounded in Tuesday's clashes.\nIt was unclear how wide the protests had spread to other parts of Bangladesh. Government officials said there were minor incidents of arson and damage in other cities, as well as damage to some trains and buses.\nThe drama centered on the arrest of Khaleda Zia Rahman, widow of President Ziaur Rahman, and Sheik Hasina Wajed, daughter of Bangladesh's independence leader and first president, Sheik Mujibur Rahman. Each woman leads a coalition of political parties that seeks to return to power.\nMrs. Zia was arrested in a ninth-floor hotel room where she had fled the night before to avoid being taken into custody. Policemen broke in the door and ordered her into van down stairs, pushing her as she pushed back, shouted in protest and was jostled amid a noisy crowd of reporters.\nThe Dhaka Police Commissioner, Nasrullah Khan, accompanied Mrs. Zia, telling her, ''Madam, I salute you,'' as he escorted her to the waiting van. Wearing a white sari as is customary for widows, she waved to supporters from the van and shouted to them to carry on. She was first driven to a police station and then to her house where she was confined under guard.\nMrs. Zia's husband was leader of Bangladesh from the time he seized power in a military coup in 1975 to his murder in 1981.\nMeanwhile all day, Mrs. Hasina Wajed remained inside her family home, the place where her father was murdered in 1975, four years after leading Bangladesh to independence when it broke from Pakistan. In the evening, she tried to leave to attend a scheduled press conference downtown.\nBut in an echo of the first arrest, and of the courtesies required in this country for women, the police officer who took her into custody also opened by saying, ''Madam I salute you,'' and then forcefully accompanied her back to the house.\nBut Mrs. Hasina Wajed, who was elected to Parliament last year and is the official opposition leader, asserted that her arrest was unconstitutional because it required permission from the speaker of the Parliament and dissolution of the Parliament itself.\nGovernment officials disputed this, saying she was not officially under arrest, simply confined to her home. As her supporters shouted slogans on a nearby street, Mrs. Hasina Wajed stood at the veranda land shouted to reporters on the other side of a wall: ''The movement will continue until Ershad's fall. That day is not very far.''"

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-27 00:00:00      \nAround 60 kilometres of flood control embankment in Patuakhali and Barguna got badly damaged due to the tidal surges caused by the impact of cyclone Fani. Moreover, thousands of people at different villages in those two districts have been suffering a lot as their dwelling houses and vast tracts of agricultural land remained inundated due to the impact of the recent cyclone. Besides, tidal water keeps entering those villages through the damaged portion of the flood control embankment since the cyclone hit the southern region. Of the damaged embankment, around 30 kilometre is under Patuakhali Water Development Board (WDB), 10.5 kilometre under Kalapara WDB in Patuakhali and 18.5 kilometre is in Barguna, according to Patuakhali and Barguna WDB offices. Patuakhali WDB Executive Engineer Mohammad Hasanuzzaman said of the 30 kilometre, about 5.5 kilometre was damaged fully and 24.5 kilometre partly. The most affected villages are Mehendiabad, Ranipur, Golkhali, Hazikhali and Charkhali, all along the Payra river in Mirzaganj upazila. \"We have already sent a letter to the higher authorities, seeking allocation of fund to repair the badly damaged portion in an emergency basis,\" he said. Meanwhile, in Kalapara, around 10.5 kilometre dyke was badly damaged and tidal water keeps entering through the damaged portion in different villages. Of the villages, Kamarpur, Nizampur, Puran Mohipur, Yousufpur, Monoharpur, Najibpur under Mohipur union and Chairpara, Nawapara, Chowdhuripara, Nayakata, Munshipara, Chandupara, Hasnapara, Poshurbunia under Lalua union are most vulnerable. Abul Talukder, a resident of Nayakata village, said the flood control embankment along on the Ramnabad river was badly damaged during the super cyclone Sidr and later repaired hurriedly. Feroza Begum of Charipara village said they often suffer from waterborne diseases as their houses and croplands remained inundated during the rainy season. \"We cannot even cook our food properly during the rainy season,\" she said. Lalua Union Parishad Chairman Shawkat Hossain said at least 16 villages under his union have been inundated after a portion of the flood control dyke along the Ramnabad river broke down. Kumar Sastik, acting executive engineer of Kalapara WDB, said they sent a fax to the higher authorities for allocation of fund. After getting allocation we will take step to repair the dyke, he said. In Barguna, due to lack of repair around 18 kilometre of the flood control dyke at 37 spots is under threats. The most vulnerable areas are Chotobaliatali, Noltona, Lakurtala, Dalvanga, Angerpara, Jangalia, Patakata, Gudighata, Gulishakhali, Chalitatali and Noli under Barguna Sadar upazila, Boloybinia, Deshantorkathi and Jhopkhali under Betagi upazila, Kakchira, Charlathimara, Ruhita, Jintala and Padma under Pathorghata upazila, Ramna, Shafipur, Chechan, Shinrabunia and Borotaleshwar under Bamna upazila and Poshorbunia, Poshimghotkhali and Purbochila under Amtali upazila. Barguna WDB Executive Engineer Dipak Ranjon Das said they have informed their higher authorities about the damaged embankment."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-15 00:00:00      \nChina's President Xi Jinping arrives in Myanmar this week to nail down multi-billion-dollar infrastructure deals in a country abandoned by many in the West appalled at the \"genocide\" of Rohingya Muslims on leader Aung San Suu Kyi's watch. Xi's two-day visit, his first as president, will seek to cement Beijing's position as Myanmar's largest investor and strategic partner. The much-trumpeted China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC) aims to connect the Middle Kingdom to the Indian Ocean, a key route in Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative that envisions Chinese infrastructure and influence spanning the globe. In addition to offering tens of billions of dollars in investment, China shields its neighbour at the United Nations, where pressure is mounting for accountability over the Rohingya crisis. Yet the relationship between the countries is tangled. Ethnic conflicts sizzling in border zones and the impact of dams, pipelines and transport links risk awakening hostility over Chinese intentions. For China, it is \"time to get things back on track\", historian Thant Myint-U wrote in his latest book. The headline deal will likely be a colossal factory zone and deep-sea port in Rakhine state, which lies on Myanmar's west coast beside the Bay of Bengal. Myanmar successfully slashed the cost of Kyaukphyu port from $7.2 billion to $1.3 billion, reducing the chance of it turning into a debt trap. Like other Chinese-led projects, however, public details are scant. Rakhine's northern fringes saw 740,000 Rohingya forced out in a bloody military crackdown in 2017. The state remains the stage for a civil war between the military and an ethnic Rakhine rebel group. Undeterred, Myanmar has declared the area open for business. While Western investors have shunned the opportunity, China -- competing against other regional giants -- has few such qualms. Billions of cubic metres of gas and millions of barrels of oil from offshore rigs are pumped each year across the country to China. Beijing now wants to secure plans for a high-speed rail link between the port and China's landlocked Yunnan province. Other key projects include industrial zones on the shared border and a makeover for commercial hub Yangon. Analyst Richard Horsey said the visit brings both huge opportunity and enormous risk for Myanmar. \"They feel they're again over-reliant on China and that's a very dangerous place to be.\" China already holds the largest share -- around $4 billion or 40 percent -- of Myanmar's foreign debt. The future of a suspended, Beijing-backed mega-dam in northern Kachin state threatens to overshadow Xi's visit. As vice-president in 2009, Xi signed off on the Myitsone dam with Myanmar's then-military junta. But widespread public anger brought the project to an abrupt halt two years later in an affront to China. The $3.6 billion dam would flood an area the size of Singapore and critics warn of irreparable damage to the Ayeyarwady River. Inching towards restarting the project would be \"catastrophic, counter-productive and unpopular\" ahead of Myanmar elections later this year, said Horsey. Once a vocal opponent of the dam, Suu Kyi last year called on people to reconsider their opposition. Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui last week cryptically said the two nations remained in \"close communication\" on the issue. But anger still permeates local communities. Ndau Pri, 60, who was shunted from her home 10 years ago by early construction work, still cannot return as the project has not been definitively cancelled. \"They don't care about us,\" she told AFP, gesturing to the infertile ground around her new village. The Xi visit is also to \"show support to Suu Kyi in the context of the Rohingya crisis\", analyst Yun Sun said. Suu Kyi's reputation in the West lay shattered even before she defended her nation against genocide charges at the UN's top court in The Hague last month. Luo, the Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister, focused on extolling China's role in mediating between Bangladesh and Myanmar over the Rohingya. China plays a shadowy yet influential role behind the scenes of other festering conflicts with rebel groups, particularly on the countries' shared border. The economic corridor will cut through mountainous areas of Shan state, where a dozen insurgent armies and hundreds of militia forces are based. Local media reported a Chinese envoy this week even visited key militant groups to warn them not to undermine the summit. Xi will meet both Suu Kyi and powerful army chief Min Aung Hlaing to deepen ties. From Rakhine fishermen to Kachin farmers, hearts and minds in Myanmar, however, are far from won. \"China could again become the bogeyman, seen as the existential threat to the country,\" Horsey said."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-28 00:00:00      \nThe website was hacked between late Friday and early Saturday   A government domain page for Manirampur upazila of Jessore district has been recovered after the website was hacked to protest the upazila's AC (Land) punishing elderly men for not wearing masks. A group of hackers named Team Donz claimed responsibility for hacking the website between late Friday and early Saturday. On Friday, a photograph of Manirampur Executive Magistrate and Assistant Commissioner (Land) Sayeema Hasan, taking a photograph of the elderly men holding their ears as punishment for not wearing masks, surfaced on Facebook that generated the criticism of netizens. News of the hacking surfaced on Facebook early Saturday when many users shared a screenshot of the webpage where the photograph of the incident was featured on the website. The hackers replaced the cover photo of the domain page with a photograph of Sayeema punishing the senior citizens. The hackers also added a notice on the noticeboard that read: \"In spite of being a literate person, the assistant commissioner of land acted like an illiterate person,\" which was later removed around 12:20am. Confirming the matter on Saturday afternoon, Jessore district's Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Shafiul Arif said: \"The webpage was hacked and our IT team fixed it at midnight.\" The domain page is run under the National Web Portal of Bangladesh (Jatiya Tatthya Batayan). Contacted, Sayeema was not available for comment, despite repeated attempts over the phone. Earlier on Saturday, Sayeema was withdrawn from her workplace after widespread criticism on social media, confirmed Public Administration Secretary Sheikh Yusuf Harun. Punishment gone wrong Following the government's directive for people to stay inside their houses to curb the spread of coronavirus, many government officials and law enforcement agencies have been conducting drives in different areas of the country. A mobile court, led by then executive magistrate Sayeema Hasan, conducted drives in different areas of Manirampur on Friday afternoon. During the drive, she asked the three elderly men, including a van driver and a vegetable vendor, at Chinatola Bazar, to hold their ears in public as punishment. She also captured photographs of the punishment. Her photograph capturing moments with the humiliated elderly individuals later went viral on social media and drew significant criticism."

Emergency services tackled thousands of calls from people overnight around the city of Townsville, where evacuation centres were filling up. Crocodiles were even spotted in suburban streets, pictures on social media showed. \"Once in a century event happening here. I have never seen the likes of this before,\" Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp TV, in a state often hit by cyclones and flooding. Palaszczuk said there could be thousands of homes affected by the flooding. A record 1.16 metres (3.8 ft) of rain has fallen across the Townsville area over the past seven days, with another 100 millimetres expected to be dumped over the area on Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Major flood warnings have been posted for several rivers. The weather bureau warned of \"dangerous and high velocity flows\" along the Ross River after the flood gates were opened fully at the Ross River dam on Sunday, releasing about 1,900 cubic metres of water a second. Even after the release, as of Monday morning, the dam was still at 229 percent capacity, holding about 532,000 gigalitres of water, or roughly as much as Sydney Harbour. \"We're hoping to see an easing trend from tomorrow,\" bureau spokeswoman Jess Gardner said, adding that the rains could move further south, towards Mackay, a major coal exporting area. Townsville, a major port for northern Australia, is the country's top exporter of copper, zinc, lead and sugar. The Port of Townsville remains open, but cargo loadings have faced interruptions due to heavy rain, a port spokeswoman said. She did not have details on specific shipments held up. Global miner Glencore Plc, which exports copper, zinc and lead from Townsville said as of late last week there had been no impact on its operations."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-13 00:00:00      \nAt least 3,483 acres of water bodies, low-lying lands filled up over the last nine years Residents of Dhaka are once again facing the threat of severe water logging, as incessant rain has inundated many parts and major roads of the capital.  The Dhaka met office recorded 48mm of rainfall from 12pm-2pm on Friday but the poor state of the capital's drainage system ensured that two hours of rain was enough to flood a considerable part of the city. Mirpur Road, Nayapaltan, Green Road, Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, Motijheel, Rampura, Banani-11, Tejgaon, Karwan Bazar, Monipuri para, Kazipara, Begum Rokeya Sarani, Mohammadpur, and Dhanmondi were among the areas flooded by the rain, with water even entering homes and business establishments in low-lying areas. The situation was even worse in areas such as Malibagh and Rokeya Sharani, where road renovation work and ongoing development projects, like the Metro Rail, pose further obstacles for commuters and residents.  However, the Gulshan area saw little to no water logging, following the revamp of the drainage system during the tenure of late Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) mayor Anisul Huq. 36% of Dhaka's water bodies filled up in 9 years At least 3,483 acres of water bodies and lowlands across the metropolitan area in Dhaka have been filled up in the last nine years, according to a recent study. Presenting the findings of the study at an event on April 25, the Bangladesh Institute of Planners (BIP) General Secretary Adil Mohammad Khan said 36% of the water bodies in Dhaka had been filled up, violating the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) for the capital adopted in 2010. The parts of the city under the jurisdiction of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkah (Rajuk) had 100,937 acres of water bodies and lowlands nine years ago, but 22% of those - 22,156 acres - have been filled up since then, greatly contributing to the perennial water-logging issue, he added. The report was prepared on the basis of satellite images. No immediate relief In Dhaka, the drainage system, water pump, canals, and rivers are maintained by a total seven government agencies:  The Bangladesh Water Development Board (WDB), Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakha (Rajuk), Dhaka District Administration, Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Dhaka Wasa), Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) and Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC).   Each of the organizations works separately to improve the drainage system in different parts of the capital. Dhaka Wasa works on the storm drain system, which handles surface water. Most drains in Dhaka are clogged by solid waste and plastic garbage, due to irregular cleanup and lack of awareness of city dwellers. Dhaka used to have 65 natural canals running throughout the city, but the number currently stands at only 26, as most of them are clogged by garbage and illegal occupiers. Urban planner and BIP General Secretary Adil Mohammad Khan said the city has been planned in a manner that does not consider the connectivity of the water management. \"There is no shortcut remedy. We have already blocked the natural connectivity to accommodate the high population density in this mega-city. We have made it a concrete jungle. Now, we have to improve the efficiencies of all existing water bodies first, and then immediately recover all the canals from grabbers and re-install their connectivity, to help the water drain from city properly,\" he added. Both Dhaka city mayors said illegally occupied city canals must be reclaimed to save Dhaka, as the blocking of the canals is largely responsible for the water logging.  DNCC Mayor Atiqul Islam said the water in Dhaka should reach rivers through canals and drainage lines of Dhaka Wasa.  \"However, the drainage lines are clogged and canals have been illegally occupied,\" he added. \"Dhaka was supposed to have 12% Aadhar (reservoir), which is now only 3%. All the ponds and water bodies have been filled up. Also, unplanned urbanization has put us in trouble, as 330 sq-km out of the total 400 sq-km area of Dhaka has already full of houses, hampering water flow routes,\" the DNCC mayor further said, adding that the authorities are in the process of mapping problem areas to find a solution. Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) Mayor Sayeed Khokhon said: \"Due to lack of proper maintenance of box culverts, water flows very slowly- at maybe at 5-10% the speed of the usual flow.\" Criticizing Dhaka Wasa, he said most city canals have been illegally occupied, and the few remaining ones are not even cleaned regularly. The DSCC mayor emphasized the need to increase the capacity of public service organizations and raise public awareness in order to address water logging. Dhaka Water Supply & Sewerage Authority (Wasa) Managing Director Taqsem A Khan could not be reached for comment as he is out of the country, while other senior Dhaka Wasa officials refused to speak on the matter."

A \"Dead Stop\" sign at rail bridges instruct trains to stop first before crossing it at only 5km/h. Sources at Bangladesh Railway (East) said six trains - Parabat, Jayantika, Paharika, Udayan, Upaban and Kalni - carry 12,000 to 15,000 passengers every day over these dangerouse locations, reports UNB. Eight of these \"Dead Stops\" are situated in an 18km stretch from Sylhet to Mogla Bazar and five in 164km stretch from Mogla Bazar to Akhaura Bridge.  According to Railway Engineering's Sylhet branch, the 13 bridges with \"Dead Stop\" signs are - Samshernagar-Tilagon section's bridge No 200, Mogla Bazar-Maijgaon section's bridge No 43, 45 and 47, Kulaura-Baramchal section's bridge No 5 and 7, Satgaon-Sreemangal section's bridge No 141, Sreemangal-Vanugach section's bridge No 157, Maijgaon-Vater Bazar section's bridge No 29, and Montola-Itakhola section's bridge No 56. Sajib Kumar Malakar, assistant station manager of Sylhet railway station, said most of the bridges in this section are in risky condition. \"I cannot confirm whether the June 23 accident happened only because of the bridge's condition,\" he added. Five people were killed when six coaches of Dhaka-bound \"Upaban Express\" went off the rails on June 23 after a culvert over the Barochhara canal, near the Baramchal railway station, caved in. A coach of fertilizer-carrying BC Special Train from Shahjalal Fertilizer Factory derailed at Maijgaon station adjacent area on April 5. A coach of Jalalabad Express ran off the tracks at Mollikapur area under Fenchuganj upazila on May 16. An oil tanker train derailed at Kulaura in Moulvibazar in March 2018, snapping rail communication for two hours with other parts of the country. Trains on Sylhet-Chittagong and Dhaka-Sylhet routes were halted for 15 hours on February 23 last year due to derailment of Upaban Express at Satgaon in Sreemangal. In 2017, media reports highlighted the sorry state of Monu Bridge and how bamboo was used to repair it. The bridge remained that way since then and is currently included in the list of risky bridges. Bhoismara Rail Bridge between Sreemangal and Satgaon stations was damaged in a flash flood on April 5, 2017. The condition of the bridge has not improved yet. The same is the case with the rest of the bridges that are using \"Dead Stops\" to prevent accidents and loss of life. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on June 25 ordered the authorities concerned to conduct a survey of rail bridges and culverts across the country and repair those damaged or risky."

The idea of moving Indonesia's seat of government from an urban conglomeration of nearly 30 million people with some of the world's worst traffic jams has stretched on for decades. Low-lying Jakarta is also prone to annual flooding and is one of the world's fastest sinking cities due to excessive groundwater extraction. Indonesia wants to move the capital from sinking Jakarta https://t.co/g0ejcImWZL On Monday, urban planning minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said the long-stalled relocation plan won approval from President Joko Widodo who favoured moving the capital away from Indonesia's most populous Java island. Jakarta, which suffers billions of dollars in annual congestion-and-flood linked economic losses, would remain the country's financial hub. \"Widodo decided on the option to relocate the capital,\" Brodjonegoro said after a cabinet meeting.  In a statement before the meeting, Widodo expressed support for the idea, but he did not give an alternate location or a timeline for any move. \"In the future, would Jakarta be able to carry the double burden of being both the centre of government and its business centre?\" he asked in the statement. \"If we prepare well from the very beginning, this great relocation idea could be realised,\" he added. During his re-election campaign, Widodo pledged to spread economic growth more evenly in the nation of 260 million.  He won a second term this month, according to unofficial poll results.  Local media have reported that a possible new capital would be Palangkaraya city on the island of Borneo."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-10 00:00:00      \nCashing in on the growing demand for spices ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the second largest religious festival of the country, traders have increased prices of spices to earn some extra buck. Demands for spices like cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, clove, raisin, black pepper, ginger, garlic, onion and vegetables like potato go up ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. Prices of each kg of cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, clove, raisin and black pepper have soared by Tk 20-250 in a week. Retailers and wholesalers have been trading blame over the rise in prices. The Daily Star on Thursday visited several retail and wholesale markets in the capital, including Karwan Bazar, Moghbazar and Jatrabari, and found a significant gap between wholesale and retail prices. Garlic (Chinese) was selling at Karwan Bazar wholesale market at Tk 140 per kg, but retailers were selling it at Tk 180 to buyers. Middle and low income groups are bearing the brunt of this spike in prices. Mizanur Rahman asked for 100gm of cardamom at Yusuf General Store in Karwan Bazar. He gave the shop owner a Tk 500 note and got Tk 230 back. Surprised, Mizan asked the retailer Md Yusuf about the price of cardamom. \"Tk 2,700 per kg,\" Yusuf curtly replied. Talking to this correspondent Mizan said, \"It's robbery in broad daylight.\" \"Now, I'll have to skip buying one or two items,\" he added. Wishing to remain unnamed, a retailer at Jatrabari kitchen market said most of the spices are dry products. \"These can be stored for a long time,\" he said. Due to flood, prices of vegetables shot up last month. Things started getting back to normal last week. However, green chili is still being sold at over Tk 100. A kg of green chili was sold at Tk 50 last month. It is now being sold at Tk 120. Abdul Wahab, a wholesaler at Malibagh kitchen market, said because of rain the price of green chili is high. \"It will go down within a week or two,\" he added. Contacted, Md Enayet Ullah, president of Bangladesh Paikari Garam Masala Baboshayi Samity, claimed that prices of spices, except cardamom and cinnamon, are stable. \"We import cardamom from India and there is a shortage of it in the Indian market. Price of cardamom will go up further after Eid if this scarcity continues,\" he said. \"We import cinnamon from China but heavy rain there has created a crisis,\" he added. Enayet claimed such fluctuation in prices happens throughout the year. \"Media gives special focus on this ahead of Eid, that's why it seems unusual,\" he said.  'PRICES HAVEN'T GONE DOWN SINCE RAMADAN IN PORT CITY' Meanwhile, spice market remains volatile in Chattogram with price of several spices showing an upward trend both in the wholesale hub and kitchen markets for last couple of months, frustrating consumers ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. Even yesterday, price of onion, garlic and ginger marked a Tk 3-30 rise per kg at Khatunganj wholesale market. According to wholesalers, delay in getting imported garlic and ginger from Chattogram port created a crisis, which caused the sudden hike. Wholesale price of most spices witnessed a gradual increase since Eid-ul-Fitr. Price of cumin, cinnamon and cardamom marked a sharp rise around three weeks back as buyers started stockpiling those from Khatunganj and adjoining Asadganj -- country's major spice hub, imported through the port. Import of spices increased in the recently concluded fiscal year. But wholesale and retail price of cardamom, cumin and cinnamon saw a Tk 50-400 rise per kg in a span of one and a half month while price of cloves remained stable. Higher price of spices in global market and delayed delivery from port due to vessel congestion are some of the reasons behind the hike, said market insiders. They also attributed it to the increase in demand and multi -level selling of same goods ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. Md Sekander, a trader who usually buys spices from importers and sells to a third party, said at Khatunganj, goods are sold several times from one party to another before buyers purchase it. Import of cardamom, cinnamon, cumin and cloves through Chittagong port in fiscal 2018-19 was around 4.53 crore kg, which was 4.36 crore kg the year before. Meanwhile, consumers are bearing the brunt of the price surge. Yesterday morning, while visiting Karnaphuli CDA Market, a housewife was seen arguing with a retailer as he was charging Tk 260 for 100 grammes of cardamom, a Tk 30 hike for the same quantity she bought a few weeks back. \"With Eid approaching, they will probably charge more. Prices haven't gone down since Ramadan,\" she told this correspondent. Mohammad Suman, the retailer, said he bought \"average quality\" cardamom at Tk 2,350 a kg from Khatunganj two weeks ago and was selling it at Tk 2,600 per kg. \"It was Tk 1,900 a kg one month back,\" he said. Regarding such hike in wholesale market, Faruk Ahmed, proprietor of Khatunganj-based Faruk Trading International, said their import cost went up due to various calamities in many countries such as India and Guatemala. Like cardamom, cinnamon was also imported in last 12 months till June. Retailers were found selling the spice at Tk 500 a kg, a Tk 100 hike. Import of cumin dropped a bit while its price rose by Tk 50 in last two months. Price of cloves, imported from Indonesia, Madagascar and Brazil, remained stable. Meanwhile, yesterday's sudden hike in wholesale price of onion, ginger and garlic prompted retailers to raise the rate. Jahangir Alam, a rickshaw puller, said he bought one kg garlic at Tk 160 in the morning but found that price reached Tk 190 in the evening."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-08 00:00:00      \n40% of expatriate employees stuck in China; Robots to be used in Padma bridge works  Chinese companies working in Bangladesh are worried about not being able to meet deadlines of the development projects, including several mega projects, that they are implementing in Bangladesh. Many of the projects are at risk of failing to maintain respective deadlines as around 40% of Chinese staff working in Bangladeshi projects have been stuck in China for more than a month. This includes staff who are currently at the coronavirus epidemic centre in China, none of whom are allowed to leave. According to the Chinese Enterprises Association in Bangladesh (CEAB), more than 15,000 Chinese staff members, under 400 companies, are involved in development programs in Bangladesh. CEAB Vice President Ke Changliang told the Dhaka Tribune that around 6000 Chinese staff could not return to Bangladesh because of the outbreak, resulting in slow progress in the development works. On February 2, Bangladesh suspended visa on arrival for Chinese citizens indefinitely amidst the coronavirus epidemic. The China government now wants the suspension to be withdrawn as the situation has almost been brought under control in China. Otherwise, meeting the deadlines for completion of development projects will be a challenge, suspects Chinese officials. Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming on Wednesday urged Bangladesh to withdraw the suspension as soon as possible. During a press briefing held at Padma Bridge Rail Link Project office in Dhaka's Keraniganj, Li said around 95% of the spreading of the virus is now happening from other countries as China has almost controlled the outbreak of the disease. \"Up to now, no Chinese national here and no Bangladesh national here or in China have been infected by the coronavirus,\" he added. According to CEAB, the total amount of investment in Bangladesh contributed by China is nearly $10 billion which created job opportunities for more than 100,000 people in Bangladesh. But these efforts have been negatively impacted due to the COVID-19 epidemic, a global health emergency. Bangladesh government may soon adopt stricter health and quarantine measures on equipment and materials imported from China. Moreover, the application of more rigorous public health regulations on Chinese employees working in Bangladesh, such as medical examination, will make it harder for them to obtain work permits. Ke Changliang said: \"All of these issues have caused certain distress to normal production speed and operation of Chinese enterprises in Bangladesh.\" \"Despite the internal and external challenges, all Chinese companies, especially contractors like CREC, Power China, CCCC, and CCECC, are doing their best to maintain workflow to avoid the suspension of the projects,\" he said at the press briefing. Importing robots for Padma Bridge construction work Although 86% of the construction work is already done, completion of the Padma Bridge project by June 2021 has become a challenge as importing the materials from China remains almost closed since the coronavirus outbreak began. Despite the outbreak currently being under control,  business entities are not in full operation in China yet, creating a shortage of material. China Major Bridge Engineering Company (CMBE) executing Padma Bridge project and China Railway Group Limited (CREC) implementing Padma Bridge Rail Link Project are looking for alternative ways to tackle this situation. These include importing four robots from China and training the local people for specialized tasks. Liu Jianhua, director of Padma Bridge project said: \"We are trying to import four robots for strengthening the execution and to deal with the shortage of manpower.\" Wang Kun, director of Padma Bridge Rail Link Project said: \"To ensure continuity of work, we are trying our best to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus.\""

      "text": "Trade Bill Has Special Favors For Companies\n1988-04-11T05:00:00.000Z\nBuried deep in the 1,000-page trade bill that Congress is trying to complete this week are provisions benefiting companies making everything from drugs and disposable diapers to cooking ware and frozen cranberries.\nThese special provisions have created a powerful constituency behind the bill, even as debate continues over other, more controversial aspects of the legislation.\nHard bargaining is expected this week between the White House and Congress, with President Reagan setting the stage by reiterating his veto threat in his radio address Saturday, asserting, ''I will veto a bad trade bill before I let a bad trade bill veto our economy.''\nThe greatest benefit, potentially worth more than $100 million, would go to the Warner-Lambert Company. A provision deftly inserted by its lobbyists would extend for three and a half years its patent on a cholesterol-reducing drug called Lopid.\nThe patent is due to expire in July 1989, at which time the company would face competition from generic producers, which, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration, would be free to sell a similar drug at lower prices.\nNow prescribed only for people suffering from inflammation of the pancreas, Lopid is Warner-Lambert's third-largest-selling drug, and the company is seeking F.D.A. approval for its wider use. Lopid sales last year were $101 million, up 74 percent over the year before.\nHundreds of other companies would also benefit, chiefly from miscellaneous tariff reductions that have been tacked onto the legislation in the more than two years of its gestation. Among these are the Procter & Gamble Company, which would get cheaper sodium polyacrylate polymers, a moisture-absorbing chemical, for use in superabsorbent disposable diapers; Corning Glass Works, which would have duties suspended on its Visions cookware imported from plants abroad, and Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc., which would be able to import frozen cranberries from Canada duty-free. White House Objections\nIt would all come to naught, however, with a Presidential veto, assuming it is not overridden. The White House objects not to the special-interest sections of the bill, but to broader proposals affecting the economy at large.\nThe main targets are proposals to force companies to give at least 60 days' notice of impending plant closings, to require disclosure of sensitive foreign investment information and to limit Presidential flexibility in some trade decisions.\nThe President's advisers may urge that he sign the bill if these proposals are eliminated or modified, Administration officials said.\nTreasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States trade representative, are expected to meet with the Democratic Congressional leadership early this week to try to lay the framework for compromise. Unresolved Issues\nHouse and Senate negotiators came to a series of agreements on March 31, just before the Easter recess, but there are some unresolved issues -chiefly relating to investment and agriculture - likely to be taken up early this week.\nMany provisions of this sweeping legislation, only the second trade bill this decade, would produce changes that would affect the nation's overall posture in trade and competitiveness.\nBut the impact would not be felt until well into a new Administration, when new cases are brought by companies seeking protection against imports, or complaining about unfair foreign trade practices.\nOn the other hand, patent extension and tariff suspension have practical effects that make the bill a point of considerable immediate interest in many board rooms. Where Consumers Could Suffer\nSome tariff-cutting benefits could be passed on to consumers in lower prices, Congressional aides pointed out. But the most controversial of the special-interest provisions, the Lopid patent extension, could work against the consumer by denying the benefits of a cheaper generic equivalent.\nWarner-Lambert's president and chief executive, Joseph D. Williams, a former president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, personally managed the intensive lobbying effort, a sign of how important the issue is to his company.\nOne major victory was getting the patent extension attached to the bill. Usually this kind of legislation stands on its own and might be subject to intense scrutiny. But there were no public hearings before the Lopid provision was added to the omnibus bill last June. The risk in this strategy lies in the veto threat.\n''There is a certain internal logic in making this a part of the trade bill, since this is an industry very much involved in U.S. trade,'' said Edward S. Knight, the company's legislative counsel and a partner in the Washington law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld.\n''The pharmaceutical industry makes a positive contribution of $800 million to the balance of trade,'' he stressed. ''Companies in France, Germany and Japan are in the process of developing and marketing drugs that would compete against Lopid.''\nThe chief House sponsor of the extension was Representative Butler Derrick, Democrat of South Carolina, who has a big Warner-Lambert plant in his state. Spirited Opposition\nBut there was spirited opposition, chiefly from Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, Democrat of Wisconsin, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice, who did not like the idea of special-interest provisions in a trade bill.\nAlso weighing in against the patent extension was Eric Hard, a staff attorney for Public Citizens' Congress Watch, a public-interest watchdog group, who argued that the losers would be ''America's poor, sick and elderly, as well as the taxpayers, through Medicare and Medicaid'' -Government programs that pay for drugs for the elderly and poor.\nA month's supply of Lopid costs anywhere from $40 to $70 in drugstores. ''If a person on a fixed income is prescribed three or four such drugs,'' Mr. Hard said, ''the dilemma is readily apparent.''\nOther provisions of the bill were intended to give added tariff protection to specific companies, such as the Smith Corona Corporation, the only surviving American producer of portable electric typewriters in American.\nSmith Corona has long complained about what it contends is the ''dumping'' of Japanese typewriters at unfairly low prices in the United States, and in 1979 won an order imposing higher duties on the Japanese products.\nBut the Japanese added calculating and memory features to their typewriters, thus changing the product classification to one not covered by the dumping order.\nThe Smith Corona provision, sponsored by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, would help Smith Corona, which manufactures in Cortland, N.Y., obtain dumping duties against ''later-developed typewriters.''\nBut most changes involve tariff suspensions to help a domestic industry dependent on materials not made in this country. Gumball Trinkets\nOne of the largest price reductions could come on gumball-machine trinkets. Tariffs on the jewelry and small toys wrapped in the plastic balls had been levied at up to 30 percent of the import price of the product itself. That duty would end. Before the gumball provision was added to the bill, one Senate aide noted, it had to be established that these products are made only outside the United States, in such countries as China, Taiwan and Bangladesh."

It lashed the West Bengal-Bangladesh coastline on Wednesday evening and prevailed till the early hours of Thursday. Hundreds and thousands have been displaced, homes destroyed, trees uprooted, embankments smashed, electricity and telephone lines, dykes and croplands damaged, and numerous villages inundated by the cyclone's tidal surges. The government has estimated the damage from cyclone Amphan is to the tune of Tk1,100 crore with some 26 districts hit, said State Minister for Disaster Management, Enamur Rahman.  Some 1,100 kilometres of roads, and 200 bridges and culverts under local government have been damaged, said official sources. The Water Development Board reported that 150 kilometres of embankments were seriously damaged while another 84 dams developed cracks,\" state minister said. 3,000 electric poles damaged in south-western regions  Three thousand electric poles of the power division have sustained damage in the southwestern regions of Bangladesh, where cyclone Amphan first made contact, said West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited (WZPDC) Managing Director, Engineer Shafiq Uddin.  \"We will start repair work as soon as possible,\" he added. WZPDC Executive Director Engineer Abu Hasan said: \"Two transformers of the Kushtia power grid short circuited around 10pm on Wednesday, cutting power to the district. The electricity supply remained suspended till Thursday. We are trying to tap into the closest alternative source to supply Kushtia with electricity.\"  Engineer Altaf Hossain, senior general manager of Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board, Khulna, said: \"A total of 316,000 customers lost electricity in eight upazilas of the district. We have 600 workers on the ground who will start repair work as soon as possible.\" 70km embankment damaged in Khulna Seventy kilometres of the 121km embankment that was built to protect Khulna from typhoons and cyclones, have been either completely or partially damaged.  Palash Kumar Banarjee, executive engineer for the water development board, Khulna-2, said: \"10km of the embankment completely collapsed, while 60km of the embankment are partially damaged.\"  As a result, low lying unions are completely submerged in saline water, putting thousands of people in jeopardy, he added. Mostajibul Hoque, an affected local of Koyra upazila, said: \"Since Aila last wreaked havoc on the embankments, the WDB hasn't been able to repair the damage completely in the last decade. Without a sustainable embankment, lives will always be at risk.\"  Khulna 6 MP, Akhtaruzzaman Babu, said: \"Koyra upazila was severely affected and inundated when 10km of the 121km-long embankment collapsed. Another 40km of the embankment were partially damaged as well. Approximately Tk50 crore worth of fish was washed away in the flood.\" Satkhira farmers count crores in losses   Satkhira farmers have suffered huge losses in crops and fish as the cyclone levelled fields and tidal surges flooded fish enclosures. Satkhira Deputy Commissioner SM Mostafa Kamal held a press briefing on the loss to lives and property in the district. He said: \"As many as 12,257 fish enclosures and ponds on 13,477 hectares in 12 unions of seven upazilas have been flooded. Fish, including 1,677 tons of whitefish and 2,531 tons of shrimp, worth over approximately Tk176 crore, was washed away.  Also, approximately Tk137 crore of crops, fruits and vegetables on over 5,000 hectares was also lost in the district, he added. 1,500 shrimp enclosures flooded in Mongla  1500 shrimp enclosures have been flooded by recent tidal surges in Mongla of Bagerhat. Also, 125 homes were completely damaged and 325 homes partially damaged, while numerous trees were uprooted.  Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Rahat Mannan said: \"Risky embankments in Kanainagar, Kalatala, and Sundartala have collapsed, flooding many houses and fish enclosures.\" Magura suffers Tk100crore in damage It is initially estimated that cyclone Amphan has caused a total damage of over Tk100 crore in loss of homes, domestic animals, and crops. Magura Deputy Commissioner Dr Ashraful Alam said: \"Cyclone Amphan has caused huge losses in the district which is yet to be calculated accurately. But we estimate it is over Tk100 crore.\"  "

In an open joint letter to the Bangladesh prime minister, the organizations said such measures pose threat to the safety and well-being of the refugees as well as Bangladesh host communities and aid workers. Posted on Human Rights Watch website on Wednesday, the letter was signed by Amnesty International, Arakan Rohingya National Organisation, Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, British Rohingya Community UK, Canadian Burmese Rohingya Organization, Harvard Law School International Human Rights Clinic, among others. The letter said that as the Covid-19 pandemic spreads to Bangladesh, unrestricted access to information via mobile and internet communications is crucial for slowing the transmission of the disease and saving the lives of refugees, humanitarian workers, and the general population of Bangladesh. \"Lifting restrictions will not only enable community health workers to quickly share and receive the most reliable and up-to-date guidance during this evolving pandemic but will also help in coordination with community leaders. We urge you to ensure refugees, local communities, and aid workers alike can freely access mobile and internet communications, in the interest of protecting human rights and public health,\" the letter noted. It also mentioned that since September 2019, Bangladesh authorities have prevented Rohingya refugees from obtaining SIM Cards and directed telecommunications operators to restrict internet coverage in Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar District.  \"These restrictions should be lifted in light of the government's recommendation to those experiencing Covid-19 symptoms to contact the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, hotline. Without a phone or SIM Card, abiding by this instruction is impossible,\" it added. Furthermore, the signatory organizations mentioned that without access to mobile and internet communications, aid workers and others will be forced to deliver critical health information in person, heightening their risk of exposure to Covid-19 and slowing the effectiveness of the response. Bangladesh government has so far reported 6 deaths and 56 infected by Covid-19.  The fast spreading coronavirus, which was first reported in China's Wuhan, has infected more than 936,100 people and claimed above 47,200 lives across 203 countries and territories and two international conveyances, according to Worldometer. Globally, a total of 194,578 infected people have also recovered from Covid-19, a pandemic announced by the World Health Organization (WHO). Read the full letter here"

Officials warned that thousands could die before help arrived.\nThey said the number of known deaths from floods, snakebites and disease rose to a minimum of 520; however, unofficial estimates put the toll at more than 1,000.\nDoctors warned that thousands of families taking shelter in relief camps in Dhaka, huddling on river embankments or clinging to their flooded homes, are threatened by starvation and disease.\nAs the flooding disaster grew worse, pledges of foreign aid continued. Japan, responding to an appeal for international assistance, pledged $13 million today, Bangladesh's press agency said. Pakistan, the United States, Britain and Australia have already promised nearly $1.5 million in rice and cash.\nOfficials here point out, though, that supplies from abroad cannot reach the country in quantities until Dhaka airport can be reopened. It has been closed to international flights since Friday when the runway was flooded."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-01-15 00:00:00      \nNew FM's foreign tour to begin with India Bangladesh and India will hold the next round of foreign minister-level bilateral talks in the first week of February, aiming to take the relations between the two countries to newer heights. The meeting - 5th Joint Consultative Commission (JCC) - will be held in New Delhi, paving the way for new Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen to make his maiden foreign tour to India after formation of the new government, reports UNB. A preparatory inter-ministerial meeting is scheduled to be held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday to finalize  5th JCC agenda. Foreign Secretary M Shahidul Haque will preside over the meeting. The representatives of relevant ministries, divisions, and agencies will attend the meeting. The 4th Joint Consultative Commission between Bangladesh and India, led by former Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali and Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj respectively, was held in October 2017. The 5th JCC meeting, once the date is set, will review progress made in areas such as trade and investment, security, connectivity, border management, power, energy, shipping, and people-to-people exchanges, said a diplomatic source. The two countries will also discuss common challenges and find ways on how the two friendly countries, along with other like-minded nations can continue fighting the scourge of terrorism, extremism, and radicalisation, the source indicates. The Rohingya issue might come up for discussions as well during the meeting. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Momen on Monday said he will make his maiden visit as the Foreign Minister to New Delhi as India has invited him. \"India is our neighbour and friendly country and we have a warm relationship\" he said, without giving any date and purpose of his India trip. Earlier, acting High Commissioner of India to Bangladesh, Dr Adarsh Swaika, met the new Foreign Minister of Bangladesh and handed over a letter of congratulations from the External Affairs Minister of India, Sushma Swaraj. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the first among global leaders to congratulate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after her party, Awami League's absolute victory in the December 30 elections. Prime Minister Modi expressed confidence that the partnership between Bangladesh and India will continue to flourish under her \"farsighted\" leadership. He also reiterated the priority India attaches to Bangladesh as a neighbour, a close partner for regional development, security and cooperation, and a central pillar in India's ''Neighbourhood First\" policy."

      "text": "Amid Bhutan's Peaks, Rituals And Temples\n1987-10-11T05:00:00.000Z\nCradled in a great sling of the southern Himalayas, the ancient Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan is held separate by its formidable mountains. To east and west are Indian hill states, to the south the plains of India and to the north the bleak and merciless Chomo Lhari range, an expanse of ice and sky, is the barricade of the Himalayans shouldering the Tibetan plateau.\nIsolated for centuries and ignored except for the odd British traveler (for traveler, read spy), never conquered, Druk Yul, as the inhabitants call it, opened its doors a crack in 1974 for the coronation of King Jigme Singye Wangchuk, who sits on the throne of a constitutional monarchy established in the 20th century.\nWith a painted dragon on its tail, the fully loaded prop-jet, a Dornier 228 with 16 passengers, soared over isolated ponds of water remaining on the plains at the end of autumn last year. Brown hills thrust up abruptly, rolling high into a horizon of snowy peaks above the valley of the Wang Chu. The cockpit windshield turned into a wide screen of cloudless blue, framing a growing shaft of white -Chomo Lhari, a 23,997-foot sentinel on the Tibetan frontier. One turn, left, and a dzong, or Buddhist center, came into focus. Crammed into a mountain, it overlooked ripe plots of grain stepping down into Paro valley where a clear tumbling stream carried Chomo Lhari's snow melt.\nAt the single modern airstrip in Paro, our assigned guides waited. One of them, Pema Dorji, a member of an exclusive breed of guides, wore a kho, the long, national robe of finely woven, sturdy striped cloth, hiked up to skirt length. Knowledgeable guides and drivers are part of the arrangements required by the Bhutan Tourism Corporation and are paid for in advance. They are prompt, which counts in a country where auto rentals are not permitted.\nAfter the torpid agonies of Indian customs and immigration, Bhutanese entrance formalities are simple. English is spoken here, the legacy of a future-thinking King, father of the present King, who declared English mandatory in the free and compulsory schools. Children run up to ask, ''Hello, are you from San Francisco? New York?'' Older people, however, speak only the national tongue, Dzongkha, a member of the Tibetan family of languages.\nAt just under 7,000 feet in Paro Valley, the Olathang (Plain of the Black Raven) Hotel sprawls over a hill in the shape of a two-story numeral 4. The bar and dining rooms were brimming with small parties of Europeans, including haggard Belgian trekkers who had come by the tortuous land route from Phuntsholing on the southwest border, and a British climbing team. At dinner, several guides and a tall young man named Isup discussed the British effort to climb and film Bhutan's loftiest peak, Gangker Phunsom (White Glacier of the Spiritual Brothers), 24,600 feet and never conquered. They had come in autumn, the clearest season, yet the spirits of the snow peaks were not to favor them.\nIn the Paro Valley you enter the Bhutanese orbit - the mesmerizing, dimly lighted and incense-suffused temples and dzongs where golden Buddhas gleam in the light of butter lamps and symbols or paintings of saints or goblins loom from flickering walls.\nTo begin a series of visits to dzongs, the day we arrived we took the road to Rimpong Dzong and Ta Dzong. Once a fortress watchtower protecting Rimpong, Ta Dzong is now a museum for dust-laden sacred masks, costumes, paintings and cultural exhibits. Its bloody past was revealed when its round tower wall was broken open for renovation: sharpened lances were discovered, up-ended and embedded in the floor, a jumble of bones heaped on the floor - warriors impaled when they were tossed into the stone-block column by Tibetans.\nThe bones are gone, but your flashlight picks up the lances as you go down bulky circular steps. Upstairs, on the third floor, past sculptured lumps of yak butter carved into Buddhas, is a fairy-tale menagerie of stuffed animals: the serow, a sort of goat; blue sheep; great hornbills; the mythical snow leopard; a standing Himalayan bear with sharp white V on its chest; the mithun, a gigantic cow, and, best of all, the rare golden takin, with the head of a goat, body of a cow and cloven feet. Live ones are in the capital at Thimphu, behind the temple.\nBelow the hill on which the fortress is situated, a monotonous buzz wafted from Rimpong (Heaps of Jewels) Dzong, which is now a monk's school of the Drukpa sect. Five hundred boys wrapped in maroon cloth hunched over parchment books, fingers following the sacred scriptures, as young monks tapped out the rhythm of their drone with decorated sticks.\nTouring Bhutan takes stamina: there are hills, and steep stairs and broad ladders (some at 60-degree angles) in dzongs and lhakhangs. Every time you enter a sanctuary, shoes come off; tying them up several times a day took some getting used to. Pema eyed mine carefully. Big-name exercise shoes made in America are esteemed; the imported Asian brands rapidly fall apart under the demands of the Bhutanese terrain, several guides said. The next morning, we were scheduled to take a trek up to Taktsang, or Tiger's Nest Dzong, which is 10,000 feet above sea level. There, according to legend, Guru Rimpoche (Precious Teacher), Bhutan's patron saint who is considered the Second Buddha, arrived from Tibet around the year 800 astride a flying tigress, landing on the precipice where Taktsang now clings.\nI peered up the nearly perpendicular craggy track and declined to go, even though a water carrier trudged by, large biscuit tin strapped to his back - a sign of good luck. Sometimes ponies make the trek though none were available that day. However, I was already at 7,000 feet, and it seemed unwise to go higher less than 24 hours since I left sea level at Calcutta.\nInstead it seemed a good moment to buy something special of Bhutan: postage stamps. Round, square, triangular, three-dimensional, large, small, in vivid rainbow colors, they are treasures of philately; there are silk stamps and even one made of steel. Across the river from town the postman clambered off his basking rock in the morning sun. With Pema conferring, I chose stamps with the Druk Yul thunder dragon, mystic symbols, masked dancers, the yeti (a living legend in Bhutan), dzongs, Himalayan animals and special editions picturing the King. Daily life is molded by Buddhism -prayer wheels turn, flags flutter, chortens containing sacred relics dot the countryside and dzongs or lhkhangs dominate villages -yet the fun-loving Bhutanese are devoted to humor and find it in anomalies. Among the stamps, for example, were several depictions of Donald Duck.\nNext day, the light was pale, the air crisp; an afternoon breeze had begun and cold descended on Paro Valley around 4 P.M. The driver, Chookie Wangchuk, unflappable and perpetually upbeat, maneuvered precipitous roads past wood-trimmed, three-story farmhouses with chili peppers drying on rooftops. All the homes looked prosperous in this country of 1.3 million, Asia's only underpopulated country.\nWe drove 11 miles up to Drukyel (Victorious Druk), a 17th-century dzong built to repel warring Tibetans. It was desolate now, a spooky, windy, charred place ravaged by fire some 30 years ago. A climb to its ramparts reveals Chomo Lhari, throne of the goddess of the same name, Still on the valley road, Chookie whisked off his cap as the Queen Mother sped by. We drove to Dungtse Lhakhang, home of a legendary Divine Mad Man who hides from demons in the nose of a god. A rascal saint beloved for shocking behavior, he is believed eternal, speaking to high lamas from his lofty hiding place. A caretaker opened the door with a scythe, revealing a creepy place of butter lamps, shakti sculptures and wafting incense. I was alone, Pema unseen, his voice breaking the eerie quiet. Climbing two steep ladders, my flashlight picked up paintings of 1,000 Buddhas spiraling up the circular walls. At the top, I rang its mournful bell, the single reverberating bong the only reward for negotiating the ladders.\nFrom there, we went to Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan since 1955. In this country you must go south to arrive north. Long north-south populated valleys dominate the land, each separated by a wilderness of mountains penetrable only on foot. Above the Paro Chu, or river, a road squiggles south to the confluence with the Wang Chu, fed by waters of Chomo Lhari. Across a bridge the road then staggers north to the capital. It is wide enough to pass - with care - as Bhutanese drivers in trucks and Jeeps politely make way.\nThimphu, with a population something over 20,000, nestles in a fertile valley at 7,600 feet. The Motithang Hotel is the tourism council's usual choice for visitors. The view of the valley is wide and wonderful, the rooms luxurious by local terms, with reliable electricity, plenty of hot water, and tasty curries. But it is high atop a hill, too far from town, and there is no shuttle. So, I prefer the smaller Bhutan Hotel at the upper end of the town road.\nWhile amenities are fewer (and the electricity less reliable), you can wander into town on your own, peek into dim shops selling cloth or serving yak butter tea and spirits, buy a bottle of Bhutanese rum or sweet liqueur, and visit the few modern arcade shops in the center of town. If you care to invest in something rare and tempting, buy huge beads of polished, glowing Tibetan coral, some the size of an apricot.\nThe Swiss Bakery, just back from the main road, with its big white on red sign, is a clean, international gathering spot of jumbled decor. Two counters sell cakes and sandwiches. Downtown, the Bhutan Hotel is where the action is. On starry nights the bar is lively; conversations among visitors, government officials, guides or a resident United Nations technician - male and female - are spontaneous. In the egalitarian society of Bhutan, women hold major government offices and marry and divorce as they choose (divorce is common).\nAt the Motihang Hotel, in a vigorous display of whirl and leap, skirts billowing and hands moving in the timeless gestures of Buddhist legend, masked dancers of the Royal Dance troupe performed. As heroes pierced clouds of ignorance with swords and vanquished stag-masked demons, good triumphed over evil to the accompaniment of cymbals, drums and gongs. Long horns blared on the sunny garden lawn, and visitors crept around snapping pictures.\nFive miles from town at the valley entrance, Simtokha Dzong tops a bluff. It is Bhutan's oldest dzong, built in 1627 by a man who exercized an extraordianry impact on the land. Nawang Namgyal, a Tibetan Drukpa (red hat) lama seeking refuge from the Gelugpa (yellow hat) sect, crossed into Bhutan in 1616, only to find differing Buddhist schools and rampant political disunity. With support from powerful families he built a series of fortress-monasteries (all of Bhutan's dzongs) and threw back repeated invasions of Tibetans. On final victory in 1639 he assumed the title of Shabdung (At Whose Feet One Submits), becoming the temporal and spiritual ruler of his adopted country, the first leader of unified Bhutan.\nState engravings surround the central tower of Simtokha and, inside,a vivid mandala painting depicts the death of the greedy: With inflated stomachs and thin, twisted necks, this mob or mortals cannot eat. Eternally condemned, their mouths emit fire. Sunday is market day in Thimphu. I left Pema and Chookie to wade into a babbling crowd of cloth-and produce-sellers and sippers of toom, a local alcohol, plopped among shoes, wool socks and plates from China, crude silver jewelry and finely woven traditional belts (kera), narrow for men and wide for women, that are worn with the kho and the khira (woman's robe). Bargaining was minimal.\nPema kept his mandatory white silk scarf in the car. Scarves, in a rainbow of color depending on official rank, are signs of respect - saffron is worn only by the King and the Je Khenpo, or head abbott. Pema wore his white scarf out of respect for Tashicho Dzong, which is the seat of the elected assembly, or Tshog Dhu, and also of the Je Khenop. The dzong is a great pile of stone with 100 rooms on the banks of the Wang Chu. In the assembly chamber a throne for the King faces a huge Buddha, with two large eggs on its altar. Many believe they are eggs of the thunder dragon; Pema says they're ostrich. The Tshog Dhu was not in session, so pedaldriven sewing machines were in the room; monks are never idle.\nDon't miss archery, practiced everywhere; the national sport is a passion. I joined a crowd watching finals of the national tournament. The King had come. From his private viewing stand he was intent on the shooting - at 4-by-1-foot targets 150 yards away. (When Bhutan participated in the Olympics for the first time at Los Angeles, the team complained that the targets were too near.) Each time a steel-tipped arrow whacked onto the target someone struck a gong and the whole team broke into wild dance.\nEach of the four days in the capital turned colder. A small electric soil heater fended off early morning chill until sunshine filled my hotel room. The trip to Punakha, lowest of the central valleys at 4,000 feet, was to be another Bhutanese upside-down route - cossing Dochu La (pass) at 10,218 feet - a two and a half hour drive not counting a stop at the summit to see, with lunch, Gangker Phunsom in a clear panorama of snowy Himalaya.\nThe road curled up toward a mantle of slumping cloud, About half-way, at the foreign registry and checkpost, Pema handed over papers. Though we drove completely around a shrine atop Dochu La, no break came in the clouds; I could not see Gangker Phunsom. The road uncoiled, down into sunny warmth where bananas and oranges grew in a valley still green in November.\nQuietness enfold all who enter Punakha, the ancient capital where the Je Khenpo takes up winter residence alongside strange waters. Where the Mo Chu and the Po Chu (male and female) burble into confluence, instead of clear icy blue streams, a wide swift current of opaque milky-turquoise bolts down the valley, its source glacial rather than melted snow. Below a swinging bridge leading to the dzong, an otter played and fished. Bhutanese stay away. The current is frightening; anyway, trout belong to the King.\nA porter squeezed by me on the bridge, hunched under a large packing crate bearing the stamp of a Japanese manufacturer. Someone said this television was for new quarters of the Je Khenpo, whose aprtments went up in smoke last winter, the charred debris left undisturbed. Dzongs have long histories of fire - the culprits are usually butter lamps caught by wind, or portable electric heaters. Whoever was to have the TV, there is no television in Bhutan. Thimphu has a video shop.\nDendup Tshering was in his Thimphu office. The B.T.C. operations manager said general visitors are discovering Bhutan. However, a selection of hotels is a long way away and government travel arrangements will continue for 10 more years. There are no restrictions on individual travel. Dendup worries about the no-tipping policy - handouts of money, ballpens, gum, candy and medicines are discouraged. During my visit, the battle was not lost. When you go, though it's a dictum difficult to follow, don't tip. A gift of wool socks is a good thing.\nTo date, values immersed in Buddhist ritual and tradition are in balance with technological innovations. That they not become casualties - transformed from cultural supports into market goods - is an old struggle and, up in their aerie, Bhutanese are holding their own. For travelers, Bhutan's combination of wilderness landscapes, ritual color amid spooky dzongs, and its impish gleeful style may be habit-forming. PLANNING A TRIP TO THE KINGDOM CALLED DRUK YUL Getting There\nBecause travelers are limited to prepaid 8- to 18-day regularly scheduled tours for individuals or for groups of six or more, directed by the Bhutan Tourism Corporation, most visitors put Bhutan on a larger itinerary, including India or Hong Kong.\nOnly Druk Air flies to Bhutan. Calcutta is now the launching point for group tours. Individual packages depart Thursdays and Sundays from Dacca, Bangladesh, which has good international connections and clearance procedures. Departures from New Delhi with a larger aircraft are scheduled to begin late this year. All international tourism is funneled throught the Bhutan Tourism Corporation (Post Office Box 159, Thimphu, Bhutan) and booked through travel agents; prices are set by tour operators. It takes about a month to get through the paperwork, so allow enough time. You'll receive a voucher acknowledging payment and entry; keep it safe because it will be matched with an official list before flight tickets are issued at the departure counter. The $20 visa fee is paid at entry (U.S. dollars or traveler's checks only).\nJourney to Druk Yul is an 8-day tour available from the B.T.C. It costs $1,150 a person including meals and round-trip air fare Dacca-Paro. All ground transportation is by modern minibus or car. Travel to Tongsa and Bumthang in central Bhutan is 10 days to 2 weeks and prices are set by tour operators: the tourist corporation will suggest names of companies. Be prepared for a 7- to 8-hour corkscrew drive to Bumthang to simple but adequate accommodations for up to 30 in bungalows grouped around a main building containing dining room, common room and showers.\nMarch through May and September through November are peak seasons with many festivals and clear and sunny weather; the cold begins around 4 P.M. Some travelers like the summer monsoon time, when light rains once or twice a day break up sunshine, pheasants migrate north and slightly lower off-season rates are in effect. Winters are sunny and clear too, and cold. The finals of the national archery tournament at Thimphu are in early November. What to Take\nThis is jeans and slacks country, with a down or wool jacket needed at night. Temperatures vary a lot between day and night, so layer your clothing. I found a flannel shirt useful to throw on in the cool dzongs. Tennis or jogging shoes will be the only footwear you'll use; dressing up for dinner isn't required. Don't forget a flashlight; keep it in your pocket all the time to study artwork and identify stairs. If your shoulder or camera bag is heavy, the guide will carry it safely. If you plan to take a video camera, be sure the B.T.C. is alerted. Lodging and Dining\nFull-service hotels are clean and comfortable, but American sanitary standards do not apply. Water heaters are large, and linen is plentiful. Electricity (240-volt) is fairly reliable, and the telephone system works pretty well. Hearty buffet meals are the norm, in a melange of Continental and Himalayan styles. There are fresh crunchy vegetables, noodles, chicken, mutton and pork, all lightly spiced; there are very hot Bhutanese curries too. Tea and coffee are served steaming hot in thermos containers (which you can have in your room). Bhutanese rice, called red though it is really pink, is delicious.\nIn addition to the new main building at the Olathang in Paro, bungalows are scattered amid gardens, each with two suites, a central parlor and uninterrupted views of the mountains. At Thimphu the Bhutan Hotel has a separate annex; the Motithang is more elaborate. There is a canteen in the rear of the Bhutan's main building: For a quick pickup, a croissant is 25 cents and ice cream 35 cents. I walked to the Druk Hotel in town one evening, an Indian place for businessmen, to soak up the Thimphu scene even though dinner was prepaid at my own hotel. Shopping\nShopping is small-scale. At the Government Handicrafts Emporium in Thimphu handwoven fabrics are attractive; the keras (belts) are $4 to $10. Price ranges for a kho or khira are from $22 for the plain woven cotton to $425 for a weaving of silk and gold. A felt shoulder bag with embroidered mask is $21; a carved frame in blue pine with a thunder dragon design (for a 5-by-7 picture) is $44; papier-mache and cloth masks $27. The block printed greeting cards are appealing, and are about 20 cents each. There are rice bowls, baskets, silver jewelery, paintings on cloth and yak-hair caps. Antiques are not sold.\nTshering Dolkar has turquoise, amber and gleaming coral beads in all sizes at Shop No. 5, Upper Market, Thimphu. Coral beads start at $8 each - some weigh in at nearly a pound for $1,500 each. At the privately owned woodcarving center in Woochu, Paro, the smooth-grained eri-wood rice bowls are well made, from $4; also have a look at spooky painted masks with little skulls on top to scare off devils, about $9.\nThe best place to buy stamps is at Thimphu post office. Sets, somewhat overpriced, are sold at hotels.\nThe ngultrum is the same value as the Indian rupee - the exchange rate of each is about 13 to the dollar - and the rupee is accepted everywhere. Credit cards are not recognized in Bhutan. Trekking\nTrekking is directed by the Bhutan Tourism Corporation. Year-round treks range from easy to difficut for periods of four days to nearly a month and include guides, cooks, equipment and pack animals. Again, prices are set by tour operators and the tourism office will suggest names of companies to accommodate groups and individuals. Depending on the tour operator, trekkers often come in by the land route via Phuntsoling. (Indian transit permits are required and take two months to obtain. A multiple entry visa is preferable.) One virgin peak is opened every two years for mountaineering expeditions; applications are taken a year in advance. M. T."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-21 00:00:00      \nCommuters, farmers, businessmen suffered a lot though central transport leaders called off strike The bus strike that crippled the southern and other districts around the country for the past three days was called off early Thursday after the government assured considering their demands. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal announced that the strike was called off around 1am on Thursday, after a four-hour-long meeting among the representatives of the Bangladesh Truck-covered-van Goods Transport Owner-Worker Unity Council, Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association and Bangladesh Bus-Truck Owners Association at his residence in Dhanmondi. Despite the minister's assurance, bus owners and workers continued the strike in several parts of the country on Thursday. In Jamalpur, normal transportation has not yet resumed on every route till filing of this report around 6pm. The workers of the Dhanbari area were restricting the movement of vehicles on the Jamalpur-Dhaka route in the evening. On condition of anonymity, one of the Jamalpur Bus-Minibus Workers Union leaders said they had discussed the issue with the transport workers, and plying of passengers on the route would soon return to normal. In Dinajpur, normal transportation services have resumed on the Hili-Bogra route since Thursday morning after the workers were assured that their demands would be met. Confirming the resumption of transportation services, Public Relations Officer Sohrab Hossain of the Hili Land Port said transporting of goods was hampered for the last five days, but normalcy returned as soon as the workers pull out their strike. In Jhenaidah, commuters were forced to use banned three wheelers as hundreds of buses were left in a frozen state at the Kaliganj central bus terminal as the strike was still in force. In Khulna, the same situation prevailed as no inter-district buses left the terminal.  Khulna Motor Workers Union General Secretary Md Ziaur Rahman Mithu said the Bus Owners-Workers Federation presented a draft proposal to the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges for amending the newly enacted Road Transport Act. In Chuadanga, no passenger buses and goods-carriers left the city on Thursday.  Local vegetable farmers and businessmen expressed fear of huge financial losses as they could not dispatch their goods to different parts of the country. In Naogaon, transport workers have continued their strike for the fourth successive day. When asked why they were continuing the strike, local bus driver Sumon said: \"We did not enforce the strike after consultation with the central leaders. The problem is ours, so we will not call off the strike based on their decision.\" In Narail, commuters had to suffer a lot as no buses left the station. Moreover, they had to count extra money and time for commuting in three wheelers. In Satkhira, although bus services remained suspended, a limited number of trucks were seen plying on the roads. Businessmen of the Bhomra port had to pay twice the usual amount to ship their goods due to the scarcity of trucks. In Tangail, transportation services remained suspended for the second consecutive day on the Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway. Three wheelers were charging extra and long route commuters were opting for trains due to the scarcity of buses. In Kurigram, commuters had to face distress due to the continued strike. Even the transport workers assaulted the drivers of the three wheelers near the central bus terminal.  One of the workers said they will not allow the plying of any transport from the terminal. Later, a police team went to the spot to handle the situation, said Kurigram sadar police station Officer-in-Charge Mahfujur Rahman. In Benapole, government and businessmen of the area had to face huge losses due to the halt in transportation. Benapole Sonali Bank Manager Rakibul Islam said the Benapole Customs was deprived of collecting almost Tk100 crore revenue as the import of goods came to a halt due to the strike and the amount will increase if the strike continues. In Sherpur, transport workers stayed off the road for the fourth consecutive day, causing immense sufferings to commuters. No long route buses and goods-laden vehicles were seen plying on the roads since morning. In Faridpur, activities at the river port came to a halt as the district's truck workers refrained from transporting goods in accordance with the strike. The strike has left several thousand porters and labourers at the port without work while causing suffering to passengers and businessmen.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-06 00:00:00      \nSoleimani's remains and those of five other Iranians - all Guards members - killed in the US drone strike had arrived at Ahvaz airport before dawn Mourners flooded the Iranian cities of Ahvaz and Mashhad on Sunday, weeping and beating their chests in homage to top general Qasem Soleimani who was killed in a US strike in Baghdad. Soleimani's remains and those of five other Iranians - all Guards members - killed in the US drone strike had arrived at Ahvaz airport before dawn, news agency ISNA said. With them were the remains of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary umbrella group, who was also killed in the US strike. Soleimani's remains arrived in Mashhad in the afternoon and are due to be flown to Tehran for more tributes on on Sunday evening. Today, Khamenei is expected to pray over Soleimani's remains at Tehran University before a procession to Azadi Square. His remains are then due to be taken to the holy city of Qom for a ceremony at Masumeh shrine, ahead of a funeral tomorrow in his hometown Kerman. 'Death to America' \"Death to America,\" mourners chanted as they packed Ahvaz's streets and a long bridge spanning a river in the southwestern city to receive the casket containing Soleimani's remains. As Shia chants resonated in the air, people held portraits of the man seen as a hero of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and for spearheading Iran's Middle East operations as commander of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force. In the northeastern city of Mashhad, scores took to streets around the Imam Reza shrine and, addressing the US, chanted \"Be afraid of your own shadow.\" Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike on Friday near Baghdad airport, shocking the Islamic republic. He was 62. The attack was ordered by President Donald Trump, who said the Quds commander had been planning an \"imminent\" attack on US diplomats and forces in Iraq.  Soleimani's assassination ratcheted up tensions between arch-enemies Tehran and Washington and sparked fears of a new Middle East war. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed \"severe revenge\" and declared three days of mourning. 'Terrorist in a suit'  Iran's top diplomat Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that \"targeting cultural sites is a WAR CRIME.\" For Iran's army chief, Trump's threat was an attempt to distract the world from Soleimani's \"unjustifiable\" assassination. \"I doubt they have the courage to initiate\" a conflict, said Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi. Iran's communications minister, Mohammad Javad Jahromi, branded Trump a \"terrorist in a suit\" and said in a tweet that he is \"like IS, like Hitler, like Genghis (Khan)! They all hate cultures.\" US-Iran tensions escalated in 2018 when Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark accord that gave Tehran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program. A year on, Iran began hitting back by reducing its nuclear commitments with a series of steps every 60 days, the most recent deadline passing on Saturday. Cyber attack  In possible act of retaliation, hackers claiming to be from Iran breached the website of a little-known US government agency and threatened more cyber attacks. The website of the Federal Depository Library Program was replaced with a page titled \"Iranian Hackers!\" that displayed images of Khamenei and the Islamic republic's flag."

In Bhuapur upazila of Tangail, the situation has taken a serious turn as the Jamuna has been eroding hundreds of dwellings and vast tracts of croplands along its banks, reports our correspondent in Tangail. Inhabitants in the area have been living in anxiety of losing their houses and properties to the river's erosion in the last one month. The worst affected villages are Khanurbari, Kostapara and Bhalkutia under Govindasi union where over 300 dwellings and a large swathe of croplands have disappeared in the Jamuna over the last three weeks. A large number of the affected people from the villages have taken shelter on different roads and houses of others. Last week, Firoza Bewa, a widow with four children, lost her house on eight decimals of land in Kostapara village to the erosion. Since then, they have been living in a makeshift structure by the river. \"My husband, a rickshaw-van puller, died in cardiac arrest few months ago. Now where will I go with my children? Who will give us shelter?\" wondered Firoza. Many others like her are now living in the open after losing everything including their crops and belongings to the river. Jhoton Chanda, upazila nirbahi officer in Bhuapur, said, \"We are preparing a list of the erosion victims in order to provide them with necessary assistance.\" Meanwhile, Water Development Board (WDB) workers were seen dumping geotextile bags along a 75-meter-long stretch at Khanurbari village. Obhijit Ghosh, a resident of Kostapara village, said finding the steps taken by the WDB inadequate for checking the erosion, villagers in many areas were seen dumping bags filled with dirt.   Contacted, Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of WDB in Tangail, said water in the Jamuna was flowing 15 centimetres above danger level at Bhuapur point yesterday. \"Since it's tough to get a big project passed, we are taking smaller projects in phases to check the erosion. Preparations are ongoing to dump geo bags along another 75 meters of the affected area,\" he added. In Faridpur, at least 11 houses and 2,000 bighas of croplands were lost to erosion of the Arial Kha river in five villages of Sadarpur upazila in the last three days, reports our correspondent in the district. The affected villages are Amir Khanar Kandi, Zajira Kandi, Charbondorkhola, Kazi Kandi and Adel Uddin Mollah Kandi village in Char Manair union. Ayub Ali, chairman of Char Manair Union Parishad, said the erosion of the river started last Friday and so far, at least 11 houses and 2,000 bighas of croplands were devoured. Although the WDB in Faridpur has been dumping geo bags to check the erosion, strong current of the river is washing those away. Even the building of Char Manair Union Parishad and Char Bandarkhola Madrasa are now under erosion threat, he added. Kulsum Bibi, an elderly resident of Zajira Kandi village, said, \"The rampage of the Arial Kha has distressed us enormously. The river has devoured our ancestral homestead.\" After losing 10 bighas of land to the erosion, Kamal Hawladar, another resident of the same village, said he and his family were bracing for further sufferings in future. Kazi Kandi village resident Abdul Karim Hawladar said in only two days' time, the river devoured 20 bighas of his land. Sadarpur Upazila Nirbahi Officer Purobi Goldar said the higher authorities were made aware of the situation. She also said, \"WDB has been dumping geo bags in the affected areas and we engaged an officer from our upazila administration [to oversee the work].\" WDB Executive Engineer in Faridpur Sultan Mahmud said as a temporary measure to contain the erosion as well as ease sufferings of people, they have been dumping geo bags in affected areas."

To transform these plans into reality Green Delta Insurance Company Limited and its distribution channel partner OXFAM Bangladesh and local associate Sancred Welfare Foundation (SWF) have insured 316 Farmers of Tahirpur, Sunamganj area under Index-Based Crop Insurance recently as a pilot basis, says a press release. Several integrated plans and activities have been going on for a while now, at the direction of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina under the supervision of the Financial Institutions Department of the Ministry of Finance to stand by the farmers who are at risk of financial loss in flood-prone Haor areas. To mitigate the risks of the farmers of the Haor area arising from excessive rainfall and river flood Green Delta will provide this insurance service to the farmers from April 28 to May 28 while converting the crop losses into fatal financial risks for them. In case of crop damage under this insurance, the insured farmers can get the insurance claim depending on the extent of excess rainfall and the height and stability of the floodwater causing by river flood. In the case of river flood, if the water level if above 6.8 meters and in case of excess rainfall if it rains 125 millimeters in 3 consecutive days the insured farmers will receive maximum Tk12,000 depending on total loss and duration of the flood. In August last year, Green Delta Insurance Company, with the support of Oxfam and SKS Foundation, provided index-based crop insurance to 650 farmers in Fulchhari and Saghata areas of Gaibandha."

C. S. Hameed said Colombo welcomed the step.\nThe offer came two days after Indian transport planes with fighter escorts, on only 35 minutes' notice to Colombo, dropped food parcels over the Jaffna Peninsula, the stronghold of armed Tamil rebels who have been under Sri Lankan military attack. India, which has a Tamil population of over 50 million, said the supplies were intended for besieged civilians.\nFighting was still going on in the peninsula today. And in southern Sri Lanka seven Tamil prisoners were killed trying to escape from a center housing nearly 4,000 political detainees, the Government said.\nMr. Hameed said in an interview in his office that China and Pakistan had been among the nations offering support to Colombo after the Indian airdrop on Thursday. He called India's actions a ''naked violation of our independence and an unwarranted assault on our territory and sovereignty.'' Attendance at Parley in Doubt\nMr. Hameed said that in the light of the Indian action, Sri Lanka was reconsidering whether or not to attend a ministerial meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, scheduled to be held in New Delhi on June 18-19.\nMost members of the association, which besides India and Sri Lanka includes Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Bhutan, have condemned the Indian air drop.\n''Countries in the region and countries far and wide have expressed concern, expressed sympathy,'' Mr. Hameed said. ''Some have expressed very grave concern, and some countries have even said that if there is a shortage, if there is a need for any assistance, they would be very happy to help us.''\nHe declined to identified the countries offering material assistance. Press reports in the region have mentioned Pakistan.\nMr. Hameed said that last week the Government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi turned down a suggestion from Sri Lanka's President, J. R. Jayewardene, to hold the same kind of talks that New Delhi was proposing today. The proposal for talks came just after Sri Lanka's Navy stopped a flotilla of 19 fishing boats that had been trying to deliver aid.\n''There was no need for the so-called relief assistance,'' Mr. Hameed said. ''Still, my immediate response then was that we were prepared to receive it, and let us work out the modalities of supply and distribution. And they said no. They dodged that request and said the matter was very urgent.'' Indian Warning Recounted\nHe said that the Sri Lankan High Commissioner in New Delhi was summoned to the External Affairs Ministry on Thursday and that ''a demarche of 35 minutes'' was issued. He said the Sri Lankans were told that ''the planes would be accompanied by fighter planes, and should there be any resistance, we will not hesitate to use force.''\n''You are told: I am entering your home, and if you resist we shall use force,'' he added.\nIn the fighting on the Jaffna Peninsula today, according to the Government spokesman, troops engaged in a limited operation around the town of Achuvely that opened a link between two previously captured area. He said one officer, five soldiers and seven guerrillas had been killed.\nSouth of Colombo, the killing of the seven Tamils occurred when a riot erupted Friday night in the largest detention center for political prisoners, near the town of Boosa, according to the spokesman, Tilak Ratnakara.\nHe said 25 detainees had tried to overpower prison guards during dinner. After a struggle, Mr. Ratnakara said, the guards summoned troops, who fired on the would-be escapees. Four soldiers and a prison officer were wounded, one critically."

The furious Jamuna has devoured his home, even the land on which his humble abode stood.  For over a month, Ahed, along with his family of five, and other flood victims, have taken shelter on a nearby field. They all have to pay a small sum of rent to occupy that space as well. \"The water started gushing in by the first week of July. There was no scope to stay back. Now, everything has been washed away. There is no land to rebuild my home and no money to start afresh either,\" he said. Anji Khatun, of nearby Dadaspanchi village, returned from the shelter to see that her home has been damaged. She had no choice but to borrow Tk 20,000 at a high rate of interest from a local money lender to repair her home. \"My daughters and I took shelter in the flood protection embankment for three weeks. Nobody is coming forward to help us, not even the government.\" Anji was lucky that she found someone to borrow money from. But Maleka Begum of Potajia Nishipara village in the same upazila, not so much. No one is willing to lend money to her. Tying up some bamboo sticks with rope, she has repaired her home. The wind or rain can blow away the repairs at any time, she said, as she continues to live perilously. \"My husband is a poor day labourer. He had no work in the last one month. We have no place to live, no food to eat even.\" All the victims said they lost everything in the last three weeks, but they did not get any help for rehabilitation. Md Chand Ali of Potajia village said, \"During the flood, we were given seven to eight kilograms of rice as relief material.\" It was enough to last a week for a family of five. \"We are in dire need of assistance to rebuild our homes.\" Over 3,079 families of 408 villages in five upazilas of Sirajganj were displaced by the recent flood. A total of 15,434 people have been hit hard, while 313,997 people were partially affected, according to Sirajganj Relief and Rehabilitation Office. A total of 6,505 houses were entirely damaged, while 44,013 were partially damaged. \"We have reported these figures to the ministry of relief and rehabilitation. They have allotted 1,570 bundles of corrugated iron sheets to rehabilitate the flood victims. The allotment is likely to reach Sirajganj soon,\" Sirajganj Deputy Commissioner (DC) Dr Faruk Ahmed told the Daily Star recently. Not just home, roads, culverts, croplands, ponds and many educational institutions have been battered by the flood. Officials concerned at the district administration have pinned losses at Tk 200 crore this year. Total actual losses cannot be ascertained yet, as many areas are still under water. \"Although the water level was dropped below the danger level now, flooding has not left yet. There are many areas in Belkuchi, Kazipur, Chowhali and Shahzadpur that are still water logged,\" said Md Rafikul Islam, Sirajganj divisional engineer of Water Development Board. The flood water is likely to remain till the end of September, which will add to the misery of the people in these areas, he added. A total of 21,000 hectares of croplands were inundated and crops on 14,000 hectares were completely damaged, said Md Habibul Haque, deputy director of Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in Sirajganj. He assumes the damage to agriculture to be worth Tk 134 crore. \"The agriculture sector has suffered the most due to the flood. We have submitted the flood loss report to the ministry, seeking rehabilitation funds.\" \"We are currently taking preparations for 30-acre seed beds and 56 floating seed beds in the district to assist the victim farmers after the water recedes,\" he said. Meanwhile, the district has lost eight primary schools to river erosion. There is no existence left of those institutions, said Md. Eusuf Reza, Sirajganj primary education officer. At the same time, 162 primary schools were partially damaged, he added. \"We could not calculate the total loss yet, but we are estimating it at around Tk 1.85 crore.\" All academic activities are stalled since July. \"We hope to resume studies after we complete the repair works after Eid,\" he added. Sirajganj District Educational Officer Md Shafiulla said 65 high schools and colleges have also been damaged. He expects repair work to start soon. Fish cultivation took a hit in Chalanbeel areas of Sirajganj. A total of 116.75 hectares of fishing areas were affected, washing away 110.73 tonnes of fish and 1.27 crore fish fry worth Tk 4.17 crore, said Md Shahed Ali, Sirajganj district fishery officer. \"We are expecting rehabilitation funds for the worst-hit fish farmers.\" The flood has destroyed 134 acres of hybrid grass fields. The loss can be estimated at Tk 75 lakh, said Akhteruzaman Vuia, district livestock officer. The flood claimed the lives of 4 cows and 3,885 chicken. Although the flood did not hurt the animals directly, the cattle farmers face massive losses for fodder crisis. Besides, a total of 55.34 kilometres of roads were totally damaged, while 180 km partially, said Md Mizanur Rahman, executive engineer of Sirajganj LGED. Twenty-nine culverts were also damaged. Several roads are still inundated, so the actual loss is still unknown, he said. Sirajganj is one of the biggest handloom and power loom producing areas in the country. Samen Ali of Saydabad Modhhyapara in Sirajganj Sadar upazila said, \"I set up a handloom factory by borrowing money from a local NGO a couple of years ago. But the recent flood destroyed my factory, taking away the lone source of income for my family.\" \"I don't know how I will repay the loan instalments now.\" Like him, most weavers in five upazilas are facing a crisis. Total damage to the sector is yet to be determined. As the flood water recedes, Jamuna river is devouring houses and crop lands at several points of Sirajganj Sadar, Chowhali, Shahzadpur, Kazipur and Belkuchi upazila, said Sirajganj divisional WDB engineer Rafikul Islam. This is casual river erosion, he added. \"According to the characteristics of Jamuna, the river banks erode both then the water level rises and drops. We have nothing to do at this moment. At the end of the flood, we can take steps to save damage for the next time.\" Sirajganj district administration has complied a flood loss report from different departments. But the fund allotment for rehabilitation is yet to be allotted. \"We will start rehabilitation work after getting the funds,\" DC Dr Faruk said."

      "text": "Fast of Ramadan Ends With Feasts\n1989-05-03T05:00:00.000Z\nFast of Ramadan Is Soon to Be a Feast\nTOMORROW evening Muslims will search the night sky for the new moon. If they see the first sliver of light or hear of its official sighting in Mecca, they will end their monthlong fast at daybreak and eat heartily in celebration.\nSince April 6, the beginning of Ramadan, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar, millions of devout Muslims around the world have abstained from all foods and liquids from the first light of morning to sundown.\nThe morning after the new moon reappears - either Friday or Saturday - Muslims will begin the month of Shawwal and celebrate the id al-fitr, or festival of fast breaking. It is a day of thanksgiving, when they will dress up, exchange gifts, visit friends and eat.\nIn the observance of the fast, Ramadan is like the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur and the Christian period of Lent. Muslims believe that God revealed the Koran to Mohammed during this month in the seventh century.\nRamadan is more than a time of fasting. It is a time of restraint and reflection, of prayer and peace. It is a time of kindness and charity, of family and community.\nIt is also a time when food takes on a greater significance. ''That which we deny ourselves is more appreciated,'' said Ahmed Almontaser, a Muslim who owns the Moroccan Star Restaurant in downtown Brooklyn.\nAs the sun sets each evening during Ramadan, Muslims often join to break their fast with dates and water, as the prophet Mohammed is said to have done. Then facing Mecca and bowing on their knees with their heads to the ground, they make their sunset prayer.\nAfterward they have the iftar, or evening breakfast. The foods are simple and hearty: soups and stews made from lamb, chicken or beef to keep up strength during the fast.\nOn a recent Sunday about 400 Muslims - with backgrounds as diverse as Afghan, Egyptian, African-American, Palestinian, Pakistani, Spanish and Bangladeshi - gathered in Brooklyn for a community iftar at Masjid Al Farouq, a mosque on Atlantic Avenue between Fourth and Fifth Streets. They represented 17 Islamic centers in the New York region. Sneakers, work boots and oxfords were strewn in piles in the hallways, because Muslims must remove their footwear upon entering a mosque.\nThe men - some in business suits, others in loose tunics - covered their heads with turbans and woven caps. They prayed and broke their fast upstairs. The women, wearing ankle-length cloaks and scarfs concealing their hair, prayed and ate downstairs.\nShortly after a meal of lamb stew and Egyptian bread, they said their nighttime prayer, followed by a special prayer for forgiveness said only during Ramadan. Then they went home to sleep, where by custom they would rouse themselves at 3:30 or 4 A.M. to eat a light snack of fruit or yogurt, or even bagels and lox, to tide them over for more than 16 hours of fasting.\nFor Osama Younis, an Egyptian-born orthodontist, his wife, Mona, and their three children, each day of Ramadan begins with the predawn breakfast and a visit to their mosque in Mount Vernon, N.Y., for early prayers. Afterward, they return home to read a chapter of the Koran and then slip back into their beds for an hour's nap before beginning the workday or school day.\n''It is not difficult,'' Dr. Younis said. ''Allah gives us strength.''\nFasting during Ramadan is required of all adult Muslims, and children are encouraged to fast as much as they can. Pregnant women or those who are sick or engaged in hard labor may postpone their fast, fulfilling it when it is less a hardship.\n''Non-Muslims always ask why do we stay hungry all day,'' said Abdul-Salam Hamid, who came to New York from Pakistan 20 years ago. ''Half of the world is hungry. Many are dying of hunger. In this way we can feel their pain, understand their suffering and become more compassionate, more giving. Allah wants us to recognize this, to do good deeds and to learn how to control our temptations.''\nMr. Hamid, who owns Shaheem Sweets, a bakery and restaurant chain with four stores in Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn, admitted that he sometimes absent-mindedly took a taste of his pastry. But according to Muslim law, an unintentional bite does not break the fast.\nDuring the last days of Ramadan, Muslims often sleep in the mosque, making intensive devotions. They await the Night of Power, which commemorates the first revelation of the Koran and a time when the faithful believe God will answer all prayers. Before feasting this week, each family must give food or money to help feed the poor.\nThere are more than five million Muslims in the United States, according to the Federation of Islamic Associations in Detroit. Because Islam brings together a multitude of traditions and cultures, there is no distinctive Islamic cuisine; there are no symbolic foods, except dates, that all Muslims eat in breaking their fast.\n''While Muslims who are from the Middle East eat baba gannouj - mashed eggplant in sesame butter - and falafel, we'll have fried chicken and potato salad,'' said Njeri Abdul-Mumit, an American-born Muslim who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.\nBut there are some similarities among the foods that many Muslims eat. Alcohol and pork are forbidden. All meat must be halal (that is, from animals ritually slaughtered). Dried fruits are very common, and sweets of all types are savored.\nMuslims of Pakistani and Indian descent often make a special sweet pudding called sevian to begin their feast and to give to friends. Middle Easterners favor honey and nut-filled pastries like baklava and kinafa.\nSweets symbolize the joy Muslims feel after receiving God's blessings during Ramadan, Mr. Hamid said. And for him, the festival of fast breaking is a double celebration: ''It is my bakeries' busiest day.''

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-02 00:00:00      \n Pabna farmers are cultivating more land for the second season of onion eyeing the high price of the spice in the market, forgetting the loss they had suffered from their flood-hit crops in the September-October season. Deputy Director Md Azhar Ali of Pabna Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) told The Daily Star, \"In the last season, farmers cultivated 44,000 hectares of land and produced 6.5 lakh metric tons of onions. This season, we have targeted to cultivate 49,800-hectare for producing 7.5 lakh metric tons of onions.\" If the weather remains dry and favourable, then this season's target will be the highest ever production in Pabna, according to officials of DAE. Deputy director Azhar informed that the total yearly demand for onion in the country is 24 lakh metric tons, and the nine upazilas of Pabna usually supplies 25 percent of it. Next year, they are hoping to supply 33 percent of the total demand of onion, he added. The deputy director noted that farmers, who could save their crop from flood during the last season, earned a lofty profit from the Mulkata variety selling it at the high market price. This motivated the other farmers to increase their cultivation for the current season. Since mid-September price of onion kept on rising from Tk 40/kg to the record high of Tk 250/kg, becoming somewhat steadier in the last two weeks selling between Tk 50 to Tk 100 per kg, as quoted on the website of the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. Sources at the DAE explained that Mulkata sown during September-October is harvested around December while the current variety sown now will be ready for harvest by March. This correspondent visited Santhia and Sujanagar upazilas, where most of the onions in the district are grown. An onion farmer of Sujanagar upazila Md Ishhaque Ali said, \"In last season, I cultivated 66 decimals of land but I did not get expected profit as most of the crop was damaged in sudden flood this year. I managed to save 20 mounds of onion and sold those for Tk 60,000. The handsome price of onion inspired me to cultivate again in more areas this season.\" Ishaque is cultivating onions on 165 decimals of land by leasing 99 decimals, expecting to earn Tk five lakh to Tk six lakh from sale of the crop, he said. He, however, is concerned about winter rain damaging his crop again. \"If it rains during winter, we may face loss again,\" he said. Forgetting the loss that he had incurred in the last season, retired college teacher Dulal Hossain of Narinda village in Santhia upazila cultivated five bigha of land for onion expecting to earn Tk five lakh. He, too, is worried about the weather.  \"The recent dense fog disrupts onion cultivation. At the same time, we are worried about rain during winter,\" Dulal said. Farmers also urged the government to stop importing onions during harvesting time, so that they can get expected profit."

Due to the sudden erosion many dwelling houses as well as a vast tract of croplands at different villages under Govindsi, Gabsara and Arjuna unions in the upazila were devoured within a few weeks. The worst affected villages are Khanurbari, Kostapara and Bhalkutia under Govindasi union as over 100 dwelling houses and a vast tract of croplands were devoured by the river in the last few days. The erosion affected people have taken shelter on different roads and other's houses. Meanwhile, demanding steps to protect their villages from the dreadful erosion the affected people, living alongside the river, formed a human chain at Kostapara village on Friday. Several hundred riverside people, carrying placards inscribed with different slogans, took part in the rally. Locals alleged that illegal extraction of sand from different places along the river using powerful dredgers is one of the main reasons behind the erosion. Local influential people, having political clout, extracting sand from the river and sell those from over a dozen sand landing stations within eight kilometre areas stretching from Bangabandhu Bridge East Cantonment area to Govindasi Ghat area, they added. Last year, erosion by the Jamuna devoured numerous dwellings and a vast tract of croplands at Arjuna, Bharua, Kuthir Boira, Jagatpura, Tarai and Balarampur villages in Bhuapur upazila and Gorilabari and Beltia village under Gohaliabari union in adjacent Kalihati upazila. Abdul Mazid of Kostapara village said over 100 dwellings and a vast tract of croplands at three villages under Govindasi union were devoured by the river in the last one week. Although the swelling river has been devouring houses, croplands, rural markets, schools, madrasas and other establishments for the last eight years, no step has been taken to protect the areas, he said. Tangail WDB Executive Engineer Sirajul Islam said Geo bags should have been dumped in the affected areas, but they could not do it due to shortage of Geo bags. Away in Netrakona, a newly constructed embankment along the Mohadeo river in Kalmakanda upazila collapsed within five months of its construction, affecting hundreds of families of at least 25 villages under different unions, reports our Mymensingh correspondent. Water Development Board (WDB) built the 285-metre-long embankment recently at a cost of Tk 17 lakh. Netrakona WDB. Sub Assistant Engineer Ibrahim Khalilullah said the construction work of the dyke was conducted on an emergency basis as there was no scope to start a fresh project to rise of water level in the river. \"We are taking preparation to build a 300-metre embankment in Chikontop and Baruakona areas in the coming dry season with an estimated cost of Tk one crore,\" Engineer Khalilullah said, adding that the dam will be built with concrete blocks and guide walls. Contractor Fazlur Rahman, who got the work order, said the embankment collapsed due to strong current and the recent flash flood. Refuting the allegation of substandard work, the contractor said he completed the work as per the work schedule using bamboo, logs and sand bags. Mentionable, about 3,000 families under Rongchhati, Kharnoi and Lengura unions in the upazila have been affected in the recent flash flood."

      "text": "FILM; Satyajit Ray Gives Ibsen A Bengali Spin\n1989-05-07T05:00:00.000Z\nSatyajit Ray, Sidelined for more than half a decade by heart disease, is about to return to the cinema world with his 26th feature film - and first screen adaptation of a play, Henrik Ibsen's ''Enemy of the People.''\nThe film will have its premiere at the Cannes Festival, which begins on Thursday. Called ''Ganashatru'' in Bengali, the picture has already been picked up by distributors in Britain and France.\nIt won't open here in Calcutta till next fall, however, because the 67-year-old Mr. Ray, always the perfectionist, doesn't want to subject it to the city's un-air-conditioned theaters during the suffocating summer. ''They keep the fans whirring all the time,'' he said. ''It ruins the soundtrack.''\n''Why I chose a play for the first time in my career,'' Mr. Ray explained, relaxing in his Calcutta apartment on a warm Bengali night, ''was that for five years I hadn't made a film because of illness. Then the doctors suggested that I could go back to making films provided I worked only in the studio, not on locations.\n''If it had to be confined within the studio, then I started thinking of a play,'' he said. ''I had read Ibsen as a young man in college, and 'Enemy of the People' I remembered. I read him again. It seems the play could be brought up to date, transplanted to Bengal and turned into a completely Indian story, relevant to modern times.\n''So I decided on Ibsen, and we got going,'' he said. ''I wrote a screenplay. I adapted it. Three or four writings, and there it was, ready to be filmed.''\n''An Enemy of the People,'' a five-act play Ibsen wrote in 1882, tells the story of Thomas Stockmann, a doctor in a Norwegian resort who falls afoul of vested interest when he tries to sound a warning that the town's mineral baths have been polluted by industrial wastes. Seeing their local prosperity threatened, even liberals turn against him, seeking to suppress his scientific report. He is hounded into isolation, a man of principle who has become an enemy of the people.\nThe play was thought to be Ibsen's sharp retort to Norwegian society's negative response to his previous play, ''Ghosts.'' ''An Enemy of the People'' portrays a hypocritical middle class, easily persuaded to trade in their idealism for security.\nMr. Ray, who casts the man he calls ''my favorite actor,'' Soumitra Chatterji, as his Dr. Gupta, the Bengali Stockmann, said the shooting of the film went very well and that his health seemed to improve in the process. The director comes close to being worshiped by Calcuttans, who save their highest regard for artists. In a city where people will pay for tape of Mr. Ray's voice, his health is a matter of great local concern.\nDressed in the white cotton shirt and trousers Bengalis call ''Punjabi pajamas,'' Mr. Ray said he feels very close to Calcuttans and would not want to work anywhere else. Sounds of the city drifted through the large open windows as he talked in his huge, high-ceilinged study piled with papers and books. The elegant old apartment, a virtual film set for intellectual Calcutta life, has had to make only one concession to modernization: an elevator has been installed outside in the hall to save Mr. Ray, who has had coronary bypass surgery, a climb up several flights of stairs.\n''Everything was made inside the studio in Calcutta,'' he said of ''Ganashatru,'' a film about 100 minutes long. ''We had a 45-day schedule; we finished in 28 days. We worked incredibly fast, particularly because I had a wonderful set of actors. It was O.K. on the first take much of the time, so I didn't even have to take a second take or third take.\n''I had an ambulance and a doctor in attendance,'' he said. ''My cardiologist would occasionally drop in. My family physican would come. You see, they were interested because it was the story of a doctor. Apart from taking my blood pressure and pulse, they were interested in what was going on and how the doctor was behaving in the circumstances.\n''Their verdict was that I kept better when I was shooting,'' he said with a low laugh. ''The adrenaline, or whatever, caused an improvement in my health. They said that I should certainly be making one film a year, and that in the next film, I could even include a few outdoor scenes.''\nMr. Ray calls his version of ''An Enemy of the People'' ''a free adaptation of Ibsen. ''People will recognize Ibsen,'' he said. ''The debt to Ibsen is there. The five-act structure is there. But apart from that, I've had to make changes. You inevitably have to make changes. People behave differently, you see.'' Mr. Ray says he dealt with the staginess inherent in a dramatic work by pulling it farther and farther out from under the proscenium as he went along. This attempt to give the story a cinematic feel has wrought additional alterations in the Ibsen work.\n''The first act has a lot of words, a lot of entrances and exits,'' he said. ''But it's as cinematic as I could make it.\n''Gradually, more and more, as the story develops, it departs more and more from Ibsen and becomes more and more cinematic,'' he said. ''Particularly, the public meeting that takes place in the film is very, very unlike the scene in the play. It's very mobile and free: lots of camera movements, cuts and this and that and not a plethora of dialogue.''\nMr. Ray said he knew that the Ibsen play would have contemporary appeal in India as well as abroad, apart from its novelty as an Indian's view of a Scandinavian theatrical work.\n''It deals with topical problems,'' he said. ''Pollution is still a problem, as much as it was a hundred years ago - more than that, much more than that.'' Mr. Ray is optimistic that this timeliness of topics, among other attractionss - not the least beings his reputation - will help India's National Film Development Corporation, the production's backers, to market the film in the United States.\n''There is considerable interest abroad, partly because it's Ibsen,'' he said. ''And then, Arthur Miller had an adaptation of the Ibsen play, which has been playing in London recently and is doing very well. So I'm sure there's an additional reason for interest in this film.''\nLike this film, Mr. Ray's previous work, ''Ghare Baire'' (''Home and the World''), based on a story by Rabindranath Tagore, was also shown abroad before being screened in Calcutta. But Mr. Ray, who has an international stature not shared by most of the rest of India's directors - Bengali or otherwise - dismisses brusquely the contention of some Indians critics that his films are made for foreign audiences.\n''I always make my films primarily for my own audience,'' he said. ''I've never known what kind of film will export well. I have never been able to fathom what goes down well with the Western audience.\n''You know, I made a film once called 'The Music Room,' which I thought was so Indian, because it had lots of Indian classical singing and dancing and music and whatnot,'' he recalled. ''It deals with problems which are totally Indian. I thought that film would never export. But it did very well abroad, and now in France, it's my most popular film. It's considered to be one of the great films of all time.'' He laughed heartily. ''I just don't understand.'' ''My first film was a success in Calcutta, a big success in Calcutta, even before it won a prize in Cannes,'' he said of ''Pather Panchali,'' released in 1955. ''It's wrong that people say that my success abroad eventually gave me a footing here. That's not true.\n''I've always made films with an Indian audience in mind,'' he said. ''In fact, I've often had great difficulties in translating the dialogues, because they were so Indian, and so Bengali. So if I had thought of the Western audience first, then I certainly would have thought of different films.''\nMr. Ray said his deep attachment to the state of Bengal has led him to reject foreign film-making offers all of his life.\n''I could have made films in Hollywood,'' he said.''I've had offers, many offers, which I turned down, because I don't have my roots there. I want my roots to be in the place where I work. I'm deeply rooted here, and I'm only interested in Indian subjects.''\nThe director acknowledges that with a relatively small - by Indian standards - Bengali market, and with a ban on Indian films in neighboring, Bengali-speaking Bangladesh, he has been grateful for his success abroad.\n''The international market helps me to survive as a film maker,'' he said. ''There's no question about it, because I have a small market in India. That is to say, it's a Bengali-speaking audience primarily. Now, of late, I have started putting in English subtitles for Bombay, Delhi and Madras, but that still is a small market.''\nSatyajit Ray has won dozens of prizes. This year, President Francois Mitterrand of France came to Calcutta to present him with the Medal of the Legion of Honor. But Mr. Ray has never won an Oscar.\n''I've won almost every other kind of prize, except the Oscar,'' he said, reflectively. ''But you see, my films have never been entered for the Academy Awards. I have no agents in America, and it's just not happened. But I'm quite happy with what I have.''"

In the face of immense public pressure, authorities deferred the Dhaka city corporation polls, but political pressure has failed to remove Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) from the election. Election day was scheduled for January 30 - a holiday for Saraswati Puja - which prompted an outcry from rights groups which called it discriminatory. The Election Commission refused to change the date initially, offering a tottering defence, but later rescheduled elections for February 1. At the same time, political parties aside from the ruling Awami League party have been clamouring against the use of EVMs, claiming it is not secure and is even \"unconstitutional.\" Chief Election Commissioner KM Nurul Huda said on December 25 that EVMs would not be used if there were objections, but later said they would be used.  EVMs were deployed in limited fashion in the 2018 General Elections, and saw only half the votes cast with them in six constituencies. Voter reactions were mixed, with complaints about the machines showing technical glitches. Though the EC said on January 21 that the army will not be deployed for the polls, Colonel Kamal Uddin, director of the project implementing EVMs, said army personnel familiar with the EVM technology will be present at every centre to help the presiding officers. The EC has deployed 35,000 EVMs in 2,468 polling centres for use in the Dhaka polls.  File Photo: Voters cast their votes via EVMs | Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune Twice the machines Colonel Kamal said that each centre will have double the machines. \"We are doubling the EVMs at each centre to instantly move from any machine that shows problems.\" Authorities declined to reveal the cost of the EVMs being used. The machines were purchased from Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory (BMTF). In September 2018, it was reported that the government has approved Tk3,825 crore for the procurement of 150,000 machines at a cost of Tk2 lakh each. In 2011, the EC purchased EVMs from the BMTF at Tk46,501 apiece, which were considered more vulnerable and were subsequently destroyed. Colonel Kamal said returning officers and presiding officers are already being trained to use the EVMs. A demonstration is set for January 27 and the EC has scheduled a mock vote for January 30 to familiarize voters with the technology. Hack-proof EVMs? Colonel Kamal confidently said: \"The EVMs are very secure. As for hackers, if they have guts and are tech savvy, they can try hacking the EVMs. EVMs are not even connected to the internet.\" However, hacking is not limited to the internet. Experts have pointed out that EVMs are still vulnerable to manual tampering. Components can be compromised, but the complexity of the process makes wide scale tampering unfeasible. He also said the EC's decision to widely use EVMs stemmed from responses to  city corporation elections in other districts.  Brig Gen Mohammad Sidul Islam, director general of the EC's NID Wing, said: \"Voters can only cast ballots in their own constituency. No other EVM will accept his ballot. On election day, the presiding officer inserts an SD card into the EVM, with voter data of that particular constituency . Anyone not on the list will be unable to vote and anyone listed in one constituency will not be able to vote in another. The EC said around 70 staff are working round the clock to tweak and upgrade the EVM system in whatever minute way possible, before the machines are rolled out."

With ancient roots in the spring equinox, both rites serve to mark the renewal of nature's cycle. As is becoming slowly evident, that cycle is too easy to take for granted.\nIndustrial activity has begun to affect the world's atmosphere in ways that threaten to induce profound changes in climate. The ''ozone hole'' that has recently opened up over Antarctica offers a sharp warning: Pay heed to the broader climatic changes known as the greenhouse effect.\nAs waste gases build up in the atmosphere, they absorb heat that would otherwise radiate out into space. Scientists have long feared that this process would start to heat the atmosphere, in the way that glass traps the heat in a greenhouse. Even a few degrees' rise in average global temperature could have extreme regional consequences.\nThe climate would change, probably making the Midwest hotter and shifting America's grain belt north into Canada. The Gulf Stream might shift course, ceasing to warm Europe. Sea level would rise a foot or two as the oceans expanded, flooding low-lying areas like America's East Coast and Bangladesh. Should the Western Antarctic ice cap melt, the sea would rise 20 feet, inundating New York, New Orleans, London, Beijing.\nThat's the fearful scenario some scientists say is possible. But is it likely?\nThe answer lies in a puzzle that may take another decade to complete. Important pieces are already in place. The greenhouse gases are already accumulating. Carbon dioxide created by the burning of fossil fuels has steadily increased since the Industrial Revolution. Chlorofluorocarbons or CFC's, used as refrigerants, also heat the atmosphere. Because of their separate effect in eroding the life-protecting ozone layer, a recent international agreement will slowly limit production.\nGiven the steady rise in greenhouse gases, is the atmosphere warming up as predicted? It's too early to say. Average surface temperatures have risen half a degree centigrade since 1861. Last year was the warmest on record, followed by 1981 and 1983. But three warm summers still don't send an unmistakable signal and uncertainty masks others.\nSo why not wait and collect more data, as the Reagan Administration proposes? Such calm seems appealing compared with the cost of overreaction. Recall the swine flu vaccination campaign, or the millions poured into synfuels plants. Moreover, the greenhouse gases may produce their own antidotes. Rising humidity could increase cloud cover and cool the Earth, plants might grow faster and absorb more carbon dioxide.\nYet hysteria and overreaction are not the only responses available. Each decade of delay may commit the atmosphere to further warming. A greenhouse effect might intensify itself by slowing the oceans' absorption of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, several of the proposed remedies are worth taking anyway - like further reducing CFC's; retarding destruction of the world's tropical forests; conserving energy and looking for safer ways to generate nuclear power.\nA primary need is for more detailed monitoring of the atmosphere, which suggests a fine planetary assignment for NASA - a mission to Earth to give earliest possible warning of the greenhouse signal. But even as research continues, it's time to take the first practical steps in averting a trend that could derange nature's rebirth and renewal."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-09 00:00:00      \nIndia is going to draw around 51.54 litres of water per second from the Feni river once the deal between Bangladesh and India is implemented, but doubts remain as to how much impact it would have on Bangladesh.   The Feni water-sharing agreement was signed in the presence of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi on Saturday. Some experts say the drawing of water will have little impact on the downstream of the Feni river.  Yet, the deal regarding withdrawal of 1.82 cusec of water by India, to be used as drinking water for the people of Sabroom town in Tripura, triggered sharp criticism in Bangladesh.   The condemnation comes due to India dillydallying on signing the Teesta deal for last eight years even after finalisation of the deal and suspicions regarding the nature of the deal.  \"I think withdrawal of 1.82 cusecs of water will have very little impact in the downstream. After a series of discussions, we have agreed to provide them the water for drinking purpose. There is no shortage of water during the monsoon and during the lean period, the river has a minimum flow of the water around 110 cusecs,\" said KM Anwar Hossain, member, Joint Rivers Commission (JRC), Bangladesh. He explained the quantity of water in one cusec water was equivalent to 28.32 litres of water flow per second. So, 1.82 cusec will be equivalent to 51.54 litres water per second.  When asked when the water-sharing would start, Anwar said it would start soon as the MoU was already signed.   While there is optimism on a government level, questions remain regarding how much water is to be withdrawn and how it would be monitored.  Professor Saiful Islam of the Institute of Water and Flood management, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), said the discharge of Feni river was around 750 cusecs during the monsoon, while it was over 100 cusecs in winter.  \"That means they are going to withdraw around two to three percent of water from the river during the lean period, which would not be a problem.  \"But if they withdraw more than 1.82 cusecs, it may affect Muhuri-Feni irrigation project based on the water from Feni river,\" he said.  Around 230.076 hectares land area is under the Muhuri-Feni irrigation project. He, however, said it was necessary to sign deals on sharing of the water of all transboundary rivers.  Locals living by the Feni river in Khagrachhari said India had been withdrawing water from the Feni river \"unofficially\", by setting up small pumps at zero point.  Regarding the deal, many said there was confusion whether it was to draw 1.82 cusec of water or more.   \"If they withdraw 1.82 cusec of water, it will not have much impact downstream. But, if they withdraw 1.82 cumec instead, it will be a disaster for us because 1.82 cumec is 35 times higher than 1.82 cusec. So, the government should make it clear about the signed MoU,\" said M Inamul Haque, Chairman, Institute of Water & Environment.  According to the joint statement of Hasina's official visit to India, it is mentioned that 1.82 cusec of water will be withdrawn. A copy of the MoU, however, is yet to be made available on public domains. In regards to monitoring, JRC member Anwar said, \"Now India will invite Bangladesh to oversee the withdrawal activities jointly with them. They will set up water pumps to withdraw the water, while officials of Bangladesh and India will jointly monitor the activities,\" he said.  \"The officials will monitor some issues like whether the withdrawal activities cause any harm to the river, so it does not cause any erosion on the river bank,\" he said.

He said an awareness campaign will be launched across the country to dispel panic about dengue. Quader said flood and dengue have increased the government's work manifold as it has taken all-out preparation to face situation. The minister said AL always stands beside the people at the time of disaster and this party does not do politics with relief activities. The flood has affected people in 18 districts and AL would not only distribute relief goods but also continue to assist the affected people until completion of their rehabilitation, he added. He criticized BNP for spreading propaganda against the government's relief activities and said BNP leaders are busy with staging photo-sessions in the name of relief distribution, and spreading remours. About the BNP's threat of movement to free its chairperson Begum Khaleda Zia, Quader said she is in jail for one and a half years but BNP could not build any agitation to secure her release. \"People would no more respond to the call of BNP because people do not trust the party due to its negative politics,\" he said. About the comments of BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir that there is a crisis in the country, Obaidul Quader said, \"Actually there is crisis in BNP, not in the country\". AL joint general secretary Abdur Rahman, relief and social welfare secretary Sujit Roy Nandi, science and technology affairs secretary Abdur Sabur, information research secretary Advocate Afzal Hossain, education and human resources affairs secretary Shamsun Nahar Champa, women affairs secretary and state minister for women and children affairs Fazilatunnesa Indira and member of central working committee Mirza Azad, among others, were present at the programme.

      "text": "TRAVEL ADVISORY\n1988-09-18T05:00:00.000Z\nBhutan to Raise Tourist Fees In January\nFor the first time in eight years, Bhutan is raising the daily fees that it charges travelers. Since 1980 Bhutan has charged tour companies a fee of $130 per person per day, and a trekking fee of $95 a day. The trekking fee is for those who do not stay in hotels but join hiking and camping tours. Those fees are passed on to tourists who sign up for trips. (Individual travel, for which there is an even higher fee, is rare because making arrangments is difficult.) As of Jan. 1, Bhutan will increase tour-group rates for the peak tourist season - April and October - to $250 a day for tourists and to $130 a day for trekkers. Proportionate increases are to be imposed during the other times of the year. The highest fees coincide roughly with the Paro Festival in the spring and the Thimphu and Wangdiphodrang Festivals in the fall.\nBhutan's government has ''realized they don't have the manpower or the hotels and infrastructure for tourism,'' said Brent Olson of Inner-Asia Expeditions in San Francisco, ''so they want to maintain tourism at the present level, about 2,400 tourists a year, for the next few years.''\nBhutan closed its official tourist agency in the United States a year ago. For information, contact agencies that specialize in Bhutan trips. Two are Inner-Asia Expeditions, 2627 Lombard Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94123 (800-551-1769 or 415-922-0448) and Bhutan Travel, 120 East 56th Street, New York, N.Y. (212-838-6382). Tokyo Exchange Opens for Tours\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange's new main office building, completed five months ago, is now open to visitors. Tours are given in English, and the activity on the trading floor can be viewed from a gallery on the second floor. There, visitors can use personal computers that simulate the buying and selling of stocks. A robot demonstrates the meaning of the traders' hand signals. And to help visitors understand financial facts Professor Stocks, a mechanical puppet, gives lectures, as a telephone provides English translation. There is also an assortment of videos on the world of trading.\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange (2-1 Nihombashi, Kaubuto-Cho, Chuo-Ku, Tokyo; 666-0141) is near the Kayaba-Cho station on the Tozai or Hibiya lines or the Edo Bashi station on the Toei-Asakusa line. Visitor's gallery hours are weekdays from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. and Saturdays 9 to 11:30 A.M. Trading sessions are weekdays 9 to 11 A.M. and 1 to 3 P.M. and Saturdays 9 to 11 A,M. The exchange is closed the second and third Saturday of each month, national holidays and the first and last three days of the year. Admission is free. New Air Service To Queensland\nThe number of flights between the United States and Queensland, Australia, will increase this fall as the result an agreement between the United States and Australian Governments. Qantas now hass three flights a week from the West Coast to Cairns. On Nov. 1, Continental will begin three flights a week from San Francisco and two from Los Angeles to Cairns and on to Brisbane. United will offer flights to the two cities sometime in early 1989.\nCairns, in tropical northern Australia and near the Great Barrier Reef, has become increasingly popular with American travelers in the last few years, according to the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation.\nIn return for granting the new flights, Qantas will be allowed to fly into new cities in the United States, to be chosen later this year.\nRound-trip coach fares for the Continental flights will be $1,195 during November, according to the airline. On Dec. 1 the fare will increase to $1,395. Meeting in Asia: A Greeting Guide\nWhile a handshake is acceptable on being introduced to a resident of most Asian cities, other forms of greeting may be customary. Also, there are often may be prohibitions about men shaking hands with women. In general, do not greet someone by his or her first name until you are so addressed.

It was founded by Faysal Khalilur Rahman, the current Assistant Director at Public Relations and Publications, Sylhet Agricultural University, Bangladesh. Their team, known as the 'Kaaktaduas', was awarded the Joy Bangla Youth Award by the Centre for Research and Information (CRI) in 2017. Bangla films as a tool to raise social awareness Using cinema as a medium to communicate social messages, the Kaaktaduas have made 16 short films so far. These include: Oishee, Bhua Doctor, Ghew, Jinn Er Baadshah, Proshno, Shei Meyeta, Foll Shommelon, Way to Success, Tution, Sesh Bikele, Prioshchitto, Arshee, Adharer Nilima, Two Face, Kingkottobobimur, Alo Adharer Golpo and Bondhu Manr Aaina. \"Cinema is one of the most preferred forms of entertainment for most people. Our films carry different social messages,\" shares Faysal. Their recent production, Shoirachaar, was released earlier this year. Pledging to preserve our language 'Bangla' \n Language is an asset and so is the environment. Bearing that in mind, the Kaaktadua volunteers started their 'Banan Shuddi' campaign in February 2014, with an aim to rectify the practice of using incorrect Bangla spellings on billboards, wall posters and signboards. \"Being the only country who has fought for their mother language, I believe we should know and practice the correct form of Bangla,\" asserts Faysal. \"Alongside correcting Bangla spellings, we provided various counselling and academic sessions to shop keepers, poster writers, and wall painters, in order raise awareness in this regard.\" Music as a weapon to fight the aftermath of natural calamities Since the past couple of years, volunteers of the organisation have been using music as a way to collect funds and donate necessary resources to victims of natural disasters. \"In 2018, there was a hazardous flood in Shunamganj, Haor. Our members came up with the idea to use music as a way of collecting funds, instead of just going around asking for money. Members who are good singers pair up and walk along the city street, holding a box labeled with the cause for fund collection.\" The Kaaktaduas collected BDT 80,000 and donated the full amount to the flood victims of Haor. Empowering the underprivileged with filmmaking skills  With the motto, 'Shobar Jonno Cholochitro', the Kaaktadua family also provides lessons on filmmaking to underprivileged children. \"Last year in February, we hosted our first free workshop on photography and basics of filmmaking in SOS Shishu Polli, Doyamir. The session was conducted by our member, Kaniz Ahmed, with the support of Md Yusuf Ali, the Director of SOS Shishu Polli. Since then, it has been one of our regular activities,\" mentions Faysal. Kaaktadua also organises various photography exhibitions and film screenings. Through their initiatives, the organisation plans to improve the living standards for the underprivileged in enjoyable and socially acceptable ways."

On the first day of the visit, Sheikh Hasina will join a community reception to be hosted in her honour by the expatriate Bangladeshis in Brunei at Indera Samudera Ballroom of Empire Hotel and Country Club. The prime minister will attend a dinner to be hosted by the high commissioner of Bangladesh to Brunei the same day. On Monday morning, Sheikh Hasina will have a general audience with Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah and Royal family at Cheradi Laila Kenchana at the Istana Nurul Iman, the official residence of the Sultan. The prime minister will then hold bilateral talks with the Sultan at Baitul Mesyuarah in Istana Nurul Iman. The talks will be followed by the signing ceremony of a memorandum of understanding (MoU). On Monday afternoon, the prime minister will join a meeting between Bangladesh Business Community, Brunei Business Community, and Brunei National Chamber of Commerce and Industry at the Empire Hotel and Country Club. She will then visit Jame Asr Mosque and offer Asr prayers there. Later, Sheikh Hasina will attend official banquet to be hosted in her honour by the Sultan at Istana Nurul Iman.

Later, she will visit the Royal Regalia Museum. The premier is schedule to depart Brunei for Dhaka at 5pm on Tuesday, and is expected to land at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in the evening. During the visit, Bangladesh is likely to sign seven MoUs with Brunei in various sectors. At a news briefing at the Foreign Ministry on Thursday, Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen said: \"We have already finalized six MoUs in various sectors, with one still under consideration.\"  The six MoUs that have been finalized are: assistance in using science and technology in agriculture; liaison in the field of arts and culture; cooperation in sports and youth related activities; cooperation in the field of fisheries; assistance in the field of livestock; and cooperation in the field of fuel and energy. Apart from boosting relations between the two countries, the foreign minister hoped that the visit will be successful in increasing bilateral trade relations. He added: \"We do believe that the prime minister's visit will further strengthen the bilateral relations as well as cooperation on energy, trade, investment, agriculture, food, air connectivity, human resource development, tourism, and technology between the two countries. \"Brunei has already expressed keen interest to invest in different sectors in Bangladesh, especially agriculture and energy fields.\" Minister Momen said Brunei is an important partner of Bangladesh in the international arena as the country is a member of both the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). The minister mentioned a discussion to be held on Rohingya repatriation, and said: \"Wherever we are going, we are raising the Rohingya repatriation issue with utmost importance. Hence it will also get priority during the Brunei visit.\""

''Hiya, sister,'' he said. ''Welcome to the love boat.''\nThe Rev. Barbara C. Crafton, who has been called Sweetie, Cupcake, Honey Doll and more, was unabashed. The Episcopal priest, one of the first 50 women ordained in 1980, has visited some 4,000 ships and heard it all. Her ministry is to the 200,000 seafarers from 60 countries who call each year at ports in the area.\n''The job is real dirty and ugly,'' said Mother Crafton, as she prefers to be known, director of Seafarers' Services for the Seamen's Church Institute of New York and New Jersey. But the joy of comforting achingly lonely souls is immense. ''The smallest sort of thing you do is a big thing,'' she said.\nThings like distributing armloads of magazines, offering a lift to stores, arranging a phone call home, setting up a soccer game, counseling marriages split by half a planet and helping seafarers fight for what few rights they have. Mother Crafton has gone into lockers to administer last rites; in these days of refrigeration, bodies are shipped home rather than buried at sea. She has exorcised demons from unlucky vessels.\nIt is all some distance from Mora, Minn., the farm town where Mother Crafton grew up landlocked and driven by an ambition to go where not everyone was blond. Now 38 years old, she is sailing a voyage that has included study at Rutgers, Princeton and the General Theological Seminary; a marriage, two daughters and a divorce, and work from cabaret singer to parish priest.\nMother Crafton's love affair with the sea began when the seamen's institute - which is ecumenical but affiliated with the Episcopal Church - asked her to perform the Cole Porter songs she loves. She expected ''a swashbuckling bunch of beer-swillers.'' What she found were ''polite little Asian boys'' far, far from home.\n''I felt sorry for them,'' she said. Thus it was that\nMother Crafton left her New Jersey parish and went to work on the waterfront in 1983. It was a different waterfront from the wild and wooly one prevailing when the institute, in 1844, launched the first of three floating churches -steeples and all - that became East River landmarks. It was different, too, from the macho jungle Marlon Brando prowled in ''On the Waterfront.''\nFierce competition has changed the maritime industry. To raise productivity and slash costs, ships have become larger and more automated, carrying smaller crews and spending 12 hours rather than a week in port. Most now register under what are called flags of convenience - Panama's, say, or Liberia's - to avoid taxes and labor rules that American or European flags would mandate.\nToday's sailors come from the bargain basement, the villages of the third world. Mother Crafton tells of a Greek cruise ship in which 50 Bangladeshis in a crew of 600 were kept in despicable conditions: eight in rooms meant for two, no bedding, the toilet a smelly hole in the next room. Unlike sailors of other nationalities, the Bangladeshis were denied shore leave for fear they would bolt.\nMother Crafton knew she could not do much, but she attacked a particularly egregious insult - men who made 50 cents an hour having to pay 55 cents for a soda. She succeeded in forcing the price to 20 cents, but probably only for as long as the boat was berthed.\nShe has seen other bad things. A Filipino whose village scraped together $1,400 to pay his way to Miami so he could become an $800-a-month assistant chef. All that was available was a messboy's job at $200 a month.\nShe saw a Chinese seaman break his neck and slowly die on a cold December day. She tells of ships abandoned at New York docks and bewildered crews running out of food. Missing fingers are common. Some shipping companies keep such inadequate records that families aren't notified of a death. All they know is that the checks no longer come.\n''You don't have to treat people like dogs to make money,'' declared Mother Crafton, who admits the world labor market is sufficiently glutted that owners can make even more by doing precisely that.\nAnd there is the loneliness. Today's seamen are gone for a year at a stretch, missing children's births, parents' deaths. Mother Crafton fears the effects of the solace many seek from prostitutes. Seamen, she worries, could become Typhoid Mary's carrying AIDS far and wide. She has distributed 30,000 pamphlets warning of the dangers in six languages.\nMother Crafton doesn't force religion on people. But while chauffeuring three Colombian seamen from Red Hook Terminal in Brooklyn to the Fulton Street Mall, she did recall that some of Jesus's apostles were seamen.\n''This is neat work,'' she judged."

      "text": "DHAKA JOURNAL; STARK VILLAGE JUSTICE: MUST THE LOVERS BE FLOGGED?\n1987-06-15T05:00:00.000Z\nDisgraced and threatened with public whipping, the lovers have turned against each other, and their stories, told in sullen monotones, are now at odds.\nBut one thing is certain. Late one recent night, Abdul Jalil and his neighbor's young wife, Khurshida Ali, were caught as they tried to elope, shaming their families and their village of Bholail, which is about 10 miles south of Dhaka.\nNow they faced the judgment of an ancient trial system known as salish, where village elders, mostly tradesmen and small landowners, would exact justice that could include a public whipping or slapping and a forced realignment of the marriages involved.\nAs the salish began, Mr. Jalil, a helper on a minibus who thinks his age is about 25, squatted at dusk in a small courtyard, surrounded by the men and boys of the village as the elders, smoking expensive imported cigarettes, discussed his crime. 'She Tempted Me'\n''I hardly even know her,'' he said of Mrs. Ali. ''She tempted me into it. She made advances.'' The women, who play a secondary role in this Moslem society, were hidden in an adjacent building. Mrs. Ali, if her testimony was needed, was to speak into the courtyard through a darkened window.\nThe salish, increasingly rare in Bangladesh, represents an attempt by village leaders to maintain their traditional feudal control and to cling to age-old customs - such as the subordination of women - in a slowly modernizing nation.\nIt is an illustration of the distance that remains between thousands of isolated villages and the structures of government, which have yet to reach much of the country with paved roads, electricity, water and administrative control. Police Are Not Trusted\nRecourse to the salish also demonstrates a local mistrust of the police, who are described as corrupt and abusive, and of the government court system, which villagers said is slow, complicated and alien to their customs.\n''I am a poor man and I cannot afford to go to the police,'' said Tamizuddin, the father of Mr. Jalil's wife, Hamida.\n''If we go to court we will be trapped in the system,'' said Mr. Tamizuddin, who is a farm laborer. ''The most powerful forces will win and there will be no justice.'' The Antagonists Balk\nBut like the courts of the distant cities, the salish snagged this night on a technicality when the aggrieved husband, a bicycle-rickshaw driver named Mohammad Suruj Ali, failed to appear.\nTwo nights later, the salish was again delayed when the accused himself refused to take part.\nAs a monsoon downpour brought a luminous early dusk to the village and green rice fields, the other principals gathered at the house of a village elder, a cosmetics salesman named Guyashuddin Ahmed, to discuss the case.\nStanding almost unnoticed among them, in the shadows by a postered bed, was Mrs. Ali, a slight woman of 18 with delicate features, wearing a faded red-print sari. The Young Woman's Tale\nA visitor asked for her side of the story.\n''I ran away because my husband couldn't provide for me,'' said Mrs. Ali, the daughter of a subsistence farm laborer. ''I hardly even know the man.''\n''My godmother persuaded me to do it,'' she said without expression. ''I didn't want to go. The boy talked me into it. He said he would take the responsibility. He took me by force. He beat his wife and blood was coming from her mouth and nose.''\nIndeed, Mr. Jalil had recently received a warning from a session of the salish for having beaten his wife, and Mr. Tamizuddin had taken her away from him.\nFrom behind a curtained doorway across the room came a woman's low voice: ''Don't believe her. She's a loose woman. She is lying.'' 'She Played Around'\n''I am not,'' said Mrs. Ali just as quietly. ''I had work in a garment factory.''\n''She didn't work,'' said the voice from behind the curtain. ''She played around. She's a slut. Someone said, 'Come with me,' and she went.''\n''It's not true,'' the young woman said, cracking her knuckles as she spoke. ''He forced me to go with him.''\n''Don't believe her,'' said the voice. ''These are the stories she prepared for the salish.''\nSubhan Sardir, a member of the salish, removed his glasses in a gesture that brought silence to the room.\n''We may or we may not whip them,'' he said of the offending couple. ''But we will probably force them to marry.'' 'Who Will Feed You?'\n''Will you marry him?'' he said, turning on Mrs. Ali. ''You won't? You won't go?'' ''I won't,'' she said. ''How will you eat, all alone in the world?'' he asked. ''Who will feed you?'' ''I'll find some way,'' she said. ''You ran away with that boy and now you refuse to marry him,'' said Mr. Sardir, brandishing a large flashlight and raising his voice. ''You know me. I'll bet you never got a real whipping from your father. I'll show you what a real whipping is.'' He turned to the visitor. ''She'll accept,'' he said. ''She must accept. She has put the whole village to shame and it is our obligation under Islamic law to rectify that shame. We will force her to marry him, and force him to marry her.''\nAt that point Mrs. Ali's husband, the rickshaw driver, entered the room. A soft-spoken man of 25, he looked everywhere but at his wife. 'A Very Simple Girl'\n''Will you take her back?'' Mr. Sardir asked him. ''No,'' said Mr. Ali quietly. ''I feel sorry for her,'' Mr. Sardir said. ''She's a very simple girl and she was deceived by fancy words. But we are doing what we must do.''\n''She is a fallen woman now and nobody else will marry her,'' he said. ''It's the boy's responsibility now to take her as his wife and support her. Otherwise she will starve.'' Mrs. Ali remained standing in the shadow by the bedpost, one bare foot crossed slightly over the other. Both Are Flogged\nWhen the salish convened again, the village elders tried to persuade the accused man and woman to get married but they declined.\nMr. Jalil and Mrs. Ali were flogged in public, he 30 times and she 20 times. Mr. Jalil was fined as well.\n''I want my wife back,'' he told the salish. But his father-in law, Mr. Tamizuddin, said his daughter would never go back to such a man.\nMrs. Ali said, ''I'll work as a maid servant to fend for myself and will never marry again.''"

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-17 00:00:00      \nShort supply, bad weather conditions and increasing demand were the reasons of the price hike, traders claimed The prices of eggs have gone up by Tk15 to Tk20 per dozen in a week. Short supply, bad weather conditions and increasing demand were the reasons of the price hike, traders claimed. While visiting different kitchen markets in the capital on Wednesday, Dhaka Tribune found per dozen of egg was selling at Tk115 to Tk125 which was Tk105 to Tk110 last week. Shohel Rahman, a resident of Farmgate, while speaking to Dhaka Tribune, said: \"I bought a dozen of egg for Tk105 last week, but I paid Tk125 today for a dozen from the same shop.\" \"As there is no one to monitor this price hike, shopkeepers are charging prices as they want,\" he added.  Md Jahir, a trader at Hatirpool Kitchen market area, said: \"I sold per dozen eggs at Tk125 which I sold for TkTk110 a week earlier. \"There is a high demand in the market for eggs, compared to a supply shortage and for that we also had to buy eggs at higher prices than before.\"  The prices per 100 pieces of eggs increased by Tk30 at the wholesale markets. At the wholesale outlets in Karwanbazar, per 100 pieces of brown eggs were selling at Tk890, white eggs at Tk870, local chicken eggs at Tk1,300, Pakistani chicken eggs at Tk1,100 and duck eggs between Tk1,050-Tk1,100.   Abdul Bachir Mona, an egg wholesaler at Karwan Bazar, said: \"Because of adverse weather, there are half of the total supplies of eggs available in the markets now. \"Besides, increasing cost of meat and fish has created an extra demand for eggs which is another reason for the price hike.\" Another wholesaler Iman Ali, said: \"The production of eggs have also decreased, as chickens fell sick or laid fewer eggs. \" However, egg traders also claimed that the hot and humid weather were another reason for which eggs were rotting and to make the cost balance they had to sell eggs at a higher price.  Syed Abu Siddiqui, president of Bangladesh Poultry Industries Association, said: \"Because of the flood, many poultry farms have been damaged.  \"Chicks production have decreased and overall poultry production cost has gone up as feed prices also went up. \" He further said: \"Due to the high cost of production, farm owners were unable to cope up with the demands in the market.\" \"Until the situation becomes normal, egg prices will remain unchanged in the markets,\" he added.

      "text": "With Iraqi Troops at the Truce Line: Where Legions Died, Deathly Quiet\n1989-04-04T05:00:00.000Z\nTwo United Nations officers stood in silence in the Iraqi observation post, peering through binoculars at Iranian positions across a no man's land and a waterway.\nThree red, white and black Iranian flags strained in the breeze above a mountain of sandbags. The two officers, part of the 350-member force monitoring the cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war, scanned the ground 500 yards away on the further shore.\nThey looked out beyond the remnants of a bridge crossing the Shatt al Arab waterway, which makes up southernmost stretch of the boundary between the two nations.\nThe only movement on the opposite banks came from the flags whipping in the warm wind. ''They are all asleep,'' the Iraqi officer said. ''Nothing is going on. Drink your tea peacefully.'' Agatha Christie's Haunt\nFor eight months, about 70 officers from 13 countries have been monitoring the cease-fire from their headquarters in the decaying Shatt al Arab Hotel. The hotel is in Basra, where Agatha Christie once wrote murder mysteries while her archeologist husband excavated nearby.\nThe Iraqis' Southern Bridge post is a forward observation station on the edge of the Shatt al Arab, on the outskirts of Fao, on the gulf. Established before the truce took effect last Aug. 20, the post is a concrete pillbox covered in sandbags with a terrace protected by a crenelated sandbag wall, like a medieval castle.\nAhead, rusty iron pylons sticking from the muddy water mark all that remains of the bridge that Iran built when it captured the Fao Peninsula in February 1986. The rusting hulk of a cargo ship sits 100 yards upstream. Tea on 'Chai Bridge'\n''We call it 'Chai Bridge,' because when the United Nations officers come, we always give them chai,'' the Iraqi officer said, using the word that means tea in the Middle East. He was speaking to the United Nations officers and to the first Western reporter to visit the Iraqi side of the cease-fire line since the truce was declared. As he spoke, the sweet, mint-flavored tea was served by a young soldier wearing a helmet several sizes too big. He carried a battered aluminum tray.\nThe officer told of how the Iraqi Army destroyed the bridge before retaking Fao last April. It was the first of a series of victories that led Iran to agree to peace, leading to the truce in the eight-year war.\n''They couldn't run away,'' he said of the Iranians. ''So they surrendered or jumped into the water.''\nIts business done, the United Nations team prepared to leave the post. A convoy of white vehicles bearing United Nations insignia drove slowly back across 300 yards of no man's land to the immense earth wall that the Iraqis have built along the Shatt al Arab. It marks the cease-fire line on this section of the front. A Rust-Choked Waterway\nThe Southern Bridge post is legitimately in Iraqi hands because it was established before the truce took effect. But under the truce, the strip of land running from the earth wall to the river bank, as well as the Shatt al Arab itself, is a no man's land. Only the United Nations observers may enter there.\nIn 1980, when the war started, President Saddam Hussein said one of his goals was to re-establish Iraqi sovereignty over the entire Shatt al Arab, which is now shared by the two nations. For at least 500 years the two countries have been fighting over the waterway, which is now clogged with sunken ships, silt and unexploded munitions.\nBy day and night, the United Nations soldiers, working in two-man teams, patrol 250 miles of the Iraqi Army's forward positions. ''Always of different nationalities,'' said Col. Ousman Goudiaby, a Senegalese who is second in command in the southern sector. ''It makes us more objective.''\nUnder the truce, the Iranian and Iraqi armies are supposed to maintain the forward positions they held on the day the cease-fire was delcared. No new trenches, no new gun placements, no new fortifications and no more firing.\nPeace talks have been under way since the truce was declared, but progress is slow. Iraq still controls some parcels of Iranian territory, and the two countries hold 100,000 war prisoners. A round of talks scheduled for late March was postponed, and Iraqi officials say they do not expect the two sides to meet before the end of April. Observers With Tied Hands\nSo every day, the observers on this side of the front inspect the Iraqi positions and note complaints about violations. On the other side, another United Nations team patrols Iran's defenses.\n''But all we can do is ask the local commander to correct a violation, and if he doesn't do so, report it to higher authority,'' Colonel Goudiaby said.\nUnited Nations and Iraqi officers say the cease-fire has become a way of life in the Fao area, with few violations reported by either side. But further north, just north of Basra, it is a different story, with the Iranian Army deliberately flooding a section of no man's land to force Iraq to abandon forward positions on Iranian territory.\nThe flooding has provoked artillery duels as the Iraqis try to knock out the pumps and the Iranians fire back. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the United Nations has called the flooding a ''serious violation'' of the cease-fire. The United Nations observers consider the big earth dams that the Iraqi Army is building to keep out the water no more than a technical cease-fire violation. 'The Cease-Fire Is Solid'\nThe Iraqi Army was cooperative as the observers inspected several miles of the earth wall. Military policemen in red berets and white belts snapped to attention and saluted as the convoy passed through check points. Soldiers on guard duty presented arms. Bayonets flashed in the sun.\nIraq's defensive wall is 15 to 20 feet high, with a cement-lined trench cut into the top where armed soldiers stand guard. The guards sleep in dugouts in the base of the wall. Every 100 yards or so is a heavy-gun emplacement.\nAs the United Nations team drove past, its members noticed an a few recoilless rifles mounted in emplacements, usually under a tarpaulin. But most of the time the emplacements were empty. ''The atmosphere is relaxed,'' said Maj. Huq Belal, a Bangladeshi operations officer. ''The cease-fire is solid.''\nAfter inspecting Southern Bridge, the United Nations team struck back inland across the devastated moonscape left by the Fao fighting. In the once-busy oil port of Fao itself, only the mosque stands. The Ziggurats of Babylon\nThe rest of the town is rubble. Scarcely a brick remains on a brick. The oil terminal is a jungle of twisted steel. Where the refinery once stood, the oil tanks have been crushed like empty soft drink cans.\nFrom time to time, the radio crackled to life inside the air-conditioned United Nations vehicles. An Iraqi unit that found Iranian bodies further north asked for help in returning them to Iran.\nA message went through to the United Nations headquarters on the Iranian side. Once both sides agree, a truck flying the United Nations flag will arrive to remove the remains.\nOutside Fao, the flat, marshy land appears empty of civilians. Villages are deserted ruins. Every mile or so, clusters of man-made hills stand topped with antiaircraft guns, reminiscent of the ziggurats built by the kings of Babylon. Forlorn Groves of Dates\nThe groves of date palms, once among the finest in the Middle East, have become a swampy jumble of blackened stumps, spent shell cases and rusting tank tracks. Telegraph poles lean drunkenly across the road, shot through with bullet holes.\n''When you are from a developing country, you know better what all this destruction means,'' Colonel Gudiaby said softly in French. ''You are happy to help stop it.''"

      "text": "Governments Start Preparing for Global Warming Disasters\n1989-11-14T05:00:00.000Z\nIN the quickening international debate over global warming, the spotlight has played mostly on the question of how and whether to control the growing emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.\nNow another concern is starting to come to the fore as well. No matter what action is taken, some scientists say, there are already enough of these ''greenhouse'' gases in the atmosphere to cause a major warming, and more are certain to accumulate before the buildup can be halted.\nAs a result, climatologists, social scientists, planners and government officials are beginning to focus on how society might adapt to rising sea levels, shifting agricultural zones, changing climates and other problems that global warming would bring if it occurs on a significant scale.\nAlready, state and local governments along the coast of the United States are starting to plan for a possible long-term rise in the sea level, and a few have taken action to cope with it. In the Netherlands, planning is well advanced for an expansion of that country's system of dikes, dunes and other coastal defenses, and the Dutch are also offering their expertise to Indonesia and the Maldives.\nAgricultural researchers are stepping up efforts to develop heat-resistant and drought-resistant crops that might gradually replace traditional crops if the climate changes.\nAnd the electric power industry in America is planning how to meet the increase in the demand for power for air-conditioning that would surely result from global warming. In one of the first studies, the Electric Power Research Institute has calculated that for every 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit in climatic warming, power demand in the summer would rise 2 to 3 percent in the New York metropolitan area - enough to have a sizable effect on the region's limited generating capacity.\nThese stirrings are somewhat tentative, both because of uncertainty about the whole question of global warming and because of a tendency on the part of some environmentalists and politicians to play down the question of adaptation for fear it will divert attention from what they see as an overriding need to limit production of the greenhouse gases.\nBut reining them in is bound to be difficult. The world economy runs on fossil fuels, and burning these fuels generates increasing amounts of carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas. Weaning the world away from them is likely to be a long and costly business. For developing countries especially, fossil fuels are tightly linked to prospects for development and a better life for their peoples, leaving those countries reluctant to give up the fuels.\nAs the difficulty of reducing greenhouse emissions has come home, the focus has shifted somewhat ''from prevention to a focus on adaptation,'' said Michael H. Glantz of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. Dr. Glantz, a social scientist, heads a group that studies the impact of climatic change on societies. And while a number of environmentalists, scientists and officials continue to believe that the first priority should be a reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases, some are now saying that adaptation must be considered as well.\nIn a report to President Bush earlier this year, the National Academy of Sciences argued that adaptive measures should be assigned a high priority. ''We are already irrevocably committed to major global change in the years ahead,'' the report said, expressing the view prevalent among climatologists. ''The elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases produced to date by human activities will persist for many centuries and will slowly change the climate of the earth, regardless of our actions.''\nStill, although many scientists agree on the broad outlines of global climate change, the system is so complex they cannot predict exactly how great the change will be or when and how it will affect specific regions.\nThis uncertainty means that in planning for a broad range of long-term activities like coastal development, construction of ports, location of waste-disposal sites, water projects and agricultural enterprises, flexibility is crucial, the academy told Mr. Bush.\nIn studying and planning for the expected impact of global warming, the Environmental Protection Agency is emphasizing this need for flexibility. ''You've got to leave yourself leeway,'' said John Hoffman, the director of the agency's global change division.\nThe planning options for industrialized countries, with all their resources, are numerous, the academy's report said. But that is not the case for many developing countries. For instance, a one-meter rise in sea level, which some experts consider likely by the end of the next century, would cover broad areas of Bangladesh, Indonesia and Southeast Asia holding some of the world's largest populations and richest agricultural lands. Those countries, experts say, simply do not have the resources to deal with such a disaster.\nSome experts, moreover, express concern that the industrialized countries, following a well-documented human tendency, will not take adaptive action until disaster is near, when it may be too late. The Science Complexity Makes Prediction Chancy\nIn the greenhouse effect, energy from the sun is trapped in the earth's atmosphere by carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons and other trace gases. The more gases, the more heat is trapped.\nCarbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas, is emitted by the burning of fossil fuels. Scientists say atmospheric concentrations of all these gases combined have increased from about 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide at the start of the industrial age almost 200 years ago to the equivalent of 400 parts per million today. At the present rate of increase, scientists say that the level will grow to 570 parts per million, more than double the pre-industrial level, possibly as early as 2030.\nScientists calculating from mathematical models of the earth's atmosphere say this doubling could cause the atmosphere to warm by 3 to 8 degrees Fahrenheit. By comparison, the atmosphere has warmed by about 9 degrees since the end of the last ice age. But climatic and atmospheric change is so complex that there is great uncertainty about the predictive accuracy of the models.\nHow long it will take for maximum warming to be reached is uncertain because the oceans slow such warming. Most scientists expect the maximum warming to take place by the second half of the next century.\nIf change is slow enough, the Environmental Protection Agency said earlier this year in a report to Congress, adaptation may be manageable. But a sudden or rapid change, it said, might make it problematic. Sea-Level Rise Defending Coasts Is a Concern\nA rise in sea level is ''one of the most certain impacts of climate change,'' the agency said in its report to Congress. Higher global temperatures would probably cause glaciers to melt, as well as leading to an expansion of the oceans because warm water occupies a larger volume of space than cold water. If levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere double, sea levels will rise; estimates of the average rise are from 1.5 feet to 6.5 feet. Some leading experts regard a rise of 1 meter, a little more than three feet, as most likely. They expect it to occur gradually in the next century, affecting coastal areas where about a billion people, a quarter of the world's population, now live.\nIn adapting to global warming, ''the primary issue is coastal defense,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund. ''Planning for sea-level rise must be done decades in advance of the actual unfolding of the consequences. If you're going to protect such areas with seawalls, or carry out a careful retreat of populations, which will be inevitable in some cases, or protect houses, those are measures that must be planned many decades ahead of time.''\nGjerrit P. Hekstra, an ecologist in the environmental protection branch of the government of the Netherlands, said defending a settled coastline or coastal city from rising seas requires ''a complete restructuring of your hydrological infrastructure - ship channels, dikes, canals, rivers, everything.''\nDr. Hekstra's country has been doing that for many decades, and the experience of the Netherlands may prove instructional for much of the rest of the world. For the Dutch, adapting to a sea-level rise means simply an expansion of the elaborate, modern coastal defense system it has developed in the last 30 years. Government studies have shown that to protect the country from a sea-level rise of 1 meter will require an investment, over the long term, of up to $10 billion. The Netherlands has already spent $15 billion on coastal defense in the last three decades.\nCoastal defense means building dikes and piling up sand on the coast to strengthen dunes and sculpting rivers and canals to keep sea water from penetrating the soil and ruining both fresh water supplies and agricultural land. Dr. Hekstra said it is his opinion as a private ecologist that all this is well within existing technology and requires only money.\n''So I don't think your country and my country is the real problem,'' he said. That is not to minimize the problem, he said, since the United States would have to spend billions of dollars to defend coastal cities and developments against a one-meter rise in sea level and might well have to abandon some low-lying regions altogether.\n''We can cope,'' Dr. Hekstra said. ''But not Indonesia, not Bangladesh, not Vietnam. They don't have the resources to do it. Who's going to pay the bill for the developing countries?'' In the United States, the E.P.A. has made extensive studies of the effect of a rise in the sea level, and most coastal states are beginning to plan for it. Questions being examined include not only coastal defense but matters like beach erosion and the intrusion of salt water into rivers and bays where it would foul drinking-water supplies. Possible solutions to salt-water intrusion include the construction of barrier dams in estuaries and canals to divert the salt water from drinking water intakes. Close attention is also being paid to the control of hazardous-waste disposal sites in areas likely to flood.\nMost of the efforts are in early stages. But ''I haven't talked to a single coastal state that isn't doing some hard thinking about this and where the government is starting to put together some plans,'' said Thomas W. Curtis, the director of the natural resources group of the National Governors' Association.\nSouth Carolina, North Carolina, Maine and Florida, with sea-level rise in mind, have all enacted standards designed to control construction on their shorelines. Water Resources Shortages Likely For California\nSome predictions of climate change, admittedly chancy, forecast drier conditions for much of the American West, with serious consequences for a region where water scarcity is already a major factor of life and prosperity. The E.P.A. study for Congress, for instance, found that California's water demand could increase, even as water supplies decrease. The decrease would come about partly because more snow would melt in the winter and less in the summer. Since reservoirs do not have the capacity to store all the winter runoff, spring and summer water supplies would drop.\nExperts say that a number of adaptive measures could help in such a situation. These could be as simple as lining irrigation systems so that less water is wasted or expensive solutions like building larger reservoirs or even such a harsh measure, should water become scarce enough, as imposing high prices on it.\n''Despite a growing awareness of the problem, the institutions involved in managing our water resources are not really taking account of the greenhouse effect,'' said Peter H. Gleick, director of the global environment program of the Pacific Institute for Studies in Development, Environment and Security, a nonprofit research institute in Berkeley, Calif.\n''The difficulty is that we don't know how precipitation patterns are going to change,'' said Dr. Oppenheimer of the Environmental Defense Fund. This, he said, underscores the limitations of adaptation. Agriculture Crop Adaptation Seems Promising\nNo more critical activity stands to be profoundly affected by global warming than agriculture, but scientists also consider it one of the most adaptable.\nAlmost all the crops now grown in the United States, for example, originally came from some other part of the world and were adapted to this continent.\nBuilding on this tradition, the Federal Department of Agriculture is preparing to ease the way for whatever transplants might be required by global warming. Jim Duke, an economic botanist at the department's research center in Beltsville, Md., has been collecting data for some years on the temperature and rainfall conditions in which 1,000 agricultural plants flourish. He is now preparing to use this data in mathematical models of climate, which would tell what crops would adapt best if, for instance, New York's average temperature rose three degrees and its rainfall also increased.\nThe E.P.A. report to Congress said that warming might force abandonment of 10 to 50 percent of the Southeast's agricultural acreage.\n''We might lose the conventional crops'' in the Southeast, said Dr. Duke. ''But assuming we didn't go dry, we would bring in semitropical crops. It's just a matter of selecting variety. We could bring in a wealth of tropical fruits and vegetables.''\nAt the same time, agricultural researchers around the world have long been striving, through both genetic and cultivation techniques, to make many crops more adaptable to harsh environments. Gary Evans, a special assistant for global change issues at the Department of Agriculture, said, ''We are augmenting most of our current plant-stress programs with an eye to what would take place if temperature or moisture shifted.''\nResearchers are also striking out in new directions with important implications for adaptation to global warming. At the University of Arizona, for instance, researchers led by Carl N. Hodges are experimenting with getting plants to grow in sea water. If they succeed, the technique could save fresh water in arid areas near oceans.\nIn Israel's Negev Desert, a team led by Yosef Misrahi of Ben Gurion University of the Negev is growing fruits and nuts at temperatures higher than 115 degrees. In the same area, the Jewish National Fund, the Israeli agency in charge of forestry and land conservation, is experimenting with a genetically improved species of loblolly pine, using seedlings donated by the Georgia-Pacific Corporation. Much of this sort of research is directly related to the prospect of global warming. Prospects Seeds of Change In Hurricane\nEven before Hurricane Hugo, Charleston, S.C., was attuned to two of the major effects scientists expect from global warming: a rising sea level and more frequent and more potent hurricanes. It had already required new buildings near the shore to be built far enough off the ground to escape flooding, which they did in the hurricane. The city had also begun installing pumping stations to insure proper drainage, unlike the situation with sewers that work by gravity, which do not drain when rising water covers their outlets.\nBut the hurricane certainly made a difference. ''The hurricane deepened our resolve,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley of Charleston said, ''and made us more confident that our decisions along those lines were wise ones, and it certainly deepened our commitment to new ways of thinking and acting.''\nThat, according to the conclusions of a study directed by Dr. Glantz of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, is how action to combat a long-term threat usually gets started. A number of case studies sponsored by the center found that a catalyst was usually necessary before governments would act. Once they did act, ad hoc responses were favored over longer-term, planned responses.\nThese responses, the study concluded, ''have often built into the existing social structures an additional degree of rigidity'' that make it more difficult to adapt flexibly.\nThose charcteristics illustrate the difficulties of adaptation, Dr. Glantz said, especially in a situation so fraught with uncertainty as global warming, where the threat, however serious it ultimately proves to be, may not become readily apparent for years or even decades."

Seventeen people are also missing, seven injured, and some 3,500 have been forced out of their homes following a series of landslides and building collapses, Civil Defense officials said. Television footage showed images of overflowing rivers, flood neighborhoods and trees and utility poles knocked over by the rushing water. Several highways have also been cut by the flooding, and scores of bridges have been knocked out. Most of the victims were killed in landslides or buried in destroyed homes. At least two children were listed among the dead. The heavy rain and flooding is also hitting the nearby states of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo. Rainfall in the region has been the heaviest since records were first kept 110 years ago, the National Institute of Meteorology said. In one 24-hour period, the Minas Gerais state capital Belo Horizonte recorded 172 millimeters of rain. Forecasters said the rain is expected to taper off on Sunday, but authorities warn that the danger of landslides remains high, especially in the Belo Horizonte area. The deluge coincided with the first anniversary of the dam collapse in the Minas Gerais town of Brumadinho that killed 270 people. Eleven people are still listed as missing. An accumulation of water and a lack of drainage caused the tailings dam rupture on January 25, 2019, according to a report commissioned by the mining firm Vale."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-17 00:00:00      \n As the nation observes the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the people of Pabna feel nostalgic because of his association with Nagarbari ferry terminal and 'Mujib Bandh', a flood control embankment along Padma and Jamuna rivers. Shekar Theke Shikhore, a large monument with a 26-foot-tall sculpture of Bangabandhu, was inaugurated on February 2 in 2018, on the premises of Dhobakhola Coronation High School in Bera upazila's Natiabari, six kilometres from Nagarbari ferry terminal. A brief history of Bangladesh from the battle of Polashi to the 1971 Liberation War have been depicted in plaques set beside the monument. Former lawmaker of Pabna-2 constituency Khandaker Azizul Haque Arzu contributed to making the monument. \"We demand establishing a museum here, so that locals as well as visitors from different areas can learn better about Bangabandhu,\" said freedom fighter Fazlu Master. There are also demands for taking initiative to keep alive the memory of Bangabandhu at other places associated with Bangabandhu.  On February 26 in 1972, Bangabandhu, then prime minister of independent Bangladesh, himself carried a pot of soil and put it at Bashantapur point of Nagarbari in Pabna's Bera upazila, marking inauguration of the construction of a flood protection embankment on the Padma and the Jamuna rivers. Locals named the 157.5-kilometre-long embankment 'Mujib Bandh', in fond memory of Bangabandhu. \"Once flooding by Padma and Jamuna rivers caused damage to crops in vast areas of Pabna every monsoon. Before the 1970 elections, Bangabandhu pledged to make a flood control embankment on the two mighty rivers,\" said Abdul Kader, chairman of Bera upazila parishad, also a witness of the day. After the independence in 1972, Bangabandhu inaugurated construction of the embankment at Nagarbari, himself putting soil at Bashantapur point. Inspired by Bangabandhu, locals worked together to construct the huge embankment, which helps the farmers in Pabna to get crops three times a year,\" he added. \"Nagarbari was the lone gateway of the northern districts in 60s and 70s. Bangabandhu travelled several times in Pabna and other northern districts for his political activities through Nagarbari ferry terminal. He held a rally for the historic Six-point demand in 1966 at Nagarbari ghat on his way to northern districts,\" said Md Rafique Ullah, chairman of Puran Varanga union parishad in Pabna's Bera upazila.  \"Now there is no trace of the ferry terminal as the river changed its course. Most of the people of that time also passed away,\" he said. \"Bangabandhu came to Pabna in 1948, 1952, 1954, 1964, 1966, and 1970 and addressed rallies at different places including Nagarbari, Pabna Town Hall and Ishwardi upazila to motivate people for joining movements for realising their rights,\" said Dr Anwarul Islam, pro-vice chancellor of Pabna University of Science and Technology, also a researcher on Bangabandhu. \"After independence, he visited many places in Pabna in connection with important public affairs. It is our duty to preserve Bangabandhu's memory at the institutional level for the future generation,\" he said.  "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-15 00:00:00      \nThe Rajshahi prison authorities have moved to grab at least 100 acres of char land in the Padma river in the city's Sreerampur to build Prisons Training Academy complex. They have already been occupying four acres of the Padma char for the last three years claiming ownership though the law allows none but the government to own any piece of land gained by a river.  A number of prison officials have claimed that a proposal was sent to the land ministry in May last year for taking out a \"permanent lease\" on the 100-acre char land and the process to get the ministry's approval was at the final stage. Deputy Inspector General of Prisons in Rajshahi Altab Hossain said they proposed to the land ministry for the lease. He, however, declined to go into details of the process. Contacted, Sebastin Rema, deputy secretary of the land ministry, on Sunday said the ministry was yet to receive any such proposal. But this correspondent saw some official documents that suggest the prison authorities sought the land from the ministry more than once showing it as a \"newly emerged char\". Locals say the land remains submerged during the rainy season. \"The site was selected as no other suitable place was found,\" the DIG prisons told this correspondent at his office on May 2.   He said they wanted to build the academy by the river, and its playground and combat training ground on the 100-acre river land. Any construction on the river land would require some activities like river training and river filling to stop the inundation of the areas below the city protection and flood control embankment, added the official. Citing Bangladesh Land Management Manual 1990, Rajshahi ADC (revenue) Alamgir Kabir said any river char -- even if it emerges afresh -- would be absolutely owned by the government. The prison authorities have some 2.08 acres of char recorded in their name in the Revisional Survey but the government would be the owner of the land as per the law, he said. Rajshahi Deputy Commissioner SM Abdul Kader says the government has the authority to lease out the land, but he has no idea about any process of land acquisition by the prison authorities. He said it was learnt that the jail authorities were claiming some land in the river but he didn't know how much has been occupied. \"In Rajshahi, we noticed some private ownership claims over river land. In other parts of the country, river land is owned solely by the government.\" Last month, the prison authorities started felling trees of a forest in the area for construction of the academy complex. After cutting down 66 trees, they backed off amid protest from locals. The forest is known to have some 100-year-old trees.  The prison officials say there are about 5,000 trees on the Rajshahi Central Jail's property where construction of the academy's infrastructure was underway. They marked some 800 trees for felling to make room for the infrastructure. The DIG prisons says they would consider keeping the old trees untouched while constructing the academy buildings. The country had no other training facility for prison officials and guards before 1995 when the Prisons Training Academy was established in Rajshahi. After a hectic lobbying, it got the government approval in August 2014. Since its inception, the academy has been functioning with accommodation support from the Rajshahi Central Jail. On the jail's property, the academy's commandant has an office in a three-room one-storey building while there are three corrugated iron sheet buildings for trainees to stay and another for holding classes. The academy offers physical, theoretical, and combat trainings for the prison officials and guards. So far, it held basic training courses for six batches of jail superintendents, 10 batches of deputy jailors, and 42 batches of male and female prison guards. Due to lack of infrastructure, the academy sometimes holds training courses at other facilities. For example, it conducted a basic training course for prison guards at Kashimpur Jail in Gazipur in 2016.   In June 2015, the Ecnec approved a Tk 73.42-crore project for constructing infrastructures for the academy on the land of Rajshahi Central Jail. The prison compound is on 18.8819 acres, which is part of 65.4070 acres of the jail's property. Out of the rest 46.5251 acres, the authorities have allotted 37.1335 acres for the academy.      The Public Works Department began constructing the academy's infrastructure dividing the work into 12 packages in 2016. Construction of the administrative building, academic block, barracks for male and female trainees, quarters and dormitories for officials and staffers is going on. Floating of tender is underway for water supply, electrification, fire-fighting and tree plantation. The prison authorities have also proposed a 443-strong organogram for the academy to the home ministry. According to some official documents this correspondent managed to see, it was around the same time the Ecnec approved the project, the prison authorities proposed acquiring the 100-acre river land. And another proposal was sent in May last year. During a visit to Sreerampur, this correspondent saw that the prison authorities have put up more than half a dozen signboards on the flood control embankment of the river. The signboards declare the river land by the embankment as the proposed site for the academy. Two of the signboards carried description of the already occupied four acres of the river land. Below the embankment and towards the river on the south, the authorities demarcated a huge portion of the river land using bamboo poles with red and yellow flags, and set up a checkpoint in the middle. A sentry deployed there said the checkpoint has been in place since February 2017. \"You've to occupy your own land,\" the DIG prisons said, claiming that records show the four-acre river land belongs to them."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-01 00:00:00      \nIn conversation with guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend on his memories of \"Goodbye Summer Concert for Bangladesh\" Goodbye Summer, a rock concert in aid of famine relief of Bangladesh on Sunday September 18, 1971, was not the only Bangladesh related rock event that summer in the UK. Though far less remembered than the ground-breaking event with George Harrison, Ravi Shankar, Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr et al six weeks earlier in Manhattan, the day-long festival at the Oval cricket ground in South London had its own rock superstars. Headlined by The Who and The Faces in their Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood heyday, it drew about as many people in one sitting as the two shows, (matinee and evening) of the historic Concert for Bangladesh in New York on Sunday, August 1, 1971. Here is a conversation with guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend on his memories of the event. Pete Townshend is happy to answer the question and waxes lyrical with a paean to growing up in a multicultural part of West London (\"a mixed-race place\") Unsurprisingly given the years that have past, he veers between remembering some things in detail, and saying \"I don't remember the concert\" (With thanks to Deborah Bonetti, Foreign Press Association Director for reading out my question and prompts) Do you have any memories of the \"Goodbye Summer Concert for Bangladesh\" at the Oval cricket ground on September 18, 1971? Pete Townshend: I remember it very well, I can't actually remember the concert. I remember the event. Rod Stewart kicked out I think 500 footballs into the crowd, which caused absolute chaos because they kept bouncing around two or three hours, all the way through our show Fun with the Faces I remember getting very drunk. Because the Faces used to know how to have a good time. They were good fun and Ronnie Lane was my best friend (he was the bass player in the Faces) we hung out and had fun Drive home I tried to give (my manager Chris Stamp's) ex-wife a lift home and she started kicking off. She was in bad shape. I pushed her out of the car and she went through a shoe shop window and I thought she would be dead. So, I wasn't feeling particularly charitable ... Pushed out of a car while driving?  No, no. We stopped the car and then pushed her out. She staggered back and (then) went through a shoe shop window On not mentioning the Oval concert in memoirs Roger's actually strange, why would he not mention that? I don't suppose I mentioned it either. I suppose it's because in a sense if you mention something like that you feel like you're bragging. I know that we did lots of amazing charitable breakthroughs On charity gigs Double O, my charity, was started by The Who (in 1976) to help Erin Pizzey start the Women's refuge system. She ran the first women's refuge in the world in Chiswick in the UK, and subsequently other charities. Double O went on to be a charity that became well known for helping people with drug problems, putting them through rehab and so on. And more recently, the teen cancer (Teenage Cancer Trust) stuff that we do, so we've always done that stuff On the Oval concert and growing up in 'a really mixed place' The thing about Bangladesh was ... These were our people. People that don't know about London, people that think, oh well its's just a big conurbation full of all different kinds of people. In West London, we grew up in a really mixed race place. Polish, Japanese, lots of Jewish people, mainly from Poland, but also from Russia. People from Somalia, I think we brought in ten thousand Somalians after the War (WWII). So, these were kids of our age from the Caribbean (and Bangladesh). The Bangladeshis tended to work very hard, so we respected them. We adored them and you know we wanted to help. It was a terrible tragedy (flood wasn't it, I think it was). We were honoured to be able to help and... I feel the same way now. I know the difference between somebody from India and somebody from Bangladesh. (pause) And, also somebody from Pakistan.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-12 00:00:00      \nParents dream of financial security, advancement  Unable to bear the cost of their children's education, many parents push them into work in the transport sector with dreams of financial security and advancement, employers, transport leaders and experts told Dhaka Tribune. While visiting the Amin Bazar, Gabtoli, Mohammadpur, Sutrapur, Jatrabari and Kachpur areas, it was seen that a significant number of children were employed on human haulers, as well as in automobile workshops and battery recharging shops. The employers claimed the children were employed as per the wishes of their parents.  Md Bulu, owner of Janani Engineering Workshop in Gabtoli, said although a number of children and teenagers were employed at the workshop, they were all well taken care of and trained in the necessary skills to succeed in the industry. \"Children who leave the workshop in search of better earnings often go astray and fall into drug addiction,\" he added. Meanwhile, a workshop owner in Amin Bazar and another in Sutrapur urged the government to set up a mechanism to measure and certify the skills of children trained in the workshops, to ease their progress in the industry. Challenges to addressing child labour in transport sector Experts said the informal nature of the transport sector made it difficult for the government to bring discipline to it. The Labour Act prohibits employing children under the age of 14 in hazardous work, but the act is not applicable for the informal sector. Save the Children Director (Child Rights Governance and Child Protection) Abdullah Al Mamun said listing the names of child labours would help monitor the rate of enrolment of children in the transport sector. He also said that among the 38 types of child labour categorized as hazardous, the transport sector offers some of the highest salaries. Education and Development Foundation (EDUCO) specialist (child labour) Afzal Kabir Khan said money was not the only reason many children were employed in the transport sector.   A number of parents push their children into child labour as they are unable to monitor them properly owing to their own jobs, he added. \"Many parents tell employers they cannot take care of their children as they both have jobs, and they wish for a successful person to take care of them so that they do not end up committing crimes and become addicted to drugs,\" Afzal said, mentioning that the parents harbour hopes of their children's quick advancement in life and starting their own business. During a presentation in April this year, INCIDIN Bangladesh Executive Director AKM Masud Ali said many boys were dropping out of school to join the workforce, as their parents were unable to bear the cost of education. The current state of child labour in Bangladesh Comparing data on child labour in the country in 2003 and 2013, from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and International Labour Organization (ILO) Bangladesh, Bangladesh Shishu Adhikar Forum (BSAF) said the number of child labourers decreased from 4.7 million to 1.7 million. However, the number of children employed in hazardous work only decreased from 1.3 million to 1.2 million over the same period.   Experts and transport workers said a number of initiatives to address child labour were taken after the first survey in 2003, but political turmoil from 2005-2008 hampered the initiatives.  The Awami League government once again prioritized child rights after coming to power in 2009, bringing significant improvement until 2013. However, the initiatives appear to have had little impact on the numbers of children in hazardous work, the experts added. Subsequently, the government made a list of 38 categories of hazardous work. Transport sector related work on the list includes truck, three-wheeler, and bus helpers, as well as automobile workshop and battery recharging shop workers. Although the categories have been made, the country is yet to collect data on how many children are employed in each category of hazardous work. BSAF said surveys show that about 25.4% of child labours work in transportation. Experts also said the number of underage bus helpers has decreased over time, and most child labourers are employed on three-wheelers and in workshops. Political willingness crucial to preventing child labour in transport sector EDUCO specialist Afzal Kabir Khan said the government has taken a number of initiatives to reduce child labour, but few of them were targeted at the transport sector. Save the Children's Abdullah Al Mamun said political willingness is crucial to preventing child labour in the transport sector, and some of the government's activities had raised questions over they had effectively rectified the convention related to minimum working age. The country has ratified 33 conventions related to child labour.  Mamun said the government has made education compulsory until grade 8, but a surprisingly large number of children still dropout before this point. A large number of them go into work in the transport sector. \"If the government can ensure that no one drops out before the age of 14 and implements courses on ICT training, the problem could have a good solution,\" he said, mentioning that children may be more eager to receive ICT training than traditional vocational training such as livestock rearing.  EDUCO specialist Afzal Kabir Khan said a special social safety net program is needed for child labourers.    Meanwhile, BSAF Director Abdus Sahid Mahmood pointed out that a lack of monitoring mechanisms and government willingness is making the child labour situation worse. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Chairman Kazi Reazul haque said monitoring child labour is a complex issue, and suggested the government form a Child Directorate to coordinate between government institutions and address child labour. The government reiterated its promise to eliminate child labour from the country by 2025 when adopting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). According to the law, a court can slap a maximum Tk5,000 fine on the employer and maximum Tk1,000 fine on parents for child employment.   The National Child Policy 2011 called for ensuring a child friendly environment at workplaces. Furthermore, it said that the cost of treatment from any accident at the workplace would be borne by the employers. "

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang inaugurated the meeting at Dalian International Conference Center on Tuesday morning, reports BSS. The three-day WEF Annual Meeting of the New Champions 2019, also known as WEF Summer Davos, is being held from July 1-3 under the theme - \"Leadership 4.0 - Succeeding in a New Era of Globalization.\"  More than 1,800 leaders, including heads of state and government, business, civil society and academicians across the world are taking part at the annual meet. Founder and Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab and the Governor of Liaoning Province Tang Yijun spoke at the inaugural session. The meeting will spur leaders to find new strategic models to adapt to the world's environmental challenges, regional competition, economic disparities and technological disruption. Sheikh Hasina will meet Founder and Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab at his office and join a panel discussion on \"Cooperation in the Pacific Rim\" at Dalian International Conference Centre in the afternoon. Earlier on Monday night, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reached Dalian for a five-day bilateral official visit to China at the invitation of her Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. A special flight of Biman Bangladesh Airlines carrying the premier and her entourage members landed at Dalian Zhoushuizi International Airport around 12:15am local time.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-04 00:00:00      \nThe crisis is so severe that the government has declared a nationwide emergency and urgently appealed for help from the international community Pakistan's farmers are struggling to combat the worst locust plague in nearly three decades as insect swarms decimate entire harvests in the country's agricultural heartlands and send food prices soaring. Heavy rains and cyclones sparked \"unprecedented\" breeding and the explosive growth of locust populations on the Arabian peninsula early last year, according to the United Nations. The insects have since fanned out and wreaked havoc on farms from East Africa to India before making their way into Pakistan from the desert on the country's southwestern border with Iran.  The crisis is so severe that the government has declared a nationwide emergency and urgently appealed for help from the international community.  Officials in southern Sindh province fear the infestation will devastate the supply of cotton, the local cash crop, ahead of its harvest in the coming months.  Local surveys of the damage are continuing, but the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture says nearly half of all crops have been destroyed near the port city of Karachi. \"I have not seen an infestation like this one in my career,\" said Shehbaz Akhtar, an agricultural official charged with locust eradication efforts in the village of Pipli Pahar in central Punjab province. 'Combat operation' Local authorities had \"launched a combat operation\" to clear the area of infestation with pesticide sprays, he said.  Clouds of the noxious gas envelop the nearby fields each morning, where villagers gather the husks of dead insects for an official bounty of Rs20 rupees per kg bag. \"We spray twice a day here,\" says Fayyaz Azeem, clad in a face mask and thick industrial gloves on top of a tractor discharging pesticide into rows of crops. But the process is slow and time-consuming, and by the time locusts are killed off in one field they have often already destroyed the next. The pesticides used by officials are also dangerous for consumption, so even when the locusts are dead the remaining crops have to be discarded. Some farmers have been forced to opt for more desperate solutions while waiting for their fields to be sprayed and have attempted to scare off the swarms by shouting and banging pots.  A team of Chinese experts has arrived in Pakistan to survey the crisis, food security ministry chief Muhammad Hashim Popalzai told AFP. Beijing could also offer aerial spraying - a much faster and more efficient method of pest control - and Pakistan may also import pesticides from China. Earlier reports circulating online suggested China was planning to send thousands of ducks to Pakistan to devour the scourge. Pakistani officials said no such plans were being considered. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has also set up meetings between India and Pakistan to prevent the swarms from spreading, Popalzai said. 'What can I do?' Agriculture accounts for 20% of Pakistan's GDP but the sector has already struggled for years in the face of drought and dwindling water supplies. The country is also experiencing 12-year inflation highs, with the cost of sugar nearly doubling and flour prices jumping 15% in the past year. Years without a locust attack meant the government \"had become complacent\" about the risks of a new infestation, said Pakistan Farmers Bureau president Zafar Hayyat. Though he applauded the steps being taken to fight the plague, Hayyat warned of the risk that swarms would return mid-year after the next locust breeding season.  For many farmers in Pipli Pahar, the extermination campaign has already come too late.  Sitting in the corner of a wheat field with her cow, Rafiya Bibi watches the flurry of pesticide spraying around her.  The locusts have already destroyed her crops of canola, sunflower, chili and tobacco, which she had bought after borrowing 45,000 rupees from the government. With no harvest, she has no way to repay the loan."

Water flow to the Baulikhal, which is a branch of the Sari river, has been completely stopped at the confluence by the 400-feet long dam that now serves as a road, locals said. The Baulikhal, also known as the Hidairkhal, merged with the Kapna river 13-km downstream. The Baulikhal was a water source for 18 smaller rivers and canals and 37 haors and beels. People of about 39 villages in Gowainhat depend on these waterbodies, officials and environmentalists said. Alirgaon Union Parishad constructed the dam early last year, they added. Residents of Khola, Budhigaon and Titkulli villages raised Tk 35 lakh for it as they needed better communication across the Baulikhal, said Golam Kibria Helal, general secretary of Gowainghat Awami League, who was chairman of the union parishad at the time. The rest of the money was funded by the union parishad, upazila chairman and local lawmaker. Abdul Karim Kim, general secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon's Sylhet Chapter, said laws and regulations regarding dam construction were not followed while constructing the dam. He added that nearly 50,000 people in the upazila are being deprived of a freshwater source due to the dam. Zahirul Islam, section officer of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) in Sylhet, said, \"The board knew nothing about the construction of the dam. If we were informed, we could have stopped the construction and suggested a suitable and appropriate alternative.\" Former UP chairman Golam Kibria Helal said, \"I supported the dam construction considering the communication problem. \"We knew about the laws regarding rivers but how could we call this a river? Water flowed only during monsoon and it stayed dry during the rest of the year. We believe that we did the right thing.\" Meanwhile, the primary findings of a study, conducted last year in Gowainghat by the Institute of Water and Flood Management (IWFM) of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, showed the negative impact of the dam on the local ecosystem, BWDB officials said. The study, titled \"Feasibility Study for Flood Control, Drainage and Irrigation System at Gowainghat in Sylhet District\", recommended removal of the dam. BWDB Executive Engineer Sahiduzzaman Sarkar said, \"The IWFM is yet to provide the final report of the study. We will remove the dam after getting the report. We may propose construction of a structure that will allow the river to flow as well as maintain road communication.\" On September 3, environmentalists held a rally on the bank of the Rangpani river in Jaintiapur upazila, urging the government to take prompt steps to remove the dam."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-09 00:00:00      \nA slapstick comedy about a ten-year-old boy fervently idolizing Hitler? Jojo Rabbit is indeed a nod to the remarkable power of humour Rainer Maria Rilke, one of the most gifted German poets who is frequently quoted in Jojo Rabbit, appealed to his readers to \"let everything happen\" to them, to delight in the humbling embrace of all beauty and terror. And Taika Waititi's coming-of-age drama Jojo Rabbit is the rare convergence of these two profound, albeit opposite truths of life. Jojo Rabbit is a World War II satire revolving around a German boy named Jojo who joins a Hitler Youth camp and starts having qualms about the Third Reich afterwards when he discovers his mother has hidden a Jewish girl named Elsa in the crawlspace of their house.  A slapstick comedy about a ten-year-old boy fervently idolizing Hitler? Jojo Rabbit is indeed a nod to the remarkable power of humour.  What this miracle of a film does so effectively is that it attempts to take the power away from the fascist narrative and exposes its idiocy through comedy. It sheds light on the buffoonish petulance of the likes of Hitler, but does not reduce the horrors of the Holocaust, rather emasculates its perpetrators with the help of a stellar cast and a balanced script.    Thomasin McKenzie plays a Jewish girl named Elsa in Jojo Rabbit, following her acclaimed performance in 2018's Leave No Trace| IMDb Jojo is a lonely young boy whose father has gone to war, never to come back. He has in turn filled the absence of his father with blind fanaticism. Hitler heils has certainly helped him drown out the noise within his troubled mind. However, upon finding Elsa, constrained by his innate nobility and ostensible cowardice, Jojo slowly begins to question the Nazi juggernaut. Telling this story from a child's perspective is arguably what makes the film work.     Thomasin McKenzie, who plays Elsa, has delivered another brilliantly understated performance following her acclaimed role in Leave no Trace. Elsa - a creative Jewish girl - does not give in to rage; her resilience rises above the oppression inflicted upon her people. She is caged, yet appears to be the embodiment of the strength that keeps the spirit of resistance alive.  On the other hand, Scarlett Johansson, in the vibrant role of Jojo's single mother, manages to pull off one of her career-best performances to this date, by playing an elegantly witty character who is unafraid to go beyond the mere aesthetics of resistance and the good old convenient life for a just cause.   Scarlett Johansson has earned her first two Oscar nominations - Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress - the latter for Jojo Rabbit| IMDb The depiction of Nazis as good people is bound to make certain critics blast this film, much like the fate in store for the Oscar-winning German film The Lives of Others. In light of the current political divide, there is merit to this discussion.   In August, 2017, neo-Nazis paraded the streets of Charlottesville, chanting anti-Semitic slogans. The US President Trump later famously addressed \"the very fine people\" on both sides, pandering to some of his white supremacist base. Consequently, he established a moral equivalence that in all objectivity does not exist.  Thankfully, Taika Waititi is more tactful than that. He succeeds at finding the tricky balance between the evils of fascism and the allures of resistance. There is an astonishing poignancy beneath the surface of humour, and whenever it swells into a crescendo, the transition feels seamless.  As World War II approaches its end in the latter half of Jojo Rabbit, we as audience members find ourselves not laughing along with Hitler. Rather, we are laughing at him, chipping away at his racial hatred. Therein lies the brilliance of Jojo Rabbit. "

From Milan, near the northern epicentre of the crisis, to the capital Rome and Naples and Palermo in the south, social media showed people on their balconies or leaning from windows and singing the national anthem or popular songs over the past couple of days. Yesterday at noon, many people across the country went onto their balconies to offer a round of applause to the doctors and nurses working on the frontlines of the crisis. With the coronavirus pandemic spreading rapidly across the world, Italy is the worst affected country in Europe, with at least 17,660 cases and 1,266 deaths by Friday. Italy's hardest hit area remains the prosperous northern region of Lombardy around the financial capital Milan, but the virus has spread across the country. The government has imposed an unprecedented lockdown, closing schools and most shops, barring all but essential movement and telling people to remain in their homes. On social media, celebrities have urged people to stay at home and to wash their hands regularly. Ordinary Italians have posted a flood of images showing life under lockdown, as well as jokes about the crisis and the difficulty of maintaining domestic harmony. The government and leading public figures have also sought to reassure the public. Hashtags with encouraging messages like #allwillbewell have proliferated as authorities and individuals have tried to maintain a sense of optimism amid the shutdown."

Mounting the land scarcity issue around Dhaka city prompts authorities to re-assess the solid waste management strategy, because generating renewable energy from solid waste not only reduces the land pressure problem, but also generates cleaner energy and better environemnt. A proposal was sent to the Local Government Division, in this regard, Atiqul said while launching a combing operation against dengue-carrying Aedes mosquitoes in the capital on Sunday. The mayor said he had a discussion with the chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Saber Hossain Chowdhury, who is now out of country. \"Upon his return, we will hold a meeting on September 21 at the DNCC and will try to determine a viable solution to mounting solid wastes in the landfills,\" he said. The Standing Committee on Saturday recommended that hefty fines will be realized from the DNCC for polluting environment by dumping municipal solid waste unsystematically at the Aminbazar landfill requisite environmental clearance. \"We are always concerned about ecology and environmental pollution. As an immediate action plan, we [DNCC] have proposed to produce cleaner energy from recycling the solid waste,\" the mayor said. Sources said the DNCC has long been using the Aminbazar landfill for dumping waste without any environmental clearance. As the dumping ground used by DNCC is illegal, the environment department earlier issued letters to the organization, but they did not respond. Dhaka Tribune on August 29 ran a report on \"A landfill in flood flow zone\" that said that Aminbazar landfill, the only landfill for all the DNCC solid waste has turned into an artificial floating island in the flood flow zone near the Turag River, severely damaging the ecosystem. An estimated 2,000 tons of municipal solid waste is dumped on a daily basis from different parts of north Dhaka to the landfill that does not have an environmental clearance certificate from the Department of Environment (DoE). The dumping ground has become over-used from all sides and falls on the path of a flood flow zone near a canal of the Turag River. This untreated garbage is also contaminating the groundwater The Aminbazar landfill was built on 2007 on 52 acres of land. Thereafter,  it was further expanded in 2017, as the solid waste and garbage have exceeded the capacity of the landfill. Since then, it has turned into an open dumping station due to the chaotic disposal of solid waste.  The Environment Conservation Rules-1997 made it mandatory to have an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and maintain sound environmental conditions in all steps of building and operation of landfills. However, the DNCC neither conducted the EIA nor obtained any environmental clearance - a clear violation of the rules."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-17 00:00:00      \nIn light of lockdowns and social distancing measures, most farmworkers are isolated in their homes The sudden outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic is worrying farmers ahead of the Boro paddy harvest season in Jessore, with farmers facing a shortage of workers to bring home their ripe crops in hundreds of acres of land.  In light of lockdowns and social distancing measures, most farmworkers are isolated in their homes, as a result, the upcoming harvesting season is threatened by impediments to harvesting. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) of the district has announced that it will help farmers by providing them with harvester machines at nominal value to harvest crops with less manpower. However, most farmers are unaware of DAE's plan to assist, so they are coming up with awareness campaigns to relieve farmers of their worries, according to district DAE sources. Farmers said the Boro harvest season has begun and they have to begin harvesting their crops in the next 15-20 days. They are facing a manpower shortage and they are not themselves allowed to work due to the lockdowns in place. They fear that their crops will either rot or the annual flood in the upcoming monsoon will ruin their year-long toil. According to the Agricultural Department of the district, over 54,615 hectares of lands are booming with Boro paddy and due to pleasant weather, this year farmers are expecting a good yield. The deputy director of the district DAE, Dr Md Akhtaruzaman, said the authorities had also taken up a scheme to provide 44 harvesters and 18 reapers to the farmers to lessen the need for manpower. He said: \"The Combine Harvester and Reapers will significantly reduce the work and cost of farmers. It can harvest around 1.5 bigha land per hour.\" The official added that the DAE was ready to provide additional farmworkers from other districts if needed, making sure of course that measures were also taken to prevent a spread of the coronavirus virus as well. When asked about the aid promised, most of the farmers said they did not know about the assistance but did appreciate the move. Dr Md Akhtaruzaman said: \"The scheme will only cost Tk250 in every two bigha land. And even if we face a shortage of machines we will employ farmworkers from Satkhira and other districts after consulting medical professionals regarding the necessary safety measures.\""

The prime minister said this in replying to a supplementary raised by Jatiya Party lawmaker Kazi Feroz Rashid in the House during a question-answer session with Speaker Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury. The Leader of the House said her government has reintroduced an automatic signalling system in the capital which had almost gone out of order previously. She said traffic could be controlled manually in some areas, but there are allegations that manual traffic control is ineffective.    Sheikh Hasina said the biggest problem is that city commuters do not follow traffic rules. Referring to the notorious traffic jams in London and Washington, the Leader of the House said traffic jams are now a worldwide problem. She said people are buying more cars as the population's financial solvency is on the rise. In reply to a question from treasury bench member Didarul Alam, the premier said a number of projects were executed in the last 10 years through various ministries and departments, while many schemes are being implemented to ease traffic jams in the capital. If the schemes are implemented, she said, it is expected that Dhaka city will be free from traffic jams very soon. The Leader of the House also said her government is considering implementing projects similar to Dhaka, in Chittagong also, to reduce traffic jams in the port city."

      "text": "Studies Seek Flood Control In Bangladesh\n1989-07-06T05:00:00.000Z\nAs monsoon rains begin to fall again on Bangladesh, the World Bank is mobilizing an international force of scientists and aid officials to draft a comprehensive, long-term plan to save this vulnerable nation from perennial catastrophe.\nWith the height of the flood season still a few weeks away, 58 villages were destroyed in late June by rising water and erosion of banks along six rivers. At least 9,000 families lost their homes, the Government says.\nAfter record-breaking floods last September, in which three of the world's mightiest rivers inundated two-thirds of Bangladesh and left more than 2,000 people dead and millions homeless, four major flood prevention studies were begun.\nIn the last few weeks, all four reports - by the United States, France, Japan and the United Nations Development Program - were completed and turned over to the Government of President H. M. Ershad, diplomats and officials of international agencies said in interviews. Consideration at Summit\nSome proposals are so sweeping as to envisage a multibillion-dollar rebuilding of Bangladesh's river embankments, or the construction of huge dikes or polders to keep away both the rivers and the unpredictable sea.\nThe reports will now be discussed in international forums, including the group of seven leading industrialized nations at a summit meeting in Paris in mid-July.\nAt about the same time, the World Bank will convene a meeting in Washington of scientific experts and officials from donor nations, Francis van Gigch, chief of the World Bank's Bangladesh office, said in an interview.\nWhile Bangladesh waits for international action, the Government has been building embankments around low-lying areas of Dhaka to protect the capital and its airport. Last September, the airport was closed for nearly a week during the flood, delaying the arrival of relief supplies. A Fatal Convergence\nDiplomats and Bangladeshi officials say that last year's flood, caused by a fatal convergence of rising water in all three major river systems, the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna, dealt a heavy blow to an already fragile development process.\nBangladesh, one of the world's poorest and most densely populated nations, suffered millions of dollars in losses to buildings, roads and other essential structures. Untold numbers of farm animals were lost.\nThe findings of the four studies are in agreement on several points, but differ in recommending courses of action. All agree, for example, that projects must be confined to Bangladesh, not the larger region.\nNations in South Asia say it is unrealistic to expect that India, which controls substantial river water, can be brought into a regional discussion. New Delhi has said repeatedly that it will discuss the issue only on a one-to-one basis with its neighbors.\nIn the case of Bangladesh, this has led to a stalemate over an Indian proposal to build a huge canal across Bangladeshi territory to link the Brahmaputra and Ganges Rivers. But the reports on the whole say that better coordination in issuing flood warnings should be possible. Disagreement on Embankments\nAll reports agree that some annual flooding is not only inevitable but beneficial to the agricultural lands of Bangladesh that feed 110 million people. They say that the damages of these ''normal'' floods could be minimized by better warning systems and emergency services inside the country.\nWhere the reports diverge, and enter into political territory, is on the question of embankments.\nThe United Nations Development Program and the French studies advocate the building of more and higher banks along the rivers, a course favored by President Ershad.\nThe American study - prepared for the United States Agency for International Development by the Irrigation Support Project for Asia and the Near East - questions the value of embankments designed for worst-case floods.\nIt puts emphasis on more effective utilization of ground water in dry seasons, lowering the aquifers by pumping through tube wells, and on drainage during rainy periods."

Talking to BSS, the prime minister says that the people of Vietnam should be allowed to decide their own fate. He adds that the whole world is concerned over the situation in Vietnam. Bangabandhu further says, \"I am sure that the peace-loving people of the world, particularly the democratic people of the USA, are in favour of the struggling people of Vietnam.\" INDIA-BANGLADESH ACCORD TO SHARE WATER RESOURCES Bangladesh and India agree to set up a joint power coordination committee in order to share the power resources of the two countries for mutual benefit. Disclosing this at a press conference held today at the conclusion of the first minister-level meeting on water and power resources between the countries, Dr K L Rao, Indian minister for irrigation and power, says that the two governments have already agreed that Tripura and Mizoram of India would receive power from Bangladesh whereas Jessore and some other northern districts of Bangladesh would receive power from West Bengal of India. Dr Rao further informs that the formation and terms of reference of the Joint River Commission have been discussed and agreement reached. The matter would now be finalised by the two governments, he adds. Steps for coordinating flood forecasting and cyclone warning have also been discussed. Meteorological data will be exchanged between the two countries. The question of sharing the water of Ganges, Teesta and other common rivers between Bangladesh and India have also been taken up at the minister-level talks. Dr Rao says that it has been decided that the subject will be discussed at the prime minister level. Earlier, Dr Rao called on Bangabandhu at Gonobhaban and had a 30-minute discussion with the prime minister.   NO TALKS UNTIL PINDI RECOGNISES BANGLADESH Bangabandhu firmly stands by his previous stand that there is no question of joining talks with Pakistan unless it accepts the reality of Bangladesh. Commenting on a Pakistani report that the Indo-Pak summit would be held in Delhi in four or five weeks' time and that Bangabandhu might also take part in the talks, a source close to the Bangladesh government says today that there can be no talks, no discussion and no summit with Pakistan until and unless Bangladesh is recognised as a sovereign people's republic by Pakistan.

Sheikh Russel Nagar Park is a nice change of pace where people come to enjoy the natural scenic beauty filled with vegetation and to open their lungs to the clean and fresh air free of all the pollution.The park also known as the Gymkhana Lake is bordered on its south side by the Morgan School in Deobhog, from where it stretches till the Mobarak Shah Road. With the implementation of vegetation projects and other conservational efforts around the previously abandoned waterbody, the Sheikh Russel Nagar Park has now transformed into a modern eco-park, befitting of a popular recreational spot. The park resembles Hatirjheel, the mid-town drainage and sanitation project of Dhaka. There are walkways, plants along the paths, street lights, and foot lights throughout the area.  There is a meeting pavilion for visitors in the park, a viewing deck, and a walking bridge. There are three beautiful docks surrounding the 410 metre long and 150 metre wide lake. The park also has an open theatre for social events and gatherings. A few other things like toilets for men and women, a swimming pool, a fountain, and a bicycle lane are now being made.  Narayanganj City Corporation began the construction work of this place in November, 2016. Even though construction is not yet complete, it has become popular among people. On Friday evenings, the park is packed with nature lovers and their families and friends.  According to the Local Government Engineering Department of Narayanganj, the area allocated for the Gymkhana Park is 38.5 acre. In July of 2016, Narayanganj City Corporation awarded Ratna Enterprise the tender for building the park on a budget of Tk7.74 Crore.  According to Narayanganj City Corporation, Tk19.14 crore has already been spent to complete the second phase of construction. A third phase of construction worth Tk16.96 crore will be initiated shortly. Locals have welcomed the park and said that people are at last being able to get some fresh air. They do not want the space to be turned into a trade centre or a space for the homeless. Abdur Rahman, general secretary of the Citizens Committee told Dhaka Tribune: \"The park is a blessing for the public. This place was once abandoned and became a hub for various shady activities. This conservation of the lake has made the area beautiful.\" Considering Narayanganj's polluted atmosphere this park will help keep the ecological balance, said AB Siddique, District secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA).  He said: \"There is no space for children to play and no space for plants and trees either in Narayanganj. This park will give the kids a place to spend their time and ensure a fresh environment for people.\" Considering all this, Narayanganj City Corporation has welcomed this new addition to the city."

Bangabandhu is presented the guard of honour by a contingent of the Dogra Regiment. The national anthem of Bangladesh and India are played.  Bangabandhu and Indira Gandhi have had wide-ranging talks on various issues, including the future economic planning and review of the situation in the subcontinent, for a little over three hours.    Speaking at a huge public rally at Brigade Parade Ground in the afternoon Bangabandhu says that the bond between Bangladesh and India is not based on expediency. He maintains that the close bond between the countries exist because the peoples of both countries have unflinching faith in the principles of secularism, democracy, socialism and nationalism. He tells the gathering, \"I bring with me the love and gratitude from the people of Bangladesh for the people of India.\" He is wildly cheered when he says that the liberation of Bangladesh would not have been possible if not for the gallant support of Indira Gandhi and the Indian Armed Forces. The venue of the public meeting turns into a human sea.   The banquet tonight is hosted by Indira Gandhi in his honour. Bangabandhu calls for peace and stability in the subcontinent saying, \"Let there be an end, once and for all, to the sterile policy of confrontation between neighbours. Let us not fritter away our national resources, but to use them to lift the standard of living of our people.\"    Referring to the growing cooperation between Bangladesh and India, Bangabandhu says that geography dictates that the two countries should cooperate in all possible fields, and particularly in the fields of economy, construction of barrages, flood control and taming of the mighty Brahmaputra and Ganges.   Mujib's portrait in currency notes Bangladesh Bank governor discloses that Bangladesh's currency will bear the portrait of Bangabandhu. The currency will be available by the last week of this month. Bhashani NAP extends cooperation The extended meeting of the Bangladesh NAP (Bhashani group) working committee resolves to extend cooperation and give enough time to the Awami League government in materialising socialism, democracy and secularism in Bangladesh. The meeting also calls for immediate measures to arrest the price hike and stop the smuggling of goods.  Mass graves found in Pabna Horrifying signs of barbarism by the Pak Army have been revealed in Pabna after several mass graves were dug open inside the WAPDA office compound. The site had been serving as Pak Army's headquarter in the district. The graves prove that more than 3,000 civilians were slaughtered by the Pak Army.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-06 00:00:00      \nRecently I went to Banani kitchen market for my weekly shopping and I saw, to my astonishment, the retailer putting all the purchased items in several polythene bags which were completely banned in Bangladesh in 2002. How did these banned bags make an entry to our markets despite the government's efforts to popularise jute bags? I believe this is due to the fact that the use of jute bags is not yet mandatory for all products. It was 1980s when polythene bags first entered the Bangladeshi market. They were light, cheap and could be disposed of after being used only one time. The bags quickly gained popularity and captured the market driving out jute shopping bags. However, our experience with plastic shopping bags is not good at all. The disposed bags find their way to detrimentally affect the environment. They reduce the fertility of soil, kill marine animals and disrupt the drainage system. The longstanding flood of 1998 was the outcome of water clogging in the sewerage line with heaps of polythene bags. After that unprecedented flood, the government, in the face of popular demand, enacted the ground-breaking law in parliament to ban plastic shopping bags. This ban left our markets with several alternatives such as bags made of jute, cotton, paper and nylon. Which one do you think is the best? I believe no other alternative is as suitable as jute, given that it has the potential to contribute to our economy and good for the enviornment. Jute was our main exporting item until the arrival of plastic shopping bags in the market. The climate and soil of our country is conducive to the production of jute. Thousands of people used to earn their livelihood through farming jute and manufacturing jute products. However, our jute industries started declining due to the onslaught of polythene bags. But I am sure that we can revive the industry if we can ensure the use of jute shopping bags for packaging all of our daily needs. The use of jute shopping bags will help us clean our environment. Researchers found that one hectare of jute plants sequester over 15 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Jute is fully bio-degradable, compostable and recyclable. It has no harmful effects on the human body or on Mother Nature. Jute leaves have medicinal properties and are eaten as vegetables. Jute is 100 percent non-toxic and its cultivation requires less pesticides and fertiliser. Jute bags are strong, durable and reusable. If it has so many economic and eco-friendly attributes, why will people not use jute bags for shopping and packaging? This is because the use of jute bags has not yet been made mandatory for shopping and packaging of all commodities. The government formulated some rules in 2013 (amended up to 2018) under the provision of Section 22 of the \"Mandatory Jute Packaging Act 2010\", that require businesses to compulsorily use jute bags for packaging only 19 commodities. Therefore, we do not see jute being used much for wrapping except for these 19 commodities. Owing to their limited use, jute shopping bags are still not cheaper compared to polythene bags. This factor coupled with the laxity in enforcing the law has paved the way for illegal trading of plastic shopping bags in the market. Then how can people be made to use jute bags for shopping and packaging all goods? We can do that by bringing an amendment to the existing rules 2013 (amended up to 2018) formulated under Section 22 of the Mandatory Jute Packaging Act 2010 so as to make the use of jute bags compulsory for packaging not only 19 products, but also all other products. If we can do so, the demand for jute will rise and farmers will be more encouraged to cultivate jute. To incentivise farmers, the government could disburse microcredit among them. In addition to that, the government may pay a certain amount of subsidy for manufacturing of jute shopping bags at the initial stage to keep their price reasonable. Once the production goes up, the price of jute shopping bags will come down automatically. At the same time, our law enforcing agencies will need to monitor the market strictly to stop the illegal trading of plastic or polythene shopping bags. Finally, I would like to reiterate that the mandatory use of jute bags can bring back the golden days of our jute sector and stop the illegal trading of plastic shopping bags. The regeneration of jute industries will create more employment opportunities, increase our export earnings, keep our environment clean and advance us towards sustainable development.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-21 00:00:00      \nThe closures of academic institutions for two weeks in response to the Covid-19 pandemic sweeping the globe have caught many of us involved in the academia by surprise. The immediate purpose of the suspension of classes is to ensure social distancing by discouraging our young ones from physically gathering in a crowded place. The intention to stop the novel coronavirus from spreading is noble. However, in all probability, the moratorium is going to be prolonged, and the end is not in sight. All of a sudden, many working parents do not know what to do with the mischief-making adorable little humans in their houses during the daytime. Many teachers do not know how to compensate for the lost time and finish their lesson plans on time. Many students do not know how to negotiate with this unexpected isolation.    For the most, one thing is certain: it means missing classes altogether. Some of the private universities tried to switch to online platform trialling e-teaching. My institution, ULAB, has been using a learning management system--MOODLE--for the last five years or so. We have mostly used it as a supplementary platform for in-class teaching. In response to the closures, we initiated an emergency management protocol and decided to migrate to e-teaching with an aim of delivering lectures, uploading learning materials, and assessing learning progress online. Our faculty members were enthusiastic; many were pro-active enough to adjust and adopt. The response from our students, however, was an eye-opener. It gave us a rare insight into the psychosocial behaviour of our students as well as the lack of nationwide e-structure to support off-campus online teaching. Our tiny effort is a pebble in the pond, and the waves have reached many shores, exposing a critical gap in our broader education sector that lacks emergency preparedness. The unofficial Facebook page of our university is crowded with comments from students who have gone back to their hometowns or villages where they reportedly do not have regular access to the internet. Many of them do not have PCs, laptops or smartphones. Even if they do, they do not have the speed and bandwidth to connect with a live classroom. They are worried about having uninterrupted power supply during a real-time examination. Printing, scanning a document, uploading assignments within a given time are concerns shared by our students. In our response, we tried to remain flexible, offering both synchronous and asynchronous services in multiple avenues and platforms. At the same time, we have realised that our students are the microcosm of a system that screams inadequacy. I am sure many of the students are presenting the problem as larger than it is to skip exams or classes as they are used to equating closures with vacation. Add to that the genuine resilience against a system that is new. Still our hiccups suggest a mal-digested education system that is currently in place. A survey done in the US shows only nine percent of educators are comfortable in teaching in a completely online environment. One suspects, in our culture, the number is going to be significantly low among those who have been solely exposed to bricks-and-mortar classrooms. For many of the old-school teachers, a virtual classroom where it is difficult to pick up the non-verbal cues of students (e.g. whether they are bored or excited, confused about a topic, shy to ask a question, etc.) robs us of the fun of teaching. Then again, good teaching is good teaching. The challenge for us then is to prepare the course contents in a way so that the human side of a teacher remains intact. Students must feel the warmth of a teacher even while attending a virtual classroom. A teacher can show the warmth by intuitively placing herself/himself in the shoes of the learners, explaining what is expected of a student, and making the learning experience pleasant. Having conducted many teachers' training courses for intermediate and graduate level teachers, I know the banality of my supposition above. Our peripheral schools and colleges are yet to make digital experience central to their pedagogical practices. The ICT in Education Masterplan Review 2019 prepared by Unesco, which is available on the website of the Ministry of Education, may tell you that there has been a significant progress in the incorporation of ICT in classrooms. This simply involves equipping schools with computers and multimedia projectors. Whether they are properly being used is a different issue. While I was teaching the teachers how to make their classes interactive and to apply blended learning, my trainee teachers told me that, in most cases, the projectors in their institutions were locked in the rooms of the principals. A teacher can issue the equipment at her/his own risk, giving written assurances that she/he will be responsible for any damage as the institutions do not have any maintenance budget. This is symbolic of how our digital progress is contained. The equipment lies in a box, nipping any possibility of thinking-out-of-the-box in its bud.   When students from these institutions come to the tertiary system, particularly to places where student-centred active learning is practiced, they find it difficult to cope with the changes and challenges. The recent aversion to digital classrooms made me reflect on the contextual background. What is even more alarming is the fact that there is an absolute lack of preparedness to deal with crisis management in the education sector. All the directives so far involve health and safety related issues. There are no official directives regarding the safeguarding of the education of our future generation in a prolonged crisis scenario. Hence, immediate guidance is needed for the clueless teachers, students and parents so that they can prepare for educational continuity. Similar guidance is needed so that psychosocial support can be made available to both teachers and students during long-term out-of-school closures. Education is not only transmission of knowledge from educators to learners; it is related to the holistic growth and wellbeing of the individuals concerned. Education shapes one's personalities, one's attitudes towards life, and makes one a social being. How we do that in a virtual setting (better not to confuse with social media) is a \"koti taka\" question! We need a plan for strategic interventions--a national contingency plan for the education sector which may go beyond fire drilling or natural disasters. The existing Bangladesh Emergency Response Plan 2014 and a follow-up SOD simply include guidelines for the aftermath of flood, cyclones or earthquakes. The pandemonium ensued by the pandemic has given rise to new concerns. Long-term social distancing, self-isolation is not only a probability but a reality. Migrating to the online teaching platform can be a logical step. Countries such as Syria, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and the Philippines have earlier adopted flexible distance learning to deal with war-time emergency. Maybe the time has come for us to educate ourselves and brace ourselves against the new dangers that may not wear a crown; they may appear in the shape of climate change or in some other formats where we will need to relearn everything that we have learned so far. And that day is not far, yet we are far away from being ready for it.   Shamsad Mortuza is a Professor of English, University of Dhaka (now on leave). Currently, he is Pro-Vice-Chancellor of ULAB.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-28 00:00:00      \nMigration continues to be a serious issue for climate-vulnerable Bangladesh There are over 258 million migrants around the world living outside their country of birth. This figure is expected to grow for a number of reasons, including population growth, increasing connectivity, trade, rising inequality, demographic imbalances, and climate change. Globally, over 68.5 million people are forcibly displaced among which 25.4 million are refugees. To address the growing number of migrants and refugees in a way that upholds the principles of human rights, in 2018, the global leaders adopted two major reports to address issues related to refugees and migration. These are called the Global Compact on Refugees and Global Compact for Migration. Bangladesh is signatory to both the agreements will be addressing the agreements taking series of actions nationally and globally. To better understand the implications of these agreement in Bangladesh, it is important to look at what the compacts are about.  The Refugee Compact The Refugee Compact has four objectives: Ease pressures on host countries; enhance refugee self-reliance; expand access to third country solutions, and support conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity.  The Migration Compact The Migration Compact comprises 23 objectives for better managing migration at local, national, regional and global levels. It expresses states' \"collective commitment to improving cooperation on international migration.\" Both compacts were being questioned by various stakeholders especially with regards to how this will be delivered when there is less clarity about few definitions (such as refugee). It is widely agreed that the compacts will only make a difference to the lives of the refugees and migrants if there is enough political will of the government to live up to their commitments. While we continue demanding for better clarity and implementation of the compacts in line with Agenda 2030, it is important to also recognize that climate change and conflict-related displacement and forced migration are on the rise -- we can start thinking of supporting the proposal of the New NANSEN Passport as one of the response mechanisms. However, this doesn't take away the fact that we need take action to prevent displacement and forced migration to take place.  National response Bangladesh continues to be within the top 10 at-risk countries to climate change impacts and disasters in the world. There are a number of scenarios with linking the temperature raise trajectory, especially how this will displace and force people to migrate. There are a number of efforts made to understand the future scenario including efforts to track what is happening with regards to displacement and migration in recent years:  * Between 1980 and 2008, it experienced 219 natural disasters -- but not enough information about how many people are displaced. Cyclone Sidr alone impacted 9 million people and at least 3 million people were displaced (NRC)  * Between 2008 and 2014 it is estimated that 4.7 million people were displaced due to disasters in Bangladesh (displacement solutions). Some of the major events include Cyclone Aila (as many as two million people lost their home)  * In 2017, the majority of new displacements occurred due to sudden-onset disasters including Tropical Cyclone Mora in May and Monsoon flooding between June and August. A total of 946,000 new displacements due to these disasters. The South Asian flood (2017) impacted 8 million people in Bangladesh   * A recent RMMRU study found Dhaka receives three out of every five (59.2%) migrants from rural areas, with one in five (20.1%) preferring the port city of Chittagong  * RMMRU surveyed 1,431 internal migrant households of 20 districts and found other urban destinations included Gazipur (2.9% of all migrants), Sylhet (1.9%), Khulna (1%), Mymensingh and Narayanganj (0.6% each), and Satkhira (0.4%). The remaining 13.2% of migrants were spread among the other districts and towns of the country Dhaka alone receives about 500,000 people each year The silver lining Bangladesh has the potential to be the biggest mover in the global gross domestic product rankings in 2030. According to the latest report of HSBC Global Research, the country is becoming the 26th largest economy in the world from 42nd now. However, such growth is tied up with the migrant workers' hard earned money and how the entire economy will be impacted by climate change and development-induced displacement and migration.  It is crucial to recognize that the government is the primary duty bearer to address the issue of migrants and refugees while the civil society organizations and movements can support in developing policy instruments to field level implementation. It is absolutely critical, while implementing the commitments, to recognize the differentiated vulnerability and struggle of women and children as migrant and refugees. Therefore, the government must develop a safeguard mechanism for the most vulnerable and marginalized. Furthermore, the government can also consider the following:  * At the policy level in Bangladesh, the government can adopt a \"people's safeguard policy\"   * Establish a national tracking mechanism for displaced and migrated people   * Establish a safety-net mechanism/fund for displaced and forcibly migrated people  For civil society organizations addressing such massive issues is a collective responsibility. Furthermore, CSOs can support the government's position on compensation from polluter countries. As the government is planning to develop 100 economic zones, support developing skills, and of local communities who can be employed within the zone, therefore, reduce displacement and migration.

On the real-time rankings, Dhaka showed an average AQI score of 161 at 10:09am on Sunday, according to AirVisual, which monitors global air quality. Dhaka's air quality was classified as \"unhealthy.\" Residential areas like Bashundhara, Baridhara DOHS, and Gulshan 2 showed AQI scores of 168, 157, and 158 respectively. Thailand's Chang Mai, China's Shenyang, and India's Delhi occupied the first, second, and third spots in the list of cities with the worst air quality with AQI scores of 194, 191, and 174 respectively. A numerical value between 151 and 200 indicates that everyone may begin to experience health effects. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. Air quality between 201 and 300 is classified as \"very unhealthy.\" If the score is between 301 and 500, then it is classified as \"hazardous.\" The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants -- Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh has been struggling with air pollution for a long time. Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Brick kilns, vehicles run on fuel containing higher levels of sulphur, as well as construction work, have all been identified as major sources of air pollution. Air quality further declines during the dry months -- from October to April -- but improves during the monsoon."

Khulna Metropolitan Magistrate Amirul Islam delivered the verdict on Monday afternoon. The court also fined Shahjalal Tk5000, and in default, he will have to serve one month more behind bars. The convict, who was on bail, was escorted to jail soon after the verdict.  Shahjalal's lawyer Nurul Haque said they will file an appeal with the apex court against the verdict.  On July 18, 2017, police arrested Shahjalal in a mugging case and took him to the Khalishpur police station in Khulna city. The convict's mother, Renu Begum, claimed police demanded Tk1.5 lakh from the family to release Shahjalal.  As they refused to do so, police members took Shahjalal out of the police station in their vehicle and tortured him, she said. The next day the family found him lying on a bed of the Khulna Medical College and Hospital with gouged eyes. Quoting Shahjalal, Renu Begum claimed the law enforcement members gouged out both his eyes with a screwdriver. On September 7, 2017, the victim's mother filed a case with a Khulna court against 13 people including 11 police personnel in connection with the incident. The then officer-in-charge of Khalishpur police station, Nasim Khan, was made one of the accused. Renu Begum said police are still threatening her and other family members for filing the case."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-20 00:00:00      \nThe non-government organisations want the government to engage them in tackling the crisis caused by Covid-19 which has far-reaching impacts on people, health and economy, especially on the poor and vulnerable communities across the country. They said NGOs, which have their presence at the grassroots level and always worked hand in hand with the government in disaster management, should be incorporated in the activities for stronger coordination and greater reach. The suggestions came at a virtual press conference hosted by COAST Trust and attended by the leaders of different alliances of NGOs -- National Alliance of Humanitarian Actors, Bangladesh (NAHAB), Bangladesh CSO-NGO Coordination Process, Network for Information, Response and Preparedness Activities on Disaster (NIRAPA), Disaster Forum, Association of Development Agencies Bangladesh (ADAB) and Federation of NGOs Bangladesh (FNB). \"The season of flood, cyclone and dengue is upcoming. With any of these taking place alongside the Covid-19 pandemic, the situation will be grave. So, we need to be prepared,\" said ADAB Director AKM Jashim Uddin. He said the government has announced stimulus packages and is providing relief materials, but there are already many allegations of irregularities. If the actual target people are not listed for the benefits, the government assistance is not going to work effectively. \"Food production is going to be a major task. So, ensuring that incentives reach farmers and that they can harvest Boro paddy before going for Aush is very important.\" Jasim Uddin also said the micro-finance NGOs are now passing tough days, with all their money in the hands of their members who are now unable to pay the installments during the shutdown. He sought government financing for the restart of microfinance operations to help boost rural economic activities. Nurul Alam Masud, chief executive of Participatory Research & Action Network, said the government is considering Covid-19 only a health issue, and until now only the administration and some partisan people are being involved in tackling it. \"The government should now activate the Disaster Management Act, involve the NGOs at national and grassroots levels for strong coordination and transparency,\" he added. Nayeem Gawher Wahra, member secretary of Disaster Forum, said shutdown is likely to remain in place for some more days, but the economic activities and food production need to continue under certain mechanism. Citing the example of Kerala, he said the government could divide the geographical areas in some categories and allow certain level of economic activities in the green zone. He said health awareness exists mostly among the urban and middle class people, not the grassroots. He suggested using community radio as an effective tool  to create mass awareness on social distancing and hygiene. Abul Haseeb Khan of NIRAPAD said the government assistance has yet to reach many remote areas and availability of food is becoming an issue of concern. With no income, moderate poor are getting into the bracket of ultra poor. Independent researcher Abdul Latif Khan said UN agencies and INGOs should limit their role to monitoring and providing technical assistance to the local NGOs. And they should provide direct funding to the national and local NGOs as localisation should be promoted to increase cost efficiency amid this global crisis when the developed countries too are affected. He suggested the government involve NGOs and civil society organisations in implementing the activities at the grassroots level under the government stimulus package declared to tackle Covid-19 impacts. \"To face the post-corona crisis, the rural economy must continue with their production maintaining the social distancing and local NGOs and micro finance institutions should be allowed for operation as they are the key players in this regard,\" he said. Latif suggested increased focus on stronger health system in the rural areas. Rezaul Karim Chowdhury of COAST Trust moderated the press conference."

The coastal district saw an average of 55-millimetre rainfall in the 12 hours, which can be considered as this year's highest in the area, said officials of the Department of Agricultural Extension. A number of roads, vast crop fields and many fish enclosures in Bagerhat Sadar, Mongla, Rampal, Sharankhola, Morrelganj and Kachua upazilas have been badly damaged. Farmers are worried as the water level rises during high tides. Bagerhat Sadar Upazila Fisheries Officer ASM Russell said fish from at least 250 enclosures have been washed away due to the flooding caused by continuous rain. Thousands of fishermen will suffer huge losses if there is further downpour, he added. Nakib Ohid, chairman of Badal Union Parishad in Kachua upazila, said at least 2500 crop farmers and several owners of shrimp enclosures in the union face serious losses due to the flooding. \"People's movement is badly disturbed as roads are under knee-deep water in our area. Many shrimp enclosures are flooded,\" said Musfikul Islam of Karapara village in Bagerhat Sadar union. \"The excessive rain caused rotting of the roots of some vegetables. However, the damage would not be that much if there is no further rain,\" said Rustom Sheikh, a vegetable grower of Kachua. Talukder Abdul Baki, panel mayor of Bagerhat municipality, said survey work has started as a project is going to be implemented to reduce waterlogging in the municipality. Aftab Uddin Ahmed, deputy director of the Department of Agricultural Extension in Bagerhat, said, \"The heavy rain resulted in the flooding that caused damage to betel plantations and vegetable fields. However, the losses will be minimum if water recedes quickly.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-17 00:00:00      \nConstruction and renovation work of an important road in Basail upazila could not be completed even after eight months of its stipulated deadline due to alleged negligence of the contractor concerned. Due to the delay, thousands of inhabitants of several villages in Basail and adjacent two upazilas -- Sakhipur and Mirzapur -- are suffering immensely for long. According to the data provided by Local Government and Engineering Department (LGED) in Basail, the six-kilometre-long road stretching from Kanchanpur to Dhangpara via Pathatghata has remained unusable for locals and unfit for vehicular movement. In a bid to ease the public sufferings, LGED floated a tender for construction and renovation work of the road at a costs of 5.59 crores. Contractor firm Bishal Enterprise got the work order and started the work on April 30, 2018.   Mentionable, although the works were supposed to be completed by May 6, 2019, it still remain incomplete even after eight months of its actual deadline. During a recent visit to the area this correspond saw construction materials lying scattered beside the under construction road in Dhangpara, Jotuki, Poulee, Haluapara and Sankapara area while construction materials did not even reached in many areas. Saiful Islam of Kanchanpur village said they have been facing lots of trouble due to the shabby condition of the road and huge amount of dust in the air. \"We did not saw the contractor concerned at the construction site yet,\" he alleged. Accidents often occur while travelling on the damaged road, Mohammad Ali of the area said. \"As the road is not suitable for vehicular movements local traders suffer immensely while carrying their goods,\" trader Shafiqul Islam said.  \"We have to move on foot as transports are not available due to the bad condition of the road,\" housewife Protima Rani said.  Basail Upazila Parishad Chairman Kazi Alid Islam said the road repair work was in full swing till the beginning of the rainy season, but suddenly it stopped. \"I hope the work will complete in a short time and local people will be benefited from it,\" he added. Basail LGED Upazila Engineer Rozdid Ahmed said about 45 percent of the total work has already been completed and they have served notice to the contractor concerned for completing the work by June this year. Mohammad Hossain, owner of Bishal Enterprise, said they could not continue the work as they were unable to carry the construction materials at many sites due to the recent flood.     \"We hope to complete the work within the next couple of months,\" he added."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-18 00:00:00      \nIf the historic site is renovated and preserved then it can become a tourist spot Due to lack of renovation and preservation, the historical and archaeological landmark of Mayurbhatta's Dhanuka Manasha Bari, in Shariatpur, has almost been lost to the mists of time. On World Heritage day today, we found that although the owner lost possession of most relics of the house, Shyamapad Chakrabarty -- the last man of his family line -- has preserved around five of the household's buildings. During his recent visit to Shariatpur, the education minister instructed the local administration to preserve the almost-500-year-old historical structure. According to archeologist Dr AKM Shahnawaz, if the government provides incentives, then Manasha Bari can become a historical tourist spot for visitors. Dhanuka village is situated in the region just behind the Shariatpur police superintendent's office; and the Dhanuka Manasha Bari is located just inside the town. This ancient structure has two significant legends attached to it. Myths surrounding the landmark The first myth says that Mayurbhatta's parents -- the Bhattacharya family -- was on a pilgrimage to Kashidham, when Mayurbhatta's mother gave birth to him inside a forest. The Brahmin family believed that religion was their priority, rather than their newborn child. Thus, the family set off for their journey once again, leaving the infant in the forest, covered with a \"shal pata,\" or sal leaf. Once their pilgrimage concluded, a deity came to Bhattacharya, in his dreams, saying that their prayers would not be accepted as they were wrong to leave their child unprotected. Realizing their mistake, the couple returned to the forest and found a peacock covering their son with its feathers. Hence, Mayurbhatta was named after the \"mayur,\" or peacock, that sheltered him; and the area later became the house of the ancient Sanskrit scholar and poet. The second legend tells the story of a teenager who had a habit of collecting flowers from the garden at dawn. One day, the teenager found a massive serpent in the garden and returned home frightened. When he went to the garden the next day, he faced the snake again, but this time it follows the teen to his house. The snake slithered around the boys in a dance in the presence of terrified onlookers. Later at night, the Manasha goddess came to the dreams of the household members, and instructed them to worship the goddess -- thus establishing the Manasha temple in the house. Since then, Mayurbhatta's house has been known as Manasha Bari. The shrines of goddesses and educational institutes A large pond is situated on the entrance of the landmark. The borders to the main house began from the west bank of the pond. At present, there are a total of five structures still standing, the: Kali Mandir -- mandir is a temple--, Durga Mandir, Manasha Mandir, a Nahabat Khana, and a Sanskrit school. Near the west border of the house, facing east, is a monument with a bungalow style two-way sloping roof, which was once used as the Manasha Mandir. Manshabari dining room Dhaka Tribune Another bigger edifice is situated on the northern border, facing south, which also has a two-way sloping roof. This monument has been marked as Durga Mandir. There is another two-storey building facing the temple--that is mostly in ruins--known as the Nahabat Khana. There is a two-storey temple for the Goddess Kali, adjacent to the west side of the manor's courtyard. A lot of the second floor and parts of the first floor of the temple have collapsed.  Another two-storey building, that has survived, on the southwest area, used to house a Sanskrit  school. Next to this school was the residence of Acharya family, however there is no way to excavate it at present. The history behind the Manasha Bari  According to historic descriptions, the descendants of Mayurbhatta came to reside in the Manasha Bari from Kannauj to present-day Dhanuka of Shariatpur. Lakshman Mishra has been shown as the descendant of Mayurbhatta in their family tree. After Shyamol Sen -- second son of the King of Sen Dynasty -- conquered Kotalipara, he brought a Brahmin named Yashdhar Mishra with him. Meanwhile, a sorceress died in Bikrampur, befalling an inauspicious haze over the kingdom. The king decided to call his priest to sacrifice all other sorceresses, when Yashdhar pointed out the fault in the idea. The king then asked Yashdhar to carry out the sacrifice; when he concluded it successfully, Yashdhar was rewarded heartily by the king. He started to live on the land rewarded to him by the king, and the king brought more Brahmins from Kannauj so that Yashdhar felt at ease living there. Lakshman Mishra is a successor of these Brahmins, but he left Bikrampur because of river erosion -- and moved to Dhanuka. Meanwhile, it is believed that Mayurbhatta and Lakshman Mishra, together, built the structures of Manasha Bari at the end of the 15th century. Architectural and cultural significance There are no inscriptions that elucidate the construction period of these buildings. Nonetheless, seeing the construction style, it is believed that they were either built at the end of the Sultanate period or the early Mughal period.  The construction style is such that there are several doors arched to enter the room from the rear of the building. These medieval monuments were built with limestone and bricks. There are also traces of Islamic architecture in the construction style of these structures. The institution and the temple were built in late 16th or early 17th century. According to the locals, the Sanskrit school building has underground cells, but it is impossible to prove its authenticity without an archaeological excavation. An excavation project was initiated by the authorities and later abandoned. However, after a bit of digging, evidence of a brick-lining was found deep inside the ground. The facade of the building is greatly damaged and the inner chamber walls have smooth plaster. There is no decoration on the wall, but there are light and simple notched designs on the walls. There are also arched alcoves every two-or-three feet on the wall. The architectural excellence of Manasha Bari proved there is a rich past and culture in this region. With the existence of the educational institution in Manasha Bari, it appears that during the contemporary period, a cultural circle has been formed in this region.  Mayurbhatta's daughter--poet Jayanti Devi, or Vaijayanti--was a Sanskrit poet Manasha Bari. She received Sanskrit education from her father, Mayurbhatta, and achieved special knowledge in scripture about conciliation. Vaijayanti husband was born into the famous Pandit family of Kotalipara in Faridpur. Her husband, Krishnanath Sarvabhouma, was also a Sanskrit poet. Temples of Manasha Bari have some significant other features of the ancient era. There are 11 ornamental tiles under the roof of the Manasha temple, and there is a big lotus in-between each tile. The flower and sapling designs on a flower vase--situated on a pillar near the main entrance of the Durga temple, and under its rooftop panel--are simply remarkable. Colored tiles were used on the walls of the eastern side of this temple. The use of these motifs were commonplace during the Mughal era. Mayurbhatta's last successor, Shyamapad Chakrabarty, said: \"Manasha Bari was established on a property of almost seven acres. Some influential people have occasionally pressured me to knock down these buildings. He said he has preserved these medieval institutions even in the face of immense pressure. Govinda Chandra Chakrabarty, son of Shyamapad Chakrabarty, said many journalists, tourists and researchers have come to receive information about the tradition of this house. However, no-one has taken any action to protect this ancient heritage. If this asset is preserved, this Dhanuka Manasha Bari can be established as one of the key tourist centers of Shariatpur. Shariatpur Deputy Commissioner Kazi Abu Taher said: \"We have sent a letter regarding the renovation and maintenance of Manasha Bari to the Department of Archeology. \"On March 15, the education minister and state minister of water resources visited the Manasha Bari. Then, both ministers instructed us to write letters again and assured us of the financial allocation in this regard.\" Former chairman of Archaeology Department in Jahangirnagar University, Dr Shahnawaz said: \"An analysis of these structures showed that these buildings were constructed in late 16th and early 17th century.  \"I have repeatedly requested the government's Archaeology Department to include the Manasha Bari of Shariatpur on their list. It is possible to build a tourism area here if the Cultural Affairs Ministry takes responsibility for the renovation and preservation of Manasha Bari.\" "

He visited Dhaka from May 11-13 to participate in a 2019 Trade Winds Indo-Pacific Forum and Mission -- plus to promote US-Bangladesh trade and investment, reports UNB.  He encouraged Bangladesh to realise the full potential of the bilateral commercial relationship by removing remaining trade barriers and improving the ease of doing business.   Trade between the US and Bangladesh has doubled to more than $8 billion over the past decade, the US Embassy said on May 7, 2019. During his first visit to Dhaka, Steff met government officials and discussed intellectual property rights as well as other investment climate issues.  \"US and Bangladeshi business leaders are increasingly expanding their commercial ties and partnerships -- as evidenced by growing trade between our two nations and the strong participation of companies in our trade mission,\" he said.  On May 13, he met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Private Industry and Investment Advisor Salman F Rahman and Energy Advisor Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury--as well as Commerce Secretary Mofizul Islam--to discuss ways to expand economic ties.  Bangladesh, with its population and economic growth, offers US companies a market of incredible potential with tens of millions of increasingly affluent consumers.   Trade Winds Indo-Pacific is the US Department of Commerce's first major trade mission to Bangladesh in recent history. The trade mission began on May 6 in New Delhi and concluded on May 13 in Dhaka.   The Trade Winds event facilitated meetings between 12 representatives of US companies and more than 40 business-to-business meetings with Bangladeshi companies.   Trade Winds, now in its 11th year, has directly supported more than $3.4 billion in US exports in over 40 countries; in 2018, US exports of goods and services to the Indo-Pacific region were more than $476 billion.   In 2017, the mission brought 100 companies to Southeast Europe and accounted for more than $3 billion in US exports.   Trade Winds has helped US companies conduct over 4,000 pre-vetted, business-to-business meetings and over 6,000 government-to-business meetings around the world."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-03 00:00:00      \nA pregnant woman dies at Bangabanadhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University At least three people including a pregnant woman died of dengue as the tally of patients suffering from the mosquito-borne virus kept spiraling with 1,687 new cases across the country on Friday.  Shockingly, two of the victims died in Dhaka.  The deceased are Md Raiyan Sarkar, Mosharraf Hossain and Maliha Mahfuz Onnya. Raiyan, a 6th grader of Government Mohammadpur Model School and College, died while undergoing treatment at Square Hospitals in Dhaka while Mosharraf, 30, at a Noakhali hospital. The expectant mother, Maliha Mahfuz Onnya, died at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), a private news channel reported, without disclosing her identity.  She had been suffering from dengue fever for the last ten days. With the latest deaths, the number of people who died of the mosquito-borne virus jumped to at least 47, according to the unofficial tally.  Interestingly, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) claimed that no deaths took place due to dengue in a 24-hour span until last afternoon. In a media release issued at 4pm, the DGHS made the claim, confirming that 1,687 people were affected with dengue anew.  Also Read- Quader for united efforts to control dengue With this, the number of dengue patients hit a record high of 21,253 since the beginning of this year. Dhaka city alone saw 992 new patients, clearly depicting that it continued to bear the brunt of dengue.  Outside Dhaka, Chittagong division became the second most affected area having 119 cases, followed by Khulna division (91 patients) and Rajshahi division (87 patients).   Since January, according to DGHS, a total of 14 people died of dengue across the country, with the highest 10 deaths registered only in July.  Currently, 6,582 people are hospitalised while the number was 4,903 on Thursday afternoon.   From January to March, there were only 73 infections in total. In April, there were 58 infections and two fatalities. The number of infected patients nearly quadrupled to 193 in May, and blew up to 1,863 in June with two more deaths. The outbreak far surpasses the previous largest instance from 2002 when there were 6,232 confirmed dengue cases with over 62 deaths. The dengue outbreak was largely attributed to the flood situation at the time. Fears, promises, criticism pour in  Urging all to work together to control the dengue outbreak, Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader said there was no improvement in the dengue situation.  \"The dengue situation is bad in Bangladesh. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is also worried about the country's dengue situation,\" said the minister while addressing a program in Dhaka on Friday. Also Read- Fakhrul : Declare state of emergency to tackle dengue \"The dengue situation is not out of control. We have strength to control the situation. It is possible to control it through united efforts,\" he said. Quader furthered there is no way to deny that dengue has spread all over the country. Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Mayor Atiqul Islam told reporters that the new sample of insecticide to kill mosquito will arrive from abroad in a day or two. But, on Thursday, lawyers of the DNCC and its southern counterpart claimed that samples of mosquito repellent would be brought from abroad by later in the day.  Meanwhile, Information Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud on Friday urged physicians to stand by dengue patients on humanitarian ground.  He also accused some doctors for trying to utilize dengue prevalence as a means of business. \"Most of the physicians have already stood beside the dengue patients on humanitarian grounds, but a section of doctors is trying to utilise the dengue prevalence as a means of business,\" he said while inaugurating a cleanliness and mosquito killing drive in the capital.  Blaming the health minister and both the mayors of Dhaka for the dengue outbreak, Nagoril Oikya Convener Mahmudur Rahman Manna at a discussion in Dhaka said the entire country is grappling with the mosquito menace.  \"People are not safe. But the minister and the mayors failed to act properly to resolve the issue. They are staging a drama on the pretext of procuring insecticide to kill mosquitoes,\" he added. Also Read- Mamata: Bangladeshi mosquitoes behind dengue in West Bengal  The government is deliberately importing effective  repellents, alleged BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.  \"Dengue menace is an annual affair. But, why the government turned a blind eye despite knowing the fact? It willingly procured insecticide that does not destroy mosquitoes. Who embezzled the money?\" he questioned.  Health Rights Movement's President Prof Rashid-E-Mahbub said negligence among the authorities concerned caused the dengue to take an epidemic shape.  \"All has to take responsibility for the failure. Firstly, the government has engaged in a blame game. But right now, we have to think of treating dengue patients and fighting the mosquito menace,\" he furthered.  The scenario across the country In Jhenaidah, five more cases including that of 7th grader were recorded in the district's Kaliganj upazila. Four of them were infected with the dengue virus while in Dhaka, said local hospital sources. All five patients were being treated at the Jhenidah Sadar Hospital.  Dr Hussain Shafayet of the Kaliganj Upazila Health Complex said they were yet to receive the dengue-testing kits.  In Barishal, 48 more patients have been admitted to the Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital in 24 hours ending last afternoon. Local health officials said people returning home from Dhaka ahead of Eid-ul-Azha are pushing up the number of the positive dengue case.  Dr Abdur Rahim, divisional heath director, said patients are approaching to private pathologies since no dengue testing-kits (like NS-I) reached at any of the 43 public hospitals in the district as yet. In Gaibandha, an upward trend of dengue cases is noticed. Until Friday, at least 11 dengue patients were confirmed. All of them live in Dhaka, but returned to their village home with the dengue virus, said Gaibandha's Civil Surgeon Abu Janif.  Other than taking measures to contain the virus, local authorities concerned have launched a loudspeaker campaign asking people not to panic over the menace as well to be aware of Aedes mosquitoes. In Dinajpur, three people were found to be dengue positive. Like most cases, the trio lives in Dhaka and returned to the district after being infected by the dengue virus. Local administration said the government clinics and hospitals have no dengue-testing kits. In Madaripur, 18 new cases were confirmed until 2pm yesterday, pushing the number of dengue-affected people to 48. Of them, 15 patients were being treated at local hospitals.  Most of the new patients came from Dhaka, said local hospital sources.  In Tangail, the situation is no different from other districts. Eight more patients were hospitalised yesterday, with total number of dengue cases soaring to 66.  In Bogra, the number of patients continued to rise. Until last morning, 148 patients were confirmed at Saheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College."

      "text": "A Hotel-Jail for Refugees\n1987-09-23T05:00:00.000Z\nIt's hard to imagine officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service as devotees of the French surrealist Jean-Paul Sartre. Yet a jail they have established in a luxury hotel at Kennedy Airport so closely resembles Sartre's vision of hell in his play ''No Exit'' - perpetual and unrelieved confinement in a small room with three strangers - that one is hard-pressed to avoid such a conclusion.\nSince April, the I.N.S. has contracted with a private security company, Tri-Way Security and Escort Services Inc., to detain in a wing of the hotel, the Viscount International, as many as 60 aliens at a time, at a cost of $4 million annually. Several Afghans have been held already in this privately managed detention facility, as have individuals from Sri Lanka, Ghana, Chad, India, Bangladesh, Libya and Pakistan - all countries that could produce legitimate refugees.\nIndeed, many of these people have applied for political asylum, claiming that they would be persecuted if they were returned to their home countries. But they can remain imprisoned for up to a year or more, irrespective of the merits of their claims.\nConditions at the facility are inhumane. According to notarized affidavits of detainees, taken by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, several of the aliens being held have reported overcrowding, with detainees sometimes sleeping four and five to a room. Many have said that they have slept two to a bed with strangers. They are confined 24 hours a day, except for excursions to Manhattan for court appearances. There are no provisions for exercise. Their only recreational activities are playing cards and watching television.\nThe detainees - who are not criminals but aliens who arrived without valid passports and visas - are held at the hotel generally for as long as it takes to decide their cases for admission, sometimes up to several months. In that time, they are almost completely isolated from the outside world. They cannot receive family visits, and they have been denied access to communications by telephone and mail. No medical officer is on duty, and the detainees are not even informed of their rights and responsibilities.\nWhile the hotel-cum-jail has been operating for some time, it might have escaped notice if not for a recent tragedy involving an escape attempt by two Indian Sikhs, who had been detained three weeks. One, Kuldib Singh Dhariwal, age 28, fell more than 30 feet from a fourth floor window when the rope he had fashioned from his turban snapped. He died from his injuries on Aug. 31.\nThis fatal escape attempt raises questions both about the continued use of the hotel as a detention center and about alien detention policy in general.\nThe ultimate source of the alien detention problem is an administrative ruling issued in July 1982 that requires the incarceration of most arriving undocumented aliens, including those applying for political asylum, irrespective either of the likelihood of their fleeing or of the danger they pose to the American community. The ruling followed complaints from Haitian detainees, who claimed they were being discriminated against. In response, the immigration service decided to mistreat others equally.\nThe problem is complicated at the Viscount Hotel by the private and unaccountable nature of the custody. Overcrowded and lacking exercise areas or facilities for family visits, the hotel is singularly unsuited for long-term detention. Moreover, by the terms of Tri-Way's contract with the I.N.S., guards are required to receive only one hour of training in human relations - hardly adequate for the demands of overseeing long-term detainees.\nThe I.N.S. defends the Viscount as a stop-gap measure. But this assertion is untrue: The contract with Tri-Way could run through 1989. And, while inferior conditions may have improved temporarily under public scrutiny and pressure, they will inevitably recur.\nThe authorities, apparently recognizing the drawbacks of the arrangement, have recently arranged to transfer some of the longer-term detainees to Federal facilities. The I.N.S. should establish guidelines to insure similar transfers for anyone held longer than a few days. Moreover, the I.N.S. should maintain a stronger presence, rather than leaving management of the detention facility entirely in the hands of a private company.\nAvoiding further abuse and tragedies will require systematic and vigorous oversight by the I.N.S, and, if necessary, by other authorities."

As of now, the number of people in Mozambique affected by the storm and floods is 600,000, Verhoosel said, citing government figures. But \"that number will definitely go up,\" he told reporters. The WFP believes it is possible that a total of 1.7 million people in Mozambique will need assistance as a result of the weather-related disasters, Verhoosel added. Aid workers are racing to locate survivors, some of whom may still be stranded on rooftops or in trees. About 15,000 people still need to be rescued from floods after central Mozambique was pounded by a cyclone last week, Land and Environmental Minister Celso Correia said today. \"Yesterday we had counted 15,000 people that still need rescue today -- 15,000 people who are in bad shape. They are alive, we are communicating with them, delivering food, but we need to rescue them and take them out,\" he told reporters. He said around 3,000 people have been rescued so far since Tropical Cyclone Idai struck the flood-prone impoverished southern African country. \"The bad news is that we have lost already 217 lives,\" he said. \"There's still a lot of people on the ground in need of rescue. We are working with 120 specialists and a lot of teams to keep on rescuing.\" \"Our priority now is to make sure we take food, shelter and medicine to the people that are isolated in small islands or in big islands and villages. \"We are working 24 hours to make sure we are taking the food and medicine to those people to make sure we avoid live losses because of sickness,\" the minister said at Beira airport, which has become the humanitarian relief coordination hub. The cyclone made landfall last week in central Mozambique before hitting neighbouring Zimbabwe where at least 139 have been killed."

The students started their demonstration in front of the university's academic building A around 11am to press home their four-point demand. The demands are: resignation of the current student adviser Md Omar Faruk, appointment of the next student adviser from a list of names prepared by students, cease of involvement by the Physics department head Dr Shamsun Nahar and the student adviser Md Omar Faruk in any academic activities of the victim student's batch, and an appropriate explanation from the department head as to why she failed to take actions during the incident being present at the scene. Earlier on February 29, during the golden jubilee celebration at the university, a local college teacher threatened a physics department student. At the time both the department head and student adviser were present but failed take any action. Later on March 2, when the students of the department presented their four point demand before the department head, an altercation broke between the two party. As a result on March 4, the department head issued a notice suspending all exams sine die.  Regarding the matter, School of Physical Sciences Dean Dr Md Sajedul Karim said: \"I have had discussions with the students who are protesting. I have conveyed their demands to the teachers concerned. The situation may be resolved with everyone's cooperation.\" However, physics department head Prof Dr Shamsun Nanhar Begum could not be reached for a quote on this matter. "

      "text": "The Editorial Notebook; India's Practical Communists\n1987-04-16T05:00:00.000Z\nThe campaign literature reads like boilerplate out of Pravda: ''The magnificent successes of the socialist world and the happy and prosperous life of the common people prove to the international community the superiority of the socialist system. . . .'' But the enduring success of the Communist Party of West Bengal, democratically elected to rule one of India's poorest states, owes more to clever politicking than it does to the theories of Karl Marx.\nIt is difficult to predict how Communists would run the rest of India were they given the opportunity, but West Bengal's Left Front government is currently playing a constructive role as gadfly to the country's inertia-bound Congress Party rulers.\nThe state of West Bengal, southwest of Bangladesh, might have been invented as a test for Job. Vastly overpopulated, torn by ethnic violence, prone to flood and drought, it has not shared the modest economic success of India's western regions. What it does have is leftist intellectuals who broke with the Congress movement after independence and took control of the state government a decade ago. Elections last month gave the Left Front its biggest majority ever.\nAnalysts credit the Communist Party's popular leader, Jhoti Basu, who is frequently compared to the pragmatic, business-tolerant Communist Party heads of Western Europe. Local industrialists have made their peace with Mr. Basu. They argue that the Communists out of power are trouble. In power, they have become realists, adept at persuading fractious unions to honor their agreements.\nThe Eurocommunist model doesn't quite fit. Here, practically everyone is a socialist in the sense that practically everyone pays lip service to the idea of government as Robin Hood. West Bengal's Communists clobber their me-too opponents at the polls because they are smarter, better organized and less corrupt.\nIndia's Constitution assigns key economic powers to the central Government, controlled by the Congress Party. Only New Delhi can site large-scale industry in West Bengal or provide the tax revenues to repair the collapsing infrastructure. When Calcutta barred commercial livestock from the city's traffic-choked business district, it took six months for the rule to receive the necessary blessing from unsympathetic ministries in New Delhi.\nLocal Communists overcome this handicap by focusing on rural justice and grass-roots development, where organization can serve as a substitute for cash. West Bengal's sharecroppers, for example, have long been legally entitled to keep 75 percent of their output. But their rights were rarely enforceable. Then the Left Front government made it almost impossible for landlords to evict recalcitrant sharecroppers.\nThe Communists have also increased the authority of village-based councils, making government more responsive and, perhaps, less corrupt. What little tax revenue the Communists do control is used for high-visibility projects in rural literacy and health.\nAshok Mitra, a witty ideologue who served as West Bengal's finance minister, insists his party's Marxist goals remain intact. Once Bengali peasants are properly organized, he predicts, Communists will be able to sell them on the virtues of collective ownership. And once Communists extend their reach beyond West Bengal and a few other peripheral states, the left will be able to discard the forms of bourgeois democracy for a proper dictatorship of the proletariat.\nPerhaps. But just now, India seems more inclined to inch right than left, and West Bengal's Communists seem fated to remain rural reformers rather than revolutionaries. India could do a lot worse."

The river has already devoured at least 28 dwellings, in areas under the union, in the last two days. According to villagers, the disaster occurred due to continuous sand lifting by unscrupulous traders.  The authorities dumped geo-bags but failed to prevent the erosion that left at least 28 families homeless. Although law prohibits sand lifting within a six-kilometre radius of a bridge, a syndicate of influential traders, having political connections, continued lifting sand near the bridge with powerful dredgers, the villagers said. Over 20,000 people in the union are under the threat of erosion, and are passing their days in panic. When Gorilabari village was visited yesterday, the villagers expressed grave concerns. \"Our tin-shed building, toilet, and tube-well were devoured by the river,\" said Fatema Begum adding that they are now living in somebody else's house. Not only Fatema but also Akbar Ali Akanda, Chand Miah Haji, Abdul Ali Mondol, Abdus Salam, Janab Ali Talukder, Abul Hossain, Korban Ali, Akbar Shikder, Ashraf Ali, Solaiman, Shafiq Uddin, Jahurul Islam, and Khaled Mondol of Gorilabari, and Beltia villages have lost their dwellings due to erosion. They have taken shelter in open spaces, and relatives' houses. \"Many people of the village have lost their houses in the erosion. I have lost my house,\" said Akbar Ali Akanda of the village. During the last rainy season, erosion by the river devoured at least 50 houses, and a 200-metre embankment in the village within a few days. This year, erosion started in Gorilabari village on May 30, and it devoured over a dozen dwellings so far, said Rashida Begum, an erosion victim of the village. Tangail-4 (Kalihati upazila) constituency MP  Hasan Imam Khan Sohel said work  for a permanent embankment in the area, to save the people from erosion, will start in December. \"Each erosion victim will get Tk, 6000, and two bundles of corrugated tins,\" he also said."

Locals claimed that due to mindless extraction of sand, portion of the town protection embankment might go under water anytime. As a result, vehicles and pedestrians were crossing the area amid risk of accident. According to the upazila administration and locals one Badrul Islam of Dakkhin Bazar area in upazila took the lease from the district administration for Tk 1.20 crore.But defying the law, the lessee has been extracting sand from Kotarkona, Salon, Dhundalpur, Jalalpur, Hashimpur, Tukoli and Matabpur areas near Kotarkona Bridge and Manu Rail Bridge, locals alleged. Meanwhile, demanding a stop to the heinous act, locals said the embankment might go into the riverbed anytime if water level in the Manu river sees a rise due to sudden rainfall during this time of the year. While visiting the area this correspondent found labourers were extracting sand using six extraction machines in Salon and Kotarkona areas. Of the two areas, one is very close to Kotrakona Bridge on Kulaura-Shamshernagar road while the other is some 500 meters far from the Manu Railway Bridge on Sylhet-Akhaura rail route. Kutub Uddin, a resident of Hashimpur area, said, \"Due to unabated lifting of sand a large crack has developed on the flood control embankment on June 26.\" Hazipur Union Parishad (UP) Chairman Abdul Bashit said a 50-foot-long crack has developed on the Manu river due to unabated sand lifting. According to the law, one cannot lift sand from one kilometre radius of any railway bridge, but the lessee is not paying heed, he said, adding that the embankment might collapse anytime due to the mindless sand lifting. Lessee Badrul told this correspondent over phone that sand is being lifted as per the conditions of the lease. Kulaura Assistant Commissioner (Land) Sadi Ur Rahim Zadid said earlier sand was being lifted from different points along the embankment on Kotarkona road, threatening the two nearby bridges. The lessee was asked not to extract sand from within one kilometre area of the two bridges, he said. "

      "text": "Land Is Losing to the Poor's Fight for Short-Term Survival\n1989-11-28T05:00:00.000Z\nACTING out of desperation, many of the poorest people in the world are cutting down forests, razing grasslands and slowly destroying fragile ecosystems to survive, environmental researchers say.\nPoor farmers in the Sudan clear trees at the headwaters of the Nile, and by destroying these valuable watersheds, cause floods up and down the river. Peasants in Brazil with no fields of their own hew down the Amazon rain forests and indirectly threaten the climate of the globe by reducing the production of oxygen.\n''For centuries, there has been moral outrage about disparities in standards of living,'' said Alan Durning, a staff member of the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental research organization. ''Today we find poverty is not just a moral issue, because we now have a situation where poor people endanger the well-being of the better-off.'' 'Landless People'\nThe poor in Costa Rica have dealt a heavy blow to the rain forests that once covered most of their country, said Sheldon Annis, a member of the Overseas Development Council, an organization that researches economic issues affecting developing countries.\nIn Costa Rica, as in most of Latin America, there are two types of poor, Mr. Annis said. Those in the first group have a small parcel of land or some community that helps sustain them. Though these people must fight daily for their food and livelihood, they are finding a political voice, he said. But those in the second category live in despair, he said. ''These are landless people, children, deculturated tribal people,'' he said. ''They are people whose lands have already been developed throughout the world. They are the ones who are moving up the sides of hills.''\nExcess in affluent communities drives most of the world's environmental problems, Mr. Durning said, but as the numbers of the impoverished have grown by more than 200 million people worldwide in the last decade, so has the detriment of starvation and homelessness to the environment.\nTo subsist, the poor must consume or shatter the very resources that give them life, he said. Mr. Durning is the author of a recent report ''Poverty and the Environment: Reversing the Downward Spiral.'' U.N. Efforts\nThe relationship between poverty and environment has been apparent to development workers at the United Nations for some time, said Paul Perry, director of the U.N.'s Development Program in Washington.\nFrom 1976 to 1986, the budget for such projects as developing underground water reserves in Mali, cleaning up the Ganges in Bangladesh and expanding small farms in Zambia has nearly tripled, from $42.5 million to $123 million.\n''We're not letting it drop,'' Mr. Perry said. But he added, ''There's a need for more concerted effort.''\nPeople in some countries have begun their own efforts to reverse the environmental damage, said Keith Oberg, a field representative for the Inter-American Foundation. The foundation is a Government agency that gives financial assistance to small development operations in the Caribbean and Latin America.\nRecently, it gave more than $40,000 to farmers in Costa Rica who are trying to turn back the erosion of their land by reforestation. The farmers themselves came up with the idea of reforestation, Mr. Oberg said, and the foundation provided money to pay for seeds, salaries, tools and vehicle costs.\n''I happen to believe there is some hope,'' Mr. Oberg said. ''In Costa Rica, we find a lot of people who are discovering they're shooting themselves in the foot.''\nBut Mr. Annis said: ''All this stuff about grass roots development is overstated. It's wishful thinking. Credit programs and education programs don't work unless states are basically competent and do what they're supposed to do.'' Economic Measures\nFinancial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have to change their policies, Mr. Durning said. As the bank works with developing nations on ways for them to pay off their huge debts, he said, it should make sure that they do not try to come up with the money by cutting food subsidies indiscriminately or by taking money away from education and health care while leaving the military and other power structures intact.\nThe World Bank focuses on helping everyone in the developing world by giving blanket assistance to national economies, he said, but it needs to shift emphasis to helping the poorest people in those nations.\nBecause of its size and the size of its loans, the bank is not always able to reach the poorest of the poor, a staff member at the World Bank said.\nBut the bank has begun to look at ways to reduce poverty along lines suggested in Mr. Durning's report. The staff is discussing devoting more money to projects that will provide jobs for more people.\nThough Mr. Durning says much needs to be done, he is optimistic. ''It's extraordinary how things can change suddenly,'' Mr. Durning said. ''Look at Eastern Europe. Who could have predicted that? If we can make the case to people not only through humanitarian arguments but also with the threat to the environment that these problems have to be solved, then we may move in that direction much quicker.''"

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-20 00:00:00      \nToday marks the 8th death anniversary of Shilpaguru Safiuddin Ahmed. As a pioneer of printmaking in Bangladesh and a modernist painter of the first generation, he remained reclusive in his life and his art. The underrated artist lived and worked in both the twentieth century and the new millennium. His individual style was known as indigenous modernism.  Besides his experimentation with artworks, what remains majorly unknown is his skill and passion for photography. His photographs are resourceful in knowing him more intimately as well as in understanding the socio-cultural conditions of his time. His son, Ahmed Nazir, talks about the artist in a recent conversation with The Daily Star.   \"Baba definitely had an affinity for photography. He bought a German Contaflex SLR camera with different lenses and coloured filters during his stay in Europe in the fifties,\" recalls Nazir. \"For a person who always lived a simple life, I believe it was quite expensive, but he wanted to have it.\" From a young age, Nazir saw the Shilpaguru develop photographs in the dark room. \"I would always be in awe when the pictures appeared from those frames, dipped in chemical solutions,\" he adds. \"Baba had an eye for details. Perhaps the moments he captured and his framing influenced his art making. He would often give borders to his art pieces, like a photograph.\" Balloon vendors, tea sellers and fishermen were recurring subjects of the Shilpaguru's canvas.  According to Nazir, the artist took note of everyday characters that gave a city its unique identity. Living in Swamibag, he captured the essence of the city in many of his charcoal and crayon works. Talking about his father's famous work, Labourers with fiddler on the roof, Nazir explained that the orchestral routine of 'Chhad Petanor gaan', during which the labourers set the roof in the rhythm of a song was an everyday sound for Dhaka dwellers. A violinist played instruments for the labourers. The Shilpaguru's wife Anjuman Ara Ahmed Renu played a vital role in his life and work. Nazir fondly recalled that his mother was always supportive of his father's choices. She was the model in many of his photographs. \"During the flood in 1956, our house in Swamibagh was inundated,\" he says. \"Baba made Maa sit on a boat and took some photographs there. Later in many of his artworks related to the flood, there were influences of those captures.\" In one of the pictures, the Shilpaguru poses in the snow, with his wife's name written on it in Bangla.  It took Nazir by surprise when he developed the slide into the photographs. \"He clicked all these photographs by himself with the help of a timer. Today, taking a selfie is child's play, but Baba practiced it in the late fifties,\" Nazir mentions. The artist, inspired by Rabindra Sangeet and Nazrul Geeti, often shared music records with his wife. According to art historian Professor Syed Azizul Haque, when the Shilpaguru toured Paris and Leningrad, he observed the sounds of the orchestra, which appear in his watery work, titled The Sound of the Water, where he mixed the mediums of print making. He used etching, aquatint, sugar aquatint, mezzotint, lift-ground, engraving, deep etch, dry points and others. It took him almost three years to complete the work.  \"He never played music while painting. He would only listen to music after he finished his work and cleaned all his brushes,\" Nazir recalls. Shilpaguru Safiuddin Ahmed's close associates fondly describe him as an organised, a disciplined and a sharply-dressed person. He was hardly ever completely satisfied with his own artworks. As putting one's signature on an artwork usually indicates the Ahmed Nazir, a noted artist and photographer himself, followed in his father's footsteps. However, Nazir explained that his father never wanted any followers. \"Although Baba would give away his techniques, he always felt that everyone must have their own experiences. He believed that every artist develops a distinctive style. They do not have to set benchmarks. They only have to be original,\" Nazir concludes.        "

      "text": "Water Recedes, Spirits Rise in Dhaka\n1988-09-08T05:00:00.000Z\nThe sun was shining in Dhaka today, the water was receding, and for a moment at least, there was a more hopeful air in city neighborhoods.\nIn a few weeks, perhaps even a few days, it may not be so. Welfare agencies fear that the lowering tide from the devastating floods will leave epidemic diseases in the slate-gray mud.\nBut today, shops were open in the city center, which escaped the flooding. The international airport, an island of sorts on a waterlogged plain, began to function again after the annual monsoon rains left much of the nation under water and millions homeless.\nOfficials said today that the death toll from the floods had risen to more than 800. They said at least 150 people had died in less than 24 hours, most of those from diarrhea and dysentery caused by impure water and rotten food. The central Government's announced death toll is slightly more than half that, but is widely considered far too low. Unofficial tabulations in Dhaka newspapers run to more than 1,200, and communications with many outlying areas are still out.\nBicycle rickshaw pullers were doing a brisk business along roads where drivers feared to take their cars, areas that are still under water. Spirit of the Marketplace\nSubmerged streets were full of indefatigable entrepreneurs - fellows who will push your car for anything you can spare, children standing in water for a pittance to show a driver how deep it is, a pushcart vendor-turned-boatman who grinned with embarrassment each time he beached his leaky vessel on a curb or an unseen bush.\nBoats themselves are a new business. Tiny skiffs that once cost less than $20 are being hustled in the wetter neighborhoods for as much as $50, a huge amount of money for the very poor.\nSome families have no choice but to buy one anyway. A boat takes marooned people to the markets for food. It allows them to live at home - albeit often on their traditional flat rooftops, from which they can keep looters away. A boat also saves slogging barefoot through waters polluted with sewage and infested with snakes.\nThe better-off residents of Dhaka concede that, this time, it is to some extent a ''middle-class flood.'' The people of Bangladesh, most rural and poor, are used to the annual inundation of their land and homes. Indians Are Blamed\nThe flooding is worse this year because south Asia in general, and India in particular, have had a record monsoon rain. Hundreds of people have also died in eastern India.\nA commonly heard explanation here is that ''the water comes from India.''\nEvery year there is concern about India's deforested hills and mountains and its uncompleted flood-control programs, which allow flood waters to tumble through Bangladesh on their way to the sea. This year, the complaint is heard more often because the water has washed into the capital.\nDhaka is a city that can empty its streets quickly in a crisis. Political tension seems to be a recurrent part of life here, since the days when Bangladesh was the eastern region of Pakistan.\nToday, however, there was no such anxiety but , if anything, a sense of making the best of a terrible situation.\n''Pani, pani,'' a man said with a rueful smile, shaking his head and using the Bengali word for water, as he hoisted a parcel wrapped in a bandanna into the air. Then he plunged in up to his neck on the way home from shopping.\nBangladeshis, the majority of whom are Moslems, have been augmenting official relief efforts with their own makeshift projects.\nTonight, as dusk fell on a sodden community in south Dhaka, a group of energetic young men arrived with two barrels of clean, fresh drinking water, which they began to distribute in a school and along a muddy highway median.\nOne of them, Nakim Mahmud Narullah, a law student at Dhaka University, said he and his three colleagues were volunteers for the Islamic Dawa Complex, a charitable organization. Islam ranks welfare high among the obligations of its adherents.\nAsked why he and his friends were standing there in their immaculate clothes, giving drinks and water-purification tablets to the children of beggars, he replied:\n''We are Moslems. It is our duty.''"

      "text": "Nations Call for Action on Environment\n1989-07-16T05:00:00.000Z\nThe latest draft of the economic communique being worked out by the major industrial democracies known as the Group of Seven calls for ''decisive action'' to protect the global environment.\nThe document, described as all but final, notes ''with great concern the growing pollution of air, lakes, rivers, oceans and seas.''\nThe seven nations - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - have thus given the environment, an afterthought at previous summit meetings, a place at the top of their agenda for the world economy.\nThe meeting's ''economic declaration'' is to be published Sunday. Today's draft is considered complete except for a few finishing touches, described as minor, being worked out in discussions of finance ministers. Members of delegations confirmed various passages of the document but said changes in nuance were still possible. Nine Pages of Concern\nThe environment takes up nine pages of the 24-page, double-spaced document - far more than any other subject.\n''This is an idea whose time has come,'' a senior Bush Administration official said. ''When an idea comes in politics, it comes with a bang.''\nThe declarations at these annual gatherings of chiefs of state are more often statements of desire and determination than commitments to change policies. But they often lead to, or reinforce, changes in the countries' domestic economic policies.\nThe draft makes no explicit comment on the level of the dollar, usually a sensitive topic for meetings of the Group of Seven ministers. West German and Japanese officials said they did not intend to mention the currency, and the Americans had no wish to.\nInstead, the statement said the countries agreed to pursue, ''in a mutually reinforcing way,'' established policies that are aimed at keeping the dollar stable. In the ministers' most recent comment on the dollar, at a meeting in April, they said they wanted no further rise nor an excessive decline.\nAfter continuing to rise in May and June despite the ministers' wishes, the dollar has receded to the April levels, so the absence of comment implies that the April statement remains in effect.\nThe countries also give an unequivocal endorsement of the Bush Administration strategy for dealing with third world debt. That strategy involves banks and debtors working to reduce the debt burden with a minimum of taxpayer involvement. The draft flatly rejects approaches that would require infusions of more taxpayer money, a tack favored by the host of the summit meeting, President Francois Mitterrand of France. A Statement on Bangladesh\nBut in a concession to Mr. Mitterrand, the countries single out one impoverished country, Bangladesh, to receive help in controlling floods that last September wiped out whole villages, although they did not go so far as to propose any spending for the ambitious system of dikes that Mr. Mitterrand wants.\nOne developing country, Mexico, has weighed heavily on the deliberations here because it is seen as a test of the debt policy of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. The Administration has been hoping that a debt-reduction agreement between Mexico and its foreign bankers, in effect validating the Brady policy, will be reached in New York before the meetings here end.\nSo far no such agreements have been made with any debtor, and it is possible that none will be reached with Mexico.\n''I think we're very close,'' Mr. Brady said in an interview with a few reporters today. Mr. Brady, former chairman of the Dillon, Read investment banking firm, added: ''I've been doing deals for 35 years, and you can't tell exactly when a deal is going to close. But I think we're very close.'' Resolve on Drug Traffic\nAmerican officials said they were pleased with one result of their meetings, a strengthened commitment to stop world production of and traffic in illegal drugs.\nAmong other things, the draft says the Group of Seven will convene experts to ''consider means to prevent the utilization of the banking system and financial institutions for the purpose of money laundering.'' France would call the first meeting.\nCurtailing money laundering, the process by which drug traffickers disguise the origins of their money as it moves through the world banking system, ''is a very important way to attack the drug problem,'' the senior Administration official said. Optimism on World Inflation\nWith respect to economic performance, the summit countries note that inflation has been contained in many of the countries but requires vigilance where it is still rising.\nIn interviews, however, officials of several countries said that they were even more sanguine about inflation than the draft statement implies and that they were moving toward Mr. Brady's position that the worst of inflation is past and interest rates could start falling.\nThe West German Finance Minister, Theodor Waigel, said he expected inflation at home to fall to 2.5 percent next year from 3 percent now.\nThe United States incurred implicit criticism in the meetings, the statement shows, over its decision in April to single out Japan, Brazil and India for possible trade sanctions for domestic policies that obstruct American access to their markets. Other countries have called the step a violation of multilateral cooperation in resolving trade disputes.\nThe statement says the countries will ''avoid any discriminatory or autonomous actions'' (an implied criticism of countries that protect their markets), but it adds, ''We also are pledged to oppose the tendency toward unilateralism, bilateralism, sectoralism.'' Call for Environmental Research\nOn the environment, the countries called for more research on issues but added that ''the persisting uncertainty on some of these issues should not unduly delay our action.''\nSignificantly, the countries went beyond the multinational Helsinki accord of earlier this year. That agreement called for an end to production of chlorofluorocarbons, used in refrigerators and air-conditioners, which contribute to the depletion of the world's protective ozone layer.\nThe statement says attention should also be given to other substances that deplete the ozone layer, presumably including carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform.\nThe countries also support further use of nuclear power in energy production as an alternative to burning fossil fuels, which are thought to contribute to global warming.\nThey raise the possibility of establishing a ''framework'' or ''umbrella convention'' to set out guidelines for combatting climate change. The statement is a gesture toward establishing an international body to regulate the world environment.\nThe countries also accepted an Italian Government proposal to serve as the host of a forum on international law for the environment."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-15 00:00:00      \nHC wants sentence copy, answers to five questions The government is set to withdraw Kurigram Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sultana Pervin, as evidence on the detention and torture of journalist Ariful Islam was found to be true.  The development came amid widespread criticism from various quarters regarding the detention and sentencing of Ariful in the early hours of Saturday, for reportedly possessing narcotics and alcohol. Ariful's family has called the allegations against him \"absurd.\" The decision on the DC's withdrawal was disclosed on Sunday after Ariful, Kurigram correspondent of  Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune, was freed on bail around 12:30pm. Worryingly, Ariful was beaten so badly that he was taken directly to a local hospital following his release.   In another development on Sunday, the High Court ordered the state to submit to it a copy of Ariful's conviction which was delivered by a mobile court. Briefing the media at the Secretariat in Dhaka, State Minister for Public Administration, Farhad Hossain, said his ministry will soon withdraw DC Sultana, as an investigation into the incident found most of the allegations against her to be true.  \"Departmental action will also be taken against her [Sultana Pervin],\" he said, adding that not only the DC but all those involved with the incident will be brought to book. Earlier in the day, Ariful was granted bail by Additional District Magistrate Sujauddowla, upon giving an undertaking of Tk25,000. The journalist was released to the custody of Kurigram Press Club President Ahsan Habib Nilu.  Immediately after his release, Ariful was taken to Kurigram General Hospital and hospitalised around 1:30pm with numerous bruises on his body.  \"Ariful has injury marks on his body, especially on his hands, legs, back and head,\" confirmed Orthopaedic Senior Consultant Uttam Kumar Roy.  In addition to protests from journalists across the country regarding Ariful's conviction, The Editors' Council  on Sunday expressed grave concern over recent reports of indiscriminate attacks, abuse and torture of journalists.  At the hospital, Ariful told reporters that the authorities concerned had lied to him about his bail petition. \"An employee of the jail came to me on Saturday night and told me to sign a paper as my family had filed a bail petition,\" the journalist said. \"Today [Sunday], I came to know that my family did not do so.\" 'They threatened my life' Arif said several people led by Senior Assistant Commissioner (Tax) Nazim Uddin broke into his home and started beating him.  \"They blindfolded me and tied up my hands and feet before shoving me into a car,\" Ariful said. \"They proceeded to take me to an isolated place and Nazim kept saying 'Say your prayers now, you are about to meet your maker.' \"I begged them to spare my life. I desperately told them that I have two children and my parents have passed away. Don't kill me or my children will become orphans too,\" said Ariful. Writ on Ariful's conviction The bench of Justice Md Ashraful Kamal and Justice Sardar Md Rashed Jahangir has sought a copy of Ariful's conviction upon hearing a writ petition seeking a court order to declare the conviction illegal. The court also fixed today to issue its order in this regard. Advocate Ishrat Hasan and Barrister Syed Sayedul Haque Suman stood for the writ while Deputy Attorney General Debashis Bhattacharyya represented the state. The court also asked the deputy attorney general to phone the Kurigram DC for all the information regarding Saturday's mobile court, to be sent by email before today's hearing. The bench wanted answers to the following queries:  1.   Was the drive conducted by a mobile court or a special taskforce? 2. There are some rules and regulations regarding entering anyone's house at night (from sunset to sunrise). In this case, were these rules followed and what measures were taken? 3. A huge force of 40 people went to the journalist's house to catch him. Did they go there to arrest a wanted terrorist? According to the journalist's wife, 40 to 50 people took part in the raid. Surely, they must have considered the matter to be very important. Why did they consider the matter to be very important? 4. Before conducting any drive, an executive magistrate of a mobile court needs to take notes on the information source. Who informed the mobile court? 5. According to the Mobile Court Act, an incident needs to take place in front of the executive magistrate to warrant action. In this case, what kind of incident took place? Humiliating people nothing new for Nazim Kurigram Senior Assistant Commissioner (Tax) Nazim was accused of humiliating several people in his previous workplaces.   On November 11, 2018, he was transferred from his post as assistant commissioner (land) of Cox's Bazar Sadar upazila to Rangamati's Langadu upazila after a video showing him humiliating an elderly man went viral on social media.  The mobile court raid Around 12:30am on Saturday, a mobile court set up at the Kurigram DC office jailed Ariful Islam for a year, after law enforcement led by two or three magistrates picked him up from his residence. The officials claimed to have recovered drugs and alcohol from the residence. Among the magistrates was Nazim, said Ariful's wife Mostarima Nitu. At least a dozen Ansar members accompanied the magistrates.  \"They did not search the house, nor did they recover any drugs,\" she said, claiming that Ariful is not even a smoker. Journalist Ariful had filed a report about a renovated pond in Kurigram town that was named after the deputy commissioner. He also produced another report recently about irregularities regarding appointments at the DC's office.   Our Lalmonirhat correspondent  contributed to this report"

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-27 00:00:00      \nThe United States on Thursday took the grim title of the country with the most coronavirus infections and reported a record surge in unemployment as world leaders vowed $5 trillion to stave off global economic collapse. More than 500,000 people around the world have now contracted the new coronavirus, overwhelming healthcare systems even in wealthy nations and triggering an avalanche of government-ordered lockdowns that have disrupted life for billions. In the United States, more than 82,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19, edging out Italy, which has reported the most deaths, and China, where the virus was first detected in December in the metropolis of Wuhan. With fears mounting of a global recession if not depression, leaders from the Group of 20 major economies held crisis talks by video link Thursday, pledging a \"united front\" to fight the outbreak -- along with an enormous financial injection. Spain's death toll has surpassed China's and the country's hospitals have been badly hit \"The virus respects no borders,\" the leaders said in a statement. \"We are injecting over $5 trillion into the global economy, as part of targeted fiscal policy, economic measures, and guarantee schemes to counteract the social, economic and financial impacts of the pandemic.\" They also pledged \"robust\" support for developing nations, where coronavirus could next take hold after ravaging China and then Europe. But the unity pledged by the G20 has been in short supply with China and the United States trading barbs over their handling of the coronavirus crisis. And Italy as well as Spain, which has the second-highest death toll, objected to a draft economic plan by the European Union which they saw as too weak. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte wants a \"strong and sufficient\" financial response that deploys \"innovative financial instruments truly adapted to a war,\" his office said. Record one-day toll in France Alarmed by the rapid spread of the sickness in Italy, France has taken aggressive action to stem the virus and went under lockdown on March 17. But the 365 deaths reported Thursday was its highest in a one-day period and, alarmingly, included a 16-year-old girl -- a rare case of a young person succumbing to a virus that has devastated the elderly. \"It is very difficult to estimate when the peak will come,\" French health official Jerome Salomon said. \"People who are ill now were infected before the confinement began.\" A health worker carries a body on a stretcher outside Gregorio Maranon hospital in Madrid \"Now there is less contact, people are going out less and get infected less. So we hope there will be fewer people getting sick next week and fewer people going to hospital,\" he told reporters. With hospitals under severe strain, medical workers in Italy and Spain are making painstaking choices. \"If I've got five patients and only one bed, I have to choose who gets it,\" Sara Chinchilla, a pediatrician at a hospital near Madrid, told AFP. \"People are dying who could be saved but there's no space in intensive care.\" In Britain, the National Health Service said London's hospitals are facing a \"continuous tsunami\" of seriously ill COVID-19 patients, despite a lockdown imposed this week. People stand on designated areas to maintain social distancing as they queue outside a medical store in Allahabad, India And in New York, the virus hotbed in the United States, authorities hope to stem the growth of infections as the city needs to more than double the number of available hospital beds. \"Almost any scenario that is realistic will overwhelm the capacity of the current healthcare system,\" Governor Andrew Cuomo warned. Economic devastation The pandemic has already, and rapidly, been catastrophic to the global economy. Containers are seen at the Port of Los Angeles on March 26, 2020 as the economy faces severe pressure from the coronavirus In the United States, the world's largest economy, the Labor Department reported that 3.3 million people applied for unemployment benefits last week -- by far the highest number ever recorded. Job losses have swept across sectors from food services to retail to transportation as nearly half of the country has closed to \"non-essential\" businesses. \"It is staggering. We are only seeing the initial numbers; they will get worse, unfortunately,\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters, estimating that half a million people in the city would lose work. Hundreds of people queue outside a government welfare centre, Centrelink, in Melbourne on March 23, 2020, as jobless Australians flood unemployment offices But Wall Street soared for a third straight day, recouping more of this month's hefty losses, on expectations for the largest stimulus in US history. The Senate early Thursday unanimously passed a $2 trillion package that will provide cash payouts averaging $3,400 for a family of four. Speaker Nancy Pelosi voiced confidence that the House of Representatives would follow suit on Friday. President Donald Trump, who has been hoping that a strong economy would win him re-election in November, has been one of the few US leaders to seek a quick return to normal. Priests at risk The global lockdown -- which also hemmed in India's huge population this week -- tightened further on Thursday as Russia announced it was grounding all international flights, while Moscow's mayor ordered the closure of cafes, shops and parks. Tokyo's millions of citizens have been told to stay home, too, just days after the city was forced to postpone the 2020 Olympic Games for a year. China said it was barring entry to most foreigners, fearing that imported cases were undermining its success in bringing domestic transmissions way down. And South Africa braced for a nationwide lockdown as its cases climbed to more than 900 -- about a third of Africa's 2,975 cases. Italy has the highest death toll in the world, though new cases have dipped slightly in recent days The impact of the virus has stretched well beyond frontline health workers, with billions trapped in their homes and facing what experts say could be lasting psychological harm. In virus-stricken Italy, clergy members have been among the worst affected. Out of Italy's more than 7,500 deaths, 67 have been priests. But offering a glimmer of hope, both Italy and Spain have seen lower daily rates of new infections this week. The World Health Organization called Italy's numbers \"encouraging signs\" but warned it was \"still too early to say whether the pandemic is peaking.\" A study from Britain's Imperial College provided a grim prediction, saying 1.8 million people could die worldwide this year even with swift action to halt the virus."

      "text": "INDIA SEEKS TALKS WITH SRI LANKA\n1987-06-06T05:00:00.000Z\nIndia proposed talks with Sri Lanka here next week to resolve their bitter dispute over Indian assistance to the Tamil population in Northern Province in Sri Lanka, where the Government is fighting Tamil separatist guerrillas.\nSri Lanka protested the Indian action to the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, and urged him to draw the attention of the Security Council to the ''violation of the country's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.''\nPakistan, a traditional rival of India, also denounced the air drop as a violation of Sri Lanka's sovereignity and described it as a ''deplorable infringement of international law.'' Talks Proposed for June 13\nIndia proposed that talks be held between the Indian and Sri Lankan foreign ministers at a conference aimed at promoting regional cooperation that begins June 13.\nK. Natwar Singh, India's Minister of State for External Affairs, told reporters tonight that New Delhi wanted ''cordial and good neighborly relations with Sri Lanka and the sooner this happens the better.'' He declined to say whether future air drops were planned.\nOther officials said Jyotindra Dixit, India's Ambassador to Colombo, met today with A. C. S. Hameed, Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister, to discuss the distribution of relief supplies to the Jaffna area in the north, which has been hardest hit by a Government offensive against Tamil guerrillas fighting for an independent nation.\nThe Ambassadors of Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh met the Sri Lankan Ambassador to India on Thursday night to ''express solidarity'' with the Colombo Government, a Sri Lankan diplomat said. Air Drop Called a 'Message'\nOne Indian official described the air drop of food supplies to Tamil areas Thursday as a ''message which had to go to Colombo that Sri Lanka cannot go about killing innocent Tamil civilians without its effects being felt here.''\nHe added that India had conducted the air drop of 25 tons of food and medical supplies over Sri Lanka's objections for its domestic political effect, especially in the southern state of Tamil Nadu where most of the country's 50 million tamils live, as much as out of humanitarian concern.\n''We were told by the state government that if we did not act positively, it would be faced with an uncontrollable situation,'' the official said. Tamil Nadu is governed by a regional party led by M. G. Ramachandran, who is allied with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.\nMr. Ramachandran, according to this official, feared that local Indian extremists would organize violence and destabilize the state administration if New Delhi was not seen to move firmly."

      "text": "Flood-Ravaged Bangladesh Seeks Plan to Control Rivers\n1988-09-09T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Government of Bangladesh, reacting to what may be the worst flood of the country's history, called today for an international panel of experts to devise plans to control the rivers of South Asia.\nAt a news conference here tonight, Bangladesh's Minister of Information, Mahbubur Rahman, announced that the Foreign Minister, Humayun Rashid Chowdhury, had called for the prompt convening of an international panel so that a plan for the river systems could be discussed in December at a summit meeting of nations in the region.\nEarlier today, in an interview in a badly stricken area near the northern outpost of Ghatail, close to the Indian border, Mr. Rahman said that his country would seek to draw Nepal, Bhutan and India into substantive talks on the river systems.\nHe added that ''involving China may also be ultimately necessary,'' because of the proximity of Tibet.\nIt is in areas like Ghatail that the toll of the flooding, which began late last month, is most starkly revealed. Officials there think it will be three to six months before something resembling a normal existence returns. 'A Terrible Human Tragedy'\nBrig. Gen. Subed Ali Bhuya and his infantry brigade there are feeding and housing nearly 30,000 people, 12,000 head of cattle and innumerable chickens and goats. ''Their houses were washed away,'' the general said today of the people who have converged on his garrison since Aug. 30, leading cattle and carrying what they could salvage of their homes. ''It was a terrible human tragedy.''\nThe flooding this year is unlike the expected annual inundation that comes with the monsoon season. It has been a sudden flood ''out of season,'' destroying the barriers and embankments that this impoverished country has managed to construct.\nBangladesh is on the receiving end of mighty river systems - among them the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Jamuna and Meghna - that descend from the Himalayas. From ancient times, it has been destined to suffer major floods with great regularity.\nAdding to the problem in modern times, the great mountains of South Asia have become increasingly denuded and eroded in many places, and the cascade of earth and water each year grows more devastating to Bangladesh, which sprawls over delta after delta at the rivers' mouths.\nIf an international effort were to be mounted to control the rivers, the task would be mammoth, not only because of the technical challenges involved but also because of regional politics. India Called Key to Effort\nNo effective plan can be drawn up without the active support of the regional power, India. Although Bangladesh has sought to involve other neighbors, especially Nepal, where deforestation has also contributed to problems downriver, India continues to insist that the rivers are a matter for direct negotiation between New Delhi and Dhaka. But joint commissions have produced no comprehensive improvement.\nIn addition, relations between China and India have been cool since they fought a border war in the 1960's, and diplomats think India would be unlikely to welcome Chinese involvement in such talks.\nThe Government of Bangladesh today was decribing the floods as ''an unprecedented human tragedy.'' [ The Indian Government announced that it was sending two transport aircraft to drop food supplies to flood victims in Bangladesh.\nAn Indian spokesman said the craft are to carry about 30 tons of foodgrains on Friday and that four Indian helicopters already are assisting in relief work. ] No Place to Land a Helicopter In Ghatail, which is in one of the most severely affected parts of the country, nearly 100 percent of the farmland was under water today.\n''There is no place to land even a helicopter,'' General Bhuya said of the outlying villages in this area in the Tangail district, nearly 100 miles north of Dhaka. Reporters were brought to the general's headquarters by a Bangladesh Air Force helicopter.\nAll of the district's 384,309 people have been dislocated, General Bhuya said. At least 247,670 houses have been damaged or destroyed.\nThe situation is as bad or worse across three-fourths of Bangladesh's land area and for most of the country's 110 million people. Unlike Ghatail, many other areas have no military base where refuge can be sought.\nAmala Hussain, waiting with her seven children for a meal of rice taken from the rations of the men at the Ghatail garrison, said today that throughout her life of hardship as the wife of a landless tenant farmer she had ''never seen anything like this.''\nAt the garrison, medical treatment is administered by army doctors and there is clean water to drink, but when flood victims return home they will have no medicine to fight disease or snake bites. The national death toll from all causes during the flooding now stands at about 510."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-14 00:00:00      \nThe Hidden Potential of Peatlands for Global Climate Mitigation People across the globe are calling for the protection of the planet's forests, creating hashtags such as #PrayForAmazonas as news of the recent fires were trending on Twitter. While it is true that our forests are an essential resource for carbon sequestration, our world's peatlands are the less known and often forgotten global carbon sinks.  Peatlands are terrestrial wetland ecosystems in which the production of organic matter is faster than its decomposition. This process results in the net accumulation of peat - a type of soil with very high organic matter content (often more than 30% by weight) as opposed to mineral soils which have a very low quantity of organic matter.   Peatlands exist in almost all countries and are a long disregarded ecosystem in the fight against climate change. Peatlands are the most widespread version of wetlands, representing roughly 50 to 70% of the global wetlands. They are invaluable ecosystems as they are the world's largest natural terrestrial carbon store. Worldwide, peatlands only account for around three % of the land surface but may store up to 644 gigatonnes of carbon which represents approximately 21% of the total global soil organic carbon stock. Despite being an essential resource for carbon sequestration, human activities such as artificial drainage for agricultural use, are degrading global peatlands - turning this helpful ecosystem service provider into the opposite - a carbon source, contributing further to climate change! Peatland types Temperate and boreal peatlands can be categorized in several ways. One of the most widespread ways to categorize them is - according to the source of water on which these ecosystems depend. The term \"Fens\" refer to peatlands which rely both on rainfall and groundwater while \"Bogs\" refer to peatlands which depend solely on rainfall. As a result of the vegetation which grows in such ecosystems, these ecosystems differ from one type to another. However, tropical peatlands lack much attention and have not been studied as well as non-tropical peatlands have been, and as a result, they have not been systematically categorised. As recent as 2017, the world's largest tropical peatland was discovered in the Congo Basin, meaning large areas that have been storing carbon for millennia may still be undiscovered.    How do peatlands lock away carbon? Peatlands are formed in areas where year-round waterlogged conditions exist. This waterlogging slows the natural process of plant decomposition, and the organic matter they are composed of do not fully degrade due to lack of oxygen and \"pile-up\", thereby locking away carbon. This process, over millennia, builds up to form layers of peat several metres in depth. Generally, 1 meter of peat takes 1000 years to accumulate. What other \"ecosystem services\" do they provide?  Peatlands provide environmental services of economic and social importance including carbon storage, protection against erosion, biodiversity, nutrient cycling and water management. Peat blankets often protect underlying soils from erosion. Peatlands host a broad diversity of species of plants and animals. Plants provide the structural foundation and are the source of organic compounds derived from photosynthesis, required for the sustenance of animals and microorganisms. Peatlands host plant species of high nature conservation value. Other life forms include an associated diverse range of fungi species, microorganisms, protozoan and algae. Furthermore, peatlands serve as migratory resting grounds for a wide range of bird species.  Peatlands provide safe drinking water. It is estimated that ten per cent of the planet's freshwater is stored in peatlands. Highlighting the need for both protecting and maintaining the health of this ecosystem is crucial for water security at present and in the future. Water that is derived from healthy peatlands is generally of high quality - having few pollutants and low nutrient levels, meaning it only requires simple treatment once it reaches a water treatment plant.  Near-natural peatlands can store large amount of water due to the spongy nature of peat. Heavy rainfall is initially absorbed and gradually released over a period of several days, the peatlands thereby act as a form of natural flood management infrastructure often minimising the risk of flood damage downstream. Coastal peatlands may additionally act as a buffer against salinity intrusion. Thus, peatlands are essential in the management of water catchments and when degraded can exacerbate flooding, which in many areas is likely to increase as climate change impacts increase. The protection and restoration of previously degraded peatlands can help to address climate change. Degraded peatlands often contribute significantly as a source of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change. A recent estimate of the monetary value of inland peatlands stands at around 11 trillion international dollars. Although peatlands are among the most valuable ecosystems on Earth, little is known about tropical peatlands. However, what we do know is that peat in the tropics occurs mostly in sub-coastal lowlands and forms from rainforest trees and other higher plants, but may also occur in swamp forests. As of 2008, tropical peatlands are estimated to be around 182 million ha, spanning South America, Asia and Africa, and account for almost half of global peatlands. These peatlands store about 40 to 90 gigatonnes of carbon and are becoming more responsive to global climate change and human influences.  Peatlands in Bangladesh?  Peatlands can be found in Bangladesh as well, although they are not usually classified as such since other wetland categories are more prominently used in Bangladesh. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) peat occupy around 60,000 ha in Bangladesh, while others have estimated this figure to range from 130,000 ha to 224,700 ha (1.6% of the total area). These peatlands can be found between the Ganges river floodplain and the Ganges tidal floodplain in Gopalgonj, Bagerhat and the adjoining parts of Khulna, Barisal and Jessore districts, in deep depressions in the Sylhet Basin and the Northern and Eastern Hills of Bangladesh. Peatlands as threatened ecosystems? Throughout Europe, over the last decades, peatlands throughout Europe and North America have been drained for agricultural use or forestry land reclamation or degraded through peat extraction. In the tropics degradation of peatlands not only caused by agrarian expansion but also result from infrastructure development, such as the construction of roads and highways for better transport networks. Mineral, oil and gas extraction may also cause substantial loss or degradation to peatlands in the tropics. In Bangladesh, peatlands are mostly converted to agricultural land for cultivating Boro rice, shrimp and vegetables where there is little scope for soil carbon storage.   As peatlands are degraded, they become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. For example, in 2015, Indonesian peat swamp forests had seriously damaging fires, that emitted nearly 16 million tonnes of CO2 a day as they burned. This level of emissions contributed more than the daily emissions from the entire US economy. Emissions from drained peatlands are estimated at 1.3 gigatonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to 6% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Peatland restoration can bring significant emission reduction and have been recognized by leading peatland scientists of the world as an effective, comprehensive climate change mitigation strategy. Conservation and restoration: not one solution for all Restoration measures of drained and degraded Northern Peatlands usually include rewetting and ditch blocking along with several other methods depending on the level of degradation, vegetation type and peatland type. Many near-natural peatlands are also conserved as protected areas, without much human interference. However, we must acknowledge that what works or has been working for high-income countries may not always work for countries of the global south. Cultural perception and societal priorities differ vastly from one country to another, from one continent to the next, while differences in economic growth, population density, dependence on ecosystems for livelihood further complicates the matter; a \"copy and paste\" approach, therefore, is not the way forward. What could be a possible way forward though, is for Governments to realize the importance of peatlands, beyond its monetary value and take necessary steps to understand peatlands as not exclusively as ecosystems but as social-ecological systems, thereby acknowledging the importance of humans as part of nature.  For Bangladesh, the national and local governments must act together with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as relevant research institutes to develop policies to protect and restore peatlands in Bangladesh. Such policies should not only be based on sound \"natural\" science but should also be based on a sound understanding of local communities. Bangladesh, being an agricultural economy and a country with very high population density, is a country where it is quite challenging to preserve vast areas of peat-forming ecosystems, without incorporating humans into the picture. Several models of community-based management have been tried and tested in the country, especially for wetlands and forests, which could be further developed for peatland management. However, given the lack of research on peatlands in Bangladesh, the first step would be to identify and locate peatlands all over the country, followed by different but inclusive restoration and management measures.    Under the Paris Agreement countries are encouraged to include peatland restoration in their commitments to global international agreements. The inclusion of peatland emissions from degraded peatlands and on the flip side carbon saving from peatland restoration are both eligible for consideration within Nationally Determined Contributions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Therefore countries must begin to include peatland restoration and re-wetting in their national climate action plans.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-18 00:00:00      \nThe official death toll since the outbreak in the country has risen to 22,745 Deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy rose by 575 on Friday, up from 525 the day before, while the number of new cases declined slightly and scientists warned that infections were now mainly happening among family members. The daily tally of new cases stood at 3,493, down from a previous 3,786, with both deaths and infections extending the broadly stable situation in place over the last 12 days. This plateau is considerably lower than the peaks reached around the end of March, but the downtrend has not proceeded as was widely hoped in a country that has been in lockdown for almost six weeks. \"Probably most of the infections that have occurred since the lockdown have occurred within families,\" Giovanni Rezza, a director of Italy's top health body, the Superior Health Institute (ISS), told a news conference. Nuclear physicist Paolo Branchini, who has been focusing on the trend of cases and deaths in Italy, told daily Corriere della Sera on Friday that the lockdown initially put a lid on infections but had now \"exhausted its beneficial effect\". Branchini said that because the main source of infections was now within families, the only way to reduce deaths and cases further was to put all people who tested positive in dedicated centres away from their relatives. The official death toll since the outbreak came to light on February 21, has risen to 22,745, the Civil Protection Agency said, the second highest in the world after that of the United States. However, the Italian authorities acknowledge that the true number of fatalities is much higher. The Superior Health Institute said a survey on a sample of nursing homes suggested more than 40% of residents who died from February 1 to April 15 had either tested positive for the new coronavirus or had symptoms consistent with the disease. Restive regions The government has said its tough restrictions on movement and the closure of most businesses will continue at least until May 3, but there is not yet any clear plan over to what extent, or how gradually, it will then be lifted. In the meantime, some of Italy's 20 regions are threatening to take autonomous action. Luca Zaia, the head of the northern Veneto region which has made particular progress in bringing the outbreak under control, said on Friday he wanted to relax restrictions before May 3. \"The lockdown doesn't exist anymore,\" Zaia told reporters, in reference to the government having allowed a few types of business to reopen over the last week. In response, the chief of the southern Campania region around Naples, Vincenzo De Luca, said if northern regions did not respect all the curbs in place, Campania would \"close its borders\" and refuse entry to non-residents for any reason. The outbreak remains heavily concentrated in the northern regions of Lombardy, around the financial capital Milan, and neighbouring Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna. The number of officially confirmed cases in Italy on Friday totalled 172,434, the third highest global tally behind those of the United States and Spain."

      "text": "TRIANGLE PARK: NORTH CAROLINA'S HIGH-TECH PAYOFF\n1987-04-26T05:00:00.000Z\nAZT was all but forgotten, an ineffective cancer drug, when the Burroughs Wellcome Company moved its North American headquarters and research laboratories in 1970 from New York's Westchester County to the Research Triangle Park near here.\nBut in the past two years, biochemists at the company's park labs and at the National Cancer Institute have shown that the antiviral drug - formally known as azidothymidine -could prolong the lives of many AIDS patients. In anticipation of the Federal clearance that came last month allowing doctors to prescribe AZT, Burroughs Wellcome expanded its plant in Greenville, N.C., some 75 miles east of here, to increase production of the drug. AZT is sold under the brand name Retrovir.\nThe prospect of more jobs and tax revenues for North Carolina because of the AZT breakthrough is a fresh reminder of how well the state's long-running effort to recruit high-tech companies and research institutes to Triangle Park has paid off.\nThe park is now the largest research center of its kind in the world, operated by a nonprofit foundation on behalf of the area's three major universities - Duke in Durham, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State in Raleigh. Home to a work force of 27,000 and an annual payroll of more than $1 billion, it is far bigger than the Princeton Forrestal Center in New Jersey and the Stanford Research Park in California, two other university-linked operations.\nSince it opened in 1960, the research complex here has turned the triangle-shaped area formed by Durham, Chapel Hill and Raleigh, the state capital, into one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. The area covers some 1,500 square miles, making it a bit larger than Rhode Island.\nAt the same time, the park's emphasis on semiconductors, biotechnology and other cutting-edge sciences has given North Carolina -long dependent on tobacco, textiles and furniture manufacturing - a new stake in the future.\nIndeed, ''the people in North Carolina like to think Raleigh-Durham is the future,'' said G. Donald Jud, an economic consultant to the Central Carolina Bank in Durham. And Terry Sanford, the state's Democratic Senator and a former president of Duke, has called Triangle Park the catalyst.\nBurroughs and most of its 50 or so neighbors in the sprawling park were drawn here by the concentration of major universities as well as by the region's pine-covered hills and easy mix of countrified and urban ways.\n''This is a particularly attractive place for a company in pharmaceuticals and biological sciences,'' said Joseph J. Ruvane Jr., chairman and chief executive of Glaxo Inc., another drug manufacturer that has its headquarters in the park. ''U.N.C. has a great school of pharmacy, there are great medical schools at Duke and U.N.C. and a great engineering school at N.C. State. And the quality of life we have is pretty hard to find.''\nBut now the park is at a crossroads, poised for a new period of growth, and state residents and government officials are grappling with some of the changes that success has brought to the region.\nSome people here are saying that the flood of new arrivals is jeopardizing their special quality of life. They point to such unsettling new features as traffic jams and land speculation - and to a population in the four-county region that is expected to exceed 1 million by the year 2000, up 50 percent from the current estimate of nearly 700,000.\n''Yes, we want growth, but we want to control any dangers to the quality of life that has brought people here in the first place,'' said Claude Sitton, editor of The Raleigh News and Observer. He noted that growth-related worries about water and air pollution and rising housing costs are hotly debated at Raleigh City Council meetings.\nMOREOVER, not everyone has shared in the boom. The poor and the less educated are being squeezed out through a kind of high-tech gentrification. Notwithstanding the Greenville plant and a few similar spinoffs, many parts of North Carolina have benefited little from the millions of dollars that the state has poured into the park area in the form of research grants, highway projects and other improvements, some critics say.\nSome of the problems are being addressed. The Ford Foundation awarded $95,000 in January to two University of North Carolina professors, Michael I. Luger and Harvey Goldstein, to study the park's economic impact on the region, including its effect on low- and middle-income residents. The park's North Carolina Biotechnology Center now receives $6.5 million a year from the state to use as seed money for start-up projects throughout North Carolina. And still more roads are being built to relieve the congestion.\nSome of the changes, however, may simply have to be accepted as the price of growth, experts on economic development say.\nWhat is certain is that the future promises even more growth. With 2,700 of its 6,700 acres yet to be developed, the park expects to more than double its work force, to 60,000, in the next 15 years. An unrelated commercial and residential project, called Treyburn, is starting to take shape just north of Durham. Treyburn's developers, who chose the area because of the park, say 50,000 people will eventually work at the new site. And on June 15, American Airlines is scheduled to open a $150 million terminal at the Raleigh-Durham Airport, its new north-south hub on the East Coast.\nIt also seems certain that the park will continue to be viewed around the world as one of the most successful joint development efforts by business, academia and government. Japan has built its own version in Sapporo. In the past year alone, delegations from Uruguay, Bangladesh, China, Nigeria and dozens of other countries have traveled to North Carolina to see the park for themselves.\nWhat they see had its origins in the mid-50's, when North Carolina ranked 45th among the states in personal income. The economy was built on low-wage, labor-intensive industries. While North Carolina has long had excellent schools, talented students often moved away after graduation because the professional jobs were elsewhere.\nTHE research park was designed to stem the ''brain drain.'' The project was shepherded along by the late Luther H. Hodges, who served as the state's Governor from 1954 until 1961 and then as Secretary of Commerce in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations.\nLand for the park was purchased with private donations of $2.2 million and then signed over to the Research Triangle Foundation. To retain the park's bucolic campus-like ambiance, the foundation decreed that buildings could occupy only 15 percent of the large lots that it sold. Companies can do light assembly in the park in addition to research, but not manufacturing.\nAfter a slow start, the park attracted the International Business Machines Corporation, which opened offices there in 1966. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a big Federal research facility, also came that year. The park's roster also includes the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, a pioneering industry consortium that has received $82 million in state funding since 1981; Sumitomo Electric, which established its American headquarters and research labs in the park four years ago, and Northern Telecom Ltd., the Canadian telecommunications manufacturer.\nInstead of suffering from a brain drain, the area now boasts more Ph.D.'s per capita than anywhere else in the country. Unemployment, which has not exceeded 5 percent in the last 12 years in the four-county region, averaged a paltry 3.3 percent in 1986, compared with 5.3 percent in the state and 7 percent in the nation. And North Carolina is now ranked 37th in personal income.\n''There are a lot of measurable things that people like about this area,'' said Professor Luger. ''Our best judgment is the park has been responsible for a lot of that.''\nBut the kind of growth that the park fosters has also raised housing and transportation costs, said Paul Luebke, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro.\nThe cost of land, for example, has soared in recent years. Prices within the research park have increased 50 percent in the last five years, to $45,000 an acre, according to Ned E. Huffman, the executive vice president of the Research Triangle Foundation. Outside the park's borders -and away from its restrictions -speculators have bid prices as high as $150,000 an acre.\n''There is relatively little emerging here for low- to moderate-income people,'' said Professor Luebke.\nMore production spinoffs from the park's research efforts, which would create lower-wage jobs, may be near, said Paul B. Phelps, a specialist in economic development who studied the park for Congress's Office of Technology Assessment.\nTHE evidence available so far, however, suggests that rural sections are getting the manufacturing jobs because labor costs there are lower than in the immediate Raleigh-Durham area. Burroughs Wellcome, for example, has already added 40 jobs in Greenville because of AZT, increasing its work force there to 1,500. The plant was opened in Greenville at the time Burroughs Wellcome moved its headquarters to the park, where it now has another 1,400 employees.\nSimilarly, Glaxo, maker of the world's largest-selling prescription drug, an anti-ulcer medication called Zantac, is planning to expand its manufacturing plant in Zebulon, some 25 miles east of the park. The plant now has 300 workers.\nOther sections of the state are ''still waiting for the ripple effects,'' said Ezra Vogel, a Harvard sociologist, in his 1985 book on American industrial competitiveness, ''Comeback.''\nRaleigh-Durham will continue to be the main beneficiary - at least in terms of high-tech jobs - for a long time to come, those who have studied the area say.\nIndeed, Raleigh-Durham's growth prospects proved irresistible to the partners developing the huge Treyburn site. The partners - which include Tishman-Speyer Properties of Manhattan, the Equitable Life Assurance Society and the Bishop Estate of Hawaii - expect the site to attract more than $1.5 billion in industrial, commercial and residential projects during the next 20 years.\nFor now, though, the area is experiencing growing pains, conceded W. Clay Hamner, Treyburn's general partner.\n''But these issues will be resolved over the next 10 years,'' he maintained. ''Then, like what happened in Atlanta 20 years ago, you'll have a single metropolitan area, with more than a million people.''"

This decision came right after a meeting between the representatives of Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation (BWTWF), and director general (DG) of Department of Shipping on Wednesday night. Authorities concerned assured the water transport workers that all of their 11-point-demands will be met by August 30. Confirming the matter to Dhaka Tribune BWTWF Secretary General Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam said: \"Considering various factors such as the nationwide flood situation, upcoming Eid-ul-Azha, absence of the State Minister of Labour and Employment Monnujan Sufian, we have decided to postpone our strike.  \"The decision came up based on the assurance to solve all our problems within August 30. All types of water transports can now operate freely.\" Earlier in the morning, water transport workers went on a countrywide indefinite strike to press home their 11-point demand. Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation enforced the strike at Sadarghat in Dhaka on Tuesday midnight with various demands, including increasing salary, providing appointment letter and identity card, and issuing landing pass for India bound workers. Sadarghat police station Officer-in-Charge Md Rezaul Karim Bhuiyan told Dhaka Tribune that launch services of all routes were suspended. \"For the last few days, they [workers] were also putting up posters at Sadarghat launch terminal to press home their demands,\" he said. Passengers of Dhaka-Chandpur route, which leaves the terminal during the day, suffered the most due to the strike.  Prakash Dutta said: \"If there is no positive discussion on our problems, the strike will continue.\"   Earlier on April 15, the workers had staged a strike with the same demands. Following the strike, the government, and the launch owners were given an ultimatum to resolve the problem within 45 working days. The ultimatum ended on June 26, without any outcome. State Minister of Labour and Employment Monnujan Sufian held a meeting regarding the issue on July 15. However, no solution was reached."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-17 00:00:00      \nThe move followed highly publicized complaints from some governments and hospitals that they received PPE from China that they considered faulty The United States has asked China to revise new export quality control rules for protective equipment needed during the coronavirus pandemic so they are not an obstacle to timely supplies, a spokesman for the US State Department said on Thursday. China tightened restrictions on exports of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) last Friday, calling for shipments of the items to be subjected to a mandatory customs inspection. It was a bid by China to balance the global demand for PPE to help treat the rising number of cases of the new coronavirus, while ensuring that manufacturers and sellers do not flood the market with uncertified or shoddy products. The move followed highly publicized complaints from some governments and hospitals that they received PPE from China that they considered faulty. \"We appreciate the efforts to ensure quality control. But we do not want this to serve as an obstacle for the timely export of important supplies,\" a State Department spokesman said. \"The US Government has raised these concerns with (China). We have requested that China revise its new requirements to allow the expeditious export of vital PPE to the United States,\" he said. The United States is heavily reliant on medical supplies produced in China, a major strategic and trade rival, something that has been highlighted in the pandemic, in which the United States has been the worst-affected country. Earlier on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal cited US businesses and diplomatic memos as saying that China's export restrictions had left US-bound face masks, test kits and other medical equipment stranded. It cited suppliers and brokers as saying that large quantities were sitting in warehouses across China unable to receive necessary clearances. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke by phone with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and stressed the \"high importance\" Washington attached to China's facilitation of medical supply exports to meet critical demand in the United States. The US-China Business Council trade lobby group president Craig Allen told reporters on Thursday it had \"had a very good set of discussions with a relatively high level of the Chinese government over the last few days ... and the Chinese government is making allowances and working with our companies to ensure that they're able to ship out.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-23 00:00:00      \nClimate vulnerability depends not only on climate change, but also on how we develop Recently, the country experienced several major cyclones (eg Sidr and Aila), indicating that climate change is already impacting Bangladesh, and future effects would further aggravate this already bleak situation. Although there will be stronger tropical cyclones (TCs) observed in the Bay of Bengal, the total number is not expected to vary much. The stronger TCs will have particularly serious impacts on our nation's forestry. The country's coastal forests, such as mangroves and coastal plantations -- including charland plantations -- will be at the forefront of climate change. Sea rise due to high temperatures may submerge coastal forests and settlements, resulting in climate refugees. In the winter, high evapotranspiration combined with low water flow will increase the salinity of the forest soil and coastal waters. These conditions adversely affect freshwater-dependent flora and fauna, in particular, and forest productivity and biodiversity in general. This will eventually shift the character of forest boundaries and vegetation as the species that provide dense canopy cover will be replaced by non-woody shrubs and bushes.    Climate change projections Climate change may affect the country's forest eco-systems, which may result in negative consequences for forest-dependent communities. However, like any other natural systems, forest eco-systems are generally able to tolerate some level of climate change and so will continue to persist in the short term.  In the long term, whether their resilience will be sufficient enough to tolerate future anthropogenic climate change, is not known. Using climate change, including adaptation, as a driver to undertake activities with multiple benefits can catalyze progress in achieving a country's sustainable development goals. Many countries are starting to take action towards adapting to climate change. Such actions need to be expanded and integrated into national and sectoral planning to ensure that sustainable development and adaptation are mutually enhanced. Climate change-based information has the following advantages on a longer time-scale adaptation planning:   * Enhancing the scientific basis for decision-making for adaptations  * Strengthening methods and tools for the assessment of adaptation  * Education, training, and public awareness on adaptation, including for young people  * Individual and institutional capacity-building  * Technology development and transfer; and promotion of local coping strategies  * Appropriate legislation and regulatory frameworks, which promote adaptive-friendly action  * An adaptive planning process that covers different time-scales and levels (eg national, regional) and sectors  We have also experienced the impacts of inter-annual time-scale climate variability El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). From our review, we are fairly confident that ENSO variations will continue to occur and influence global climate in the coming decades and centuries. Therefore, climate change projection combined with a future ENSO event may provide improved perspective for capacity-building efforts in the forestry sector of Bangladesh. Also, future vulnerability depends not only on climate change, but also on development pathways. The implementation of adaptation needs to be integrated into national and international sustainable development priorities, as well as into national and sectoral development plans in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has already started to take concrete action towards adaptation to climate change. However, such action needs to be expanded and integrated into national and sectoral planning to ensure that sustainable development and adaptation are mutually enhanced. Recommendations for improvement Future trends are becoming clear, insofar as there is a need for more quantified spatial specific information, especially on future changes in extremes. This information is needed for improved flood and drought risk analyses. Therefore, we propose a climate change micro-level downscaling analysis of the future climate scenarios for Bangladesh. The output of this downscaling exercise is necessary for future water availability, food security, flood risk analyses, and forest eco-systems. The other major issue that needs to be seriously addressed is the inter-annual variability ENSO. One of the biggest El Nino related threats is forest fire. Forest fires threaten many ecologically-important areas, including habitats for rare species like tigers, and the smoke they give off is a serious threat to local people's health. Improved longer-term projection based on El Nino variability is essential for adapting to forest hazards in Bangladesh. It is also important to improve our understanding of emissions from fires in the region, which would ultimately help improve climate models. It will also contribute to initiatives like the United Nations Collaborative Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation program.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-11 00:00:00      \nThis translation marks the writer's second death anniversary on April 24.  (Translated by Khademul Islam)  Ah, those days, it made no difference to us whether it was night or day--we didn't know, and didn't care to know! The only thing that mattered was spending twenty-four hours of the day at the Coffee House on College Street (in the then Calcutta). Though formally it was supposed to open at 9:00 in the morning, an insistent clamor to open the main gate would commence from 8:30 onward, and by 9:15 it would inevitably begin to loosen and then open. Some of us insiders who knew what to do would then slip in early and grab the seats at our favorite tables. At the entrance, by the foot of the stairs leading up to the cafe, would be Ismail, the man from my own side of Bengal, from whom we would buy ten-plus-ten totaling twenty sticks meaning two packs of Charminar cigarettes, which were our invaluable props as we sought the precious philosopher's stone inside the cafe. As the day wore on, all sorts of people would drop by. Some were stooped from the weight of their learning, while others were wracked by drugs. Everybody from the hangman to the racetrack addict - who would not drop by there? At that time, we were the most senior of the Coffee-House-ians. Until the gates closed at 10:30 at night, who had time for anything else? No sooner would one group depart than the next one would breeze in; all were our devotees and hangers-on. Ah, life then was so light and sublime and so full of promise! The days blew by in a swirl of good times and laughter. If Baruna left our table, the slot would be filled by Namita. Almost five feet tall and shapely and chocolate-colored, Namita had us all buzzing around her like a swarm of bees. We would table-hop incessantly; now this table, then that table, and time would fly by with nobody knowing how or where.  Especially if it was a winter day. When on one such day came our very own Babu Shri Chandan Majumdar, who was good-looking, well-spoken, and a Coffee House regular, because, really, what was one to do with one's life except write poetry? With a broad, beguiling smile he informed us that his kaka (paternal uncle) S... and his mother had been repeatedly pressing him to bring the gang one day over to the family home, and that today was that very day! That both his Mama and mother kept hearing so many tales from him about us, the Coffee House crowd, that everybody in his household, from old to young, felt as if they had come to know us intimately. His mother, listening to these tales, in fact, was quite taken with a certain wretch named Belal Chowdhury, and now harbored a store of affection for this fellow far in excess of what she displayed for her own sons and daughters. And also, he said, it would be quite special if Namita and the Mitras could also come along, though of course he knew that those two had families and duties, people to take care of. Whereas among the rest of us there was one truly free male named Belal--if he could be made to tag along then we were assured of not only a chicken-and-rice dinner being laid out but also the prospect of some extra cash, say, a little twenty-rupee handout.  No way! I took a firm stand against such an idea. That would not be allowed to happen. I would announce to his folks from the very first that I had no need of anything. And even if there was, I would ask for it myself.  The afternoons then were honeyed. And now that there was no way to back out of this outing, it made sense to waste as little time as possible in hitting the road given that it would afford us more time for play and fun. Led by Chandan, by the time we descended from the Bangaon train line at some cow-shit, fly-blown station, the winter afternoon shadows were beginning to darken and deepen. Dense banks of trees lined the path to Chandan's village, as an equally dense, deep blue dusk began to fall. The moment we entered the neighborhood his house was in, however, a deep voice suddenly brought us to an abrupt halt.  Aha, the voice intoned: from which direction has the Sun God risen today? Otherwise how can it be that at this time of the day do we get to see our Chandan Babu in our lowly little village, and that too with his friends and boon companions. Are you fellows feeling all right, your bodies fit to do battle, is that the... It was Chandan himself who stepped forward and introduced the voice to us as his Mama (maternal uncle). Who knew about so much and yet had not the slightest air of affectation about him or a jot of righteousness, talking and mingling with us like some genial lord of the manor: Baba, all of you are very lucky fellows, you have blossomed forth on a very auspicious day. So what if it's a cold Kartik night with its sweet air blowing around us--today it's also a Kartik full moon night. The goddess Parvati's son, the six-faced one who is the commander of the heavenly forces in his abode, will enchant us tonight with his playful frolicking and fancies.  But, Chandan Babu, listen, why don't you hurry on ahead in the meantime to the house and give my didi Audity advance notice of our guests? By the time you get everything ready I will have shown them the moonrise over on the other side of Dudh Sayerer beel, and then bring them around. This did not sit well with me. No matter how dear a Mama he was of Chandan I didn't feel like going even one step forward with this gentleman. But what choice did I have? In the tenth circle of Hell even the gods become ghosts/And we all know who's to blame for it. Even though Chandan and I grumbled a bit about it, I noted that the others were all for experiencing the Kartik moonrise over on the other side of Dudh Sayerer beel. After walking a considerable distance, I felt as if I no longer even had the energy to listen to the howling and barking of distant foxes and jackals. Mama was striding in front of us like Vasco de Gama, while muttering some incantations under his breath. To be perfectly truthful, our collective knowledge of Sanskrit was so meager that the Shiva-like cries of those jackals seemed clearer and more ominous. But Mama was our indisputable leader. Drawing up his dhuti tightly around him and clutching at his sacred paita thread, he was murmuring mantras so obscure and unfathomable that it was impossible for any of us to understand a single word of it. Then, all of a sudden, he stopped at a spot and raising a forefinger at the distant forest line, he said, look, look at this scene. Are you destined in this life to ever see this again? Fill your heart with it. If not over a bamboo grove, the moon has certainly risen over the tops of the mango orchard, and even if Kajala didi is not here to sing this sloka to you all, at least the Mama who is before you will always be with you. And look, look, take a good look across this vast plain to see what a real full moon night can be--oh, what a flood of shimmering light falls down on us! But you know,  all this while there were jackals, now it seems that packs of wild dogs have joined them in the baying and howling. Even then I would urge you to take a last look at the moonlight cascading down over the tree line. It was not for nothing that Abanindranath had written: here is one moon/over there is another moon/O brother the moons twine/the moon over the hinchay bush... The way Chandan's mama that night, in that remote cow-shit, fly-blown sheltered nook, in leading us to see the moonrise, flayed us with the moon that even today after all this time it seems to me that we are still trapped in some charmed circular maze, going round and round in a trance...

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-16 00:00:00      \nSultana Pervin came under fire after approving a questionable mobile court raid at Ariful Islam's home The government has appointed a new deputy commissioner (DC) in Kurigram district, removing Sultana Pervin. She came under fire following the questionable arrest, incarceration, and torture of Dhaka Tribune journalist Ariful Islam by a mobile court raid she approved. A circular from the Ministry of Public Administration announcing Sultana's removal from the post and attachment to the ministry was issued on Monday. Another circular, issued on Monday, said Mohammad Rezaul Karim, deputy secretary of the ministry, will replace Sultana as the new Kurigram DC and district magistrate. The ministry has also withdrawn three executive magistrates from Kurigram connected to the incident, by issuing another circular. The officials are - Senior Assistant Commissioner Nazim Uddin, and assistant commissioners Rintu Bikash Chakma, and SM Rahatul Islam of Kurigram. All three orders were effective immediately, said the circulars. Meanwhile, State Minister for Public Administration, Farhad Hossain, told Dhaka Tribune: \"There are allegations against them [the four commissioners] and they have been made officers on special duty [OSD]. \"We will initiate divisional inquiry, and punitive action will be taken against them if they are found guilty after investigation,\" he added. However, the High Court on Monday asked state lawyer, Deputy Attorney General Debashis Bhattacharyya, to collect and submit all documents related to Ariful's conviction and bail by March 23. The bench of Justice Md Ashraful Kamal and Justice Sardar Md Rashed Jahangir issued the order on Monday. Supreme Court Bar Association President, advocate AM Amin Uddin, and advocate Ishrat Hasan with Barrister Syed Sayedul Haque Suman, stood for the writ. During the hearing, the court made a comment stating that a single person does not represent the whole country. The state will not take responsibility for someone's mistake. On Sunday, the High Court ordered the state to submit before it a copy of the conviction and one-year imprisonment sentence of the journalist, issued by a mobile court. During the hearing, the bench also asked the state to respond to some questions over the mobile court's judgment. Responding to a question about whether the drive was conducted by a mobile court or a special taskforce, the state lawyer informed the court that it was a special taskforce and there were 13 people including six from police, five from Ansar battalion, one from the department of narcotics, and one executive magistrate. The drive was conducted around 11:45pm of March 13, 2020, and they found 450ml of local liquor and 100gm of cannabis, with a price of approximately TK150 and Tk1,000 respectively, the DAG informed the court. The DAG told the court that everything was done by law. Advocate Amin Uddin said to the court that a mobile court cannot hand out punishment this way. Mobile courts are appreciated and operations of all mobile courts are not being questioned, he said. Drawing an example of an abuse of power, he said a mobile court had punished a teacher earlier by asking him to \"perform squats holding his ears\" at an examination hall for using a mobile phone. Over the Kurigram incident, the lawyer mentioned that this too was an abuse of power. The way the mobile court operated has proven a mala fide intent. \"One can hand out punishment if a journalist commits an offence, but not in this way.\" The senior lawyer also appraised the role of the media in the country. The court asked the lawyer to bring in journalist Ariful as petitioner if possible and told the state lawyer that there is a gray area regarding how bail was granted to the journalist. Earlier on Sunday, advocate Ishrat Hasan filed the petition on behalf of online news portal Bangla Tribune's Executive Editor, Harun-Ur-Rashid. On March 14, Ariful Islam, Kurigram district correspondent of Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune , was sent to one-year in jail, soon after the mobile court, set up at the Kurigram DC's office, ended the trial proceedings. The mobile court in the dead of night jailed the journalist for a year, after law enforcement led by magistrates picked him up from his home in Kurigram town. The mobile court brought an allegation against the journalist that drugs and alcohol were recovered from his possession, which his family termed absurd. DC's comments contradictory with documents The Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sultana Parvin on March 14 told Dhaka Tribune that a task force was set up to apprehend the journalist as a routine drive against narcotics.  However, her comments in the documents, placed before the court by the state lawyer, contradict that statement. In the witness record, one of the witnesses, Md Arif, stated that Ariful was apprehended by mobile court and the task force while he was drinking liquor and smoking cannabis. Meanwhile countrywide processions were organized by journalists and civil society to seek justice and protest the abuse of power and torture of journalists. They were held in Comilla, Khulna, Natore, Nilphamari, Jhalakati, Joypurhat, Naogaon, Narsingdi, Thakurgaon, Rangpur, Netrokona, Sirajganj and Tangail, according to our correspondents. Our district correspondents Masud Alam, Comilla, Hedait Hossain Molla, Khulna, contributed to this report."

There were so many people on the ferries on the Padma yesterday that the authorities, in a bid to prevent crowding, suspended the services on Shimulia-Kathalbari and Paturia-Daulatdia routes for hours. In the absence of public transport because of the ongoing shutdown, the holiday-makers travelled by pickups, motorcycles and battery-run three wheelers. Many had to spend two to three times the usual fare. The Dhaka-Chattogram highway witnessed a 25-km tailback in Daudkandi, caused mainly by thousands of cars leaving Dhaka. The Covid-19 outbreak had hit Dhaka and its adjacent areas the hardest in the country. Experts said this rush of thousands of people will further spread the deadly virus and delay the reopening process. After observing the crowds that have been getting bigger for the last few days, the Bangladesh Jatri Kalyan Samity in a statement yesterday urged the government to announce a 10-day curfew around the Eid to slow the spread of the outbreak. Around three crore people used to leave Dhaka and other major cities ahead of Eid, it said. And many people have started leaving the cities for their hometowns this week. The shutdown began on March 26 and the government later extended it six times. Before May 30, most of the private and public offices will not reopen and transport services will not resume. In a circular on May 14, the cabinet division said movement of people will be restricted from May 17-May 28 across the country. The circular also said that no one would be allowed to leave the city where they work. The local administration and law enforcers were supposed to enforce the restrictions during the period. Police on Sunday stepped up measures to restrict the movement of people. They set up check posts across the country to prevent people from travelling from one district to another during Eid unless there is an emergency. But the number of people leaving Dhaka increased yesterday. Eid-ul-Fitr will be celebrated on May 24 or 25, subject to the sighting of the moon. CROWDING AT FERRY TERMINALS The number of people leaving Dhaka has been increasing since Friday, a day after the government announced the extension of the Eid holidays. Ferry operators on the Shimulia-Kathalbari route said they have been transporting several thousand people across the Padma every day this week. The authorities reduced the number of ferries from 14 to just four early yesterday to prevent crowding. But from 6:00am to 10:00am, the operators had to carry only people across the river, because there was no room for vehicles, said an employee. As the day progressed and the crowd became larger, the authorities suspended the services around 3:00pm. The services did not resume as of 9:00pm. Ferry terminal staffers said there were thousands of people there. At Paturia and Daulatdia terminals, the situation was similar. As the number of small vehicles increased in the last few days, the authorities stopped transporting small vehicles from 11:00pm on Sunday, Zillur Rahman, BIWTC deputy general manager at the terminal, told this newspaper. When the number of small vehicles like cars kept rising, they stopped operation of all five ferries from 11:00am yesterday, he said. \"We will resume operation after getting permission from higher authorities and will only carry goods-laden vehicles now.\" Rifat Rahman Shamim, superintendent of police in Manikganj, said police were struggling to control the movement of people. Police on Sunday set up a check-post at Golra on Dhaka-Aricha highway in Manikganj, he told our Manikganj correspondent. But people have been reaching Paturia Ghat at night, using bypass roads, he added. The terminals witnessed similar crowds when the government on March 23 announced the shutdown from March 26. DHAKA-CTG HIGHWAY The long tailback from Eliotganj to Daudkandi took shape yesterday morning. The situation became normal around 4:00pm. As the number of private vehicles increased, police intensified their checking activities, causing the gridlock, reports our Cumilla correspondent. Abdullah Al Mamun, officer in charge of Daudkandi Highway Police Station, said they have been working to maintain the \"lockdown\" strictly. Vehicles carrying goods and emergency transports were only allowed to move towards Dhaka. Lorry driver Shafikul Islam, however, said when police forced the cars to return to Dhaka, they caused the jam. WHAT HEALTH EXPERTS SAY Prof Dr Shah Monir Hossain, one of the eight members of a government-formed expert committee to supervise, monitor and support the coronavirus response, said: \"It's clear indication that we are going towards a worse situation. \"In a nutshell, I can tell you that the way people... are returning to their village homes.... we are heading towards a more serious crisis.\" The government should immediately take measures to stop the flood of people leaving Dhaka, he added. Prof Muzaherul Huq, former World Health Organisation regional adviser for Southeast Asia, said, \"I think the death rate from coronavirus may increase if the government fails to prevent people from going to their homes. \"We are yet to know who tested positive or negative for Covid-19. That's why a sea of people, especially from the hotspots, going back to their villages, poses serious risks to others,\" he said.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-02 00:00:00      \nDengue, the notorious mosquito-borne menace in the country, is back and so is the familiar paranoia that accompanies its advent every monsoon. Splashed across the front pages of newspapers and the headlines of news channels are the alarming numbers of new cases of dengue every day. People are grappling with anxiety and confusion over the news that dengue is manifesting itself in a different form this time; patients are presenting with atypical features and their conditions rapidly deteriorating in the absence of timely medical intervention. \"The epidemiology of dengue is complex and it still remains poorly understood. It entails the host (humans), vector (Aedes mosquito) and viral (Dengue virus) status; these factors are further influenced by demographic, behavioral and societal determinants,\" explains Professor Dr Quazi Tarikul Islam, during his speech at the seminar \"Dengue: changing trends and management update\", organised by the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and the Bangladesh Society of Medicine. \"Aedes mosquito is very adaptive.  It has evolved in terms of both longevity and survival due to climate change and different socio-cultural and economic factors of human habitation,\" adds Dr Islam, who is also editor-in-chief of the national guideline on dengue. He refers to the shift in the affected age group earlier, dengue fever used to be uncommon in adults, whereas older age groups being affected have been reported not only in Bangladesh, but also in Thailand, Singapore, and Indonesia. Another shift is that the largely urban-centric disease has now spread to rural areas too. \"Moreover, changes in the dengue virus are altering its ability to cause infections. In sequential or secondary infections, the manifestations become severe,\" says Dr Islam. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), warmer temperatures due to global warming accelerate the development of mosquitoes and reduce the time it takes for them to become infectious. In addition, increased rainfall leads to more ideal breeding sites and high humidity enhances their chances of survival. The worsening flood situation this year, coupled with the unusually high temperatures, could have triggered such alterations. Concerns over the re-emergence of a new serotype have also been voiced by experts. There are four distinct serotypes of dengue. The national guideline on dengue, published by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), documents that following its first outbreak in Bangladesh back in mid-2000, the prevalent serotypes of dengue were the first three; among them, serotype-3 was only predominant till 2002. A study published in the journal New Microbes and New Infections states that the re-emergence of serotype-3 in 2017 may have been responsible for the massive dengue outbreak in Bangladesh last year. Previously, no cases of serotype-3 or serotype-4 had been seen in Bangladesh after 2002--the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control & Research (IEDCR) found only serotype-1 and serotype-2 in patients' serum samples between 2013 and 2016. In a report in The Daily Star last month, Dr HM Nazmul Ahsan, associate professor at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital, said that the number of serotype-3 cases were higher than the others last year and that would most likely prove the same this year. In a subsequent report, Kinkar Ghosh, an epidemiologist at Dhaka Shishu Hospital, also stated to The Daily Star that the pattern of dengue was different this year. Patients presented with new as well as faster-acting symptoms indicating that the serotype of the virus had changed but why, he stated, is as of yet uncertain. When a person is infected with one serotype, his/her immune system confers him life-long protection from re-infection from the same serotype. But he/she still remains vulnerable to infection from the other serotypes after a transient protective state lasting for a few months. That is when the complications ensue. Secondary infection with a different serotype is the most significant risk factor leading to dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome--severe forms of dengue, where mortality rates can be as high as 20 percent. However, it is to be noted that Bangladesh's dengue mortality rate is still significantly lower than that of other endemic zones of dengue such as Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Hence, the re-emergence of serotype-3 in Bangladesh where serotype-1 and serotype-2 were prevalent for over a decade increases the chances of cross-infections and consequently, the severity of dengue. Which is why it is important to immediately screen anyone with a fever during this time, for dengue. \"Plasma leakage [the fluid portion of our blood, plasma, leaking from the blood vessels] or impaired ability of our body to regulate bleeding may proceed to multi-organ failure. When three or more organs fail, there is an 80 percent risk that it will culminate in death. That's what concerns us,\" states Dr Md. Robed Amin, associate professor of medicine at DMCH and an editor of national guideline at the seminar. Droves of patients have been getting admitted to hospitals and medical care is stretched thin. \"The workload is overwhelming as we constantly juggle between evaluating new patients and monitoring the admitted ones. But we're always here for them,\" says a duty doctor at DMCH, busy examining dengue patients. \"Early diagnosis and appropriate quality care can bring down the mortality rate to below one percent,\" states Dr Sanya Tahmina, line director of communicable disease control at the DGHS. \"Our case fatality rate (CFR), calculated by dividing total deaths by total identified cases, is quite below one percent. The numbers (as of July 25) show eight deaths out of 9,256 cases, yielding a CFR of only 0.09 percent. Even if you consider the death rate to be 28 as per some unsupported sources, CFR is still 0.3 percent--still below one percent.\" \"We have an efficacious national guideline on the management of dengue. We regularly train our physicians to enhance their skills. This year, from January to June, we've trained around 2,000 clinicians both in government and public sectors including the consultants of Intensive Care Units about the clinical management of dengue,\" states Dr Tahmina. Considering diagnostic efficacy and quality care as the metrics, we are performing quite well. Our doctors are putting in their best efforts to rein in the epidemic, but is the government doing the same?   Kazi Md. Shaimul Reza is a medical student at Dhaka Medical College."

      "text": "INDIANS TO SEND CONVOY TO SRI LANKA\n1987-06-02T05:00:00.000Z\nIndia announced today that it would send a convoy of unarmed ships to northern Sri Lanka on Wednesday to provide ''humanitarian assistance'' to ethnic Tamils besieged by a weeklong offensive by Government forces.\nThe unexpected announcement marked the first overt attempt by India to undercut Sri Lankan sovereignty and intervene directly in Colombo's four-year-old battle against Tamil guerrillas seeking an independent nation in the north and east.\nNot since 1971, when India invaded what was then East Pakistan and helped it become the nation of Bangladesh, has New Delhi intervened directly in a neighboring country's domestic affairs.\nIt was unclear if Sri Lanka would try to stop the Indian flotilla, an action that might risk a confrontation in the Palk Strait, where there have been minor clashes involving fishing boats and coast guard ships of both countries in the past. The strait separates the island nation and India. Officials met here late tonight to discuss the handling of the situation. Certain to Cause Concern\nIndian officials emphasized that the current move was stricly nonmilitary and that it continued to support the territorial unity of Sri Lanka. But the action was certain to cause concern in Pakistan and other countries distrustful of Indian motives.\nIndian officials said Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had decided to act because of anger that the President of Sri Lanka, J. R. Jayewardene, had ignored his appeals to stop the military offensive and allow India to resume its mediation of the war.\nIn a statement, India cited Sri Lanka's claim that its ''all-out military assault'' was ''a fight to the finish'' and that it had subjected civilians to ''sustained strafing and bombing'' and tried ''to keep this tragic story from the world.'' The statement said India was inviting reporters to accompany its mission so they could verify reports of ''large-scale civilian deaths.''\nAn Indian official said tonight that a convoy of 20 ships would go to the northern Jaffna Peninsula on Wednesday, a distance of about 30 miles, and that the Indian Red Cross would distribute food and medicine. It said that the convoy would be unarmed and accompanied by no armed vessels, and that the mission would not be postponed or negotiated with Colombo.\nThe Government here reacted with surprise and caution, saying the move was unnecessary and uncalled for. But officials said that if New Delhi wanted to send assistance, it should do so only after consulting with Sri Lanka. Parliament to Meet\nMeanwhile, an emergency meeting of Parliament was called here for Tuesday, where it was considered certain that India's move would be widely condemned as a violation of Sri Lankan sovereignty.\nNew Delhi's announcement, conveyed to Sri Lanka at noon today, came as Colombo asserted that its 3,500 troops had finished the task of controlling a small, 20-square-mile section of the peninsula used as a supply center and staging area by the insurgents.\nThe Government also said that all shelling and aerial bombardments by Sri Lankan forces had stopped and that a curfew imposed in the peninsula would be eased starting today.\nThere were also reports that a fuel embargo imposed since January throughout the peninsula would be eased.\nIndian officials said this appeared to be a response to New Delhi's action. They pointed out that Sri Lankan officials have suggested that the current offensive was actually a prelude to a broader effort to eliminate guerrillas, believed to number from 1,200 to 2,000, from the whole peninsula. Divergent Claims in Fighting\nNew Delhi says d that hundreds and perhaps thousands of civilians have died in the last week, essentially supporting the claims of Tamil spokesmen in the area and in southern India, which the Tamil groups use as a political base and sanctuary.\nBut Sri Lanka asserted today that fewer than 50 civilians had died, and that most of the roughly 200 dead were soldiers and guerrillas.\nIt has been impossible to verify the divergent claims, but some Western diplomats said here this week that they believed the Tamil and Indian claims were exaggerated."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-18 00:00:00      \nHe knew the value of a peaceful environment Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released from his internment in Pakistan in the first week of January 1972 and eventually returned to Dhaka, the capital of independent Bangladesh, amidst a rapturous welcome on January 10, 1972. On the way he stopped over in London and New Delhi. It was his commitment and his vision that enabled him to safely guide our ship through troubled waters amidst a devastated post-war scenario. It was his significant contribution that facilitated our growth towards democracy and institution building. Bangabandhu's magnanimity and belief in the people of Bangladesh was reflected in his optimism. It was also this spirit that would inspire him to face up to the many difficulties that he would have to overcome in the coming months -- arranging relief and rehabilitation for the more than 10 million Bangladeshis who had sought refuge in India during the war in 1971, restoring economic activity, infrastructural connectivity, agricultural process, educational institutional facilities and health care. It was a daunting task but handled efficiently by Bangabandhu and his team in cooperation with the United Nations. A statesman and gifted orator, Bangabandhu in his speech on January 10, 1972 at Suhrawardy Uddyan was masterly in his advice for the victorious people of Bangladesh. At this first opportunity, he warned that none should \"raise\" their \"hands to strike against non-Bangalis.\" At the same time, he displayed his concern for the safety of the \"four hundred thousand Bangalis stranded in Pakistan.\"  There was a nuanced connotation in his approach to the problem. This eventually assisted in the safe repatriation to Bangladesh of the unfortunate Bangalis who were stranded in different internment camps in Pakistan. While re-affirming that he harboured no \"ill-will\" for the Pakistanis, he also pointed out that \"those who have unjustly killed our people and assisted in this crime will surely be tried.\" Later, on April 17, 1973, after the completion of investigations into the crimes committed by the Pakistan occupation forces and their auxiliaries, it was decided to try 195 persons for serious crimes, which included genocide, war crimes, breach of Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, murder, rape, and arson.  It was also decided that the trials of such persons and others associated in planning and executing such crimes would be held in accordance with universally recognized judicial norms. This argument and the related judicial process were to be central till his murder in August 1975. Unfortunately, his death also resulted in the setting aside of the entire judicial process. Fortunately, under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the trial process has been activated and is being completed. Subsequently, Bangabandhu did not hesitate to exhibit his and Bangladesh's closeness and support for Islam, Arab countries, and the OIC during the 1973 war between Egypt and Israel. His personal initiative resulted in the dispatch of a Bangladeshi Army Medical team and cartons of Bangladeshi tea for Egypt and Syria.  This was greatly appreciated by members of the OIC and resulted in Bangladesh being invited to be a member of the OIC during its Summit meeting in Lahore in February, 1974. Bangabandhu believed in the sovereign equality of all nations and laid particular stress on the promotion of close cooperation with India in the fields of development and trade \"on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.\" He also believed in development and utilization of resources \"for the benefit of the people of the region.\"  It was this approach that led him eventually to persuade India to agree to the establishment of a Joint Rivers Commission comprising of experts from both countries \"to carry out a comprehensive survey of the rivers systems shared by the two countries and to formulate projects concerning both the countries in the fields of flood control and then to implement them.\" Consistent with this principle of brotherly relations, Bangabandhu signed the historic \"Land Boundary Agreement (LBA)\" with the then Indian Premier Indira Gandhi on May 16 in 1974 to settle the land boundary dispute between the neighbours. Bangladesh quickly ratified the agreement that year but India failed to do so. Indian Parliament however took 41 years to subsequently unanimously pass the LBA on May 7, 2015 -- thanks to the persuasion of Sheikh Hasina. Bangabandhu's persistent interest in foreign policy eventually led to Bangladesh being recognized as an independent state by nearly 120 countries within three and half years. In addition, Bangladesh also secured the membership of the UN, the Commonwealth, OIC, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and some other international bodies. Like Bangabandhu, who was conferred with the \"Joliot Curie Award\" in 1973, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has also received recognition through numerous awards bestowed on her by international agencies for her government's socio-economic achievements that has helped to reduce poverty, create higher functional literacy, better health care, induce gender empowerment and facilitate accountability -- so important for good governance. We are now also on the way towards meeting the requirements pertaining to SDG goals. Through these achievements, during this important year of 2020, when we are observing the special centennial anniversary of the birth of Bangabandhu, Sheikh Hasina has proven that Bangabandhu was correct when he stated: \"Only a peaceful environment can enable us to enjoy the fruits of the hard-earned national independence and gather all our strength and resources to fight poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, and unemployment.\" Muhammad Zamir is a former ambassador and an analyst specialized in foreign affairs, right to information and good governance.

      "text": "THIRD-WORLD CONCERN: DEATHS DURING CHILDBIRTH\n1987-02-14T05:00:00.000Z\nInternational health experts here began a campaign today to conquer a third-world health problem that has been largely overcome in the West: the death of women in childbirth.\n''The third world is where we were in Europe and the United States at the turn of the century,'' said Dr. Halfdan Mahler, Director General of the World Health Organization, one of several sponsors of a ''Safe Motherhood'' conference held here this week to focus attention on what participants called ''a hidden tragedy.''\nAt the opening session, on Tuesday, Barber B. Conable Jr., president of the World Bank, challenged participants to ''reduce by half the number of women who die in pregnancy or childbirth by the year 2000.''\nTo further this goal, Mr. Conable pledged $1 million in World Bank funds for a ''Safe Motherhood Fund'' to be managed by the World Health Organization. Mr. Conable also promised to double World Bank lending for population, health and nutrition programs to $500 million by 1990. New Research Cited\n''Common decency tells us that it is intolerable that 1,400 women die every day in the process of carrying or delivering their children,'' said Mr. Conable, a former Republican Representative from upstate New York.\nThe Nairobi meeting was partly an outgrowth of a conference held here two years ago to mark the end of the United Nations Decade for Women. This week's conference drew on new research and personal experiences to bring the problem of maternal mortality into focus.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, one quarter of all deaths of women of childbearing age in developing countries occur during pregnancy or childbirth.\nLast year, of 500,000 women who died worldwide in pregnancy or childbirth, 99 percent lived in underdeveloped nations. An American has one chance in 6,366 of dying while pregnant; an East African one chance in 15. Child Dies if Mother Dies\nThe death of a mother often means death or hardship for surviving children. In Bangladesh, a study found that when a mother dies in childbirth her infant has a 95 percent chance of dying within a year.\n''I remember a group of 20 women in rural Kenya telling me that three women from their community had died in childbirth,'' said Barbara Herz, an adviser to the World Bank. ''I asked them what happened to the children. They said, 'The older ones went to the city to beg, and the younger ones died.' ''\nIn Latin America and in urban Africa, about half of maternal deaths are a result of complications arising from illicit abortions, experts said. Mortality could be cut by a third if women who did not want more children had access to contraceptives, one study said.\nOne participant in the conference, Barbara E. Kwast, recalled interviewing an Ethiopian tailor whose 35-year-old wife had died because of an attempt to abort her 10th pregnancy. ''He did not know anything about family planning services,'' said Ms. Kwast, a professor of public health who worked in Addis Ababa from 1981 to 1985.\nIn developing countries, about half of all women go through labor and childbirth without anesthesia or trained attendants. In addition, two-thirds of pregnant women in developing countries are believed to be anemic.\nSeveral conference participants, citing recent medical history, were optimistic that maternal mortality rates could be reduced in underdeveloped countries.\nIn 1935, it was pointed out, England and Wales had a maternal mortality rate of 400 for each 100,000 live births - not much below India's current rate of about 500. Today, Britain's rate is about 10 deaths for each 100,000 births.\nThe difference, experts here said, is not economic development but the widespread extension of modern health services: family planning, antibiotics, Caesarian sections, blood transfusions, and hygenic medical practices. Family Planning Favored\nA key step, participants said, is access to family planning. Through the 1970's, many Africans criticized family planning programs as racially inspired limits on their growth. But at this week's conference, which was attended by health professionals from 13 African countries, the mood was heavily in favor of family planning.\n''I believe an effective population-management program will considerably improve the quality of life for women and thereby insure safe motherhood,'' President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya said in the keynote speech.\nParticipants also discussed other low-cost methods for reducing maternal deaths.\nOne method that has worked successfully in several countries is building maternity waiting homes adjacent to health centers. One week before her due date a woman moves with her children to one of the homes. This eliminates the need to transport her from a remote site to a health center when an emergency develops unexpectedly. Caesarians by Midwives\nAnother proposal that drew much comment was a move by Dr. Sambe Duale of Zaire to teach nurse-midwives how to perform Caesarians if a doctor is not available. In his rural area, he said, midwives perform 80 percent of the 200 to 300 Caesarians a year.\nOther solutions included improving rural health centers, extending ambulance service to remote areas and training community health workers to identify pregnant women at high risk.\nDown a dirt road in the Nairobi slum of Kawangware, a community of 59,000, the effect of a modestly financed maternal health program could be seen. Built about 10 years ago, the Kabiro Health Care Outpost sends 37 health-care workers into local shacks to explain maternal and child care.\n''I haven't seen a mother die of childbirth in five years,'' Sister Eroni Nakagwa, a nurse-midwife, said today."

      "text": "Long Island Q&A;: Robin Chandler Duke;\nSoldier in an Unpopular War: Population Control\n1989-02-05T05:00:00.000Z\nLEAD: FROM her Upper East Side apartment, Robin Chandler Duke may seem an unlikely soldier in what many consider a nasty battle: World population control and abortion rights.\nFROM her Upper East Side apartment, Robin Chandler Duke may seem an unlikely soldier in what many consider a nasty battle: World population control and abortion rights.\nBut for more than 40 years, Mrs. Duke, the wife of Angier Biddle Duke, former Ambassador to Morocco, Spain and Denmark and now president of Southampton College, has been fighting to make birth control an integral part of basic health care.\n''This is an issue that's not very popular,'' Mrs. Duke said in an interview in her Manhattan apartment (she and her husband also have a house in Southampton).\n''This isn't like fighting for the museum in your town or some great cultural endeavor that everybody wants to identify with. This is an issue that nobody much likes.''\nSince 1972, Mrs. Duke has been a national co-chairman of the Population Crisis Committee/Draper Fund, which finances the International Planned Parenthood Federation.\nMrs. Duke is also active in education, serving as vice chairman of the Institute of International Education, which processes student exchange programs in the United States, and is on the board of numerous organizations, including the Guggenheim Museum, International Flavors and Fragrances, the East River Savings Bank and the Rockwell International Corporation.\nOriginally a feature writer for The New York Journal-American, writing about what was then considered women's issues - fashion and society - Mrs. Duke, as a divorced mother of two, became one of the few female stockbrokers on Wall Street during the 50's, working for the firm of Orvic Brothers. Her subsequent years with Pepsi-Cola took her to Africa and the Soviet Union, where she met Angier Biddle Duke in 1959. \nQ. How did you become involved in family planning issues? \nA. I first became involved when I was a very young woman with two young children and lived in New York. I realized there were no girls' clubs, no facility for young girls to go off the streets of New York.\nI worked with another group of women to finance the first Girls Club, and became very interested in young girls and the aspects of their life in an urban area where they, even in those days, were from a one-parent family.\nI suddenly realized how these girls grow up in an environment where they are uneducated about fertility - ignorance is the bottom line. In those days, Margaret Sanger was alive and she was imprisoned on Rikers Island because she demonstrated, marched and was pushing family planning. Just think of it.\nIn my lifetime - I never thought of myself as being an antique, but I am 65 - this great lady, for the very fact that she prescribed artificial birth-control methods, was put in jail. It's amazing. \nQ. Do you think that things have changed much since the 40's in terms of the lack of education of poor women in matters of family planning? \nA. I'm ashamed to say that in the last eight years we've been set back quite critically. \nQ. You mean the Reagan Administration? \nA. Absolutely, and I hang a big black cloak around that Administration because of their fight against abortion rights. They supported this militant group who went out and demonstrated against Planned Parenthood and had people lying down in Planned Parenthood clinics where abortion services were offered. This kind of thing has set us back many decades.\nThey were against strong population policies within our Agency for International Development. That's where we provide foreign assistance money to inform, counsel and enlighten people about how to plan families. And these are in countries where they're overpopulated.\nThis whole movement was supported and abetted by the last eight years of a very, very poorly advised Administration as to what you should be doing in terms of foreign assistance and what you should be doing domestically for poor people. \nQ. Do you think things will improve under George Bush? \nA. Yes, I have high hopes. Mr. Bush is a man who has served in China as our representative and as a Congressman. During the days when he was in Congress, he was pro-choice on abortion. I don't know what turned him around. Maybe he felt he had to get that body of a minority to support him to get him elected, but he certainly wasn't anti-choice in the old days. \nQ. What areas of the globe face the greatest threat of overpopulation and, therefore, poverty? \nA. Africa is one of the more devastating continents in terms of hunger, environmental impact and overpopulation. Our very dear neighbors in Latin America have some of the highest incidence of illegal abortion in the world. That's because they can't get the access to family planning.\nThis is an ongoing battle with the church. If they can't get access to family planning, they resort to horrendous abortion techniques that very often render them ill and maimed and, very often, kill these women. \nQ. According to predictions, world population growth is going to be one of the big issues of the 90's. What are the implications for Americans? \nA. What we have to know in this sort of one-world concept is that, if the third world falls apart, it will have a direct impact on developed nations. The marketplace for all these great American corporations is ultimately that third world.\nIf that third-world element isn't going to develop, we have to bail them out. The third-world debt is monumental and this is a debt built out of enormous infusions of money, which they have had to borrow to keep going. Where, in fact, if they had basic education and health care, they would have the nucleus of the energy to get their economy rolling.\nYou have to have some other economic structures, and you have to get a hold on the numbers of people. If you don't, you are facing starvation, and the only people who are going to prop you up are the Western developed nations. \nQ. You mentioned that population is an environmental issue. How is that? \nA. Look at the great turtles of Indonesia. They're not coming back in such numbers along the shoreline to lay their eggs. Why?\nThe population of Indonesia has chopped down so much of the forest land in order to develop a little patch to grow their crops that they have practically killed off all the turtles and tigers that used to come there.\nThis is all a matter of too many people on a land base that can't support them. You could say the same thing for northern India and Bangladesh. They have chopped their forest lands down, and have created erosion and flooding, and then you don't have any agriculture because you've washed away your topsoil. \nQ. Even though much of your work has been focused on third world countries, how does America fare in terms of population control. Are we up to par? \nA. Our problem is not population control, it is education. Our problem is seeing that every child born has the fundamental rights, which are decent health care, to be nurtured and loved and to get an education.\nIn the United States, they have withheld important aspects of education because they won't Federally fund a system for sex education, which I think is vital. We keep hearing about the breakdown of the family in the United States, and there's no question that it's probably true.\nI think the schools have the responsibility, with Federal funding, to counsel young people about their sexuality in a constructive way. If they watch television and see salacious sex, then there must be something wrong with a society that isn't willing to deal with sex in an intelligent, normal way.\nContraception should be like toothpaste: it's basic to your health care. You brush your teeth and you use contraception. It ought to be in the medicine chest, and there shouldn't be any hiding under the rug and all this phony kind of nervousness about discussing sex. Sexuality is fundamental and it should be taught, starting with very young children. \nQ. Do you think it is the Federal Government's responsibility to step in and play a major role in family planning, or are birth-control and health issues up to the nonprofit, private sector? \nI think the private sector has a major role to play, and I think the Federal Government has a major role to play. We have a Surgeon General and we have a Department of Health and Human Services, and I think part of what you do for your people, when they cannot do it for themselves, is to have outreach from the Federal Government. \nQ. Do you believe in Federal funding for abortion? \nA. I certainly do. We have women who come in and can't afford anything, and it is my job as a private citizen to try to raise money so that those women will get those abortions if they can't afford it. \nQ. What do you think the future of legalized abortion is in this country? \nA. I think it's at a very high risk and we should be very worried about it. If it goes back to the states, it's going to be difficult to obtain an abortion. You're going to have some states that won't provide services at all.\nI've talked to a number of members of Congress who have told me, ''Well, you know I've been on your side, but basically it's too risky,'' and they don't want to get on this issue. And until people are courageous enough to be like Bob Packwood and others who have been our friends and supporters in the Senate, we lose out. \nQ. Are you planning to join the fight to keep abortion legal? \nA. We are mounting a very big campaign in the National Abortion Rights Action League about the ultimate effects of making abortion illegal, how it will impact on the poor and on the rights of women. These are fundamental rights we're talking about. I have people who are so angry with me about this, and they don't want to talk about it, and ''There goes Robin again - babble, babble, babble. I know what she's talking about. It's just distasteful, my dear.''\nIt's not distasteful. This whole subject matter should be part of health care. It is fundamental. Toothpaste in the medicine chest sitting right next to contraception."

Kuwait, which went into virtual lockdown on Thursday, has taken some of the most drastic steps in the region to curb the virus' spread. The Gulf Arab country, which has reported 176 cases of the virus, said violators of the curfew could face up to three years in jail or fines of up to $32,157. The Kuwait National Guard will aid police in imposing the curfew. The decision was made due to \"some manifestations of non-compliance with precautionary measures,\" Deputy Prime Minister Anas al-Saleh said, according to KUNA. Kuwait's cabinet also decided to extend a suspension of government and private agencies for two weeks. It had already announced on Thursday an extension to a suspension of schools and universities until Aug. 4 - the first among its neighbours to impose such lengthy education closures to limit the spread of the sometimes deadly disease. After a late-night cabinet meeting on Saturday, the minister of trade and industry said the country's strategic food reserves were \"secure and plentiful\", KUNA said. He urged people not to stockpile food and said there was no need to panic. Last week, the cabinet approved a bill to increase the budget of ministries and governmental departments by 500 million dinars for the 2020/21 fiscal year due to the coronavirus outbreak. It also established a temporary fund for receiving financial contributions from institutions, companies, and individuals to support the government's efforts to fight the virus. The country's stock market has been battered by the virus outbreak as well as a historic plunge in oil prices. Its main index has lost nearly 30% of its value since the start of the year."

Even the seamen caught up in the battle have trouble finding it out beyond the serene horizon. 1\nThe U.N. Security Council agreed to send Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar to Iran and Iraq as soon as possible to try to persuade the two countries to carry out a peace plan approved by the council in July. 1\nA missile struck off Kuwait's coast, the Kuwait Defense Ministry said, as Iraqi jets struck new Iranian oil targets. The long-range missile, whose source was not known, struck at 4 A.M. off the southern coast. 5\nTaiwan may ease restrictions on contact with mainland China. The country seems close to allowing some of its citizens to visit their ancestral villages on the mainland. 3\nAn effort to monitor nuclear tests is being readied by American scientists in the Soviet Union. From the start of the three year project, their work has been frustrated by the militaries of both the United States and the Soviet Union. 3\nAfghanistan wants a special session for negotiations in Geneva on Monday at which it is expected to offer a new proposal for a shorter timetable for the withdrawal of the 120,000 Soviet troops in that country. 2\nSouth Korean riot policemen raided two industrial complexes, arresting nearly 300 striking workers in the biggest roundup since the current wave of labor troubles began two months ago. 3\nIn Manila, the U.S. is being accused by some newspapers of playing a role in last week's coup attempt.

The Fed was apparently concerned that a three-week decline in the dollar was pushing up inflation. 1\nForest fires in eight Western states have left nearly half a million acres of forests and brush ablaze. For the 20,000 firefighters gathered to fight the blazes, the Labor Day weekend will mean nothing but work. 6\nWhen the Pope travels to the U.S. next week, he will condemn a growing tendency by American Catholics to ''pick and choose'' among church teachings, accepting some and ignoring others, a senior Vatican official said. 8\nA laboratory worker was infected with the AIDS virus as a result of working with it, Federal officials announced. It was the first such case known. Officials stressed that the worker was growing the virus in very large amounts. 6\nEmployment continued to grow during August but not vigorously enough to reduce the nation's jobless rate, the Labor Department reported. Economists said the figures point toward faster economic growth. 29\nSanta Barbara has some problems. The most visible, residents say, is how to deal with the city's homeless people. The city is now engaged in a new conflict in which the homeless are seeking to set up campsites. 7\nSince Sam Nunn's announcement of noncandidacy, the Democratic hopefuls have begun to scramble for support in the South. ''I'm getting worked on just about every way I can get worked on,'' a Georgia politician said. 7\nGary Dotson's parole was revoked. The ruling on Mr. Dotson, whose prison sentence was commuted after the woman he had been convicted of raping said she had fabricated her testimony, follows his arrest on unrelated charges. 46\nThe risk of a heart attack may be as closely linked to blood levels of a clot-forming protein as it is to smoking, high blood pressure and obesity, researchers say.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-01 00:00:00      \nIt is difficult for farmers to develop a good marketing plan without proper market information, as is the case for managers of any industry. Fortunately, in today's day and age, digital technology can help the agriculture industry in many ways. From daily prices of agricultural products to costs of fertilisers, seeds and renting tractors, digital technology can help disseminate the market information that the farmers need. This timely information for agricultural commodities can assist farmers to not only plan production and harvesting dates, but also decide when and where to sell their products. While farmers can get to know current prices of their local markets through middlemen or by directly visiting the market places, at times, they do not receive the correct market information and get exploited. Proper market information gives farmers more bargaining power against middlemen. They can sell their products to different wholesalers or directly to the vegetable sellers in the market place if they know the availing prices.   The Department of Agricultural Marketing (DAM), a section of the Ministry of Agriculture, Bangladesh, updates the daily retailer and wholesaler prices for key agricultural commodities such as rice, fish, flour, betel leaves and vegetables, in addition to prices of seeds and fertilisers and many markets of several sub districts of Bangladesh.   Teaming up with the DAM, a group of undergraduate students, led by Mohammad Hassan, an adjunct lecturer of the Department of Economics & Banking at International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC), has taken steps to raise awareness about market data and enhance data literacy among the farmers, so that they can collect and interpret data to make informed decisions. Under the title, 'Sharing Market Data with Farmers', the project is currently covering the Sitakunda upazila in the Chattogram district. Predominantly funded by the initiators, the project was launched in November 2018. The activities of the project include teaching farmers how to see daily price data of specific products for a specific location, generate bar charts for monthly, weekly and yearly prices, and read and interpret the data charts. The project is designed to make things simpler for farmers so that they can easily use the DAM website and mobile app.  Farmers in Sitakunda have responded to the project positively. Mohammad Sayedul, who owns two poultry farms, uses the website to check the daily price of eggs. \"As an arable farmer, my father grows tomatoes and cabbages. He does not use a smartphone. Ever since I have come across this project, I let him know of the market prices with its help,\" says Rabiul Islam. \"I think it is also useful for buying vegetables from the market.\" The students who are a part of the project also shared their experiences. \"We are currently taking a course in Agricultural Economics with Mohammad Hassan,\" says Kawsar Ahmed. \"It is exciting to engage in real-world applications of agricultural practices. We work on the project during our time off from classes. We are also thankful to the IIUC family for encouraging us.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-14 00:00:00      \nUSDA says, US-China 'trade war' also comes into play as supply of low-price yarn, fabrics gluts Bangladesh  Backward linkage factories - spinning, weaving, and knitting - in Bangladesh are running their businesses at a loss because of yarn dumping from India, and fabrics from China and Pakistan.  Although apparel industries seem to benefit more from dumping, it makes them more dependent and vulnerable as a supplier of low-priced garments for export, states a just published report by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).    It says, \"Due to the U.S. - China 'trade war,' yarn and fabric from China are exported to Bangladesh at a lower price. Textile industries are facing hard challenges and incurring business losses, as they can't compete with imported yarn and fabric at very low prices.\"  It also states that China is providing direct cash returns to exporters of about 15 to 20% on their export of fabric to Bangladesh.   In March 2019, the price of cotton yarn reduced due to lower cotton prices in the international market, along with ample supply of yarn and fabric from China, India, and Pakistan.  USDA says, the local textile millers are facing uneven competition due to abundant imports of cheap yarn and fabrics. Some of them are about to leave the market and are facing a challenge dealing with a huge stockpile of unsold fabric, it adds.  The phenomena is attributed to low-priced yarn and fabric imports increased through bonded warehouse import \"leakage,\" improper utilization declaration (UD) certification facilities of readymade garment (RMG) manufacturers, false declaration of product specification, and smuggling through the border with India.  Local RMG manufacturers are importing yarn and fabric from China, India, and Pakistan using a bonded warehouse (zero tariffs on import of raw materials for export value-added product) privilege.  \"The imported yarn and fabric with zero tariffs are then illegally sold to the local market which forces down prices in the domestic market and makes local weaving mills and spinners more competitive,\" states USDA report. Bangladesh has import duties of 32.4 percent for man-made fiber, 91.37 percent for fabric, 38.47 percent for yarn, and 32.4 percent for textile chemical dyes.  Export-oriented RMG factories can import yarn and fabric under a duty draw back incentive, which reimburses all customs duties paid on imported yarn, and fabric (but not taxes such as the VAT and Advanced Income tax).  Imports of all textile raw materials, including fabrics, have no quotas.   As a result of yarn oversupply in the domestic market, prices fell nearly 15-20 percent, while some textile millers and spinners suffered as a result, the report says also noting that \"Some millers planned to cut overseas purchases of cotton for yarn and fabric production as they were struggling in the market due to the flood of imported yarn and fabric from China and India.\"  Textile millers have urged the government to take necessary action in order to protect the textile industry.  Of 2.1 million metric tons of Bangladesh's yearly yarn demand, 70 percent is met by local millers, while the rest is imported mainly from India, China, Vietnam and Pakistan.  More foreign buyers of value-added apparel are purchasing from Bangladesh due to cheap labor cost, competitive prices, and an appreciated US dollar versus the Bangladesh Taka.  Reportedly, some high-end millers have increased production capacity to satisfy higher domestic and international demand says USDA report.  Bangladesh currently has 430 spinning mills, 802 weaving mills, 244 dyeing and finishing mills, 32 denim fabric mills, 22 home textile mills, and a total of 6,502 registered and 527 un-registered garment factories.  Sixty-five percent of these factories are located in Dhaka district.  Approximately 4,296 Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) members employ four million workers, of which 80 percent are women.  In first eight months of the current fiscal, ready-made garment (RMG) exports fetched Bangladesh approximately US$23 billion, up nearly 15 percent from last year.  In previous financial year (2017-18), the country earned US$ 31.6 billion from RMG exports, an increase of 8.77 percent compared to 2016-17 FY, and contributed 83 percent of total export earnings.  Ministry of Textile and Jute has projected that the RMG sector earnings would grow to US$35.62 billion and US$38.73 billion in 2019-20 FY and 2020-21 FY respectively.   The export growth was partially contributed to by improved workers' wages, compliance maintenance investment, workers' skill development, diversified value addition, increased domestic and foreign direct investment, and more international brands involved in the trade.  USDA also predicts, Bangladesh's cotton import to rise from 8 million bales (projected for 2018-19) to  8.5 million bales in 2019-20, on expectations of increased export market demand for value-added apparel products, increased capacities of existing mills, stable international prices of cotton, and favorable weather for world production.  Bangladesh imported cotton from 41 countries around the world in 2017-18. Among them, India (25%) and the U.S. (10%) take the largest share of volume, followed by Australia (9%), Mali (9%), Burkina Faso (8%), Benin (8%), Brazil (7%), Uzbekistan (6%), and others.  Nearly 80 percent of garments made in Bangladesh are sourced from cotton; the rest are made from viscose, polyester and other materials.  Local spinners supply 90 percent of raw materials for knitwear and 40 percent for the woven garments sector. "

Akshay Thakur, Vinay Sharma, Mukesh Singh and Pawan Gupta were scheduled to be hanged at Tihar Jail in Delhi on Tuesday at 6am. The court deferred the matter after one of the convicts, Pawan Gupta, filed a mercy petition before India's President Ram Nath Kovind earlier in the day. His lawyer had requested the court to stop the execution citing the petition. Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana rapped his lawyer for filing the curative and mercy pleas so late. \"You are playing with fire, you should be cautious,\" said the judge, adding, \"One wrong move by anybody and you know the consequences.\" Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court rejected Gupta's curative petition. He had sought commutation of his death penalty to life imprisonment. The four convicts were given the death penalty - first by a trial court in September 2013, which was upheld by the Delhi High Court six months later and the Supreme Court in May 2017.  The death warrants were first issued for January 22, and then postponed to February 1 because of the mercy pleas filed by two of the convicts.  Gupta was the only one among the four convicts who had not availed of the legal remedies. His counsel had told a sessions court in Delhi earlier this that he could not avail any legal remedy as his earlier lawyer did not meet him during the seven-day period granted by the Delhi High Court. The four men, along with two others, raped and brutally assaulted a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in a moving bus in Delhi on the night of December 16, 2012.  The woman succumbed to her injuries two weeks later at a hospital in Singapore. The gangrape triggered huge protests in the Indian capital and across the country.  One convict died in prison, while a minor convict was sent to a detention home for juveniles and was released in December 2015."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-04 00:00:00      \nThe government has already taken a number of measures to save Robi Cropconsidering the lockdown and because the haor region--especially Sunamganj, Sylhet and some northern districts such Gaibandha, Jamalpur--may suffer flashflood. These measures include regular weather forecast, early warning, arranging harvest machines and so on. These are some of the most important and timely decisions by the government as first steps to ensure food availability.   The government has also issued cyclone early warning for coastal areas and is taking actions to save crops. The Agricultural Loan Department of Bangladesh Bank also declared Tk 5,000 crore for agricultural loan, especially for the horticulture, fruit, fisheries, poultry, dairy and other businesses. This is also a great initiative considering that these small businesses have already been affected due to the pandemic. The concerns related to food security, however, remains unaddressed by and large due to a number of factors. Everyday food items such as rice, vegetables and other necessary perishables are produced by the smallholder and women farmers in Bangladesh. And these farmers are already suffering. For example, Taslima Begum of Chorgacha, Ghoraghat is a small poultry farmer. Due to the COVID-19 crisis she cannot sell her chickens at the market, so she is forced to sell the poultry items at a loss of Tk 50 per kg to her neighbours in fewer quantity. Afroza Begum of Fulchari, Gaibandha is a vegetable producer. Because of the lack of market access, she is selling pumpkins at Tk 5 per kg whereas the regular price is Tk 25-30 per kg. It is watermelon season in Bangladesh and farmers normally sell their products at Tk 30-40 per kg. The farmers in Patuakhali are currently selling watermelons at Tk 8-10 per piece whereas their cost of production is over Tk 20 per watermelon. How are these farmers going to recover the loss they are already suffering? We need to take note that these farmers' livelihoods are depended on their produce and any loss means they will not be able to go into production next season without external assistance. Coming back to paddy, with the hope that flash flood or other natural hazards will not cause any disastrous situation in any parts of Bangladesh and farmers are able to get their desired harvest, question remains whether the farmers will be able to sell their crop at a fair price. In 2018 hundreds and thousands of farmers protested across the country demanding fair price. The response from the government was helpful, but it was late and inadequate in solving the matter. At present, even if the government manages to buy the paddy and other ROBI crops, how are those going to be processed and stored? This will mean that the rice mills will have to be re-opened during the crisis, risking the spread of the virus. Furthermore, given that inter-city transportation systems carrying food products are yet to be re-established, unless major changes are made and government facilitates are opened for the distribution and redistribution of food products, a food crisis may be inevitable in the long run. The solution lies in following the right strategy considering different timescales. For immediate action, it is important to set up an oversight committee headed by the Ministry of Agriculture with appropriate representatives from key relevant ministries and civil society organisations. In each district and Upazila, a committee should also be established where local transportation authority is represented. Government has already taken the initiative to open school fields for local market to operate. This timely initiative needs to be maintained besides creating interconnectedness between the village market to union market to Upazila market and so on. It is critical to ensure two major things: i) The smallholder and women farmers are getting fair price; and ii) A safeguard mechanism is in place to prevent COVID19 from spreading. At the short to medium term(1-3 months), considering the flood season and its impacts on agriculture, farmers may lose the rainfed Amandue to early flood or excessive rain during seedling period. It is critical to note that unless we ensure fair price for smallholder and women farmers for their Boro crop, they will not be able to invest in Amanproduction. Seed and fertiliser supply will become a challenge. The smallholder and women farmers will require access to interest free loans with the option to repay post Aman harvest. This will be the most critical stage of intervention in terms of ensuring food security for the remaining year. Considering the worst case scenario, the government and other actors must map possible solutions including countrywide planning of distribution and redistribution of the products. We also need to ensure quality seeds where community seedbank initiatives can play a critical role. Addressing overall market mechanism to support the smallholder farmers will be the key challenge in the medium term. Due to the current travel ban, buyers from distant places are failing to reach the market and the producers are deprived from optimum price of crops especially vegetables and seasonal fruits. Lack of infrastructure to preserve vegetables or perishable products has been one of the biggest challenges for small farmers for a long time contributing to their losses every year. Considering the products that are to be harvested between July to September, the government must take measures including flood preparedness, etc. Given that there could be a global food crisis, the government should strengthen its safety net programme ensuring that food is available, accessible and affordable for the poor and marginalised. Special schemes for the smallholder and women farmers is needed to ensure they survive until the next harvest. The government must also ensure the transportation system is functioning well considering that the COVID-19 crisis may continue. Guaranteeing transparency and accountability throughout the process to stop theft and exploitation by the powerful and the middlemen are must. In the long term (6-12 months), it will be important to monitor the global food security situation, market system as well as climate condition. We must not forget that Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to the imapcts of climate change and throughout the year, we may face flood, river erosion, cyclone and hailstorm--and dry period at the end of this year. It is important to note that even if everything goes right and there is no climate induced disaster in 2020, we will still continue to carry the loss that we already suffered due to the current crisis. Therefore, the government must be ready to continue prioritising food producers, the smallholder and women farmers, along with the small and medium agricultural businesses. The policymakers and city dwellers may be buying food from the supermarkets now, but supermarkets do not produce crops and will never do. It is the smallholders and women farmers like Taslima and Afroza who produce the food we eat. If they do not survive, it will be only a matter of time before we face a food crisis in Bangladesh.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-04 00:00:00      \nAt least 29 Rohingyas, who had been in one of the two boats floating on the Indian Ocean, were sheltered at the Bhashan Char after they reached the shore of Teknaf early Saturday. \"The 29 Rohingyas were taken to Bhashan Char under the supervision of the Navy,\" Mahbub Alam Talukder, Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC), told The Daily Star yesterday. Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said the Rohingyas took small boats and swam to the coast of Teknaf. Some of them even fled when locals were rescuing them, he said. A Rohingya broker said an international NGO gave them between Tk 90,000 and Tk 1 lakh for transporting the Rohingyas to Malaysia. As Malaysia denied to receive those Rohingyas the NGO again asked the brokers to get them back to Bangladesh, Momen said. \"The broker did not name the NGO.\" They were then taken to Bhashan Char, an island in Noakhali. Bangladesh Navy has built a housing facility of 120 cluster villages on the 40sqkm island under a Tk 2,312 crore project for accommodating one lakh of the nearly 1 million Rohingyas sheltered at cramped camps in Cox's Bazar. However, the authorities were considering shelving the relocation plan after the UN and other aid agencies opposed the plan, saying there were risks of flood and cyclones and also that it did not have facilities for accommodating the aid agency officials. The foreign minister yesterday said the government did not want to \"pollute\" the Rohingya camps during coronavirus pandemic by sheltering new members there. Therefore, the rescued Rohigyas were taken to Bhashan Char. \"Any new Rohingyas, if there are, will be sheltered at the Bhashan Char,\" he told The Daily Star. Earlier on April 16, some 400 Rohingyas were rescued by Bangladesh authorities. They were, however, quarantined in the Rohingya camp healthcare facilities. Rights bodies then said there were two boats carrying about 500 Rohingyas drifting in the sea as Malaysia and Thailand refused their entry to their territories. The UN and many other global and regional rights bodies then called for Bangladesh to rescue and shelter the Rohingyas. Momen had then requested the UN and rights bodies to ask the other regional countries to rescue and shelter the Rohingyas. Momen also wrote a letter to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet citing the international law that surrounding countries of the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea have a role to share the responsibility of helping the distressed people in the deep sea. He said so far there is information that the two boats were in the Myanmar territory of the Bay of Bengal, and that the UN should tell Myanmar to rescue and shelter the Rohingyas. On Saturday, European Union in a statement asked the regional countries to rescue and shelter the drifting Rohingyas on the Indian Ocean, following the example of Bangladesh that has been sheltering more than a million Rohingyas.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-10 00:00:00      \nThe costs of industrialisation are many. Human beings, wildlife, nature, the environment, and future generations often pay the price. In some instances, those who shoulder the burden do so voluntarily; some are compensated for their sacrifice and, in most cases, the suffering is imposed without their knowledge and consent. Add to that the tons of catastrophic events such as industrial accidents, mine collapses, and transport disasters that are a regular news item in this day and age. Ironically, many of these were foreseen and the deaths and illnesses could have been prevented. Victims of industrial accidents are sometimes paid compensation although these are often small quantities of money and frequently do not reach the victims on time. Fortunately, we now have the capability to identify the culprits and are constantly refining the mechanism to measure the cost of the pain, suffering and physical damage they generate. A review of these disasters has identified three problems: 1) Safety inspectors are lax or go easy on owners; 2) Companies hire inspectors from \"friendly\" agencies; and 3) Companies ignore inspection reports or disregard early warning signs.  To start off this dialogue and to provide a context for the theme of this write-up, I will mention two recent instances of criminal neglect that has caused death and suffering for workers. Amnesty International recently reported that children as young as seven are working in very dangerous conditions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to mine cobalt, a metal used in smartphones, cars and computers sold by Apple, Microsoft and Vodafone. In Hungary, a few years ago, an industrial accident at an alumina plant killed eight people and injured more than 220. Finally, on February 4, two former senior executives were convicted and sentenced to prison in one of the few instances where the wheels of justice turned, however slowly. The latest disaster, which has led to a global outcry for action to prevent human rights abuse, happened in South America. An estimated 300 people were killed after a dam collapsed on January 25, at an iron ore mine owned by Vale SA. Vale is the world's biggest producer of nickel and iron ore, a raw ingredient for steel. A holding dam at the Corrego do Feijao mine, located near the city of Brumadinho in the state of Minas Gerais in south-eastern Brazil, gave way releasing a tide of mud, toxic sludge, and mining debris that swept away an entire village. The sludge buried a company cafeteria brimming with workers during a lunch break, and other Vale buildings, and inundated a part of Brumadinho. This is not the first time that Vale has been cited for its failure to ensure safety standards and abide by \"conflict of interest\" regulations designed to keep the fox away from the chicken coops. In 2015, a similar incident at Bento Rodrigues dam at the Brazilian mining company Vale's Samarco joint venture in Mariana town killed 19 people when the iron ore tailings dam gave way, and flooded two villages, destroying around 200 homes. Experts are blaming the Brumadinho disaster on criminal negligence on the part of the employees of Vale and contractors hired by the mine to inspect its dams. The government arrested five individuals, three of whom are senior members of the mining company and two inspectors from TUV SUD, a German company that Vale SA hired to certify the safety of the Corrego do Feijao dam. Officials indicated that while the criminal case against the owners and management of Vale is only beginning, the arrests are a precautionary move to prevent the individuals from leaving the country. Two of the five arrested are inspectors from TUV SUD, who had certified the dam as structurally sound. Makoto Namba, one of the arrested inspectors, had stated that the dam had a low probability of failure. Critics, however, observe that this is a familiar story in the business. The Vale mining company told the Associated Press that there are eight sirens in the area around its dam that failed. They also held that \"the speed in which the event happened made sounding an alarm impossible.\"  New documents show that TUV SUD also acted as consultants on Vale mine closures in Brazil. The Wall Street Journal ran a story on February 4 under the headline \"Inspectors of Collapsed Brazilian Dam Had Close Ties to Its Owner\", and again raised a critical alarm applicable for all. This incident \"raises fresh questions over whether the dual role of safety evaluator and consultant presents a conflict of interest that can compromise safety,\" the report said. Commenting on this cosy arrangement between Vale and TUV SUD, Dr Gavin Mudd, an environmental engineering professor at Australia's RMIT University, observed that \"the expertise is too connected with those controlling the money--and nowhere near enough emphasis on protecting the public interest.\" A review of guidelines for external audits for mining companies in Canada suggests that external audits should be conducted by entities whose \"independence can be demonstrated by the freedom from the activity being audited or freedom from bias and conflict of interest.\" The UN Human Rights immediately issued a statement asking for the Brazilian government to launch a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation. \"The tragedy demands accountability and calls into question preventive measures taken subsequent to the Samarco mining disaster in Minas Gerais just over three years ago, when a catastrophic flood of mining waste near Mariana killed 19 people and affected the lives of millions, including indigenous communities.\" In all these accidents, there is evidence that corrective measures could have prevented the loss of life, property, and human suffering. For example, a leaked report from 2013, two years before the Mariana dam collapse, had identified structural issues in the dam. Prosecutors allege that the company took no action, and many of the victims are still waiting for justice. There is a renewed question as to whether Vale did enough to improve its safety protocols following the Mariana accident. \"They prioritized profits and left safety in second place,\" said Jose Adercio Sampaio, coordinator of a task force of federal prosecutors, summarising the criminal case against the joint venture and its parent companies Government officials have been called out too this time. Federal officials have pledged to make mining regulations stricter, Catherine Osborn, a print and radio journalist based in Rio de Janeiro reported. \"But for many, this disaster has laid bare the difference between pledges and enforcement.\" Vale was suspended from the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRP) over the dam disaster. CHRP is a global compact aimed at preventing adverse impacts on workers, communities and consumers. Nonetheless, Vale is among the mining companies still receiving investments from several large European banks, despite the recurrent violations of environmental and human rights, as investigated in a Dirty Profits 6 report.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-30 00:00:00      \nOptimism to turn the tide in his favour had preoccupied the mind of Bimal Krishna Biswas as 2018 drew to a close. The 62-year-old farmer dreamt of renovating his house with brick walls in 2019 with the sales of paddy and the income from fish farm he and his neighbours had in partnership in their locality. One year has passed by but his hope of a better home, increased wealth and improved living standard remains a distant dream. \"This is totally a year of losses for me. How could I make profit unless the prices of paddy go up?\" said Biswas, a farmer from Tungipara in the southwestern district of Gopalganj, over phone yesterday. He cultivated paddy and other crops on five acres of land, including two acres he took as a lease. The elderly farmer and his neighbours live in an area where crop fields remained submerged for seven months a year and they get only five months to grow paddy during the dry season. The paddy grown during the Boro season is the prime crop on which Biswas and tens of thousands of farmers in the country rely for their living. The season is expected to produce 52 percent of the total 3.78 crore tonnes of rice this calendar year, up 4 percent year-on-year, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics and the Department of Agricultural Extension. This year, they were deprived of profit for higher domestic production that outpaced demand, causing the price to fall. The average national wholesale prices of rice fell between 13 percent and 21 percent from the previous year. Wholesale prices of coarse rice fell 21 percent to Tk 2,753 per quintal, according to the Department of Agricultural Marketing, which compiled price data until October. And the prices of the cereal were 24 percent lower than the government's procurement rates of Tk 36 per kg during this year's Boro and Aman seasons. Farmers said the prices of paddy had edged up slightly at the beginning of harvest of the second biggest crop, aman, but the spike was short-lived. The price has remained low irrespective of grain quality as the speed of the government's purchase is slow. In order to ensure profits for farmers, the government has declared to buy 6 lakh tonnes of paddy directly from producers during the current aman harvest season. But the food office began purchasing paddy on November 20 and has managed to buy 38,000 tonnes until Dec 23. Biswas had spent as high as Tk 700 for hiring a farmworker to harvest paddy. But after the harvest, they found the prices of paddy were about Tk 500 a maund. \"This is really frustrating. We had good prices last year. None of us have peace of mind this year,\" said Biswas, who also suffered losses as tidal surge for cyclone Bulbul destroyed fish farm. The farmers who grew jute benefited, he said. Farmers grow more than 200 crops, including four cereals, 153 vegetables and 34 types of spices, oilseeds, pulses and cash crops such as jute and sugarcane. Including fruits, the total number of crops and fruits grown would be roughly 350, according to the Agriculture Information Service. \"Potatoes brought me profit to some extent by the end of 2019,\" said Masud Rana, a farmer from northwestern district of Kurigram. The 42-year-old farmer cultivates wheat, mustard, potato and vegetable on his three-acre farmland and says flood-affected seedlings of paddy and early plantation in his area, raising the cost of production. \"Rice is our main crop and our wellbeing depends on it,\" Rana said. Rice is grown on more than 70 percent of the total cropped area of 1.54 crore hectares and 77 percent of marginal and small farmers depend on rice for food security and livelihoods, according to the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey 2015, funded by the USAID. Liakat Ali, a farmer from northern district Sherpur, said the farmers who depend highly on paddy suffered losses owing to falling prices of the grain. \"But I am better off as I grew potato, beans, onions and bottle gourd and I am getting higher prices from these vegetables,\" he said. All the three farmers said those who have grown onions, encouraged by skyrocketing prices of the key cooking ingredient this winter, have had margins. Yet, the number of onion growers is insignificant compared to rice producers. Fifty-one percent farmers grow only rice and 20 percent of growers produce rice along with other crops, said Akhter Ahmed, country representative of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). \"It appears that falling price of Boro paddy hampers farmers' wellbeing. But, there had been major setback except for the price of Boro paddy. Overall, the outgoing year has not been too bad or too good,\" he said. Ahmed said ensuring fair prices is vital. \"Reduction in prices of diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser is a positive step towards reducing the production cost of farmers.\" The government slashed the prices of the key fertiliser by 36 percent to Tk 16 each kilogram early December to give a boost to farming. \"The price cut raises hopes that we will make profit in the coming season,\" said Sanjay Kumar, a small farmer from Gabtoli of northwest district Bogura. He cultivated vegetables and rainfall destroyed his tomato field twice. With crop producers looking at their balance sheet for 2019, dairy farmers also did the same. The demand for locally produced milk was affected because of safety concerns following findings by the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority and a team of Dhaka University researchers on the presence of harmful substances in samples of pasteurised and raw milk. \"Our situation has not improved this year. Instead, it deteriorated,\" said Mohammad Shah Emran, general secretary of the Bangladesh Dairy Farmers Association. \"The demand for locally produced milk suffered. We, the farmers, did not get fair prices because of soaring imports of meat and power milk.\" On the other hand, the prices of feed rose and dairy farmers have to pay electricity bills at commercial rates even though the sector is part of agriculture, which enjoys lower tariff than other sectors, he said. \"Rice growers suffered in 2019 but consumers did not suffer as prices of the staple remained almost stable,\" said Quazi Shahabuddin, a former director general of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies.  Consumers can complain about higher onion prices, which have provided profits to farmers recently, he said. In 2020, the government should pay attention to ensure balance in the prices of essential commodities and farm produce to ensure a win-win situation for both consumers and farmers, Shahabuddin said. IFPRI Country Chief Ahmed said the thrust should be on rapid mechanisation, especially for harvesting in order to reduce the cost of production resulting from higher labour cost. The government will roll out a scheme to provide subsidies to farmers to buy agri-machinery, said Md Shahjahan Kabir, director general of the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute. \"We hope that farmers will make profit next year on the back of the cut in prices of DAP and the plan for faster mechanisation,\" he said. Biswas is still hoping for the paddy prices to recover so that he can sell more than 500 maunds of the staple now in his storage. The crop damage in some areas of southwest and south owing to cyclone Bulbul could prompt the prices to go up. \"I am waiting for the prices to increase,\" said the grower, who has also cultivated onion.

Austerity Plan\n1989-09-06T05:00:00.000Z\nAusterity measures imposed on the poorest countries by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for new loans, have produced no results, according to a United Nations report.\n''I guess you could say the sacrifices have been in vain,'' said Roger Lawrence, an official of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, referring to the reductions in social spending and the drop in living standards the austerity measures have caused.\nThat is one of the conclusions of the conference's annual report, scheduled for release Wednesday. The Geneva-based body is the main United Nations agency promoting the economic interests of the developing countries. The agency has often criticized the ways that industrialized countries have responded to economic conditions in poor nations. Foreign Debt\nThe report says there is a troubling split in world economic performance. While healthy growth has continued, both in the industrialized countries and in several developing countries - mainly in eastern Asia - the economies of the developing countries of Africa and Latin America have stagnated or worsened. The report attributed much of their plight to their large foreign debts.\nRecent initiatives, particularly by the United States and France, to forgive part of the debt are ''extremely welcome and positive,'' Mr. Lawrence said. However the conference argued that these measures would provide only about half the minimum debt reduction needed to spur economic growth.\nThe report examined the results of the adjustment programs adopted by the least developed countries to qualify for new I.M.F. loans. The United Nations has put 42 nations, with a combined population of more than 400 million, in this category. They all have very low per-capita income levels.\nThe report found that of the 12 least developed countries, which have applied such programs for most of the 1980's, the growth rates of only three - Bangladesh, Gambia and Mali -were above the average for all the least developed countries. ''The adjustment programs in the least developed countries have so far produced mixed results and achieved, at most, limited success,'' the report said. Detrimental Effects\nThe adjustment programs usually involve cutting public spending, devaluing the national currency to stimulate exports and reducing imports. By causing governments to reduce subsidies on food staples, such programs have provoked rioting, most recently in Venezuela.\nThe report said that often the main result of these programs had been a contraction of economic activity. Currency devaluation ''had little effect in stimulating exports in the least developed countries, but certainly created hardship, particularly to vulnerable groups,'' by raising prices, the report said.\nWhat is needed, it continued, is increased debt relief, more flexible adjustment programs and better access to industrialized countries' import markets."

However, the Kushtia Jail presents a different picture. Instead of being termed as a punishment house, the jail seems more like a skill development centre with all kinds of skills being taught to the inmates. The jail authorities here focus on making the prisoners self-reliant and help them channel their time and energy towards positive contribution to the society.  Established in 1968, the Kushtia Jail has the capacity to house 600 inmates. However, the jail currently houses 950 inmates, including 40 females. The initiative - which was started on June, 2017, by the Superintendent of Jail Md Zaker Hossain - is solely funded by the jail and works as a self-sufficient project where each inmate teaches another, said officials from Kushtia jail. The prisoners are engaged in many skillful activities including fabrication unit, weaving, handicrafts, dressmaking, power-loom, electrical and music training. In the fabrication unit, inmates make various items like Sari (a local garment worn by Bangladeshi women), Lungi (A garment worn by local Bangladeshi men), and monochords (one chord musical instrument) which are sold at the sales centre of the jail. Similarly, prisoners at the weaving unit manufacture handloom items like blankets, bedsheets, pillow covers, towels, fabric pieces, and hand-crafted products. Moreover, the prisoners take music and Arabic lessons every morning lessons from the districts' most esteemed teachers. They get to pursue their inner passion, organize regular cultural programs and even perform in front of guests visiting the prison. Prison authorities say, they identify the illiterate inmates as soon as they arrive at the prison, make a list, assess and enlist them to different groups to make the learning experience better and coherent, in order to help them achieve their goals in line with their interests. At the same time, a library has been set up inside the jail. The initiative has been taken to give prisoners a chance to read books. However, there is a lot of work left to be done in the library due to lack of funds. Sohel Rana, a prisoner who is sentenced to life at Kushtia Jail, is said to have helped 900 illiterate inmates so far to learn the basics. From 2017 to till date, 3,288 people have been taught to sign their names by him. Nahid Hasan, Nasim, Channu Miah, Fazle Rabbi, Nur Mohammad, who served at the jail in different times, said they were trained in electronics and now, as free citizens they are working as professional electricians and earning good money to support their families. Nur Mohammad, a resident of Chourhash area of Kushtia municipality, said that he too, like his other inmates, he feels dignified and empowered after getting back to his normal life. He said: \"I am a professional electrician and earn Tk600 each day. It feels good to be self reliant.\" Rubel Hossain of Sadar upazila said he is grateful to the jail authorities for his new life and said: \"I now work at a telecom shop and earn Tk10000 each month.  My life has changed.\" Parul's husband, Ismail, serves at the prison, and she said that he was previously  illiterate but can now can read and write. When contacted, Superintendent of Jail Md Zaker Hossain said their focus is on making the jail a correctional centre, rather than punishing them for which they are already convicted. \"We are working day and night to make the prisoners self-reliant so that they can live their lives as responsible citizens after finishing their terms here.\" \"The prisoners are getting half the amount of what their manufactured products are sold for and that can help them to re-initiate their learning when they get out,\" he added. Deputy Commissioner Md Aslam Hossain said: \"We are discussing with the concerned authorities to see if the prisoners can be helped  with loans that can help to kickstart their business after leaving the prison.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-17 00:00:00      \nThe Ichhamati, the once vibrant river that features prominently in several Bangla literary works, has turned into a narrow channel filled with garbage, thanks to rampant encroachment and indiscriminate dumping of waste. At some places in Pabna town, the river looks like a dying canal with the riverbed silting up, while at some other points, garbage chokes the water flow. Originated in the Padma in Pabna's Shibrampur, the Ichhamati runs an 84km course across the district before meeting the Jamuna in Bera upazila. Today, the river is hardly visible in Banglabazar area, near the point of its origin, because of roads, commercial and residential buildings, and business establishments. Reckless encroachment even forced the river to change its original course, said Kabir Mahamud, the deputy commissioner of Pabna. According to the government's Cadastral Survey (CS) records, published in 1922, the 9km section of the river that flows through Pabna municipality had 88.58 acres of riverbed. But the area dropped to only 54.53 acres as shown in the most recent Bangladesh Survey (BS) record map in 2013, said Md Mostak Ahmed, the district settlement officer, who has recently been transferred to Dhaka. In the CS map of Pabna's Ramchandrapur mouza, the river was identified as a single plot. But the recent BS survey map shows that the same plot is divided into 26 pieces, of which only one belongs to the Ichhamati and the rest have been grabbed. Similar pictures were found in all nine mouzas of Pabna municipality. In the last couple of decades, the 9km course through the municipality has been massively encroached upon. At some places, the river has completely disappeared. \"Encroachers have grabbed the riverland, and with the passage of time, many of them already prepared land documents. Paying revenue tax, most encroachers even attained the legal right to own the riverland as their personal property. Everything was possible because of administrative weaknesses,\" said Mostak, without elaborating on the weaknesses. The major portion of the river was occupied by petty settlements in the 1940s before the abolition of the feudal system, he said, adding that the illegal occupants marred the riverside land survey at that time. POLLUTION The Ichhamati has also been a victim of mindless pollution. Visiting different points of the river recently, this correspondent saw those apparently have turned into breeding grounds of mosquitoes and garbage dumping sites giving off foul smell. At some places, sewer from residential and commercial buildings flow into the pitch black water of the river. \"We have hung signboards in different parts of the Ichhamati asking people not to dump waste. But no one is paying any heed to our request,\" said Kamrul Hasan Mintu, mayor of Pabna municipality. \"The pollution won't stop unless public awareness on the issue is raised,\" he said, adding that they did not have adequate manpower to check the pollution. For years, different local citizen bodies have been campaigning to save the river from land grabbers and pollution. \"My children can never imagine how the Ichhamati looked three decades ago when we used to bathe in it,\" said Mirza Hasan Shahid, a resident of Pabna town. He lamented how land grabbing has changed the shape and direction of the river. PROJECT ON THE CARDS\n Following the campaign, the water resources ministry has taken up a project to restore the water flow in the river. As part of the project, the Institute of Water and Flood Management and Buet experts completed a feasibility study spending Tk 3.44 crore in June. The study covers the entire 84kms of the river, however, the focus of the project will be on 38km of the river from Banglabazar point in Pabna Sadar upazila to Madhupur point in Santhia upazila. \"Encroachment and pollution massively damaged 38km of the river, and there is no current in this portion. Through the feasibility study, experts tried to get a total picture, identifying illegal structures and the actual area of the river,\" Mosharaf Hossain, assistant director of the Water Development Board, Pabna said.  The experts submitted the feasibility study report last month and the ministry of water resource is making the DPP (development project plan) of Ichamati said Kabir Mahamud, the deputy commissioner, Pabna. \"Design plan and development plan of the river would be included in the DPP. After completing the DPP we will take initiative to evict the illegal occupation from the river according to the requirements of the project plan.\" the DC said. Meanwhile, the Pabna district administration conducted an eviction drive on September 1, removing eight structures, including a portion of a brick kiln, a road, and some concrete houses at Char Shibrampur sluice gate point in the sadar upazila, near the confluence of the Ichhamati and the Padma. Johurul Haque, executive engineer of WDB, Pabna, said three acres of land were freed and eight structures were removed at the point of the river's origin. \"A brick kiln owner had taken part of the river [near the sluice gate] on lease from Water Development Board for fish farming. After taking the lease, he filled up the river there and built a brick kiln. He also constructed a two-storey office building,\" Deputy Commissioner Kabir Mahmud said, adding that the lease was not renewed after 2016. The official said the district administration was trying to restore the water flow by freeing areas at the origin of the river from grabbers. They would also verify the private ownership claims of the river land near the sluice gate, he added. In addition to routine drives, massive-scale eviction will also be carried out before WDB takes up the dredging project, he said. If the district administration conducts eviction drives now and hands over the riverland to WDB, the latter will not be able to keep the land free from encroachment, the DC said. Once the mega project starts, the eviction will be sustainable, he said. It is not sure when the project may start, but the DC expects it to begin soon.  "

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-06 00:00:00      \nHe proposed a three-point plan for India's current economic slowdown and social unrest Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has spoken out against the recent predicaments unravelling in India including the economic slowdown, social unrest, and global coronavirus epidemic. Over the past few weeks, Delhi has been subjected to extreme violence over religious disputes following the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which provides access to citizenship for religiously persecuted minorities, excluding Muslims.  Singh, in an op-ed in The Hindu, even criticized people who use past instances of such violence in India's history to justify the present violence in the country, adding that: \"Every act of sectarian violence is a blemish on Mahatma Gandhi's India.\" Singh suggested that the Indian government implement a three-point plan which includes taking measures to contain the coronavirus threat, withdrawing or amending the Citizenship Act, and creating a holistic fiscal stimulus plan to boost consumption demand.  By removing religious stipulations from the Citizenship Act, India would be ending the toxic social climate and foster national unity, as well as reviving the economy. India's economy is currently facing an economic slowdown due to a lack of new private investment, since investors are unwilling to take on new projects over the looming uncertainty of volatile social tensions.  The lack of investment translates to a lack of jobs and incomes, which in turn means a lack of consumption and demand in the economy. This lack of demand further suppresses private investments, leading to a vicious cycle.  Singh, a renowned economist, stated that no amount of tweaking of tax rates, showering of corporate incentives, or goading will propel Indian or foreign businesses to invest, when the risk of eruption of sudden violence in one's neighbourhood looms large. Furthermore, the fear of the coronavirus epidemic reaching India threatens to dampen economic growth, further exacerbating the dire situation of the Indian economy. Despite the ambiguity of the situation, Singh proposes that India launch a full-scale, mission-mode operation to counter the threat immediately. Moreover, Singh has said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi must convince the nation that he is cognizant of the dangers and reassure the nation that he can help tide over this period of violence and uncertainty as smoothly as possible. He must also provide details of a contingency plan for the threat of the coronavirus scare. He adds that the virus contagion and the slowing down of China can potentially open up an opportunity for India to unleash reforms to become a larger player in the global economy and vastly improve prosperity levels for millions of Indians. \"It is time to confront the harsh reality of the grave risks we face as a nation and address them squarely and sufficiently.\" "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-26 00:00:00      \nWhat makes it different from the last DNCC polls is the absence of strong candidates As many as three million voters are set to go to the polls tomorrow to elect a new mayor and councillors for new wards, in the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) by-polls, without any enthusiasm or electioneering in sight. What makes it different from the last DNCC polls is the absence of strong candidates.  This has failed to generate a buzz among voters, not to mention lack of strong opposition candidates. While five candidates will vie for the mayoral position, only ruling Awami League-nominated candidate Atiqul Islam was seen to be electioneering, which ended yesterday.  The other candidates are Shafin Ahmed from Jatiya Party, Anisur Rahman Dewan from National People's Party, Shahin Khan of Progressive Democratic Party, and independent candidate Abdur Rahim. Polling for mayoral elections will be held in 54 wards of DNCC. Also 36 new wards, 18 in DNCC and 18 in Dhaka South City Corporation, are up for elections on the same day. Unlike the mayoral by-polls, vigorous campaigns are being conducted by candidates for councillor posts, as the posts are being contested for the first time. Election materials, including ballot papers, have already reached the offices of the returning officers concerned, as the Election Commission finalizes its preparations for the elections scheduled tomorrow. Arrangements are already in place to send the election materials to the polling centres by today, before voters head to cast their ballots starting 8am tomorrow.  The elections will take place until 4pm without any interval. A public holiday has been announced in DNCC areas so that all voters can exercise their voting rights. Electioneering concluded on Tuesday Returning Officer for the DNCC mayoral polls, Md Abul Kashem, told BSS that no candidate or none in favor of any candidate can conduct any meeting, rally, or procession starting midnight in the DNCC areas, after the electioneering schedule ended on Tuesday.  \"No offices will remain open on that day. But Public academic examinations will be held as per schedule. Students residing in hostels or residences for study purposes will be exempt from the directives concerning leaving election areas\" the RO said. Kashem added that the ban on traffic movement will be relaxed on highways and inter-district roads inside DNCC, considering the issue of public suffering, but vehicular movement on connecting roads will remain banned. Vehicle restrictions According to a home ministry circular, motorcycle transport will be banned in DNCC polling areas from today till Friday 6am.   Meanwhile, all vehicle traffic in the area--excluding emergency services--will be banned for 24 hours starting Wednesday midnight (12am) to Thursday midnight (12am). Vehicles affected by the ban during the by-elections are: motorcycles, trucks, motorized three-wheelers, taxis, microbuses, jeeps, pickups, and cars. Water vessels moving through the area will also fall under the vehicle ban. However, the restriction on vehicle traffic will be loosely implemented on important roads, streets, and highways leading into and out of Dhaka, and at inter-district bus terminals. The circular also directed non residents or voters in the DNCC to leave the area by Tuesday midnight (12am), to ensure a peaceful by-election, and to avoid facing legal action on voting day. Filling a void The DNCC mayoral post fell vacant with the death of Annisul Huq on November 30, 2017. According to the schedule declared by the Election Commission, the by-polls for the DNCC mayoral post were supposed to be held on February 26 last year. But a High Court bench stayed the election for six months after hearing two separate writ petitions on January 14 last year. However, another High Court bench later cleared the way to hold the by-election by withdrawing the stay order."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-04 00:00:00      \nSince the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic we have begun to analyse, forecast and speculate the impact on economies, societies, political systems, governance mechanisms, and on many more areas. We have started to imagine a world after COVID-19 through a variety of lenses based on our own understanding and experiences. The innumerable research that are being carried out on the impact of COVID-19 throughout the world have flooded our minds, and sometimes made us confused as to what life after COVID-19 would look like.   The implications of COVID-19 on the global economy and on individual countries are becoming obvious as time goes on. The shutdown of almost all economic activities have brought miseries to economies of all strata and phases. Production and supply chains have been disrupted, exports and imports decelerated, transportation system collapsed and service sector interrupted. These have changed the lives and livelihoods of people across the world. Unemployment has soared, poverty has surged, food insecurity has increased, and above all, loss of lives is increasing by the hour. Barring a few, most governments have undertaken policy measures to address such a rapid and massive impact of corona pandemic at large scales. Health expenditures have been topped up to mitigate the health risks. Stimulus packages for various sectors of the economy have been announced with the objective being increase spending following the Keynesian theory to rejuvenate the economy. Relief packages are also in place in many countries to extend income and food support to the poor to save them from hunger. These are of course immediate responses to rescue the lives of people and also pump oxygen into the economy. And, hopefully it will work sooner rather than later. Scientists and doctors have shown some rays of hope to tackle the disease. And once health is under control, human beings are smart enough to work through in reviving the economic activities and recover the lost gains to the best of their ability. At least, history has pointed out clearly how economies could get back to life after several crises in the past. The World Wars, the Great Depression, the Spanish Flu and many more examples will confirm this. However, apart from economic recovery, will there be any changes in social, cultural and institutional norms, political systems and governance patterns? Change is a continuous process. It happens for good or for bad. Changes emanated from crises may sometimes become beneficial for humanity. What changes will COVID-19 lead to? It depends on what changes we want to see. And how we work towards that. It is not automatic.  At the onset of COVID-19, people talked about the universal nature of this pandemic. We were reminded of how every person--rich and poor, man and woman, powerful and weak--is vulnerable to this pandemic. COVID-19 does not distinguish among race, colour, gender, location, profession, position or riches. But it has been proven wrong when immediate research in many communities in several countries showed that COVID-19 also has a bias against certain groups of people. That is why African-American were more affected in the USA or the underprivileged with weak immune system in poor countries are becoming victims of COVID-19 more than others. This bias is of course not created by COVID-19. Rather it is the outcome of the biases that have been created by government policies which favour the rich and ignores the impoverished. A review of the ongoing discussions with respect to the situation during the post COVD-19 period indicates that there can be three possible scenarios. First is the business as usual situation. That is, the world recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and goes back to where we were before COVID-19--economically, socially, politically and environmentally. We continue to live in whatever good or bad circumstances we had during the pre-COVID-19 period. And we continue to accept and adjust to the existing realities that the world will continue to generate wealth, and economic prosperity of some countries and some people will continue to multiply but these privileges will not be universal. The second situation will be such that the global economy slides so much that it takes a long time to recover. Poverty, mortality, morbidity, food insecurity and unemployment increases. All forms of inequality within and among countries accentuates. All global targets--Sustainable Development Goals, providing support to poor countries by developed countries equivalent to 0.7 percent of their gross national income, Paris climate agreement to limit the increase of global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius--fail to be achieved. As a result, countries become inward looking and resort to protectionism. And the effectiveness of global institutions such as the United Nations, World Trade Organisations and the like decelerates. Third is the optimistic case. The economies around the world not only recovers but, moves further ahead. Governments invest more in areas such as health, education, technology, climate and work towards ending poverty, improving inclusivity, establishing good governance and creating democratic spaces. Cooperation among nations improves and commitments toward fulfilling the global promises get implemented. This is the situation where crisis will be turned into opportunity by global and national leaders. What do we expect in Bangladesh during the aftermath of COVID-19? The outcome of the greatest crisis in Bangladesh's history--the Liberation War in 1971--was regaining our prized possession, that is, an independent country. We faced the crisis in unity and solidarity. And following the war we also got a progressive constitution that upholds the dignity and rights of every citizen of Bangladesh. Social justice and equality are also enshrined in our great constitution. After 49 years of our independence, we however, cannot claim that we could keep our promises to those who sacrificed their lives for the country. Rather, the spirit of our freedom fighters is being undermined by the way some of us conduct ourselves each day and even during crisis. Politically connected people who steal relief for the flood affected people and get away with such misdeeds are also active now during COVID-19. With shame we observe when people go hungry, these people in charge of distribution of food and support have the audacity to commit such heinous crimes. With frustration we see how public representatives are nowhere to be seen to coordinate the relief work and help their voters to survive. With sadness we note how people behave with the frontline workers of this crisis who are risking their own lives and also how health workers mistreat patients by forgetting the core values of their profession. With discouragement we learn how faulty and corrupt the health procurement is and how the poor are deprived of medicines allocated for them. And, all of a sudden, it seems everyone has become poor in Bangladesh!  The way every business--irrespective of its size and strength, is seeking stimulus packages from the government reminds us of the old story of greed, not need. One wonders, will people change in their attitude and behaviour or keep repeating their old acts once COVID-19 recedes?   Dr Fahmida Khatun is the Executive Director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue."

      "text": "3 Die as Police Clash With Protesters in Bangladesh\n1987-11-11T05:00:00.000Z\nAt least three people were shot and killed by the police here today as thousands of rioters set fire to cars and buildings, and threw bricks and homemade bombs in an attempt to force President H. M. Ershad from office.\nAt the end of the day of running battles between protesters and the police, the streets of the capital's commercial center were strewn with rubble, and the air was tinged with tear gas and smoke. But the likely effect of the unrest was unclear.\nBoth sides in the disorders proclaimed victory - the opposition parties because they had carried out a protest ''siege'' of the capital in defiance of a ban on demonstrations, and the Government because President Ershad's position appeared unthreatened, at least for now.\nOpposition leaders acknowledged tonight that they had been hampered in their ability to mount the protest, originally conceived as drawing two million participants. The actual number of protesters was in the tens of thousands at most.\nIn addition to outlawing demonstrations, the Government had closed Dhaka University and shut down incoming bus, rail and ferry transportation. Opposition Vows to Fight On\nThe opposition parties vowed to continue their drive until President Ershad was forced from office, but Government officials predicted that it would abate as many protests had in the past.\n''The myth has been exploded,'' asserted M. A. Matin, the Home Minister and a close aide to the President. ''They were supposed to force the Government to resign. They couldn't. The so-called siege degenerated into an act of anarchy, vandalism, arson and an attempt to create civil disorder.''\nLeaders of the main opposition parties said the attacks on their members were unprovoked. They called for a nationwide protest strike Wednesday and Thursday.\n''He will have to resign,'' Khaleda Zia Rahman, the leader of a coalition of seven opposition parties, said of the President. ''It is a matter of time. We will be out in the streets tomorrow and the day after until he goes.''\nThe opposition said a total of six people, not three as the Government said, had died from police gunfire. But the report was impossible to verify because the police had taken possession of the bodies. Nearby hospitals reported two people with gunshot wounds and dozens of others with injuries from the rioting.\nThe opposition said dozens were wounded by gunfire. A Turbulent History\nBangladesh, one of the world's poorest and most densely populated countries, has had a history of natural disasters, riots, assassinations, coups and coup attempts since it broke from Pakistan to become an independent nation in 1971.\nPresident Ershad was the army's Chief of Staff when he seized power in 1982; he was elected President last October in a day of voting marked by charges of fraud.\nAnti-Government parties renewed agitation against President Ershad last summer, culminating in 3 days of strikes in which 10 people were killed. But protests subsided when Bangladesh was hit by the worst floods in 40 years.\nThis fall, the opposition tried to revive the protest drive with what it termed a siege of the capital. The authorities reported arresting more than 1,100 people for political activities in the last few days; the opposition said the number was more than 5,000.\nAn unusual aspect of these protests was the unity among political parties of all ideologies, except for the ruling National Party of President Ershad. Anatomy of a Protest\nThe day began peacefully, with small groups marching noisily through the downtown area, occasionally broken up by riot police officers wielding clubs and shields or firing tear gas. By mid-morning, demonstrators were throwing bricks and homemade bombs, and the police were firing back with blanks.\nThe police later resorted to bullets in ''self-defense,'' Government officials said; opposition spokesmen said the firing was unprovoked."

Joint leadership has made the party stronger and organized than ever. There's no rift among us,\" he said at a press briefing at the party president's Banani office yesterday. GM Quader also said that JaPa is prepared to extend their help for flood victims across the country. \"JaPa will always follow Ershad's footprints in terms of helping people. As his successor, JaPa is prepared to stand by flood affected people,\" GM Quader said. \"Through our work, we will keep Ershad's principle alive which is to serve the country people selflessly,\" he added. JaPa's Secretary General Mashiur Rahman Ranga said at present, a massive area of Bangladesh is under water and the party is ready to extend their help to government's relief activities. Earlier, political analysts and researchers expressed their doubts whether JaPa, that has no definite ideology, organizational strength and most importantly lost the person who kept their politics alive, would sustain as a political party in the future.  They might get extinct like the party established by Maulana Bhasani or AK Fazlul Huq, as those were abolished after their death. They said, to be alive in Bangladesh politics, a party needs an authoritarian leadership and it may be the major lacking for the party in the future. Besides, the party has internal \"lack of democracy.\" The press conference was held following a joint meeting of the party's Central Executive Committee. However, party's Senior Co-Chairman Raushon Ershad and the presidium members, known to be as her followers, skipped the meeting."

      "text": "By the River, Refuge but Little Relief\n1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nClustered on a riverbank, more than 8,000 residents of this town in Bangladesh, about 100 miles south of Dhaka,were forced today to take shelter any way they could.\nIn outlying areas, those displaced by the floods took refuge in treetops and on tin roofs - survival having become a matter of ingenuity and improvisation.\nNo relief had reached this town in Bhola district today, 10 days after the start of the extensive flooding that has taken at least 550 lives and left much of Bangladesh under water.\n''How long will I survive with my family if this continues?'' asked one of those living on the embankment, Abdul Haq, 55, head of a family of nine. An Annual Event\nThe overall flood situation in this south Asian nation remained basically unchanged, though the levels of most rivers had dropped further after the devastation wrought by the monsoon, the wind-driven torrential rain that occurs annually in this part of the world. The monsoon is both devastating and beneficial: the death and destruction it brings is repetitive, yet agriculture -and particularly rice cultivation - depends on it.\nDuring a two-hour helicopter trip to and from Bhola today, vast sheets of water stretched as far as the eye could see.\nIn the affected districts - Narayangang, Munshigang, Faridpur and Chandpur - the treetops and tin roofs still protruded above water. Some communities, and the district headquarters of Narayangang and Munshigang, 11 and 20 miles south of Dhaka respectively, measured the flooding at knee-deep levels. Boats were seen plying the roads along with rickshaws. Many Are Cut Offs\nA helicopter pilot, flying over vast areas during the last few days, said he has seen many people trapped by flood waters asking for food.\nInformation Minister Mahbubur Rahman said that about 1,700 relief centers were in operation throughout the country. On one such place in Narayangang hung a sign reading ''Ershad Gruel Kitchen.''\nIn Nichkasia, Mr. Haq and about 200 other flood victims rushed toward three journalists today, having mistaken them for relief officials.\n''They don't care about us,'' said Mohammad Musa, 60 years old. ''They show up only when such great disasters befall us.''\nNaziur Rahman Mia, Minister of State for Local Government and Rural Development, said that more than 200,000 of of the district's 1.4 million people had been affected by the flooding and that about 70,000 had lost everything they owned.\n''Now the main problem is erosion of the river,'' said Mr. Mia, who is from this district. ''Already, 22 square miles have been gobbled up by the Meghna, leaving thousands homeless.''\nHe said he would assess the damage and provide relief as it is needed. Surviving on Biscuits\nStanding nearby was an 11-year-old girl, who gave her name as Fajilatunnesa, who said she had received a small package of biscuits four days ago, but nothing after that.\nThe Bhola area becomes nearly inaccessible in the rainy season. The five-mile road to the district headquarters is mostly unpaved and full of potholes and deep ruts. It took about half an hour to travel those five miles by jeep.\nHealth officials throughout the country continued to express concern both over hunger of flood victims and disease in places where there is little or no pure drinking water.\nA daily newspaper, Ittefaq, reported large-scale outbreaks of diarrhea and other intestinal ailments. Health Minister Abdul Munim said 2,250 medical teams are now working in the flooded areas."

      "text": "MAN IN THE NEWS; Diplomatic Handyman: Diego Cordovez\n1988-04-16T05:00:00.000Z\nA talent for waiting and a sense of humor have helped bring Diego Cordovez success in his six-year search for an Afghan settlement.\nA patient negotiator, he has been stalking that elusive quarry since 1982 when, as the United Nations Secretary General's personal representative, he first sought to negotiate among the various parties in the vast Palais des Nations in Geneva.\nAt first business was slow and unpromising. The Russians refused United Nations mediation. The Afghan guerrillas would not deal with the Soviet-backed Government in Kabul at all and Pakistan, which agreed to represent the insurgents, would not share a negotiating table with it.\nThe innovative Mr. Cordovez, a 52-year-old Ecuadorean lawyer who has worked for the United Nations since 1963, started by talking to each side separately. It was uphill work. Shuttle Diplomacy\nThen he hit on the idea of ''proximity talks'' - putting each side into a separate room and ''shuttling'' back and forth between them, while the United Nations disarmament talks droned on in an intervening conference hall.\nAlthough progress remained slow, there were reasons to laugh. Overzealous guards, told to keep the warring factions apart, regularly locked delegates in the lavatory for fear they might bump into a member of the opposing camp. Mr. Cordovez took to limping through the corridors to signal that his talks were still limping along, despite everything.\nThroughout all the disappointments and frustrations, Mr. Cordovez remained cheerful and persistent, maintaining that what was needed most was time and plenty of it. He was right. It took three years to persuade Kabul to cut the timetable for pulling out Soviet forces from Afghanistan from 43 months to 9.\nEven now, Mr. Cordovez is banking on time, the great healer, to make his agreement a success. The accord provides for Soviet forces to leave Afghanistan but not for the Afghans to stop killing each other.\nBut Mr. Cordovez remains hopeful that once Afghanistan's warring factions see the provocative Russians leave, they will bury their Kalashnikovs and compromise. ''It takes time for them to understand their fate is in their own hands now,'' he said.\nA stylishly dressed, plumpish man with horn-rimmed glasses, Mr. Cordovez is almost always laughing at something, occasionally himself. Enjoys Tinkering\nHe was born in Quito on Nov. 3, 1935; he and his wife, Maria Teresa, have a son, Diego. Mr. Cordovez enjoys carpentry and tinkering (he uses the French word bricolage) with broken things - useful hobbies for a United Nations bureaucrat.\nA lover of good food, wine and Cuban cigars, Mr. Cordovez also enjoys reading biographies of the famous. Not even his closest friends would call him modest.\nMr. Cordovez was appointed an Under Secretary General by Kurt Waldheim a few months before he stepped down as Secretary General.\nIn 1965 he was sent to the Dominican Republic when it was in the throes of revolution. Six years later he was involved in the violent birth of the nation of Bangladesh. In 1980 he was the senior official accompanying a mission to Teheran that failed to resolve the United States Embassy hostage crisis. He had better luck later that year when he helped settle a dispute between Malta and Libya over seabed rights.\nDespite his optimistic temperament, Mr. Cordovez's friends say he suffers occasional fits of gloom. A few days ago, with the Afghan talks on the verge of collapse, he said he was through with diplomacy and would go back to Ecuador to manage his family's horse ranch when this job was over. That seems unlikely now.\nHis job as Under Secretary General for Political Affairs includes settling the Persian Gulf conflict, too, so another odyssey lies ahead.\nMr. Cordovez plans frequent trips to Afghanistan in the coming months to oversee compliance with the treaty and to encourage the country's factions to reach a political settlement.\nHe is preparing seriously for the task. Visitors to his offices here are treated with Coca-Cola bottled in Kabul and offered a variety of Marlboro cigarettes popular in Afghanistan these days - they are made in the Soviet Union."

      "text": "A.T.&T. Plans 1.3% Rise In Long-Distance Rates\n1989-11-17T05:00:00.000Z\nEight months after the Government approved a method for setting long-distance rates that was expected to lower consumers' telephone bills, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said yesterday that it would raise prices on domestic long-distance service.\nA.T.&T. said it planned to raise its rates for night and weekend calling an average of 1.3 percent on Nov. 29. The increase will raise about $34 million a year, it said, and cost customers 3 cents a month on an average residential telephone bill. Night and weekend calls are made between 11 P.M. and 8 A.M. weekdays, all day Saturday and until 5 P.M. Sunday.\nAlthough the rate increase is relatively small, consumer advocates said it could spell an end to the trend toward declining long-distance rates and might also set a precedent for A.T.&T. to put sudden rate increases into effect. New Regulatory Format\nA.T.&T. said the rate increase is allowed under the regulatory change approved by the Federal Communications Commission in March. That permitted the company to set its own prices for long-distance services within certain ceilings and floors prescribed by the agency.\nThe new regulatory format allows A.T.&T. to change its rates on 14 days' notice, instead of the 45 days required under the commission's previous form of regulation, which was known as the rate-of-return approach and limited A.T.&T.'s profit from its long-distance business.\nThe price caps allow A.T.&T. unlimited earnings from long-distance and give the company incentives to cut costs, the F.C.C. said; the floors prevent it from undercutting competitors.\nThe No. 2 and No. 3 long-distance companies, the MCI Communications Corporation and the U S Sprint Communications Company, respectively, are not subject to F.C.C. regulation and have generally offered long-distance service at rates slightly below those of A.T.& T. Rates Rising to Ceiling A.T.&T. said the price increase announced yesterday would bring night and weekend rates for residential consumers up to the ceiling of allowable rates. It said current long-distance rates were sharply lower than they would be under rate-of-return regulation.\nA.T.&T. said yesterday that its rates for business customers were priced at about 95 percent of the maximum allowed by the commission.\nDavid Wagenhauser, a spokesman for the Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a Washington consumer group, said the rate increase showed that A.T.& T. planned to keep rates for residential customers ''at the maximum'' while it offered business customers discounts.\n''It's Wall Street and not Main Street U.S.A. that is seeing the benefits of price caps,'' Mr. Wagenhauser said. ''This is just a signal of who will bear the brunt of the new system.''\nWhen the change in regulation took effect in June, residential long-distance rates dropped $97 million. They later fell an additional $48.8 million when the regional phone companies reduced the rates they charge long-distance carriers for connecting to their networks. F.T.C. Statement\n''The commission is never happy to see a rate increase of any kind and we will review it and makes sure that it complies with the established rules of the price cap system,'' said Richard Firestone, chief of the F.C.C.'s common carrier bureau. ''People should understand that this rate increase is just part of the system, and we fully anticipate that there will be future decreases in rates over time.''\nThe F.C.C. has said the new price-cap system will reduce long-distance bills by $900 million in the next four years, with $700 million going to residential customers and $200 million to businesses.\nA.T.&T. also said it planned both to raise and lower its rates for international calling, depending on the country called. Calls to Rumania, Suriname and Macao would increase 20 percent; calls to India would drop to $4.20 from $4.50 for the first minute and to $2.04 from $2.77 for each additional minute, and calls to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal would drop to $4.45 from $4.90 for the first minute. The new international rates become effective Dec. 30."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-21 00:00:00      \nAt a time when the government is engaged in the multifarious activities involved in crisis management during the ongoing pandemic, it is encouraging to learn that the non-government organisations (NGOs) are emphasising their eagerness to share their expertise and experience with the government to help in tackling the crisis too. Various alliances of NGOs have expressed this at a virtual press conference recently. There is no doubt that these organisations can significantly help the government in its fight against Covid-19. With their widespread presence at the grassroots level, NGOs have been working alongside the government during times of disaster for decades. And such collaborative measures have proven successful in various aspects. Moreover, the presence of the surging cases of dengue, along with the approaching flood season, will surely weigh heavy on the crisis and make matters more challenging in the days to come. Thus, a collaborative means of preparedness between the government and NGOs will help ease some of the suffering during such times. With hands-on experience in dealing with vulnerable groups and disaster management, among others, NGOs can be involved in various spheres of operations--from helping farmers save their crops to the distribution of relief and much more. Furthermore, with government assistance, micro-finance NGOs can also operate to help boost rural economic activities as the moderately poor are entering the bracket of the ultra-poor. NGOs can also assist in implementing the activities at the core level under the government stimulus package declared to tackle Covid-19 impacts. The possibilities are many and will prove promising once the collaborative efforts are put into practice. It is to be noted that people's lives and health are at stake here, not to mention the adverse economic impact on the entire nation. The government should therefore take advantage of this opportunity to involve NGOs and their human resources to tackle the Herculean task that looms. Needless to say, during these challenging times, people's wellbeing in terms of health and the economic situation should be kept above all other considerations. The government should take all the help it can get."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-04 00:00:00      \nThe three time Grammy winning singer died from heart complications on Friday Bill Withers, a soulful singer best known for the 1970s hits Lean on Me, Lovely Day and Ain't No Sunshine, has died at age 81 from heart complications, his family said on Friday. Withers produced nine albums, most of them written and recorded in the 1970s, starting with Just As I Am, which included Ain't No Sunshine, which won him the first of three Grammy Awards, according to his official website.  His musical career ebbed in the 1980s as he left \"the hype and the hoopla\" of the spotlight for a more private life, it said. \"A solitary man with a heart driven to connect to the world at large, with his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other,\" Rolling Stone magazine quoted the family as saying a statement. \"As private a life as he lived close to intimate family and friends, his music forever belongs to the world.\" Withers was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, among his several honors, and made a rare public appearance to accept the tribute.  His death drew a flood of tributes, including one from Democratic U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who said he often played Withers' Lovely Day at events during his now-ended presidential campaign. \"In this time of death and pain, I hold onto him,\" Booker said in a statement. \"He gave us lifetimes of light and that flame will never be extinguished.\" Booker's former campaign rival, Senator Kamala Harris of California, called Withers a legend whose song \"Grandma's Hands\" reminded her of her own grandmother and other mother figures. \"Let's all continue to live by his cherished lyrics during these times and lean on each other,\" Harris said in a statement. William Harrison Withers Jr. was born on July 4, 1938, in Slab Fork, West Virginia, a coal country town of 200, the son of a miner who died when Withers was 13. He joined the Navy at 17 as his \"ticket out,\" according to his website. After his military service, he moved to Los Angeles where he worked in an aircraft parts factory, taught himself to play the guitar and made a demo tape that launched his career."

      "text": "Bangladesh Intensifies Appeal for Flood Aid\n1988-09-04T05:00:00.000Z\nBangladesh renewed an appeal for emergency international aid today as the official death tollpassed 500 in monsoon flooding that has made millions homeless.\nOfficials said earlier that the floods, which have closed Dhaka's airport, threatened the lives of 10 million people.\nFlooding during the monsoon season is an annual event in Bangladesh, and such flooding in limited proportions is considered essential to a successful rice crop. But last year's floods, which killed about 1,600 people, were described as the worst in 70 years, and this year's devastation is believed to be greater still.\nPresident H. M. Ershad was quoted as saying today that this year's flood ''is far worse than the last year's,'' and added: ''Nobody knows whether this devastation has any parallel in the subcontinent's history.''\nForeign Minister Humayun Rashid Chowdhury told the heads of diplomatic missions in Dhaka that the floods had caused enormous damage to crops and communications networks.\n''This year's flood is more than a natural disaster,'' he said. ''It is an aberration of nature in which 25 million people have lost their homes, and communications networks disrupted totally.''\n''Bangladesh will need about three million tons of additional food grains on top of what is already committed as regular assistance,'' he said, ''to feed nearly half of the country's population for four months before the next crop is expected.''\nMore than 50 people died today, putting the death toll above 500, officials said. Some unofficial estimates put the toll at more than 1,200, but the collapse of communications has made it virtually impossible to get an authoritative assessment. Mr. Chowdhury said there was no sign of any easing of the flooding crisis, adding: ''All major rivers are flowing above danger marks. The human misery and suffering are unbearable.''\nFloods engulfed more than half of the capital, drenching the homes of a third of the city's six million residents.\nOfficials said earlier that thousands of families huddling on river embankments or clinging to their submerged houses could starve to death unless supplies reached them soon. An estimated 10 million people faced starvation or death from poisonous snakes and disease, they added.\nBangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, has so far received promises of more than $600,000 worth of rice and cash from Pakistan, the United States and Australia. Britain has pledged $800,000 in immediate relief."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-13 00:00:00      \nDespite a court directive to stop the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics, the health authorities have taken no concrete steps in this regard, raising the spectre of superbugs, which cause some seven lakh deaths globally per year. Sale of antibiotics without requiring prescription from registered physicians is still high in the country, The Daily Star has found visiting over two hundred drug stores and talking to experts. Bacteria-fighting drugs known as antibiotics help control and destroy many of the harmful organisms that make people sick. But overuse and misuse of antibiotics prompt some strains of bacteria to make a small change in their DNA and become antibiotic-resistant \"superbugs\", experts say.  There is no data on deaths caused by superbugs in Bangladesh, but professors at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) say about 70 percent of the deaths at ICUs are caused by AMR [antimicrobial resistance] infections. AMR is a situation when microorganisms like bacteria, virus and some parasites resist medicinal interventions. \"Problem is people don't know which drugs are antibiotics. Around 15 lakh people are taking antibiotics daily and most of them don't have prescriptions,\" Prof Sayedur Rahman, chairman of pharmacology department at the BSMMU, told The Daily Star. A recent study, carried out jointly by the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) and the WHO, shows that antibiotics consumption in Bangladesh has increased by 30.81 percent in the last two years. The DGDA and the WHO used data from the pharmaceutical companies, and the study report was released on November 27 last year. Earlier on April 25, the High Court ordered the DGDA to take steps to stop the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics.  The ruling came after a writ petition was filed by Advocate Sayedul Haque Suman over the matter. The writ was spurred by a report in UK's The Telegraph, which cited a report this newspaper ran under the headline \"A big cause for health concern\" in April last year. High-ups of the DGDA -- the apex regulatory body for pharmaceuticals -- claimed they had done their best. But in reality, they only issued a notice in May to all district commissioners and civil surgeons, asking them to take steps in line with the court directive. The notice was followed-up by a reminder a month later. That was the extent to which the DGDA acted. DGDA Director Ruhul Amin told The Daily Star, \"Our drug inspectors are regularly advocating this issue at meetings with stakeholders.\" Queried further, he again mentioned that \"awareness was all important\" in this regard. People concerned, however, said the DGDA's action was \"just to save its skin\". Meanwhile, a laboratory analysis by the Department of Microbiology and Immunology (DMI) of BSMMU, conducted from 2010 to 2018, has found a sharp rise in the number of superbugs in the country. In 2010, superbugs and multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria were detected in 6.5 percent cases of all patients seen. But it increased to 11-14 percent in 2018, according to the study. Experts said it is the inappropriate and overuse of antibiotics which leads to the rise of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or superbugs, The AMR infections have become a global threat, with 10 million deaths predicted to be caused by it by 2050 if things go unchecked, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). But the country's authorities concerned seem to be taking the matter lightly. GROUND REALITY: PROFIT OVER PRESCRIPTION\n Recently, The Daily Star correspondents have visited drug stores in Farmgate, in front of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital in the capital. They have also been to pharmaceutical stores in both urban and rural areas in Savar, Rangpur, Khulna, Sylhet, Chattogram, Mymensingh and Rajshahi. The scenario was similar everywhere. At half a dozen drug stores at a rural market in Rangpur's Pirgachha upazila, this correspondent last month found antibiotics being sold either without prescriptions or as suggested by medicine sellers. \"As antibiotics work better and are more profitable, we sometimes do suggest it. People usually don't buy full dose of antibiotics. Besides, they are also reluctant to visit doctors because it would cost them additional money,\" a medicine shop owner in the village market told The Daily Star. Visiting at least 25 stores in Khulna's Hazrat Market, Moilapota intersection, Natun Rasta intersection and in front of Khulna Medical College Hospital, The Daily Star correspondents found customers buying antibiotic drugs without any prescription. Jalal Ahmed, owner of Afroz Medical Hall at Moilapota intersection, said he was not aware of any formal instruction from the authorities on not selling the drugs without prescription. There are more than a hundred pharmaceutical stores on the Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital Road. A medicine seller there said they make a huge profit from antibiotics sale. \"We have not got any direction in this regard,\" he said. The Daily Star correspondents witnessed the same situation in Chowhatta and Amberkhana areas in the city. Our Mymensingh correspondent and Rajshahi University correspondents also found antibiotics being sold over the counter in the two districts. Usually people suffering from dysentery, diarrhoea, food poisoning, common cold, cough, fever, toothache, and ear and throat pain use self-prescribed antibiotic, shows a 2014 study conducted in Rajshahi and published in the journal of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information. According to the DGDA website, there are 118,901 licensed retail drug shops across the country. A 2015 study by the System for Improved Access to Pharmaceuticals and Services, however, revealed the existence of approximately an equal number of unlicensed retail drug stores in the country, shows WHO website. A majority (68 percent) of the clients visiting these drug shops came by self-referral and without a prescription, the study showed. For another study, the Institute of Epidemiology, Diseases Control and Research (IEDCR) analysed some 14,669 samples collected from nine public hospitals across the country from 2017 and 2019. It found Ceftriaxone, a watch group drug, to be the most used antibiotics, and that the drug's effectiveness has gone down by 10 to 92 percent in killing several bacteria. According to the WHO, antibiotics are classified into three groups -- \"access group\" used for a wide range of primary level infection, \"watch group\" used against higher resistance bacteria, and \"reserve group\" only to be used when all alternatives fail. Imipenam, another watch group drug, has been found to be 10 to 76 percent ineffective. If these don't work, it only leaves to a few other antibiotics. \"It indicates we are rapidly going to exhaust rest of the available antibiotics in our hand,\" said Dr Zakir Hossain Habib, principal scientific officer at the IEDCR, who led the study. DGDA INITIATIVES -- NOT ENOUGH? On the DGDA directive on stopping the sale of antibiotics without prescriptions, several deputy commissioners said the DGDA initiative had a very little to no impact on creating awareness on the matter. \"We have held a meeting with all stakeholders. However, we haven't conducted any mobile court drive yet,\" Md Asib Ahsan, DC of Rangpur, told The Daily Star, adding that they were focusing on raising awareness first. He also said the issue deserves more campaigning and the DGDA needs to do more planning. Asked, DGDA Director Ruhul Amin couldn't even say whether the sale and consumption of antibiotics without prescription was a punishable offence. A DGDA official, however, said any medicine seller could be punished under the existing law for selling antibiotics without proper prescription. Such punishment, however, has yet to be meted out. BSMMU's Prof Sayedur Rahman said the DGDA can impose a fine of up to Tk 40,000 for the offence. He said cases can be filed against the owner of the drug store and it also can be sealed off. Contacted, Health Minister Zahid Malek apparently defended the DGDA, saying, \"It has a shortage of manpower. It is tough for them to monitor drug stores across the country.\" The DGDA has only 46 drug superintendents in its 54 district offices, said its sources. COORDINATION IS THE KEY Experts says the sale of antibiotics over the counter continues unabated mainly due to a lack of monitoring from the DGDA and coordination between the drug administration and the local administration. \"There are around 200 staffers, including 20 doctors, under the health ministry at each upazila. They can easily be involved in raising awareness on AMR [antimicrobial resistance],\" Prof Sayedur Rahman, who led the antibiotic DGDA-WHO antibiotic consumption study, told The Daily Star, adding that the DGDA cannot sit idly for the recruitment of manpower. He also said physicians often unnecessarily prescribe antibiotics \"due to a lack of facilities to carry out antibiotic sensitivity [ABS] test. Doctors in 55 districts do not have ABS test facility, he said. Dr Zakir Hossain Habib, principal scientific officer at the IEDCR, however, said the required tests could be done manually with the existing facilities as an alternative to the ABS tests. For that, the government must appoint enough lab technicians and ensure sufficient supply of reagents. Dr Muniruddin Ahmed, professor of clinical pharmacy and pharmacology at Dhaka University, suggested involvement of all local bodies in the fight against over-the-counter sale of antibiotics. He wants the DGDA to take the lead. Prof Sayedur Rahman suggested marking boxes of antibiotics red so that people can easily know they are prescription drugs.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-25 00:00:00      \n'So, the students who were trapped used the windows to escape with help from locals and fire service officials'  A fire which broke out at a campus of the Daffodil Polytechnic Institute in Dhaka's Kalabagan has exposed the building's lack of fire safety protocols which put hundreds of its students' lives at risk. The small scale fire that caused no casualties forced the students use windows to climb down from the second and third floor of the building with the help of outsiders who extended their helping hands with bamboos. Later, firefighters joined the locals and rescued the rest of the students trapped inside. The students could have suffocated from toxic fumes if the help had not come on time as there were no fire escapes in the building except for a narrow staircase. The fire originated from an electric short circuit around 11am and the flames were doused after one and a half hours, said Fire Service and Civil Defence officials. Abdullah Al Mamun, a fireman of the Mohammadpur Fire Station, said Daffodil Polytechnic Institute never conducted any fire drills to create awareness in case of a fire emergency. Seeking anonymity, a student of the Daffodil Polytechnic Institute, said: \"There aren't any emergency exits in our campus. As the fire originated from the main switch board installed beside the main staircase on the ground flood, the smoke quickly travelled up and prevented students from getting down. So, the students who were trapped used the windows to escape with help from locals and fire service officials.\"   \"We had found only one fire extinguisher for each floor, but when we tried to use them, we found them to be defective.\"  \"If a bigger fire breaks out in the future, there will be massive casualties and damages. The administration should take necessary fire safety measures as soon as possible,\" he added. According to Arif Miah, an office staff of the campus, the institution uses four floors of this five storey building and every floor is 2,500 square feet. Around 350 students attend classes regularly in this campus. Many students were in their classes when the fire broke out. Arif showed this correspondent five fire extinguishers which were all defective and lying beside the main switch board, where the fire had originated.  According to the Fire Service and Civil Defence, the building safety protocol dictates that at least two fire extinguishers have to be installed for every 1,000 square feet of a floor besides emergency exits and other fire safety equipment. At least one fire drill every month is mandatory for educational establishments, says the Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC). When contacted, the administrative office refused to make any statement regarding this matter."

A bench of Justice Mamnoon Rahman and Justice Ashish Ranjan Das passed the order on Sunday, as the DG failed to comply with its previous order on issuing Monthly Pay Order (MPO) scheme to the 19 teachers, and staff of Saleha Begum Mohila Degree College at Jhenaidah district. The DG has been asked to appear before the court, and present his explanation on July 31. Lawyer Mohammad Siddique Ullah Mia, who stood on behalf of the applicants in court, said the High Court on March 13, 2017 issued a verdict on issuing MPO to the 19 teachers and staff of the college, which got rejected on August 6, 2018 following an appeal. Meanwhile, as the order of HC was not followed, the teachers filed a case with the High Court for non-compliance of the HC order. On December 18, 2018, the HC issued a rule on contempt of court. Later on April 16, 2019 it gave the director general a week to comply. As the directive was not complied to, yet again, the HC summoned him on Saturday, and asked him to produce explanations over the matter."

      "text": "WAS MAN MEANT TO FLY?\n1987-11-01T05:00:00.000Z\nAMERICANS have always been on the move, but never have so many moved so far so fast.\nLast year, our domestic airlines carried 394 million passengers more than 3 billion passenger miles - twice as many people, twice as far, as a decade ago - and this year's traffic is still greater. Airliners have displaced trains, buses and cars for all but short trips and now account for nearly 90 percent of interstate travel.\nBut if we're flying more, we're enjoying it less. Near-midair collisions, and the August crash of a Northwest Airlines plane, have been much in the news, alarming air travelers. Exasperating and costly delays are dishearteningly common; at more than one airport recently, police have had to quell disturbances by infuriated passengers. Of five flights I booked researching this article, two were canceled, three delayed. I spent a total of seven hours flying - and six waiting, fidgeting and fuming. Such irritants, plus amenities sometimes akin to those of a bus in Bangladesh, generated three and a half times as many complaints to the Department of Transportation in the first nine months of 1987 as in the same period of 1986.\nMuch of the trouble stems from the 1978 deregulation of the airlines. Its aim was to benefit passengers by replacing government controls of fares and routes with free-market competition. And it worked: airlines fought for market share by offering discount fares, opening up hundreds of new routes, and competing on 2,000 city-to-city connections formerly served by one airline. Air travel became the transport of the masses.\nBut the unrestrained scramble for business, according to both government and airline industry experts, led to overscheduling of flights at popular hours, with concomitant traffic jams and delays. And when the Civil Aeronautics Board was phased out in 1985, airlines got free rein as to seating-room allotment, extent of overbooking, passenger compensation when flights are delayed or canceled, refund policies when so-called deep-discount tickets are returned, and so on. (The Department of Transportation regulates only three consumer issues: smoking, baggage losses and bumping of passengers due to overbooking.) A number of bills filed with House and Senate committees would reimpose enough control to correct some of these problems without losing the benefits of deregulation. One such bill, which would include the requirement that airlines provide more time between connecting flights and post on-time performance records, was approved by the House on Oct. 5, but has not yet been considered by the Senate. Until it or some other bill becomes law, caveat volator -Let the flyer beware.\nThe following primer on domestic air travel advises passengers of areas in which they can make advantageous choices and of ways to minimize the slings and arrows of air travel. HOW TO GET FLIGHT INFORMATION\nBefore deregulation, you had only to call any airline and say where you were going. If it didn't fly there, it would tell you who did. Since all airlines had pretty much the same fares, it mattered little which you picked; aside from departure time, you might choose on the basis of the food or the movie.\nToday each airline sets its own prices and no two have identical fare schedules; accordingly, for most passengers cost is a major factor in choosing an airline. But cost comparisons are complex. Most flights offer three classes of service: first, business and coach (economy). Coach fares, the choice of most passengers, vary by day of the week, time of day, and how far in advance the ticket is bought. Also, some routes to a destination are cheaper than others: many airlines offer lower fares on ''direct'' or ''through'' flights (flights on their airline with stops en route) than on nonstops or flights going part way on another airline. A traveler going from, say, San Jose, Calif., to Washington can choose among six airlines offering three direct flights and 23 with connections - all at varying prices.\nOne can neither review all the possibilities with an airline agent nor, except with great difficulty, locate the best one in the thickets of data in the printed ''Official Airline Guide.'' But computers can instantly sort out the guide data according to whatever parameters - itinerary, day, time, lowest fare and so on - are punched into the keyboard, and come up with the optimal alternatives.\nThat's why many travel agents subscribe to one of the five computer reservation systems and why passengers buy 80 percent of their tickets through travel agents. Geoffrey H. Lipman, executive director of the International Foundation of Airline Passengers Associations, says, ''The C.R.S. is the one way to manage all that data - and thus the travel agent is more important than ever.'' (Agents' services are free; the airlines pay the commissions.) All the major computer reservation systems are owned by airlines (Sabre by American and Apollo by United, for instance), and each tends to offer its own airline's flight first; to get the best flight from your own standpoint, you need to be insistent, or have a truly helpful agent, or both. A FARE QUESTION\nTo choose among the alternatives, you must first establish your priorities. A businessman's primary criterion might be to get from New York to Denver next Monday in time for a business luncheon. A thrifty vacationer going to Denver might rate economy first, even if it means taking a Saturday afternoon flight with several stops and paying weeks in advance. For most travelers, the best choice is a compromise.\nAirlines reserve some seats at full fare for business travelers, who typically book on short notice, must fly at certain times and cannot look for bargains. All other seats are cheaper, the biggest bargains being at the least desirable times and days, often requiring stayovers, and subject to 25 to 100 percent penalties for cancellation or change. Last year, 9 out of 10 travelers bought their tickets at discounts that averaged 56 percent below full fare. Typically, a full-fare traveler from New York to Miami on Eastern would pay $698 roundtrip for a coach seat and $924 for first class, a discount traveler $180.\nThe biggest bargains are hard to come by. Certain airlines play ''bait and switch'': They advertise superbargain fares, but these always seem to be sold out - although the airline is happy to offer you a seat at a somewhat higher price. The ads aren't totally fraudulent; there actually are a very few seats per plane at the superbargain rate. Some airlines, however, set aside large blocks of seats for deep-discount fares.\nWhat can the ticket-shopper do? Here is some advice from the Department of Transportation, the Aviation Consumer Action Project, which is a Ralph Nader-founded advocacy group, and industry sources:\nIf you must go on short notice and at peak hours, you'll have to pay full fare. But it may cost less on one airline than another; Continental, for instance, charges 30 percent to 50 percent less than its major rivals.\nBook long in advance; the farther ahead, the better your chance of getting a bargain.\nPick off-peak times and days. On business routes, cheap seats are most available on Saturdays at midday; on resort-area routes, in off-season and midweek.\nIf you can stay overnight or even longer, you may qualify for certain superbargains.\nGamble on a superbargain fare with a cancellation penalty unless factors in your life make cancellation likely.\nPrepayment is required for certain superbargains, but don't prepay if the airline is financially shaky; if it goes bankrupt before your flight, you'll be just another creditor.\nFor $25, senior citizens can join a discount club with any of several airlines; travel is limited to certain times, but with a discount of 10 percent. MARCHING THROUGH GEORGIA - OR, ANYWAY, ATLANTA\nOld air-travel joke: Whether you're going to heaven or hell, you have to change at Atlanta.\nThat's because Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport is a major hub for both Delta and Eastern - a focal center in the ''hub-and-spoke'' system that has dominated routing since deregulation. (Eastern and Continental, both owned by Texas Air, continue to operate as separate airlines.) Formerly, to go from A to B, you went nonstop if an A-to-B flight existed; if not, you hunted for some C to which you could fly from A, and where you could get a C-to-B flight. With deregulation, airlines were freed to add routes as they chose; they greatly increased the number of routes available -but instead of adding convenient nonstops, they transformed their route structures into hub-and-spoke systems. A hub is a center from which a large number of spokes -connections to many cities -radiate in all directions. Hub-and-spoke systems make for many shorter, better-filled and hence more profitable flights than nonstops; that's why airlines like them. As for passengers, they can now make connections between scores of minor cities by going through a hub. But doing so can be a miserable experience. Of the country's 30 major hubs, some are chronically plagued with delays at peak hours, and some have vast concourses (Delta's, at Atlanta, are more than a third of a mile long) down which the panting traveler trudges, through crowds, toward a gate that always seems to be at the far end.\nThe essence of hub operation is the dovetailing of a peak-hour ''bank'' or batch of incoming flights with an outgoing bank; ergo, congestion, crowds and delays. Delta, Eastern and other airlines daily make 2,200 takeoffs and landings at Atlanta; United, American and others almost as many at O'Hare. That means a lot of people in your way during your long walk, a lot of people in line in front of you, a lot of competition for seats in the waiting areas, a lot of planes waiting a turn to take off or land. Some suggestions: Try to avoid major hubs. The five busiest airports, all hubs, are: Atlanta, Chicago's O'Hare, Los Angeles, Dallas/ Fort Worth, Denver.\nIf you can't avoid them, try to pass through them at off-peak hours.\nCompare alternate routes; sometimes a roundabout one, with two stops at small hubs, is a better bet than a direct one via a single superhub. But bear in mind that every change of planes increases the chance of a missed connection and misrouted baggage. THE DIFFERENCES AMONG AIRLINES\nSeen at the gates, all airlines are sleek and gleaming, all pilots handsome and competent. Some passengers assume all airlines are about the same in quality of service. The evidence is otherwise.\nComplaints to the Transportation Department about delays, cancellations, missed connections, long waits at ticket counters, lost bags and so on vary greatly by airline. Complaint rates per 100,000 passengers for the large commercial airlines for the first nine months of 1987: Continental 29.3 Northwest 18.5 TWA 13.4 Pan Am 13.3 Eastern 12.7 United 7.0 Braniff 5.2 American 4.3 USAir 3.5 Piedmont 3.0 Delta 2.5\nIt should be noted, however, that industry-wide complaint rates declined in September by 23 percent over August of this year. Continental's latest ads claim that it is getting a handle on its problems, which were due to its recent absorption of New York Air and People Express. But it has a long history of passenger discontent: from 1984 through 1986, Continental's complaint rate, though far lower than in 1987, was among the three highest of the major airlines (the other two: Pan Am, TWA). In contrast, in all three years, Delta and Piedmont had the lowest rates -only a fourth to an eighth as high as the highest three.\nBy promoting competition, some critics of deregulation contend, airlines have been encouraged to cut costs, and not all of them adhere equally to maintenance procedures prescribed by the Federal Aviation Agency. Notable examples: The F.A.A. recently fined Eastern a whopping $9.5 million for 78,000 violations, and American $1.5 million for violations that included using plastic wing slat pulleys instead of the F.A.A.-approved metal ones.\nPilot competence, or the public perception of it, is a factor in passenger choice: Some travelers avoid a particular airline after news reports of near-misses, pilot errors and the like. But news items are a poor guide; most pilot errors never make the papers. A better guide: F.A.A. findings released to the press. In September, for instance, an F.A.A. safety team investigating Delta's recent string of close calls reported that the airline's poor policies on crew training resulted in ''a lack of crew coordination and lapses in cockpit discipline.''\nAirlines differ as to how much space they allot passengers, especially in coach class. Delta's L-1011 has nine seats across in economy, United's, 10. USAir's all-coach 727-200 seats 158 people; Eastern's cram in one more row, for a total of 177. An obese person might suffer in United's plane, a long-legged person in Eastern's. Ask the airline or your travel agent for the number of seats across or the ''pitch'' (distance from the back of the passenger's seat to the seat ahead - 33 inches is acceptable). Seating diagrams for 14 airlines (lacking pitch data but identifying seats with little legroom) appear in ''Airline Seating Guide,'' obtainable quarterly for $10 from Carlson Publishing Company, P.O. Box 888, Los Alamitos, Calif. 90720.\nFrequent-flyer plans are a decisive element for some travellers. In return for enough mileage credits, some airlines give free trips to any city on their domestic routes, others first class seats at coach prices, and so on. The ''best'' deal is the one that offers what you prefer. Money magazine last year rated Pan Am's program best because it gave free trips to exotic locales such as Bombay and Nairobi, but if such places don't call to you, that plan isn't best - for you. HURRY UP AND WAIT\nMany air travelers can sympathize with former Senator James Abourezk of South Dakota, who is suing New York Air (now Continental) for false imprisonment. In Washington several years ago, he boarded a late-afternoon plane for New York to attend a United Nations reception. The plane ''tarmacked'' - stood idling on the taxi strip - for three hours. Having already missed the reception, Senator Abourezk asked to be let off, but the pilot said no gates were open. So the Senator went to New York, took the next flight back to Washington, and arrived home at 1:10 A.M., out $154 and nine hours, and understandably furious.\nDelays - not all of that magnitude - are very nearly as numerous this year as last year, although they were down 24 percent during the summer of 1987 as compared to the summer of 1986. What constitutes a delay? The F.A.A. defines it as a 15-minute period or longer between the pilot's request for clearance to taxi and actual takeoff, but passengers held an hour or two at the gate before boarding define it differently. ''Nobody keeps track of the real delays,'' says Hoyte B. Decker, assistant director for consumer affairs at the Department of Transportation, but some clues exist:\nMonte Lazarus, a former United vice-president, proudly told the House Subcommittee on Aviation that in May, 78 percent of United's flights had departed and 70 percent had arrived within 15 minutes of scheduled times - which means that more than a fifth of United's flights took off late and nearly a third landed late. United's track record is typical, or better than typical, of the industry's. At busy hubs, the chances of delays are far worse.\nIn September, the then Transportation Secretary, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, aware that bills pending in Congress would force the airlines to publish their on-time performance records, seized the ball and ran with it: the Transportation Department ruled that airlines would have to make the data available to the public by late this year through travel agencies and airline ticket offices. Meanwhile, Transportation Department spokespersons, veteran travelers and Frequent Flyer magazine offer these tips:\nIf possible, avoid peak-hour departures and arrivals.\nTry to bypass the biggest airports; sometimes a minor one, though farther from the city, is a better bet.\nTry to avoid any airport that is a major hub for one or more airlines.\nIf you must depart at a peak hour, don't base your appointments on the scheduled arrival time.\nWhen flying to an important appointment, allow extra en route time or go the night before.\nCall the airport before setting out to see if flights are being delayed.\nOn short trips, consider going by train, bus or automobile; on paper the trip may look longer, but in reality it may save time and stress.\nFliteline is a service run by the Aviation Safety Institute; for an annual fee of $50, you can call an 800 number at any time to ask if weather or other problems are likely to delay your flight that day. Fliteline's computers use National Weather Service data and F.A.A. delay reports; on-line advisors give you the prediction and, if necessary, suggest alternate routes. For information, call 1-800-848-7386. LEFT AT THE GATE\nEven delays aren't as infuriating to passengers as ''denied boardings'' (bumpings) because of overbooking.\nAirlines overbook by a small percentage to compensate for no-shows and cancellations. Sometimes they overshoot the mark and are forced to bump some ticketed passengers, usually the last to check in. But they must report bumpings to the Transportation Department, which can take punitive action if the number of incidents gets too large. For the first six months of 1986, the overall rate was 4.61 persons bumped per 10,000 boardings - less than one-twentieth of 1 percent - and for the first half of 1987 was only a trifle higher, 4.76 per 10,000. But the chance of being bumped varies widely among airlines. For the first half of 1987, Pan Am had nearly four times the average rate; American's rate was only 0.06.\nUnder Transportation Department rules, when passengers have to be bumped, the airline must first ask for volunteers, offering compensation for giving up their seats. If airline agents fail to ask for volunteers before trying to bump you, demand that they do so; the law is on your side.\nThe department also requires that the airline, if it bumps you, get you another flight or pay you for your inconvenience, as follows:\nIf it can get you to your destination within an hour of your original scheduled arrival time, you get no compensation.\nIf it gets you there more than one but less than two hours late, it must pay you an amount equal to the fare of your oversold flight, up to $200.\nIf it gets you there more than two hours late (four hours on international flights), it must pay you twice the price of your ticket, up to $400.\nIf it makes no travel arrangements for you, it must pay you twice the above amounts.\nPayment must be immediate, in the form of a free ticket to your destination, a check, or both.\nNone of the above applies if the plane has 60 seats or less, the flight was canceled, or a smaller plane had to be substituted for the original one.\nTo minimize the chance of being bumped, book ahead of time, check in at least half an hour early, and be at the gate before boarding (last-minute arrivals are prime candidates for bumping). IMPEDIMENTA\nAt many airports, travelers with hand luggage must carry their bags long distances (porters are a vanishing breed; rented carts are scarcest when most needed). Big bags or parcels, checked through, often take up to half an hour to reappear at the baggage-claim area. Sometimes they never do, particularly if you've changed planes en route.\nIf your bag doesn't show up, don't panic; according to the Transporation Department's ''Fly-Rights: A Guide to Air Travel in the U.S.,'' 98 percent of lost bags are found and returned.\nIf your bags are missing, the airport staff of most airlines will, on request, give you money for emergency purchases of toilet articles and some clothing (a fresh shirt or change of underwear). Only if the bag is permanently lost will they work out a settlement payment. The Transportation Department limits airline liability to $1,250 per claim; if your checked possessions are worth more than that, buy ''excess valuation'' insurance, if available, as you check in. Some major credit cards, if used to pay for the tickets, provide free baggage insurance. FEAR OF FLYING\nA 1983 Gallup poll for Newsweek found that 11 percent of people are always frightened when they fly; another 3 percent are frightened most of the time, and 21 percent some of the time. Most flight-phobic people attibute their fear to the risk of midair collisions and other accidents. But the facts would allay fear of flying - if fear could be counteracted by rational thinking, which is rarely the case. The facts:\nFor the last dozen years, the fatal accident rate for passengers per million aircraft miles flown by domestic airlines was far lower than the preceding 12 years. There were no passenger fatalities in 1986, and in the first nine months of 1987 there was only one fatal airline accident out of close to five million flights. (A Northwest Airlines plane crashed near Detroit on Aug. 16, killing 156 passengers and crew members.) In 1986, 46,000 people died in highway accidents; from 1980 to the present, an average of 77 passengers and crew have died per year in major domestic airline accidents. The fatal accident rate for regional airlines has been higher than that for major airlines, but not by much.\nThe F.A.A. last week announced that there was a sharp rise - 48 percent - in the number of reports of near collisions involving commercial airliners for the first nine months this year; the increased was from 258 last year to 383 for 1987. But Robert Buckhorn, deputy assistant administrator for the Office of Public Affairs at the F.A.A., has said, ''We still have less than half the number of near-midairs that we had in the 1960s - and double the traffic. And a good proportion of near-midairs are of the 'no-hazard' variety -closer than regulations allow but without actual danger.''\nFlying used to be a delightful and luxurious way to travel; today it is neither. But the informed traveler can minimize its fears, discomforts and inconveniences. In any case, one can only say of it that, like democracy, with all its faults it's far better than any of the alternatives."

The approval came at an Ecnec meeting, with its chairperson and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair, held at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area on Tuesday. While briefing reporters after the meeting, Planning Minister MA Mannan said a total of 6 projects involving an overall estimated cost of Taka 4,447.76 crore were approved, reports BSS. \"Of the total project cost, Tk4,439.86 crore will come from the state exchequer while the rest of Tk7.90 crore will come from the organization's own fund,\" he said. Of the approved six projects, five are new while the other is a revised project. The minister said the Nuclear Security and Physical Protection System Cell and Bangladesh Army, Army Headquarters, GS Section (coordination) will implement the project by March 2023. The main project objectives include ensuring security to the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant through implementing the physical protection system side by side, creating a supporting environment for generating safe and protected nuclear power. It also aims to face the risks generating from Design Basis Threat (DBT) or outside of DBT for the nuclear power plant. The planning minister said concerned experts from Bangladesh Army in cooperation with the experts from Russian Federation would implement the project. A bilateral protocol between Bangladesh and the Russian Federation was signed on September 17 last year and in light of that agreement, the project has been undertaken. According to the Planning Commission, establishing nuclear security infrastructures is indispensable for implementing any nuclear power plant project and it is also separate from the construction work of nuclear power plant. Besides, establishing an effective national nuclear security infrastructure is also very much important as a precondition for setting up a nuclear power plant. The main project operations include some 300 acres of land acquisition, 1214678 cubic meter of land development, public works for security and physical protection system."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-29 00:00:00      \nShuvo told the visiting journalists that he immersed himself in robotics related subjects from an early age dreaming of making robot one day Shuvo Karmakar is a tenth-grader from Kalupara village in Agoiljhara upazila of Barisal, attending Gaila Secondary High School. He spent about Tk 25,000 to make an artificial intelligence (AI) robot named \"Robin\", that can communicate in both English and Bangla.  The thought of creating Robin came after Shuvo saw robot Sofia.  He made sure the robot could speak Bangla unlike Sophia. The cost of making Robin was much less than Sophia, said Shuvo to local journalists. Shuvo told the visiting journalists that he immersed himself in robotics related subjects from an early age dreaming of making robot one day. So he gathered knowledge about robotics and programming from the internet. He learned that the word 'robot' derived from the Czech word 'robota,' that means forced labour, slave of man, or the machine that can work continuously and spontaneously and would be an alternative for various human activities.    When his friends played outside, he remained home in front of the computer, going from one website to another to learn robotics and programming.  He started to make Robin on May 25, 2018, and it took him about eight months to complete in January 2019, spending around Tk 25,000. The robot was named Robin after a superhero of a cartoon show in the USA.  To make Robin locally and affordably, Shuvo managed to acquire hardware from local shops in Dhaka and Barisal, and from online. After completion, he enriched Robin with several useful features like self-learning and using machine-learning algorithms to process information. It can also tell the names of its maker, and top leaders and officials of the country. A sensor in Robin can detect fire emergencies and send location information to the nearest fire service office via Google Maps. Robin is also a treasure of information for interacting with children to teach them the basics of different subjects. It can also  provide valuable insight to farmers about producing and caring for crops. Shuvo is now working on improving Robin by giving eyesight and movement on legs instead of working on wheels.   \"If I get enough support, I can improve Robin more to reach further heights in the field of robotics, by making a robot even better than Sofia,\" said Shuvo. Shuvo received an award from Dr Dipu Moni on July 5, 2019, and at the National Children's Prize held in 2018.  He was also honoured with an award from Science and Technology Affairs Minister Yeafesh Osman at The National Science and Technology Fair on June 26, 2018, and different prizes from upazila, district, and divisional shows and competitions. Businessman Santosh Karmakar and Dipti Karmakar, father and mother of Shuvo, said he is the older of their two children, and family members are happy and proud of Shuvo. His parents say they will continue to support him to follow his passion."

The minister made the statement at the roundtable meeting, \"Safe food and agriculture management,\" arranged by Daily Bangladesher Khabar at the National Press Club in Dhaka on Tuesday. \"We cannot change anything rapidly due to bureaucratic problems in our country.  There is lack of skilled manpower and infrastructure for a safe food institute,\" he said. To solve the manpower shortage, new employees have to be recruited and the process of recruiting them is underway, he added.  Saying that the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority needs to be well equipped and that there is a need for labs in all districts to conduct food tests, he continued: \"We need to form a task force along with all ministries and authorities concerned that will work together to ensure food safety.\" The future of the coming generation depends on food safety, he added.  He expressed disappointment, saying the media does not focus on issues of food safety.  Dr Md Fazlul Karim, dean of the agriculture department at the Sher-e-Bangla Agriculture University, said the rule of law must be sustained to ensure food safety. He said: \"We cannot ensure food safety without ensuring rule of law.\" Chairman of Bangladesh Food Safety Authority, Syeda Sarwar Jahan, said food safety is a basic right, and food safety has to be ensured to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). She said: \"Everyone in the food industry has to take responsibility to ensure food safety,\" adding that the government plans to set up \"healthy markets\" across Bangladesh to promote organic agriculture. She continued: \"We have already sat with CEOs of city corporations and theyhave  agreed to help set up healthy markets where farmers can sell their produce. She also urged the mass media to publish reports on healthy markets soelt that people are made aware of such products in the market. Shajahan Ali Badsha, a poultry farm owner, said authorities have to arrange training sessions for farmers so that they are made aware of everything about food safety. Bangladesh Food Safety Authority member Abdul Alim, Member Director of Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council Monirul Islam, former managing director of Directorate General of Health Services, Sha Munir Hossain, and Dr Nurul Islam, director of Agriculture Information Service, and others, spoke at the roundtable meeting.

We only need the 'will' of the richer segments of societies - everywhere - to act ambitiously against climate change. We need to 'transform' our lifestyles, attitudes, systems, economies,\" she said on Saturday. She made the remarks while delivering her speech at a panel discussion on \"Climate Change as a Security Threat\" at the Conference Hall of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich, Germany. She said that climate change has become a real threat to human beings with an unabated rise in global temperature. About Bangladesh, the prime minister said increasing cyclones, storm, surge, and monsoon flooding challenge livelihood of its people. \"Our Bay of Bengal is increasingly getting acidic. Twenty percent of our people living along the coast and one third of Bangladesh's population eventually risk displacement with rising sea level although we have little contribution to global warming,\" she added. She said flooding erodes river banks during every monsoon while numerous families overnight become homeless and helpless. \"We lose thousands of acres of precious farmlands. And, let's note that our mighty rivers carry nearly one fourth of entire load of sediment carried by all the major river systems in the world every year.\"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina addresses a panel discussion on 'Climate Change as a Security Threat' at the Conference Hall of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich, Germany on Saturday, February 16, 2019 |Focus Bangla Hasina mentioned that the erratic pattern and intensity of rainfall and rising heat make farming difficult for Bangladesh's people. There are also reports of growing water stress during dry season. She said changing climate is taking its toll through the emergence of new pathogens. \"Diseases like malaria, which we successfully eradicated risks a comeback. Similar risks are evident in diseases in serials, livestock and poultry,\" she said, adding that temperature variation is challenging breeding of Bangladesh's national fish ilish. \"There are serious enough challenges for the precious gains we made in development.\" Displacement issue The prime minister said despite the fact and also the IPCC findings - a lot of people - including those that are conscious of climate change are yet to understand the climate displacement issue. She said South Asia, East Asia and the pacific experience most displacement in such contexts. All together, these regions at present have 8.6 million displaced people due to sudden-onset disasters mounting to 40% of the global total, and had new displacements in 2017. She mentioned that an estimated 46 million people were displaced in South Asia alone by sudden onset disasters during 2008 to 2013, though the actual number of people moving internally and across borders in South Asia is not known. \"It's anticipated that population movements in the context of disasters and climate change in South Asia, south East Asia and in the Indian Ocean rim are likely to increase over the next decades,\" Hasina apprehended. She said the challenges ahead are likely to be enormous, as a recent World Bank report -- titled \"Groundswell - Preparing for Internal Climate Migration\" -- projects that without concrete climate and development actions, in South Asia alone, more than 40 million people could be forced to move within their countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change. \"Bangladesh has been in the forefront in addressing coping mechanisms, in particular in agricultural sector. We've invented flood-resistant, salt- tolerant and drought- tolerant rice varieties.\" Collective good Replying to a question, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh military has been engaging with a lot of development activities as well as leading the disaster response in the country. They can also be engaged in early warning mechanisms. She said most of the UN members are engaged in the discourse of climate change in the multilateral fora. \"We need to keep the discussions and engagements up.\" Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable front line countries, she said, and added that her government has mainstreamed climate actions and disaster risks reduction in its national plan. \"We've investment of over 1% of our GDP to address climate change impacts. Moreover, $450 million has been allocated from our own sources for adoption and mitigation purposes.\" In 2012, Hasina recalled, she pledged in New York that Bangladesh will pursue a low-carbon development pathway as its commitment to \"collective good\" of tackling climate change. \"Our commitment to low carbon, climate resilient development is firm. We planned to move to 'carbon budgeting,' resilient industrialisation. We wish to decarbonise our manufacturing pathways.\" She said Bangladesh has installed around six million solar home systems, provided two million Improved Cooking Stoves among the poor, in spite of limitations the country allocated $385 million to the Bangladesh climate change trust fund for adaptation and mitigation. Director of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Hans Joachim chaired the panel discussion on Saturday, which was moderated by Chief Political Correspondent of Deutsche Welle Berlin Melinda Crane-Rohrs. Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs and International Trade of Kenya Monica Juma, Foreign Minister of Norway Ine Eriksen Soreide, US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Co-Executive Director of Greenpeace International Bunny McDiarmid were also present as panel discussants."

Cattle in Africa are regarded as ''lobola,'' or bride price, an index of social prestige and a custom very much alive in Africa, and the more cattle the better, without regard to condition or whether or not they produce milk. Which is why one sees herds of emaciated cattle in rural Africa.\nI had personal experience with this attitude in a semirural environment, where the family had good elementary education. The family, consisting of six children and one adult, had one milk-producing cow, and when a serious drought affected the region, I offered to send money beyond what I was sending for their own needs to keep the cow alive. This was refused, and the cow was sold for a paltry sum that would have bought milk powder for about two months.\nI don't know what the solution might be, but attitudes must first change before inroads can be made to alleviate Africa's mass, periodic famines.

Amidst protests by teachers and students, a \"torture cell\" reportedly used by Chhatra League has been found on RPI campus by an investigation committee. Allegations have also arisen that the leaders and activist of the ruling party student wing have established a reign of terror on campus through various criminal activists and misdeeds. Leaders and activists of Chhatra League's RPI unit beat dissenters in that torture cell on many occasions, several teachers and students on Sunday told the probe team formed by the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE). The three-member probe team on Sunday recovered metal rods and pipes from Room No 1119 of a building on campus during its visit. Torture instruments found inside the torture cell of Rajhsahi Polytechnic | Dhaka Tribune The building is situated on the west side of the pond into which Principal Farid Uddin Ahmed was thrown by some Chhatra League leaders and activists on Saturday. The recovered metal rods and pipes were later handed over to the police. Top leaders of Chhatra League's RPI unit and Rajshahi metropolitan unit were unavailable for comments regarding the torture cell until the filing of this report at midnight. DTE Director and probe team Convener SM Ferdous Alam said they would submit their findings within three days. He declined going into the details regarding the torture cell, but said: \"All of our findings will be in our probe report.\" Principal Farid said he also heard about the torture cell of Chhatra League. \"But no student or teacher ever lodged any formal complaint out of fear.\" The room in Rajshahi Polytechnic where the torture cell is situated | Dhaka Tribune Allegations Many have also accused Chhatra league leaders and activists of extorting students, threatening and assaulting teachers, publicly humiliating female students who rejected their advances, and sitting for exams without attending classes, among other misdeeds. The allegations were made during a demonstration of RPI students, teachers and staff on Sunday. They formed a human chain in front of RPI around 11am on Rajshahi-Naogaon Highway, placing a number of demands to the institute authorities. The demands include permanent expulsion of those involved in the assault on the principal, bringing them to book, ban on politics on campus, ban on outsiders' entry in RPI, ensuring safety of general students and suitable environment for education. Agitated students also tore down many banners of Chhatra League leaders and activists inside the campus during their hour-long demonstration. However, Chhatra League's RPI unit President Mehedi Hasan Regan rejected the allegations levelled against them, including embezzlement of money taken from around 4,000 students -- Tk300 each -- for a freshers' reception that was never organized. He claimed that the teachers and students were lying. \"We didn't embezzle that money. The department heads have the money meant for the freshers' reception,\" he claimed. Regan said he was not on campus when Principal Farid was assaulted. \"We saw in the CCTV camera footage [of the assault] that Chhatra League's [RPI unit] Joint General Secretary Kamal Hossain Sourav was present there only. \"No one else from Chhatra League was there. We are looking into this too and will take organizational action against anyone involved in this,\" he claimed further. Requesting anonymity, many students alleged that Regan and Sourav are very close and they have established a reign of terror on campus by getting involved in different criminal activists. But everyone has been afraid to raise their voice against them, until now. Chhatra League's central committee in Dhaka on Sunday also expelled Sourav from the organization over the assault on the principal and violation of organizational discipline. The organization's Rajshahi metropolitan unit President Rocky Kumar Ghosh also said that they formed a six-member committee to look into the incident. \"Organizational action will be taken against anyone involved.\" Case and arrests Principal Farid on Saturday night had filed a case at Chandrima police station, naming eight people and accusing at least 50 unidentified others over the assault. Rajshahi Metropolitan Police Additional Deputy Commissioner Golam Ruhul Kuddus said five RPI students were arrested and sent to court on Sunday for their involvement in the incident. They are Shafi Shahriar, 24, Sohel Rana, 20, Badhon Ray, 19, Ariful Islam, 23, and Ripon Ali, 20. However, police are yet to arrest the Chhatra League men who were named in the case. From the CCTV camera footage, RPI teachers had identified Sourav, Murad, Shanto, Bony, Hasibul Islam, Salman Tony, Habibul and Maruf. Of them, only Sourav and Murad are current students. All of them have gone into hiding, said ADC Kuddus. \"But our detectives are on the case. No one will be spared. We are working to bring all of them to book.\""

The other reasons include malfunction of railway engines, passengers jumping recklessly from the train, breaking of rail lines, disruption of telephone systems, derailment and destructive activities on the train, disruption of rail movement due to excessive flood and head-on collision of trains, among others. The Railways Minister said this in reply to a query from Workers Party MP Lutfun Nesa Khan.  In his response, the minister said the government has taken various initiatives so that respective officials and railway staff carry out their responsibilities more consciously. \"Besides, actions are being taken against the responsible staff for their involvement in train accident,\" the minister also said. In reply to a query from ruling Awami League MP M Abdul Latif, the Railways Minister said a deal was signed with a consultation firm in 2018 for completion of the feasibility study and detailed design of the construction of Dhaka-Chattogram high-speed rail track. \"Progress of the project is 62 per cent as of December 2019,\" added the minister. In reply to a query from Jatiya Party MP Mujibul Haque, the Railways Minister said a total of 230 projects were included in the 30 year-long updated master plan (2016-2045) for Railways for implementation at a cost of Tk 5,53,662 crore."

Resident Editor of The Statesman, Delhi, Kuldip Nayar, who had an 80-minute interview with Bangabandhu in Dhaka, says in despatch that Bangabandhu would not comment on India holding talks with Pakistan because it is an independent  country and thus free to have a dialogue with anyone it wishes. The report says that the point Bangabandhu made repeatedly, at times in a raised voice, was that Bangladesh is an independent country without any string pulled from outside. He further said that Pakistan held that Bangladesh was dependent on New Delhi's wishes and that the surrender of Pakistan Army before the joint command of Indian and Muktibahini forces was a fiction. Bangabandhu said, \"It is not fiction but a hard fact.\" He said that he knew that Bhutto wanted to exchange the PoWs with the Bangalees in Pakistan. Soldiers were never exchanged with civilians, \"I am willing to exchange the Biharis in Bangladesh with the Bangalees in Pakistan,\" the Bangladesh Prime Minister added.

Hundreds, among the 10,000 permanent workers and 50,000 temporary workers, demonstrated with a sit-in protest on Tuesday at their respective tea fields, demanding protective gear for work, said Raju Goala, president of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union in Sylhet. Answering a query, he told Dhaka Tribune that the workers are prepared to work as per the premier's directives if Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is provided to them with their salary for the last five days, when they abstained from work. He added that they will go for a large movement if the demands are not fulfilled. Sylhet Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Abul Kalam Azad said Tk12 lakh and 521 tons of rice have so far been allocated for marginal communities in the district to fight the coronavirus crisis so far. However, the allocated resources were not for the district's tea workers. \"Over video conference on Tuesday, the premier instructed to keep all tea gardens of the country operational,\" added the ADC. The tea worker's leader Raju Goala, said: \"People in other occupations in the country are in quarantine, but there were no clear guidelines for tea workers. To avoid risk of virus transmission, workers are abstaining from work. \"Although poor people in the district are receiving government support, none is allocated for tea workers.  \"Most of the workers are hired on a temporary basis. They routinely work at places other than the gardens. They could not work at these other places due to the virus outbreak and the authorities do not have any specific guidelines regarding how workers will not starve, but yet be safe,\" added Raju. In Habiganj, hundreds of tea workers demonstrated in Chunarughat upazila demanding government relief.  During a three hour protest in front of the upazila parishad until 12pm yesterday, they chanted 'Du Mutho Bhat De (give us two fistfuls of rice) as a slogan. Tea worker Koilash Munda said: \"We will die of starvation before catching coronavirus. No one has come to our aid so far.\" Nipen Paul, joint secretary of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union central committee, said: \"Tea workers were not given leave. We asked workers of some of the gardens to abstain from work. We couldn't arrange government allocations for workers by contacting the upazila administrations. I have heard that workers protested for food in Habiganj.\" Debashish Das, manager of Deundi Tea Garden in the upazila, said: \"We haven't received any instruction from the authorities to allow leave for the tea workers and we haven't put pressure on them to come to work either.\" He added that no worker from his tea garden received any government relief. Chunarughat Upazila Nirbahi Officer Shattyajit Roy couldn't be reached for comment over phone."

The erosion of the river bank began on last Thursday, causing suspension of vehicle movement on Koterkuna-Hazipur road for one week, reports our Moulvibazar correspondent. Local people fear that the embankment may collapse any moment as a crack in it keeps widening. Earlier, the river damaged the embankment in the first week of last month. According to local sources, the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) repaired the crack with wooden pillars and sand sack structures in an attempt to curb damage from the escalating erosion, but the repair works failed to contain the river and were washed away in last few days. Ali Hosain, a resident of Koterkuna village, said that due to heavy rains for the last one month the flood control embankment at Koterkuna area got damaged twice. Persistent rains and water from the upstream hills have turned the river dangerous, he said. \"I have two acres of land near the embankment and I run my family with the income from selling the crops. I won't be able to maintain our livelihood if the embankment collapses,\" said Sadhon Das, a resident of Monu village. Abdus Salek, a farmer of the same village, said erosion also hit the embankment last year and villagers contained the damage by erecting corrugated iron fences and dumping sand bags. The locals also demanded alternative road for the 30 villages as vehicles movement on the Hazipur-Koterkuna road get suspended every time the embankment is damaged, This important embankment has been facing erosion threat due to mindless sand lifting by a section of local influential people, locals alleged. \"How can we celebrate Eid when we are tensed if the embankment collapses again? If it will collapse in Eid time then we will lose all our assets and crops,\" said Nargis Banu, a resident of Monu village. Hazipur Union Parishad Chairman Abdul Bachhit Bacchu said the 30 villages near the embankment and the Koterkuna market will not survive if action is not taken immediately. \"We have marked 67 points in the Sadar, Kulaura, and Rajnagar upazilas which are at risk due to river erosion,\" BWDB Executive Engineer Ranendra Shankar Chakrabarti said \"A Tk 1,000 crore development project will soon be proposed to build permanent boundaries around the river embankments which will contain the river waters in the rainy season,\" he added."

      "text": "Rise in Hunger Seen As World's Harvests Fall and Costs Soar\n1989-04-05T05:00:00.000Z\nAfter two years of poor harvests worldwide, poor countries will experience increased hunger and starvation as their bill for imported food soars by more than $5 billion this year, the top United Nations agriculture official says.\nCalling the global food situation ''a cause for serious concern,'' Edouard Saouma, director of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said Monday that an expected rise in world grain production this year would be insufficient to rebuild stocks and bring output back in line with consumption.\nAnother bad harvest in the United States or any other major grain-producing region of the world would have ''very serious implications for world food security,'' Mr. Saouma told the Committee on World Food Security, which monitors global food supplies and is meeting here this week.\nThe agriculture organization's latest confidential report on food shortages this year lists 15 countries as requiring ''exceptional or emergency assistance.'' The 15 are Angola, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Haiti, Jamaica, Laos, Lebanon, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Peru, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, the Sudan and Vietnam.\nIn the Sudan, for example, the report predicts ''serious food supply difficulties.'' in the drought- and war-ravaged southern region unless emergency assistance ''is made available immediately.''\nImportant factors in declining grain production in the northern countries are the severe drought in North America last year as well as policy measures in the United States and Europe meant to curb surplus production. But in addition, many agricultural experts, citing the shortage of spare arable land in many parts of Asia and Africa, warn that some poor countries may be reaching limits of production.\nThe decline in production has meant a sharp fall in grain stocks, to about 16 percent of annual consumption, their lowest level since the early 1970's, and a rise of 40 to 50 percent in prices, Mr. Saouma said.\nA fall in global grain stocks below 17 percent of annual consumption leaves the world vulnerable to a food crisis if harvests fail again and invariably trigger a sharp rise in grain prices, the agriculture organization says. Higher world grain prices will mean better returns for the world's major grain-exporting countries, which include the United States, Canada, Western Europe and Australia.\nMr. Saouma stressed that while the richer industrialized countries can weather the current price rise, poor countries will need to raise spending on imported food from $12.3 billion in 1988 to $17.6 billion this year just to maintain the same, often indequate level of nutrition.\n''The increase in import costs will further worsen the balance of payments position of many of the low-income, food-deficit countries, which are already suffering from mounting external debt and adverse terms of trade,'' Mr. Saouma said. Less Famine Aid\nMoreover, the increase in the food costs for poor countries comes at a time when the quantity of free food that industrialized countries will provide for famine relief is expected to fall by about a quarter. This is because the donors generally budget cash sums for food assistance, and these buy less when grain prices rise.\nThe amount of free food Western industrialized countries will donate for famine relief in poor countries this year is likely to fall from the roughly 13.2 million tons they gave in 1988 to about 9.7 million tons, officials of the organization say.\nAs a result, officials say, some poor countries may be unable to maintain even last year's nutritional levels.\n''Over 500 million people are undernourished today and this is going to get worse,'' said James Ingram, head of the World Food Program, an agency affiliated with the agriculture organization that distributes food aid.\nIn a new effort to help the world's growing numbers of poor and hungry, agriculture ministers from 36 developed and developing countries, including the United States, will meet in Cairo on May 22 to consider a new action plan prepared by the World Food Council, a body set up within the organization in 1974 to review world agricultural policies.\nThe meeting will bring together ministers from countries representing 68 percent of the world's population and 75 percent of its wealth.\n''We've spent enough time analyzing hunger,'' said Gerald Trant, the World Food Council's director. ''The time has come to act.''\nIn its latest survey of world grain markets prepared for this week's meeting, the agriculture organization forecasts that total production of wheat and coarse grains like sorghum and corn will rise to 1.4 billion tons this year after dropping from 1.33 billion tons in 1987 to 1.25 billion tons last year.\nBut since the global rice harvest is unlikely to be much higher than last year's record, the organization believes that total world grain production will increase by about 150 million tons this year, or less than the 200 million tons it says is needed to rebuild stocks and bring output back into line with consumption trends."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-07 00:00:00      \nBamboo chicken is generally eaten with rice, and bread made of wheat flour Hilly district Rangamati, home to a large number of indigenous peoples, has been known for sometime now for its captivating natural beauty and exceptional life style. Now the district is becoming quite popular for Bamboo Chicken, a rich and healthy dish native to the region. The mouth watering dish is traditionally known as Huro Chumo (Chakma dialect) to the indigenous people of the area. Now it has turned the heads of many people in and outside Rangamati for its unique taste and flavour.  What one needs to cook Bamboo Chicken To prepare this delicious dish one needs one or half a kg medium sized chicken(sliced), onion, ginger, garlic, and green chilli paste. Add turmeric, cumin seed,  coriander powder with oil and salt  to your taste. You also need banana leaves. Finally, the most important thing. You need to cook all this in a hollow and sturdy fresh bamboo stem, large enough to hold all of the above.  Hence the name Bamboo Chicken.  Cooking the dish  First, one needs to mix the chicken and spices with oil and salt to taste. Then all this is put into the bamboo pipe and the mouth of the bamboo pipe needs to be closed securely with banana leaves. Next, the now full bamboo pipe is cooked in an open charcoal oven. Every few minutes, the pipe needs to be turned so the chicken is tender and cooked evenly. Finally, when the green bamboo stem turns white, the dish is finally cooked, says chef Debobrota in Rangamati.

      "text": "Bangladeshi - and Proud\n1988-11-17T05:00:00.000Z\nIt is not easy being a Bangladeshi these days. While our country is going under - literally and figuratively - the international community has responded with generous aid as well as a strong dose of cynicism and sarcasm. Ever since Henry Kissinger dehumanized Bangladesh by labeling it ''an international basket case,'' Bangladesh has been the butt of many cruel jokes.\nWe have been accused of behaving as though the world owes us a living. When cyclones lash out at our seacoast, killing thousands, it is because of our ''fatalistic attitude.'' I have heard Bangladesh blasted as the ''most backward country on earth.'' I have seen it kicked around as ''Bang-the-dish'' in satirical cartoons.\nYet, not so long ago, Bangladesh was the breadbasket of the region. In pre-industrial days, our prosperity earned us the name ''Golden Bengal.'' Every inch of land was cultivated for two and three crops each year. Life was so easy that neighboring Indians settled in droves on this fertile plain. Everyone stayed put, with the result that now 100 million people are jammed into an area the size of Wisconsin.\nThe massive deforestation and the construction of numerous river dams in India and Nepal has a lot to do with the recent floods in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a delta through which the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent discharges its water to the sea.\nDuring the monsoon rains, some flooding is inevitable and is actually beneficial for the paddy fields. But when combined with an overflow from dams, the rivers - which have not been dredged recently because of the prohibitive cost - cannot discharge the water to the sea fast enough. Consequently, the water backs up, submerging a very flat, sea level country. Our neighbors, who consistently refuse to discuss a solution to our flood problem, share some moral responsibility for our misery.\nWe Bangladeshis are a proud people, famous for our poetry, songs and cuisine - maybe the best in the world. We may be poor, but we are not backward.\nThe civil war with Pakistan in 1971 completely destroyed our land's infrastructure. It took a monumental effort to get the country back on its feet. The hot, humid climate is not conducive to heavy, prolonged physical labor. Saddled with the burden of feeding millions, our development plans have to be scrapped regularly because of catastrophes like this year's.\nBut our population control plan is in place and births are decreasing. Given a stable, representative political system - already within reach -and a few flood-free years, our genius will make us rebound.\nThe land that produced literary giants like Rabindranath Tagore, the first Asian to win the Nobel Prize, and poet laureate Kazi Nazrul Islam, will not stay down for long.\nIn the meantime, as we fight to save our people from disease and starvation, we ask the international community to be helpful and understanding - and not to indulge in ridicule and pontification."

(Schocken, Cloth, $25; Paper, $16.95.) The greater a suffering, and the better known its historical context, the more likely people are to be shattered by visual and literary testimonies, to consider them as sacrosanct and to turn them into a myth. Today, the Holocaust is being transformed into a legend, and documents from the concentration and extermination camps are collected and increasingly treasured. There is nothing wrong with this, as long as one realizes that the need to bear witness does not guarantee the adequacy of the testimony, and that drawings or paintings, in themselves meaningless, may be imbued with meaning by the mere fact that they were executed by the victims of the Holocaust. Alfred Kantor's drawings of the Holocaust do not convince. Although one admires this Czechoslovak Jew, who throughout his imprisonment in several concentration camps sketched the annihilation factories and after his liberation re-created his experiences in a series of watercolors, one turns over the pages of his ''Journal of the Holocaust'' with disappointment. Trained as a commercial artist, Mr. Kantor possessed a modest skill of neat representation that worked against him. His pedantic contours, schematic figures and naturalistically applied colors outline the horror without capturing it."

Locals are worried about the case filed against 70 unnamed individualsye Mostafa Kamal of Ichachhara village in Matiranga, said locals are tense about the matter. \"We have no idea how and when we face harassment.\" Another local, Hanif Miah, said the BGB dispute was between deceased Shahab Miah and Mofiz Miah's relatives. \"There was no involvement of the villagers. BGB is doing this [filing case] to harass locals.\" Meanwhile, Bangladesh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Md Javed Patwari visiting Khagrachhari on Thursday, asked the public to trust the police. \"Cases have been filed and an investigation will be launched,\" he said. \"The perpetrators will be brought to justice through proper investigation no matter which party filed the case,\" the IGP said, afte ran inauguration program of the Police Officers' Mess.

The deceased are BGB Palashpur zone soldier Md Shaon, villagers Shahab Miah and his sons Ahmed Ali and Ali Akbar, and Mofiz Miah. According to witnesses, Ahmed Ali was carrying timber cut down for power lines in a trolley around 11.30 am on Thursday, when a BGB patrol team stopped and questioned him. This led to an altercation between the villagers and BGB. At one point, the BGB started firing their guns, killing Shaon, Shahab, Ahmed, and Akbar on the spot, while bullet-stricken Mofiz died on his way to the hospital. The BGB, in a press statement issued the same day, claimed that the villagers had surrounded a BGB patrol team when they tried to stop timber trafficking, prompting the border troops to fire a blank round. They also claimed that the villagers snatched weapons from the BGB men and started firing indiscriminately, killing five. However, locals who witnessed the incident rejected all such claims. BGB said Mofiz Miah killed Shaon while locals claim that he was killed by another BGB personnel for protesting the incident.

      "text": "A Far-Flung Corporate Empire\n1989-07-12T05:00:00.000Z\nB.A.T. Industries, the target of Sir James Goldsmith's $21 billion takeover bid, is one of the most far-flung international corporations, selling insurance in Australia and the United States, producing paper pulp in India and Portugal, and processing tobacco in Zimbabwe and Zaire. Its shares, which are traded in New York as well as London, are widely held by individuals and institutions that specialize in assembling global portfolios.\nAlthough B.A.T. itself is not a household name in the United States, many of its subsidiaries and their products are. The company sells Kool and Barclay cigarettes, owns the Marshall Field's and Saks Fifth Avenue department store chains and offers insurance policies through the Farmers Group. It also produces NCR Paper and other carbonless paper products and has a 40 percent stake in Imasco, the Canadian consumer products company that owns the Hardee's fast-food chain and Peoples Drug Stores. Little Fat at Headquarters\nSuch diversity is what attracted the attention of Sir James and his partners, who describe the London-based company as a conglomerate whose parts are worth more than the whole. Analysts agree that the company has many highly independent operating units that could readily be sold to pay the debt Sir James would pile up in the proposed acquisition, but they also say that B.A.T. has a lean corporate structure from which little fat could be cut.\nThe company employs only 100 people at its London headquarters and another 100 at the Louisville, Ky., headquarters of Batus Inc., its holding company for United States subsidiaries. That might limit the profits to be gained in breaking up B.A.T.\n''B.A.T.'s managers are excellent, and it is unlikely that Sir James could find anyone better,'' said Roy D. Burry, who follows the company for Kidder, Peabody & Company in New York.\nMany analysts count the most likely casualty in any takeover, Patrick Sheehy, B.A.T.'s chairman, as one of the company's chief assets. A veteran of the British Army who fought his way up the corporate ladder through appointments in Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia and the Caribbean, Mr. Sheehy has a record that analysts say demonstrates both toughness and competence.\n''He has got his hands on the helm, and we think he knows where he wants to go,'' said Paul Himmelheber, vice president of Himelheber Investment Research, a Philadelphia stock research firm. Highly Decentralized Structure\nUnder Mr. Sheehy, B.A.T. has evolved a highly decentralized structure, emphasizing four main business lines: tobacco, insurance, paper and retailing. Operations within these businesses are run independently enough that dismemberment could be relatively easy. ''It's not just the big four pieces,'' Mr. Burry said. ''There are pieces within the pieces you can break off.''\nB.A.T. started out as the British-American Tobacco Company, which was created in 1902 by an agreement among international tobacco barons to divide the world market. James Buchanan Duke, founder of the American Trust Company, agreed with the Imperial Tobacco Company, which had a near monopoly in the British market, that each concern would sell tobacco products only in its home country. British-American Tobacco, with the Duke family as its majority shareholder, was created to sell cigarettes throughout Britain's colonies and protectorates.\nDespite aggressive diversification efforts, the cigarette business still accounts for two-fifths of B.A.T.'s sales and nearly half its profits. B.A.T. owns the Louisville-based Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, the nation's third-largest tobacco company and the maker of such cigarette brands as Capri, Kool, Barclay, Viceroy and Raleigh. B.A.T. also has full or majority ownership of tobacco companies in 38 countries, ranging from Switzerland and the Netherlands to Nicaragua, Suriname and Bangladesh. A Shade Smaller Than Texaco\nWith $31 billion in sales and $1.7 billion in pretax profits last year, B.A.T. is only a shade smaller than Texaco Inc. or the Du Pont Company. Only nine American industrial concerns are larger.\nThe company's diversification campaign began in earnest during the 1970's, when B.A.T. began using the huge cash flow from its tobacco operations to buy retailing and paper-making companies. The results from these acquisitions were decidedly mixed, analysts say.\nThe subsidiaries that have given B.A.T. the most trouble have been retailers. It sold three of its department store chains - Kohl's, Crescent and Frederick & Nelson - in 1986. The company also failed in its efforts to rebuild Gimbels, which was dismantled in a series of asset sales. About 5,000 employees were thrown out of work by the moves. Shift to Insurance in 1982\nMarshall Field's and Saks, which showed poor fashion judgment in the mid-1980's, were also disappointments. But with help from B.A.T. to invest in sprucing up their stores, both chains are now doing well, Mr. Burry said.\nMr. Sheehy shifted diversification targets after taking over in 1982, replacing retailers with insurance companies. B.A.T. paid $1.4 billion in January 1984 for Eagle Star Holdings P.L.C., a leading British company with strong sales of life insurance policies, after Eagle Star became the target of a hostile bid from Allianz Versicherungs A.G. Germany's largest insurer. Last December, Batus, which accounted for 30 percent of B.A.T.'s sales last year, completed a $5.2 billion hostile takeover of Farmers Group Inc., a Los Angeles-based company that is the third-largest home and auto insurer in the United States.\nBoth acquisitions have generally done well under B.A.T.'s management, analysts say, with B.A.T. successfully retaining the senior Farmers management that has made the company among the more profitable in the industry. Eagle Star has had poor results only in the United States. Loss on Eagle Star Unit\nB.A.T. disposed of Eagle Star of America in late 1986 for $34.5 million, after pouring in nearly $39 million to shore up the subsidiary's inadequate reserves.\nIn testimony last year at California Insurance Department hearings into the Farmers acquisition, a senior B.A.T. official blamed bad management in the early 1980's for Eagle Star of America's poor performance.\nThe spectacle of B.A.T. as a takeover target provoked comments yesterday that the poacher of companies was in danger of being poached itself. But with the exception of a bitter eight-month battle last year to take control of Farmers Group, B.A.T. has pursued almost exclusively friendly takeover bids."

The minister's original plans were to travel by rail, but the prevailing conditions forced the change. Railways Minister Nurul Islam Sujon was set to visit a stretch of the rail tracks along the Kurigram-Teesta route after a bridge near Tagraihat rail station partially sank into the soil after a flood in 2017. Kurigram Deputy Commissioner Sultana Parveen confirmed the visit. While Kurigram has experienced great strides in development under the Awami League government over the past 10 years, the negligence in the rail sector has caused consternation among locals. According to sources at the Kurigram rail station, only one train operates in the district under two separate names. Due to the shortage of trains and the poor state of tracks, commuting has become a tedious endeavour for locals. A 33km route takes nearly two hours by train now, a staggering example of the breakdown in infrastructure. The dependence on rail is mostly because of the low cost. The bus fare from Kurigram to Rangpur is Tk80, while it costs only Tk15 by rail. Hence, countless people from low-income groups opt for the train despite its many deficiencies. The local railway officials are also concerned about operating on the hazardous route, fully aware than an accident could befall any day. Advocate Pradip Kumar Roy, spokesperson of a Kurigram-based concerned citizens' group, said the people demand extensive overhaul of railway infrastructure and introduction of an intercity train between Chilmari and Dhaka popularly referred to as \"Bhawaiya Express.\""

The awards are administered by the Magsaysay Foundation in Manila, created for this purpose by the New York-based Rockefeller Fund.\nEach recipient receives $20,000 and is to be honored at an awards ceremony in the fall in Bangkok, Thailand. Other Winners\nAmong the other winners was Dato Haji Hanafiah bin Haji Ahman, a Malaysian Government official, who was honored for helping to ease the hardships of the country's devout Moslems undertaking pilgrimages to Mecca.\nAnother winner, Hans Bague Jassin, director of Indonesia's Center for Literacy Documentation, received a Magsaysay award for public service, and Diane Ying, a Taiwanese editor and publisher of a business weekly, Commonwealth, received a prize in journalism. Dr. Aree Valyasevi, professor of pediatrics and director of the Institute of Nutrition at Mahidol University in Thailand, received a prize for community leadership.\nFather Timm, who is 64 years old, was born in Michigan City, Ind. He left the United States in 1952 to teach science at St. Gregory's College in East Pakistan, which became part of independent Bangladesh in 1971. Emergency Assistance\nAfter the country was devastated by a cyclone and floods that took 300,000 lives in November 1970, he gave up teaching to devote himself to emergency assistance for the disaster victims, mobilizing relief and rehabilitation activities.\nLater, he became involved in long-term rural development. He also undertook efforts to reduce communal tensions.\n''I have more hope in changed people than in changed structures and political systems,'' he said of his decision to devote his energies to improving life for the people of Bangladesh.\nIn 1974, he succeeded in inducing 130 relief agencies in the country to work together as the Association of Development Agencies. Last year, he helped establish the Coordinating Council for Human Rights in Bangladesh."

In Noakhali, a Chhatra League leader died of bullet wounds,  injured in an ambush by suspected Islami Chhatra Shibir activists at Palwaner Pool market in Begumganj upazila. The deceased Rakib Hossain was a joint secretary of Chhatra League's Amanullapur union unit. He died under treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). Police conducted a drive on Sunday night shortly after the incident and detained four people, said Begumganj police station OC Harun-Or-Rashid Chowdhury. The detained Faruk Ahmmad, 42, Masud Alam, 30,  Akram Hossain, 24, and Ibrahim, 30, were produced in court on Monday afternoon.  Police are trying to arrest the others involved and a case will be filed soon, said OC Harun. \"Some Chhatra League men were staying at a tea stall when Shibir activists shot and hacked at them indiscriminately. Rakib and Habib were transferred to hospitals in Dhaka when their condition deteriorated after the incident. Rakib had to undergo surgery as bullets penetrated his kidney, liver, and stomach. Habib is currently receiving treatment at a private hospital in Dhaka,\" said Union Parishad Chairman Arifur Rahman, also president of Awami League's Amanullahpur unit.  Three other Chhatra League members were also injured, hacked with sharp weapons. In Khulna, another injured Chhatra League leader died after being severely beaten by a rival group over establishing supremacy.  The deceased Hadiuzzaman Russel, 28, was general secretary of Chhatra League's Koyra Upazila unit. Koyra police station OC Robiul Islam said: \"A dispute arose between Russel and his cousins on Sunday afternoon, over the positioning of an under construction bridge across Batikata canal. Russel was mercilessly beaten by his cousins following the altercation. The incident left him seriously injured.\" Russel succumbed to his injuries on the way to Dhaka while being transferred from Khulna Medical College Hospital, added the OC. Locals said there was a long standing feud between Russel and his cousins over establishing supremacy in the area."

The three restaurants were Bailey Bar B Q, Dhaka Biriyani, and Rooster Cafe. The quasi-judicial government department also fined Vaggokul Sweets for unclean and expired food items, and S Baker for not labeling their packaged products.  Bailey Bar B Q, Vaggokul Sweets, and S Baker, were fined Tk 50,000 each, while Dhaka Biriyani was fined Tk 30,000 and Rooster Cafe, Tk 20,000. Md Adbul Jabbar Mondol, assistant director of the Directorate of National Consumers' Right Protection, said if they continue to run their businesses in this way, the authorities concerned would cancel their trade licenses.    \"We are keeping them under pressure. If there is any lapse, our team will visit and take necessary action,\" he said.    The Directorate of National Consumers' Rights Protection team also identified expired tomato sauces and other condiments at Vaggokul Sweets. The popular store did not put any price tags for the sweets they were selling. It also stored some sweets in a very unclean bucket.  The staff and employees of Bailey Bar B Q kitchen were working in an unhygienic and congested atmosphere. The authorities found grilled chicken and kebabs being kept overnight on the kitchen countertop.  Dhaka Biriyani stored almost rotten vegetables and stale dough at their restaurant.  The National Consumers' Right Protection team raided BFC and Chittagong General Store in the Bailey Road neighbourhood and found their services and products to be satisfactory.  Sabiha Zaman Shobha, a customer who heading towards BFC, said the average consumer is frustrated with these restaurants and their services, and demanded exemplary punishment against restaurant owners responsible for not living up to maintaining standard operating procedures."

The reason being given is that no other suitable land has been found to build the complex. Locals are against the idea for the reason that these lands remain submerged during the rainy season and the forest in the area has trees that are over a hundred years old. If the ministry of land leased the area for the proposed construction, it would require land filling and the decimation of some 5,000 trees. While there is a need for the police administration to build the necessary infrastructure to train police personnel, developing this particular spot for an academy complex would threaten the forest cover and disturb the ecological balance that the forest provides. On top of that, the land in question is flood-prone and would require significant expenditure in land filling and dredging to protect it from future inundation. It is understood that the prison authorities have already marked some 800 trees for felling to make way for the construction of the complex, and people of the locality fear that it will mean irrecoverable damage to the forest with its ancient trees. A visit to the area has found that the authorities have set up several signboards on the flood control embankment of the area, declaring the proposed site of the academy.  Precious forest areas need to be conserved, not decimated. Forest land should not be leased to any party, even if it is for public construction, because it sets the precedence for private entities to follow suit. We hope that an alternative site would be found for the academy that does not disturb the environment or the ecological balance of the area."

At least 38 people have so far been rescued from the rubble of the 80-room Xinjia hotel in coastal Quanzhou city, said the local government. Footage circulating on microblogging platform Weibo showed rescue workers combing through the building's wreckage in the dark and reassuring a woman trapped under heavy debris as other wounded victims were carried into ambulances. The hotel's facade appeared to have crumbled into the ground, exposing the building's steel frame, and a crowd had gathered around the area as the evening wore on. Officials have yet to confirm whether anyone died in the accident. Quanzhou authorities said over 700 rescue workers had been deployed to the scene along with ambulances, excavators and cranes.  Representatives from Beijing are also en route to Quanzhou to assist in relief efforts, Xinhua news agency reported. Quanzhou has recorded 47 cases of the COVID-19 infection and the hotel, which opened just two years ago, was recently repurposed to house people who had been in recent contact with confirmed patients, the People's Daily state newspaper reported. China is no stranger to building collapses and deadly construction accidents, which are typically blamed on the country's rapid growth leading to corner-cutting by builders and the widespread flouting of safety rules. At least 20 people died in 2016 when a series of crudely-constructed multi-storey buildings packed with migrant workers collapsed in the eastern city of Wenzhou. Another 10 were killed last year in Shanghai after the collapse of a commercial building during renovations."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-22 00:00:00      \nThe government is considering shelving its plan to shift one lakh Rohingyas to remote Bhashan Char following persistent objections from international aid agencies to the relocation. \"We are seriously thinking of shelving the relocation plan because the international organisations have not agreed to it,\" Md Enamur Rahman, state minister for disaster management and relief, told The Daily Star on Wednesday. Without cooperation from those organisations, the government would face difficulties in arranging food, healthcare and other necessary items for one lakh people on Bhashan Char, he said. UN and aid agencies say the island is isolated, flood-prone and would be hazardous for the Rohingyas because of cyclones and tidal surges. The government has already built 120 cluster villages on the 40sqkm island under a Tk 2,312 crore housing project for accommodating one lakh of the nearly 1 million Rohingyas sheltered in cramped camps in Cox's Bazar. Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen, Enamur and officials concerned visited the project site on the island, in Noakhali's Hatiya upazila, around 37 miles off the coast of Bay of Bengal, on February 13. Meanwhile, Momen on Sunday said if the Rohingyas were shifted to Bhashan Char, they might not agree to leave the place in future. \"We want the Rohingyas to go back to Rakhine. We want to repatriate them. That's our priority,\" he told reporters at his ministry office. The housing project, funded with public money, was taken after some 750,000 Rohingyas fled a brutal military campaign in Myanmar's Rakhine and took shelter in Cox's Bazar since August 2017. They joined some 300,000 other Rohingyas, who had fled previous waves of violence in Rakhine. Disaster management ministry officials said destruction of forest and hills and risk of landslides in Cox's Bazar prompted the authorities to choose the temporary housing site on Bhashan Char. They said the project implemented by Bangladesh Navy has 120 cluster villages that are capable of accommodating one lakh Rohingyas. The houses have been built four feet above the ground with concrete blocks. The entire housing site is protected by a 13-km-long flood embankment. There are also 120 cyclone shelters, which are planned to be used as schools, medical centres and community centres. The officials also said there are large swathes of land that could be used for livestock and fish farming if the Rohingyas were relocated there. The refugees in the Cox's Bazar camps have a very little work to do now. UN and several international aid agencies have been opposing the relocation plan from the beginning. Human Rights Watch too said the island is not sustainable for human habitation and could be seriously affected by rising sea levels and storm surges. In October last year, Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) Mahbub Alam Talukder said some 6,000 to 7,000 refugees had expressed their willingness to be relocated to Bhashan Char. UN agencies then decided to send a technical mission to the island. They intended to look at the risks of natural disasters, water supply, access to basic services, including health and education, and the freedom of movement within Bhashan Char and to and from the mainland, a UN official said. Later, the government set a condition that there should be terms of reference for the UN technical mission. Since then, there has been no visible progress on the matter. Now, ministers and officials concerned say they are considering not to relocate the Rohingyas to Bhashan Char and that they are thinking of an alternative plan. Requesting anonymity, an official said different relevant ministries reached an informal agreement on shelving the plan to relocate the Rohingyas to the remote island, but the final decision would be taken by the Prime Minister's Office. \"Bangladesh earned so much praises for sheltering the Rohingyas. It should not have a bad reputation now by executing the relocation plan, going against the will of the Rohingyas and the international aid agencies,\" the official said. Asked about the future of the housing project if the government changes the relocation plan, Foreign Minister Momen said they were yet to decide on it. He, however, thinks homeless people from other parts of the country could be accommodated on the island. The government maintains the island is safe for human habitation. Bhashan Char is only 25 kilometres from Sandwip, another island in Chattogram, he said, adding, \"With the fast siltation rate, Sandwip and Bhashan Char can get connected in the near future. Eventually, we will have a huge landmass. We can do a lot of things.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-29 00:00:00      \nThe boom of export-oriented garment business created jobs for millions of mostly young female workers in Bangladesh, many of who moved from rural areas to urban centres like Dhaka. This created unique and important health and safety issues for these working women--some are typical with women of reproductive age such as maternal and reproductive health whereas some are work-related such as back-pain, machinery injuries, and exposure to particulate matters. Yet, one more issue that has been largely unknown or ignored is their daily exposure to traumatic events. According to a recently published research conducted by a University of Texas Health Science Center Medical and Public Health students and led by this author, garment workers in Bangladesh are found to be highly prone to traumatic events in their daily life. Out of the women they surveyed, three most commonly reported events they experienced in life are natural disasters (71.83 percent), fire/explosions (43.33 percent) and exposure to sudden accidental death (30.15 percent). Contact with such exposures may have short- and long-term impacts on their life, health and wellbeing. The findings may be considered not that unusual for people in general of low socioeconomic status living in a developing country. Bangladesh geographically is prone to natural disasters such as flood where many low-lying regions including some parts of the capital go underwater almost annually and living arrangements of these workers in poor neighbourhoods are not by any means resistant to rain and flood. It is more than likely that these workers are living in makeshift slums or informal-housing facilities which do not follow building codes. Also, the streets of Dhaka and other major cities get clogged with water very quickly and easily after any heavy rainfall. The cities in Bangladesh are overcrowded and its basic infrastructure is very fragile and weak. When their houses get flooded and streets go underwater, garment workers face challenges to live and commute to work. With all the recent and highly visible efforts by western retailers, to get the Bangladesh government and factory owners to improve workplace health and safety, about half of these workers (43.33 percent) are still reporting experiencing a fire/explosion incident. This is unusually high though the survey did not ask if these were encountered at the workplace or their homes or somewhere else, nor asked about its seriousness. If these occurred at home, this finding again highlights the vulnerability of living conditions of these workers in informal and unsafe housing arrangements. In fact, it is surprising that with such high rates of exposure to risk, more workers are not actually sustaining severe burns from such incidents. Witnessing or experiencing sudden violent death (17.89 percent), accidental death (30.15 percent) and serious accidents (14.33 percent) were reported by many of these workers. These findings show the extreme uncertainty associated with a garment worker's life who is so frequently encountering or witnessing these very sad and unfortunate events. Some of these events are likely referring to transportation related accidents that they encounter in their commuting to and from factories or when they visit their family members in rural areas or other parts of the city. The safety of transportation in this country is notoriously bad. Other events may be associated with overall law and order situation. Garments workers, because of their increased use of transportation and interaction with other/outside people, may be encountering more of these adverse events compared to stay at home women. Encountering so many sad and stressful life events create mental stress for garments workers who may develop short- or long-term episodes of depression, anxiety or prolonged period of grief in life. Given all these adversities going on in their personal and social life, the highly demanding and strenuous garments factory work may add to their existing miseries. Providing social protection for these workers is an obligation for the government, factory owners, western retailers and buyers. While the country's economy is heavily dependent on their labour, garments workers are living in deplorable conditions with respect to their physical safety, living arrangements and commuting. The stakeholders can think beyond building and fire safety at the factories and act in a more socially responsible and holistic way to advance the non-work determinants of health and safety of these workers. Raising minimum wage is a very laudable first step. However, instead of only increasing their income, these workers have a lot of other needs as identified and reported here and earlier by many research studies and newspapers reports. Given their age bracket, providing them subsidised and safe rental accommodation close to the factory or in a decent neighbourhood may be more of what they need which can somewhat protect them from many of these unwanted traumatic daily events. Creating specific housing complexes for garments workers in certain areas of Dhaka and its vicinity, factory provided transportation options for these workers, providing discounted grocery vouchers, giving them access to preventative care at factory-run-clinics can be meaningful undertakings by the stakeholders. These may greatly help improve the safety, heath, quality of life and wellbeing of this large economically active workforce. Garments workers of Bangladesh do not need to live in constant fear and anxiety.   A different version of this article was published previously in the International Journal of Social Psychiatry.

      "text": "A Bank Battles Poverty\n1987-07-12T05:00:00.000Z\nRABEA stepped out of her dirt-floored house, stamped one bare foot on the ground and snapped a smart salute. Rabea is so poor that she cannot offer a visitor a chair or protect her children from rain leaking though her thatched roof. But she is a proud borrower at an innovative rural bank. Like nearly 300,000 other landless Bangladeshis, she has managed, without collateral, to borrow enough to start a small business and slowly advance her family's standard of living.\nThe salute reflects steps taken by the Grameen Bank to improve the outlook and habits of its mostly female borrowers and to achieve what it maintains is an extraordinary 98 percent rate of loan repayments. ''Now that you are earning, you can stand up straight and look into people's eyes,'' the bank's founder, Mohammad Yunus, says. The bank also works to improve the nutrition, family planning, sanitation and literacy of borrowers.\nAll this is provided for within the bank's financing, which offers a new approach to problems that are endemic throughout Asia and the third world. The bank has attracted widespread attention; in Washington, for example, Congress is studying the possibility of tying some foreign aid to credit for the poor.\n''We are not doing any favors. We are in business,'' Mr. Yunus said, noting that healthy, literate borrowers, not burdened by a large family, are better credit risks. ''The entry point is credit,'' added an aide, Muzammel Huq. ''Development through credit can be done without any cost to the Government. These people are borrowing at the commercial rate of 16 percent.''\nDespite their subordinate role in this Moslem society, 74 percent of Grameen borrowers are women. ''Women are better clients in terms of repayment, and in terms of the objectives of the bank, the alleviation of poverty,'' Mr. Huq said. ''We have found that poverty, hunger and disease are primarily women's issues.''\nIn Bathoimuri, a village 40 miles north of Dhaka, the capital, the bank has lent money to 575 people, two-thirds of them women. Last year, Rabea borrowed $90, bought a cow and started selling milk. Her earnings made possible a $85 family investment in a bicycle rickshaw, with which her two grown sons now make a living. When her loan is repaid, Rabea said, she plans to borrow again to improve her house.\nThe Grameen Bank grew out of an argument between Mr. Yunus, an economics professor on leave from Chittagong University, and bankers who said they could not do business with the 50 percent of Bangladeshis who are landless, the 80 percent who are illiterate or the more than 50 percent who are women. Started in 1979, the project has grown to 330 branches serving 6,000 villages. Owned 75 percent by its borrowers and 25 percent by the Government, Mr. Yunus said, the bank has made a modest profit from the start.\nThe average Grameen loan is for the equivalent of $60. The smallest was for one dollar, to a woman who wanted to sell plastic bangles door-to-door. Borrowers have financed small-scale perfume making, bookbinding, peanut frying and the selling of matches, mirrors, bullocks and bananas. Mr. Yunus attributed the bank's success to the close contact between borrower and lender, peer pressure and the seriousness with which illiterate, poor people approach financial transactions.\nPotential borrowers are organized in groups of five. All transactions, including the approval and the weekly repayment of one-year loans, take place at group meetings. A borrower who cannot meet a payment can seek help from the group. Bank representatives meet with borrowers every week in their home villages."

European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic has said the Rohingya crisis is in its third year and it is more important than ever to maintain their support and not forget those that remain dependent on humanitarian aid to survive, reports UNB. The European commissioner said: \"We are committed to supporting both refugees and host communities in Cox's Bazar, as well as to the vulnerable Rohingya in Myanmar.\" \"It will ensure that those most in need continue to receive life-saving assistance, while being protected from the effects of flood and other hazards.\" Out of the funding announced on Wednesday, EUR18.5 million will help the most vulnerable groups among refugees and host communities in Bangladesh, according to the European Commission. This will be done by providing critical health care, food assistance and education in emergencies. Another EUR3.5 million will go towards building the local communities' capacities to prepare for and manage natural disasters. File Photo: In this handout aerial photo taken on June 19, 2019 and released on October 21 by Mukta Dinwiddie MacLaren Architects shows buildings intended to accomodate members of the Rohingya refugee community on the silt islet Bhashan Char in the Bay of Bengal | AFPIn Myanmar, EUR6.5 million will focus on helping communities in Rakhine, Kachin and Shan states by providing health care, nutrition, education and shelter. Protection is also at the core of this support, with a specific focus on registration and documentation. Another EUR2.5 million will boost the local preparedness system in case of conflict or natural disasters. Humanitarian aid  In 2019 alone, the European Union provided close to EUR27 million in humanitarian aid for vulnerable Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshis in Cox's Bazar and other parts of the country, as well as EUR9 million to address the immediate needs of displaced and conflict-affected communities in Myanmar. September 2019 marked two years since the massive influx of over 700,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar to Bangladesh, following violence in Northern Rakhine. In total, almost one million refugees are living in camps in the Cox's Bazar district and are fully reliant on humanitarian assistance. Since 2017, the European Union has provided over EUR150 million in humanitarian aid to respond to the Rohingya crisis both in Myanmar and in Bangladesh. File photo: Rohingya refugees stretch their hands to receive aid distributed by local organisations at Balukhali makeshift refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, September 14, 2017 | Reuters This includes basic humanitarian assistance for Rohingya populations, both for those who have been living in displacement in Bangladesh for many years and for the newly arrived, and host communities living close to the refugee settlements. The EU provides shelters, health care, water and sanitation support, nutrition assistance, education, and protection services. Approximately 600,000 remaining Rohingya people in Myanmar's Rakhine continue to suffer from a protracted human right crisis, with very limited access to basic services and viable livelihood opportunities due to strict movement restrictions and denied citizenship and rights. In 2019, a new conflict between the Burmese army and the Arakan Army, an ethnic Rakhine armed group, has caused new displacement of ethnic Rakhine population. The total number of new internally displaced persons in Rakhine State has risen to 70,000 spread over 106 sites."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-22 00:00:00      \nChild protection professionals have real worries about the risks with families locked up 24/7 together for an indefinite period \"I've put the kids in the freezer, so everything's cool now.\" Parents may be joking on social media about their childcare hell as more and more countries go into lockdown with the coronavirus.  But child protection professionals are not laughing. They have real worries about the risks with families locked up 24/7 together for an indefinite period. \"You will no doubt want to throw your children out the window at some point. That's normal,\" psychologist Moira Mikolajczak told AFP. \"What isn't normal, is to do that,\" she warned, as she urged parents to give themselves a break and \"not try to be Superman or Superwoman\". While governments across Europe from Ireland to Greece have been having schools send lessons and activity ideas by email to occupy bored children, social media is full of testimony from parents frazzled at having to be both teacher and playmate to their kids. Grassroots groups, however, are trying to step into the gap with the French feminist collective #NousToutes (\"All of Us\"), which campaigns against domestic violence, mobilizing with WhatsApp support groups and practical tips on how \"not to blow your top.\"  \"Being locked down gives us the chance to spend lots and lots of time with our children,\" the group said, tongue ever so slightly in cheek. But when \"we have to work from home and we are all stuck together in a small space, tensions can escalate.\" 'Step away!' Its WhatsApp groups already have 4,000 members dispensing support and tips on how to stay zen. First among them is \"step away when you feel the tension mount (even if that means locking the toilet door).\" Parents should also watch funny videos with their children, \"and program in 'off' times when you can be on your own... while someone else looks after the children.\"  The main thing is to try to avoid \"words or gestures... that can hurt and wound... because we can behave in ways that we will regret immediately.\" Mother-of-three Sarah, whose kids range in age from seven to just two months, is \"staying relaxed\" so far. \"Yesterday I took an hour for myself in my room, without a child hanging from me, and I did a meditation session via Instagram,\" the Parisian told AFP.  \"It's going OK, but it's worrying for the long haul,\" she said as France neared the end of its first week in total lockdown. If it is tough for the parents, it's no walk in the park for the children either - they too have been ordered home across large swathes of Europe and now in parts of the US. \"When we got into the living room when Mummy is working, there can be arguments,\" said 10-year-old Estheban. \"I am having to be a mother, a teacher, a cook, a cleaner and do my job as an executive in a bank from home at the same time,\" said Virginie, who has two sons aged 11 and six. While most parents will cope, said Mikolajczak, Professor of Emotion and Health Psychology at the University of Louvain in Belgium, some will not. \"We can predict increases in parental burnout,\" she said, and sometimes there could even be \"neglect and violence.\" 'Relax the rules' Governments have the same worry, with the French children's ministry warning of a \"higher risk of mistreatment... and since it will be happening at home, it will be hard to spot.\" \"Stay at home parents are more vulnerable to burnout,\" Mikolajczak said, an effect likely to be exacerbated by the fact they are there against their will. \"Western families are also not used to living on top of each other,\" she added. Added to which families can no longer turn \"to grandparents for help nor go out\" somewhere to blow off steam. Mikolajczak said structuring the children's day can really help with moments when they will play or work on their own.  And she urged parents to \"be flexible and not afraid to relax some rules\". \"Let it go,\" said Etienne, the father of two girls aged 10 and six, who has adopted the refrain from Disney's film \"Frozen\" to get him through the crisis. In these exceptional times you cannot juggle everything, he said. \"At the beginning when the schools closed, I put myself under pressure. I didn't know what to do. I had no time for myself nor the kids. \"Then the penny dropped. I stopped working and since then it's going a lot better,\" he said."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-07 00:00:00      \nIf Volkswagen realizes its ambition of becoming the global leader in electric cars, it will be thanks to a radical and risky bet born out of the biggest calamity in its history. The German giant has staked its future, to the tune of 80 billion euros ($91 billion), on being able to profitably mass-produce electric vehicles - a feat no carmaker has come close to achieving. So far mainstream automakers' electric plans have had one main goal: to protect profits gleaned from high-margin conventional cars by adding enough zero-emission vehicles to their fleet to meet clean-air rules. Customers have meanwhile largely shunned electric vehicles because they are too expensive, can be inconvenient to charge and lack range. The biggest strategy shift in Volkswagen's 80 years has its roots in a weekend crisis meeting at the Rothehof guesthouse in Wolfsburg on October 10, 2015, senior executives told Reuters. At the meeting hosted by then VW brand chief Herbert Diess, nine top managers gathered on a cloudy Saturday afternoon to discuss the way forward after regulators blew the whistle on the company's emissions cheating, a scandal that cost it more than 27 billion euros in fines and tainted its name. \"It was an intense discussion, so was the realization that this could be an opportunity, if we jump far enough,\" said Juergen Stackmann, VW brand's board member for sales. \"It was an initial planning session to do more than just play with the idea of electric cars,\" he told Reuters. \"We asked ourselves: what is our vision for the future of the brand? Everything that you see today is connected to this.\" Just three days after the Rothehof meeting of the VW brand's management board, Volkswagen announced plans to develop an electric vehicle platform, codenamed MEB, paving the way for mass production of an affordable electric car. For months after the Volkswagen scandal blew up in 2015, rival carmakers treated diesel-cheating as a \"VW issue\", according to industry experts. But regulators have since uncovered excessive emissions across the sector and unleashed a clampdown that undermines the business case for combustion engines, forcing a sector-wide rethink. Now the \"villain\" of dieselgate is likely to become the largest producer of electric cars in the world in coming years, analysts say, putting it in pole position to flood the market - should the demand materialize. \"Decisions to convert the Emden factory (in Lower Saxony) to build electric cars, would never have happened without this Saturday meeting,\" said Stackmann, one of five senior VW executives who spoke to Reuters. However the full scale of VW's ambitions were only revealed two months ago when it took the industry by surprise by pledging to spend 80 billion euros to develop electric vehicles and buy batteries, dwarfing the investment of rivals. It plans to raise annual production of electric cars to 3 million by 2025, from 40,000 in 2018. It's a risky bet. With regulators and lawmakers, rather than customers, dictating what kind of vehicles can hit the road, analysts at Deloitte say the industry could produce 14 million electric cars for which there is no consumer demand. It's also an all-or-nothing bet in the long run. VW, whose ID electric car will hit showrooms in 2020, has set a deadline for ending mass production of combustion engines. The final generation of gasoline and diesel engines will be developed by 2026."

As they sit in the spaces fenced in by the few bags and boxes of belongings they could carry, evacuees wonder how long they will have to wait to know whether Taal volcano will devastate the region or sputter back to sleep. \"It's all in God's hands now. We are not sure if we will have a home to return to,\" said Leonita Gonzales, 52, who fled with the rest of her household from the danger zone around Taal. Her banana palms were destroyed by the ash that fell after the volcano started to gush smoke on Sunday. She is uncertain whether her home's tin roof will be able to bear the weight either. Nearly 44,000 people have fled the 14km (nine mile) danger zone around Taal, where volcanologists have warned a devastating eruption could rain rocks and magma and set off a tsunami from the lake in which the volcano sits. On Tuesday, more than 1,100 evacuees packed into the gym and classrooms at the state university at the Santo Tomas town, some 20 km (12 miles) northeast of where Taal continues to puff clouds of ash and steam through old and new fissures. Occasional tremors signalled the forces rumbling beneath the earth and set hearts pounding. \"Don't tell me you're brave. When disaster strikes, you will call on all saints, big or small,\" said Obet Dionglay, 61, who had trekked through roads deep with ash to seek refuge. Dionglay's hut had been crushed by bamboos bent to the ground by the weight of the ash and he had little hope that his three pigs and dozen chickens would survive. Dionglay recalled Taal's last eruption in 1977, when his hometown of Talisay had escaped largely unscathed. Although Taal is one of the world's smallest active volcanoes only 311 metres (1,020-foot) high, it can be deadly: an eruption killed more than 1,300 people in 1911. At the evacuation centre, a couple of dozen kids kept busy with an impromptu dance class. A delivery of water gave some people a chance to wash the grit from their bodies for the first time in days, but many complained of a lack of sleeping mats, blankets, toiletries and face masks despite generous private donations. \"For now, we endure, we live with nothing,\" said Ferdinand Paderan, 39, who evacuated with his wife and two children. But even as thousands more people were being evacuated from the danger zone, some defied official warnings to head back in to collect belongings or tend livestock that they could not bring out. \"I went home and checked it. It's a good thing no one stopped our tricycle on the way home. I fed the chickens and the dogs,\" said Leonel Gonzales, 32, a tourist guide at Taal Lake, who fled with his one-year-old daughter and pregnant wife. \"We will stay here to make sure we are all safe. We will check on the pets again when the volcano calms down.\""

State Minister of Foreign Affairs M Shahriar Alam informed of Bangladesh's decision to Japanese State Minister for Foreign Affairs Toshiko Abe during a meeting held on the sidelines of the 4th Indian Ocean Conference, at Male in Maldives, on Wednesday. Toshiko Abe expressed her country's gratitude to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for meeting all the family members of the Japanese victims of the terror attack. Shahriar thanked Japan for facilitating the very fruitful visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina earlier in May this year.  Referring to the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed last month in Tokyo, he expressed gratitude to the Japanese government for listing Bangladesh as a country for skilled migration.  It was highlighted that both governments will work closely to deliver on the MoU as per the agreement.  Shahriar Alam updated his Japanese counterpart on the latest status of over 1.1 million Rohingyas sheltered by Bangladesh, including Bangladesh's concerns about security at the camps. He underscored that Bangladesh needs the support of Japan for the repatriation of the Rohingyas safely and with dignity to Myanmar, and for their settlement at Bhashan Char. Toshiko Abe mentioned that Japan is particularly happy that Bangladesh has decided to name metro rail stations after the names of the Holey Artisan victims.  Both sides agreed on timely implementation of ODA, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here. Shahriar called for Japanese support for building a new railway bridge over the Jamuna River. The Japanese side reassured their support and cooperation to build the railway bridge.  The State Minister led the Bangladesh delegation to the 4th Indian Ocean Conference organized by India Foundation in association with the government of the Maldives and S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore from 3-4 September. He is also a member of the IOC Organizing Committee.  The theme of IOC 2019 is \"Securing the Indian Ocean Region: Traditional and Non-Traditional Challenges.\""

Villages and chars along the Teesta and Dharala rivers were hit hard by flash flood twice lately when huge amounts of fodder got damaged. As a result, farmers and small scale traders are seeing no option but to sell off their cows. In consequence, the prices have dropped sharply in all 25 cattle markets of the district. Mozibur Rahman, 55, brought three cows to sell at Durakuti Haat, one of the biggest cattle markets in the Sadar upazila, on August 6, five days before Eid-ul-Azha. He could sell only one cow at Tk 42,000 and returned home with the rest. \"I bought the cow at Tk 55,000 three months ago but now had to sell it at a loss in the same market,\" said Mozibur, a farmer of Kalmati village located on the bank of Teesta. \"I would never have sold it at such a low price if was not in a financial crisis,\" he told this correspondent. Another farmer, Nazu Miah, 50, of Bongram village said, \"Grasses and hays were largely damaged by the recent flood. The crisis of fodder has compelled us to sell cattle at low rates. \"I had nurtured four cows with an aim to earn Tk 200,000 by selling them. But I got only Tk 82,000 by selling two of them, the rest are still unsold,\" he said adding, supply of cattle was greater than demand this season. Jitish Chandra Sen of Falimari char had 19 cows. \"My two cows got washed away by flood while I have sold 10 dirt-cheap. This happened due to an acute crisis of fodder in our flood affected village,\" said the 63-year-old farmer. \"Prices have fallen sharply this year due to oversupply. The flood affected farmers are bringing their cattle but are returning with disappointment.\" Said Hazrat Ali, a trader in Durakuti Haat. Similar condition was prevailing in 25 other cattle markets in the district, he told this paper. Mizanur Rahman, 50, who came from Thana Para of Lalmonirhat town, said he purchased one cow at price lower than last year. \"From a large number of verities, I selected one and bought it at Tk 48,000,\" said the content customer. Lalmonirhat Zila Parishad Chairman Matiar Rahman was at the Haat on August 6. \"Buyers are happy to get cattle at reasonable prices but flood affected farmers and small scale traders are unhappy as they are being compelled to sell off their cows on the occasion of Eid,\" said Matiar, also general secretary of Awami League Lalmonirhat district unit.

      "text": "Plane for Bhutan Opens Many Lost Horizons\n1988-11-27T05:00:00.000Z\nThe tiny and remote landlocked Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan took a major new step toward improving its communications with the outside world recently when it bought its first passenger jet.\nA top Bhutanese official said last week that the new plane, a British Aerospace 146 jetliner with 82 seats, will increase the strength of Druk Airways, the kingdom's carrier, to a total of three. The others are small turbo-prop Dorniers bought from West Germany that hold 18 people each and are used between Calcutta and Bhutan. ''This aircraft will play a positive role in the further development of Bhutan,'' said the official, Chi Dorji, Secretary of the Planning Commission. Mr. Dorji said the plane will be used not only to promote tourism but also to ferry cargo from India to Bhutan.\nMost Western visitors to Bhutan travel by air and must stop or make a connection in India or Bangladesh.\nThe current ruler of Bhutan, governed for much of this century by the Wangchuk family, is King Jigme Singye Wangchuk, who sent his Foreign Minister to India a few weeks ago to announce the solemnization of his marriage to four sisters and the declaration of his successor, an 8-year-old boy born to one of the sisters.\nKing Jigme, 32 years old, revered throughout his nation of 1.3 million that has an annual per capital income of $150. One of the poorest countries in the world, Bhutan is cautiously trying to blend its cultural traditions and economic development at its own pace.\nMr. Dorji said the Aid Bhutan Consortium that meets in the French capital every three years had substantially increased its contribution. Explaining that in previous years Bhutan had been getting $45 million a year from the consortium, he said, ''We have been pledged $63 million a year.'' This figure does not include India's aid, which is several times higher.\nHe said that he had to sharply counter demands by those who suggested that Bhutan modernize its economy.\nMr. Dorji said the new plane would would be used to transport people and goods between New Delhi, Bhutan and Calcutta. ''Later we can explore some more areas, maybe Katmandu in Nepal, maybe other places,'' he said.\nHe stressed that Bhutan was not going to open its borders to a flood of tourists. For years, the kingdom has kept mass tourism at bay because it does not want to be swamped by Western influence and because the powerful Buddhist clergy believes that largescale tourism will hurt national character and the morality of the young.\nFor decades, India has played a powerful role in developing Bhutan and keeping other nations out. It bankrolls most of the country's economic plans, has built all-weather roads across tough mountain terrain, trains Bhutanese soldiers and keeps an eye on Chinese troops across the border, has set up a major hydro-electric project that supplies power to the kingdom and is sold to power-hungry Indian states. Under the terms of a 30-year accord, New Delhi also consults regularly with Bhutanese leaders on foreign policy.\nSignificantly too, the Indian Embassy was for many years the only diplomatic mission in Bhutan. It is still the largest although Bangladesh and the United Nations Development Program also have presences there now. Most other foreign embassies operate out of New Delhi and cover Bhutan in occasional visits."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-13 00:00:00      \nExperts are hopeful, but cannot attest the long term effects of the project Bangladesh and India will both benefit from the opening of the Farakka barrage, as it will be favorable for ilish fish in general, said sector experts. India has redesigned a navigation lock at the Farakka barrage on the Ganges to ensure the smooth and safe migration of ilish during their three-month spawning season. This lock has now been redesigned to ensure the smooth and safe migration of ilish shoals during their mating season. A navigation lock is a device used to raise and lower boats and ships between stretches of water on a river. Inland Waterway Authority of India Vice-Chairman Pravir Pandey said the barrage gates will remain open for only eight metres between 1am and 5am each day, the preferred time when the ilish seek passage. The tentative completion date of the project is in June. Professor Monirul Islam of the Department of Fisheries at University of Dhaka said: \"It is important to note at which season India is going to open the barrage. In mating season it is forbidden to catch ilish in Bangladesh. If India opens the barrage at that time, then Bangladesh will suffer the consequences.\" \"It seems to me that India is doing this project experimentally. If this works out and India gets more ilish, then perhaps they will realize the value of cooperating with Bangladesh, and that it is wrong to block river flow,\" he added. Also Read- India to open Farakka for illish migration He said there is still a possibility that India might block the barrage after the ilish are on their side, but it would not do them much good. Ilish is a fish of the sea; after releasing eggs in the river, they will return to the sea. If that is blocked, the fish will not release any more eggs. Sector experts have said factors such as pollution, unplanned river islands and water politics may contribute to lessening the ilish population. However, not all experts are skeptical. Dr Md Niamul Naser, an ilish researcher from Department of Zoology at University of Dhaka, is viewing this as a positive turn of events. He said: \"The illish need the flow of water. If there is proper current in the river, the fish will be able to go as far as Rajshahi.\" \"Meghna has enough flow right now. If there is enough flow in Teesta, Surma and Kushiyara rivers, then there will be no issues. It is not as if it will be bad for Bangladesh if India gets ilish,\" he said. Department of Fisheries Deputy Director Dr Zillur, who is in charge of the Aquaculture Branch, said: \"We do not think Bangladesh will face any problems from this project. If the fish traverse the water bodies, then both countries will benefit from it.\" \"However, I cannot attest to the long-term effects of this project. Ilish is a natural resource; no single country owns them. They should be able to migrate in the way that is natural for them.\" When asked about the potential effects of India's project on Bangladesh, Department of Fisheries Director (Scientific Research and Fisheries Survey) Dr Monowar Hossain said: \"If the water flow is improved, then both countries will benefit from the project. Bangladesh will have no issues regarding ilish breeding.\""

      "text": "Photographs That Reflect and Confront Cultural Icons\n1988-01-29T05:00:00.000Z\nJUDGED by its first month, 1988 promises to be an energetic, expansive and sometimes controversial year for photography. On a weekend's excursion to museums and galleries currently exhibiting photographs, one can sense a ferment that compensates for the often uninviting chill of winter streets and sidewalks.\nIf the shows now on view are any indication, the biggest issue to be faced this year hinges on how we look at photographs. Do they wear their meanings on their sleeves, or are they signs of half-hidden attitudes and biases? The sharpest delineation of this question can be found in the exhibition ''Picturing 'Greatness' '' at the Museum of Modern Art. Part of the museum's ''Contemporary Art in Context'' program, the show consists of 39 portrait photographs of artists, selected from the museum's photography collection by the artist Barbara Kruger.\nGiven Ms. Kruger's post-modernist reputation and the nature of her artworks - declarative, billboard-size photomontages that intend to upset the status quo - a collaboration between her and the museum's generally conservative department of photography would seem unlikely. But the result is a huge success. For the museum's audience, it offers a chance to see firsthand how a new generation of artists and critics is responding to photographs as cultural evidence. For the museum's photography department, it marks what one hopes is a new era of openness and experimentation.\n''Picturing 'Greatness' '' is a show about the ways in which artists of this century have presented themselves to the camera, and the ways in which photographers have chosen to depict them. Although Ms. Kruger does not bother to sort out whether photographers or their subjects are more responsible for the images that are presented, her essential point is well taken: the idea of ''the artist'' is, in pictorial terms, a virtual cliche. The ''look'' of being an artist is predetermined by cultural precedent. The art-ists on view range from Claude Monet to Jackson Pollock, and in appearance they vary from ''a kind of well-tailored gentility,'' in Ms. Kruger's words, to ''a kooky middleman between God and public.'' Many of the pictures are well known, including the show's most obvious cliche, Edward Steichen's print of Rodin posed as a mirror of his sculpture ''The Thinker.'' But others are sufficiently individual as to seem fresh, including a 1935 image of Alexander Rodchenko, thought to be a self-portrait, and Irving Penn's 1947 portrait of John Marin, imperiously leaning on a umbrella.\nBut the intent of the exhibition is not to present these images as individual works of art. This is made obvious by the installation itself, which differs radically from usual museum practice. Ms. Kruger has hung the prints in groups, stacking some like totem poles, to point out certain motifs. In one group, all the artists are holding cigarettes; in another, they are all wielding brushes. And then there is the show's wall label, which dominates the center of the gallery. It greatly resembles one of Ms. Kruger's own artworks, with bands of red paint flanking type so big it can be read from outside the gallery.\nWhat Ms. Kruger has done, in short, is to make obvious the curator's intention and intervention. She also has expanded the context of the photographs so that they are ''about'' more than just the history and esthetics of photography itself. For this we have to thank the artist and Susan Kismaric, the photography curator who invited her to put together the show.\n''Picturing 'Greatness' '' remains at the Museum of Modern Art through March 29. ''The Logic of Display'' P. S. 1 46-01 21st Street Long Island City, Queens Through March 6\nWhile less emphatic about revealing the hand of the curator than ''Picturing 'Greatness,' '' the group exhibition ''The Logic of Display'' at P. S. 1 suggests that the urge to link photography with larger cultural forces is a widespread, even international phenomenon. Consisting of work by 10 artists from four countries, the exhibition makes the point that photographic images are increasingly being used in hybrid works that resemble sculpture more than traditional photographs. But that's only part of the purpose of the show, which was organized by two P. S. 1 curators, Paul Laster and Renee Riccardo. The less obvious, more telling message is that artists are ''packaging'' their photographs in ways that refer to, and comment on, commercial precedents.\nBarbara Bloom's ''Arena,'' for example, is a glass-fronted showcase that holds photographs and a shoe. The images depict a sports stadium and a shoe store that is designed like a stadium. On another wall, a group of French artists who call themselves Information Fiction Publicite show a series of four light boxes, arrayed from floor to ceiling, that look like miniaturized bus-shelter advertising panels. But in this case, the backlit ''ads'' are merely images of clouds.\nThe most intriguing piece in the show, however, may have more to do with architecture than packaging. By an artist known as B. Wurtz, it consists of an empty amplifier case, on which is mounted a cylindrical chair leg, and two photographs. The photos seem to show us industrial factory buildings, but close examination reveals them to be close-up, worm's-eye views of the assemblage on the floor.\nAlso at P. S. 1 is a fascinating exhibition of work by the Swiss artists Peter Fischli and David Weiss and an intriguing slide installation by Richard Baim. The Fischli and Weiss show, organized by Karen Marta for the List Visual Arts Center of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, features humorous photographs of their unlikely, Rube Goldberg-style constructions and a video projection of their masterpiece to date, a film called ''Der Lauf der Dinge'' (loosely, ''How Things Work''). Using elemental means - fire and fireworks, blasts of air, gravity and a variety of corrosive liquids - the artists manage to sustain a chain reaction of ever-more-absurd materials and events for 30 minutes.\nMr. Baim's installation, called ''World/Fair,'' uses the techniques of corporate slide presentation, including computer-controlled dissolves and lighting effects, to undercut the implicit promise of progress they contain. Images of ''modern'' society - highways, factories and buildings - merge and blend in sometimes revelatory, sometimes unfathomable ways. Their slow procession, seen over a monument bearing an optimistic message about a ''brave new world,'' gives the installation a seriousness and gravity unusual in today's art world. 'No Trumpets, No Swans' Pratt Manhattan Gallery Puck Building 295 Lafayette Street Through Feb. 24\nA far more jaundiced view of contemporary art photography than the P. S. 1 shows - indeed, an oppositional one - can be found in the exhibition ''No Trumpets, No Swans,'' at the Pratt Manhattan Gallery. Organized by Philip Perkis, who teaches photography at Pratt Institute, with Eleanor Moretta, the gallery's exhibitions director, ''No Trumpets, No Swans'' aims to rehabilitate the practice of what's called ''street photography'' from what Mr. Perkis clearly feels is its currently unfashionable position in the art world.\nAlthough situated geographically on the edge of SoHo, ''No Trumpets'' is situated against it esthetically. The eight photographers in the show seem less interested in issues of representation and packaging than in reporting on fleeting facts of the visible world. In an argumentative statement available at the gallery, the critics Marvin Hoshino and Roberta Hellman say that these pictures challenge ''the common notion that straight camera work is somehow limiting, that it's come to a dead end and is not contemporary.''\nThe evidence gathered here includes Helen Levitt images dating to 1942 and Garry Winogrand pictures from the 60's together with much recent photography, including Mr. Perkis's. The pictures indeed show that the pleasures of straightforward, uninflected photography remain as strong as ever. Photographs such as Elaine Mayes's image of a boy flattened against his skateboard, and Judy Linn's Coney Island view, in which a young woman's shoulder merges magically with the horizon behind her, seem marvelous no matter what one calls them. But it remains to be seen whether the incidental beauty of images like these is enough to displace the current trend toward more elaborated, skeptical uses of photography. (After closing in Manhattan, the show will reopen at the Rubelle and Norman Schafler Gallery, Pratt Institute, 200 Willoughby Avenue, in Brooklyn, March 4 to 31.) 'Marc Riboud: Lasting Moments, 1953-1988' I.C.P.-Midtown Gallery 77 West 45th Street Through March 12\nThe ''hidden hand'' tradition of ''No Trumpets, No Swans'' is by no means limited to the eight photographers represented in that show, of course. It can also be seen at the I.C.P.-Midtown Gallery, in an endearing retrospective of the work of the French photographer Marc Riboud. Mr. Riboud's output of the last 35 years serves as a reminder of Henri Cartier-Bresson's vast influence on postwar photography. While never a slavish imitator of Cartier-Bresson's style, Mr. Riboud does share the master's reliance on intuition and devotion to lyrical moments. What distinguishes his work is its obvious sympathy with peasants, laborers, refugees and common people generally.\nCompared to Cartier-Bresson, whose work can be seen in the show ''Henri Cartier-Bresson in India,'' at the International Center of Photography (1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, through Feb. 28), Mr. Riboud seems to function on the sidelines of world events. He portrays strife in Bangladesh through the faces of grieving young widows, the Vietnam antiwar movement by juxtaposing a flower and a bayonet. Although he has called himself a poor reporter because of this, his knack for recording history from the viewpoint of those most affected by it gives his pictures their unique and often compelling personality. Robert Rauschenberg Pace/MacGill Gallery 11 East 57th Street Through March 5\nRobert Rauschenberg's new photographs, taken with a large-format Polaroid camera and displayed at the Pace/MacGill Gallery, are something else entirely from Marc Riboud's work. Rather than report on the world, they record the omnivorous vision of their maker. The photographs fall into two groups. Those in black and white, showing us bits of cars, bicycles and palm trees, are bleached and stained and sometimes grouped into grids of four. The color images are straightforward, almost documentary observations of fading signs, peeling plywood and other forms of material dereliction.\nPhotography is nothing new to Rauschenberg, who started taking pictures at Black Mountain College in 1949. The idea of claiming for art items that were bound for the junkyard is not new either - witness his show of ''Glut'' sculptures at Blum Helman Gallery (20 West 57th Street, through tomorrow). What is of interest, though, is the way these pictures make clear his penchant for decay.\nThere are, however, two problems here. One is that the pictures seem to have a touch of deja vu. The black-and-whites have the look of earlier Rauschenberg prints, perhaps mixed with a touch of the Starn Twins; the color is reminiscent of William Eggleston's work. The other is that the artist's perceptive facility is so great there seems to be no end to its expression. By using a camera - that mechanical producer of endless images - Rauschenberg doubles the odds of visual surfeit."

      "text": "THEATER; Life and Death Are the Actors On Her Stage\n1989-04-23T05:00:00.000Z\nOn stage, a grieving old man paces, mutters, groans, finally exploding into words. It is a speech from ''Titus Andronicus,'' Shakespeare's early, rarely performed drama of revenge, pitting Romans against Goths, with unhappy endings for all.\nDeborah Warner, the director - wearing a white cable-knit sweater, black jeans and black loafers - sits quietly, smoking, in the front row of Peter Brook's Bouffes du Nord theater in Paris, watching her Titus, the Scottish actor Brian Cox, plot doom for his enemies. This run-through is largely for the benefit of the technical crew, who must orient themselves to the Bouffes before the March 22d opening.\n''Titus'' has sometimes been considered too histrionic for production: a young woman is flung down on her husband's dead body and raped by his killers, two brothers who then cut out her tongue and hack away her hands to render her incapable of communicating their identities. Her father's vengeance is equally terrifying.\nBut the Royal Shakespeare Company has been playing this violent, emotional piece for the last two years, infusing it with Ms. Warner's characteristic mixture of intensity and dark humor. During a recent six-week tour that took the production to Spain, France and Denmark, the play - which lasts almost four hours in this uncut version - got standing ovations. In Paris, the tiered scaffolding of the set, created at the Swan Theater in Stratford-on-Avon, looked right at home among the crumbling splendor of the Bouffes.\nMs. Warner, who turns 30 next month, grew up near Stratford in the Cotswolds and admits that Mr. Brook's productions have been an inspiration. ''I did not see his 'Titus' with Laurence Oliver and Vivien Leigh, because it was before I was born. But my older brother dragged me to Brook's 'Midsummer Night's Dream' when I was 10,'' she said, ''for which I thank him.''\nFor someone whose style has evolved from bare-bones minimalism on small stages, Ms. Warner's jump to prominence has been astonishing. She recently won the Laurence Olivier award as best director of 1988 for ''Titus'' and has been mentioned as a candidate to replace Terry Hands as the R.S.C.'s artistic director; he announced earlier this month that he will step down in 1991.\nMs. Warner, one of a new wave of women directors of classic plays at Stratford last summer, including Di Trevis and Garry Hynes, has, in the opinion of some critics, risen right to the crest. ''Of all the Englishwomen, Ms. Warner is the one who has made the greatest impact,'' wrote Mel Gussow of The New York Times. ''As demonstrated by both 'Titus Andronicus' and 'King John,' she has a visceral sense of theatricality. In her hands, plays draw an immediate responsiveness from the audience.'' It is Ms. Warner's goal in staging Shakespeare to pitch her public into the Elizabethan mood; in this sense, the audience plays a vital role in her productions, and so does every actor on stage: there is no star system, and even the smallest roles are personal creations.\nLast season, Ms. Warner tackled Sophocles' ''Electra'' at the Pit Theater of London's Barbican center. Writing in The International Herald Tribune, the critic Sheridan Morley called it ''an intense, almost religious experience on a bare stage through which runs a river turning slowly to blood.''\nAt the Paris rehearsal of ''Titus,'' Ms. Warner, with her modest, unruffled manner, seems distanced from all the blood and thunder. She finds it hard to express her vision in conversation, saying only, ''A love of the words and a very unacademic approach is what I have, and an absolute love of acting.''\nThere are no theater people in her family. ''But,'' she says with a laugh, ''I was raised by an English eccentric.'' She is the youngest of three children, and her father, a Quaker, was an antiques dealer. ''I grew up surrounded by the most wonderful Elizabethan objects; if I have any visual sense, it comes from that.''\nHer productions are characterized by bold approaches to stage design and an anachronistic mix of costumes. ''Minimalist design is complex, actually,'' she says. ''The space itself is the central inspiration. It should be like Elizabethan theater - Shakespeare could take you from the fields of France to the fields of England because there were bare boards.''\nIn the city of Oxford, where she completed her secondary schooling, Ms. Warner became involved in university productions, and later took a stage-management course in London. ''But the big thing was being on my own in London, going to the theater nightly,'' she recalls. ''It was a good time - the R.S.C. was doing the War of the Roses trilogy.''\nWhen she was 21, she founded the Kick Theater Company. It was aptly named, because the classics with a kick is what she delivered, putting on Brecht, Buchner and Shakespeare with no funds, no attempt at historical grounding, no sets - just odds and ends from the family antiques shop. The Kick's first production, in Oxford in the summer of 1980, was Brecht's ''Good Woman of Szechwan''; the company was in residence in Edinburgh from 1981 to 1985.\nHer 1985 ''King Lear'' attracted a sudden rush of publicity and brought her name to the attention of the R.S.C. Terry Hands had asked Mr. Cox - who starred with Glenda Jackson that year in a production of Eugene O'Neill's ''Strange Interlude'' seen in London and on Broadway -to play the lead in ''Titus Andronicus.''\n''I said, 'I'll do it, but I want to take risks,' '' recalls the 52-year-old Mr. Cox, who was also to win a Laurence Olivier award for ''Titus.''\n''I had heard about this girl, and I felt she would be a breath of fresh air in the English atmosphere of good, slightly tight-sphinctered theater,'' he says. ''Deborah's incredibly open; she doesn't go around wearing that director's badge. She never stood in my way with 'Titus.' She works like a gardener: prepares the bed, plants the seed, waters it and watches it grow.'' He adds, ''She has something modest, but she's tough, hard, cunning, believe me. Deborah's ageless - when she sprang out of the womb, she was already 40.''\nMr. Cox punctuates this rehearsal by rushing to adjust the tilt of a bucket of blood. Lumbering about, a chef's apron tucked around his ample body, he is preparing Titus's revenge scene - a feast for Tamora, Empress of the Goths, whose sons have raped and mutilated his daughter, Lavinia. First he kills the villainous pair, then grinds their bones and bakes a pie of them.\nTwo rows of waiters, at the command of Titus the master chef, carry the feast table onto the stage of the Bouffes. They are whistling an ominous work song that sounds strangely like the one from Walt Disney's movie of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.''\n''Yes,'' Ms. Warner murmurs, alluding to the music. ''British critics raised brows, but we kept it in because I believed we could use some relief.''\nEstelle Kohler, who is playing the Goths' Empress, swoops on stage. ''Welcome, dread Queen,'' Titus greets her, making a flying leap onto the table.\nMs. Warner rarely interrupts the rehearsal; she believes in giving her actors leeway and feels that a lot of their inventiveness comes through play.\nAfter the run-through, Sonia Ritter, who plays the ravished Lavinia as a quivering, wounded bird, sits in the Bouffes restaurant having a cup of soup. This is not an easy part to shake off; she looks as if she will never warm up. To prepare for her role, she visited shock and trauma victims in hospital wards. ''Deborah is marvelous that way; she lets you try out your idea, and if it doesn't work, you find out soon enough,'' the actress says. ''She is always watchful and helpful; she sees the play every other night. When we were in Madrid, we started to slow down for the foreign audience, but it got so grim that Deborah said, 'Forget language differences - go for it!' ''\n''You cannot direct this play in the late 1980's,'' says Ms. Warner, ''without showing rape for what it is - a denial of the human being - and that's what Sonia has acted, very bravely.\n''Imagine writing a mute role into your play!'' the director exclaims. '' 'Titus' is a young man's play, no question of that; an experimental play that has its echoes in 'Lear,' 'Othello,' 'Macbeth.' Shakespeare did not write it just for the murders, mutilations and cannibalism, but to show the other side: why these things happen to people, how they develop, and what they learn.''\nMs. Warner's interspersing of black comedy with the gruesome goings-on sends her audiences reeling abruptly from stunned grief to hysterical laughter. ''And we've had a lot of fainting - five faints in a night once,'' she recalls. ''I'd rather have a conscious audience.''\nShe is happy, she says, to have done plays with such strong women's parts. In the title role of ''Electra,'' she cast the Irish-born actress Fiona Shaw, who will play the wife of the 19th-century explorer Sir Richard Burton in Bob Rafelson's new movie, ''Mountains of the Moon,'' now being filmed.\n''Once I chose 'Electra,' I spent weeks terrified of it,'' Ms. Warner says. ''The thing that frightened me is that I couldn't do what I could do with Shakespeare - I couldn't find any humor. Your support in Shakespeare is colossal; when you don't have those images and you don't have those metaphors, you're suddenly at sea. I believed there was a way of playing Greek tragedy that focused almost exclusively on the emotions. It needed an extraordinary actress, which we had in Fiona, but I wasn't able to help until she touched that intense emotion: then I could work, I could direct.''\nAn assistant comes over to show her one of the props for the run-through: the Parisian version of Titus's macabre pie, fresh from the oven: it is exquisitely fluted, topped by a small pastry rose. The director bursts out laughing. ''Why, it's very pretty,'' she exclaims. ''It's very French, isn't it? The trouble is, Titus could never have made that pie - it has to be 10 times bigger, and rough-hewn.''\nMs. Warner is used to dealing with the unexpected on tour. From the start, she has traveled widely with her productions, taking the Kick's ''King Lear,'' for example, to Yugoslavia, Egypt and Israel. Recently she was in Bucharest, where she saw a Rumanian version, which she says still haunts her, of ''King John'' - the play she mounted last summer at Stratford and that will soon move to London.\nTwo years ago, she was invited to go to Bangladesh by the British Council, a government-backed organization that promotes British culture abroad. ''The idea was to send a director to work with Bangladeshi actors on Shakespeare,'' she says. ''The play was 'The Tempest,' ill chosen in many ways, since it was the time of the floods. I had to convert them to the play, because they wanted to do a tragedy, and they expected to perform in cloaks and gowns, as they'd seen on television.\n''The idea people have of Shakespeare comes from BBC television movies, which have bred the most terrible cliches. Shakespeare hands you extraordinary circumstances, full of contradiction; those who try to iron out the contradictions make me very angry. They are great dramas because they are like life: wretched, awkward, confusing - let's honor them in that way.''\nTouring, she thinks, is a vital way of touching the present. ''I'm more in my times than anywhere else,'' she says. ''I've never approached any of these plays in their historical context; above all, I want to speak for now. There is a lot of Bangladesh in 'Electra' because of that trip. A great many actors and directors feed on that which they make, not that which happens to them - that's where they go wrong.''\nMs. Warner's next project will be to prepare ''The Good Woman of Szechwan'' for a November opening at the National Theater in London. ''It was the first play I ever directed,'' she recalls. ''I'm going to open at the Olivier, the National's biggest theater, and it couldn't be more different from the church hall in Oxford where I first directed it - but in a way, I've come full circle.''\nYet she admits that the Brecht, which will reunite her with Ms. Shaw, will call for fresh resources of her imagination. The huge Olivier stage contrasts sharply with the intimate, black-box theaters in which her past successes have been shaped. Ms. Warner sees this new production as ''completely challenging - which is the reason to do anything.''\nAnd then? ''A lot of people want me to do a new play,'' she says, ''but I will still concentrate on the classics because they are the bigger plays. I'm interested in an emotional depth; it has to be about life and death. I don't want to direct a play about social security.''"

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-30 00:00:00      \nWhat do I expect, what do you expect, being a citizen of a megacity in 2020? The answer is simple. A liveable life. Only a few basic elements are enough for ensuring a simple liveable life; the kind of life I look for, you look for. I am sure, everybody has the same desire. The desire of having a blue sky, a little greenery, open grass-covered fields, fresh air, and like a cherry on top, a breathing space. Our Dhaka, the city with which all of us have a love-hate relationship... all our scopes and opportunities -- livelihoods of all middle income and upper-middle income groups, comparatively better education and treatment hubs are in Dhaka. So apparently, we have few options of leaving this city. Nowadays, living in Dhaka is not a choice any more, rather it's destiny. However, the ambiance of Dhaka city is our choice, more precisely, our leaders' choice. Many of my friends would disagree with me. These friends are dedicatedly trying for the last few years to make people understand that we, the inhabitants are responsible for a better city. They argue that inhabitants are responsible for turning the poetic rainy season terrible, as they use plastic, throw garbage here and there which destroys the drainage system. They also argue that people don't obey the traffic rules hence we lose our working hours on the roads. They have many such arguments that render the responsibilities of a livable city becoming unlivable on the shoulders of the inhabitants, who are already overburdened with an excessive rate of house rent, the high price of basic food grains, fear of toxic food items, insufficient supply of freshwater and cooking gas, the challenge of reaching office on time, and above all insecurity. These poor people expect a change, wait for a better life, hence they pay taxes. Since the beginning of civilisation, people are used to nominating a leader for ensuring their collective well-being. I agree with my dear friends that people also have responsibilities. But for that, an effective governance mechanism should prevail to compel people to obey the rules and laws. Laws are formed for the people and people are bound to follow in spite of their urge to violate them. This is ensured through a fair and effective governance system. If the governance mechanism is unfair, corrupt, then it will fail to implement the rules. That's why Dhaka dwellers construct a building without following the construction codes. These people know that an under-table deal is sufficient to acquire approvals despite the issue being illegitimate. People violate traffic rules because everyone violates, and nobody cares. Here also a small transaction on the roadside is enough to get the green signal. Nowadays, Dhaka dwellers are also being consoled that the city is going to become fast and fabulous. Singapore, Los Angeles are our benchmarks! Metro rail project is underway. As if a track of metro rail is enough to ease all the pains of the city dwellers. All these assurances underscore that there is lack of confidence that the big gap between the people's expectations of a liveable city and ongoing development projects will be resolved. Unplanned development itself is a monstrosity and enough to destroy a city. In the last few years, many disasters happened in Bangladesh due to unplanned urbanisation. We can still remember the tragic incidents of fire in Nimtoli, Chawkbazar and Banani. All the major cities including Dhaka and Chittagong are regularly inundated during monsoon. Recently, Dhaka has been identified as one of the cities with the poorest air quality. The barrier to breath is also a disaster for human life. And why is this happening? Definitely because of unplanned \"so-called\" development. Not only in the megacities, but also across the country, unplanned development is a cause for various natural disasters like flood, river erosion and water-logging. Despite the mighty Sundarbans evidently protecting the coastal belt from devastating cyclones several times, this natural wonder is now at risk from a sword of Damocles which spells \"development\". Please, stop singing the song of monstrous development. Just try to give us a city to live in. Let us spend our currently depressing evenings in an open field, walk barefoot on the grass, fly our kites of hope in the blue sky, go home on foot on clean pavements, and please ensure our security and safety.  We are no longer in a position to urge for an acceptable and fair process for electing the guardians of our city and the reasons are manifold. We don't even want to discuss those anymore. But our dreams are still alive. Dipping in the abundance of suspicion and doubt, we can only wish for a city to live in, a city where we can breathe. Please listen to our unheard demands at least once, as this may be the last shot of realising these.   Shegufta Sharmin is a development worker and can be reached at shegufta@yahoo.com"

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-24 00:00:00      \nThe government sought financial support from the development partners to implement the ambitious Delta Plan that would need $37 billion by 2030 for ensuring food and water security and fighting disasters.  The Planning Commission shared the plan with the development partners at the National Economic Council (NEC) conference room at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the city yesterday. Shamsul Alam, member of the General Economics Division (GED), made a presentation on the plan. Representatives of multilateral, bilateral development partners, including the United Nations resident coordinator Mia Seppo, were present at the programme. Ideally, the government wants to implement the plan with its own funds, but the plan needs vast amount of money and hence the development partners' support, Planning Minister MA Mannan said. The government will welcome the development partners if they become interested, he said. As per the Delta Plan, which was approved in September last year by the NEC, were primarily selected for implementation. Of them, 65 would be infrastructure projects and 15 aimed at enhancing institutional capacity, efficiency and research. The required fund for the projects would come from the government, Green Climate Fund, development partners, foreign direct investment and the private sector. At present, the government spends 0.8 percent of the GDP for Delta management projects and programmes. To implement the plan, 2 percent of the GDP would be required. Bangladesh is likely to get $2 billion assistance from the Green Climate Fund every year. Besides, about 0.5 percent from the private sector's annual income could be added to the Delta Plan fund. Coastal, Varendra (Barind) and drought-prone, haor and flood-prone, Chittagong Hill Tracts, riverine and urban are the six areas to be given priority by the Delta Plan. Due to climate change, the country's agricultural production may seriously be affected.  The production of paddy and wheat may decrease by 17 percent and 61 percent respectively. About 70 percent of the areas in 16 districts, where the poverty rate is very high, are most vulnerable to natural disasters, the planning ministry document mentioned. Mannan said the Delta plan will be emphasised in different development plans including the upcoming Eighth Five-Year Plan. The representatives of development partners urged the government to be strict against river pollution and grabbing to cut the impacts of climate change."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-27 00:00:00      \nFarmers are acutely at risk of contracting sewage-borne diseases Comilla City Corporation's unplanned drainage system is turning farmland into water bodies; as polluted water is flooding hundreds of hectares of farmland. However, the city corporation has undertaken several mega projects to improve  rural infrastructure and increase opportunities for urbanization. Among these projects, one of them was undertaken to ensure a better sewerage system. However, the newly-constructed drainage system--in nine wards of Comilla City Corporation, including wards 23 and 24-- has brought sewage onto arable farmland, into open fields, and near educational institutions; mostly harming farmers in the process. Diseases--such as: cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and diarrhea--are emerging from these unhealthy conditions. Various crops, dwellings, schools, and other institutions, are in danger of becoming water-logged. Farmers complain that due to the negligence of the city corporation officials, the drains empty onto farmland instead of into rivers or canals. They claim that if the sewerage system had been carefully planned, the farmers would not be suffering. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said the drainage line empties onto farmland for various reasons; including that some cases filed against construction of the line, by people who do not want drains over their land, have left the process incomplete. He said: \"We are trying to find a solution to this problem.\" Visiting the area, this correspondent found that starting from the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) Comilla sector, the main drain pipe ends near Nandanpur Bishwaroad. Branches of drainpipes from other areas link to this main drain line, leading the sewage water away to places near farmlands, houses, and educational institutions in several areas, including: Gandhamati, Changini, Batabaria, and Rampur. The main drain line of the 23rd and 24th ward ends near Batabaria school, while Ghungaijhuri canal is only 2700 square feet away. If the drain had been extended by 2700 square feet--over the Changini-Nandanpur area to the canal--then the problems would not have existed. There are at least 30 government and non-government institutions in wards 23 and 24, including: the Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development (Bard), the BGB sector headquarters, Comilla University, a section of cantonment, a cadet college, Shalban Vihara, and the Buddhist Bihar Museum. Locals said if the unplanned sewerage system persists, these places will flood with polluted water. A farmer from Nandanpur, Abul Hashem said they are struggling to yield crops as contaminated water is flooding their arable farmland. They demand the pipeline be moved so that it ends at Ghungaijhuri canal, rather than on the farmland. Many people--including Md Ayub Ali, Md Lutfur Rahman, Zahid Hossain Mithu, and Md Abul Kalam--have complained that apart from harming the crops, farmers are also contracting skin diseases from the contaminated water. Dr Mosleh Uddin, president of Comilla Environment Movement, said: \"Due to the dirty and contaminated water of the drains, the farmers of those areas are [working] in extremely dangerous conditions. \"All the polluted water from the city is flowing onto agricultural land. As there is no way to dispose of the sewage--other than in the southern area of the city corporation--the area will be considered a recycling zone.\" He said it is possible to protect the agricultural land--at least in those areas--by creating a recycling project. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said: \"The work to extend the drainpipes, for them to empty into canals, is going ahead according to the master plan. It will be completed in phases. He also said alongside it, there is a plan to extend the main drain line of Nandanpur towards Ghungaijhuri canal. The mayor said: \"A man named Abdul Jalil from ward 24 has filed cases against seven city corporation officials, including me. Construction of drains in various places is hindered due to these problems.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-05 00:00:00      \nRenowned artist Jamal Uddin Ahmed  emphasises the need for spontaneity as an important aspect of art. The artist received the Ekushey Padak this year, for his outstanding contribution to fine arts. He is also famous for his artwork series on pigeons, horses, boats, gypsies, flood victims, fishermen, marine life and the mystic troubadours of Bangladesh. Ahmed's artworks have earned him many other accolades at home and abroad.   He uses soft pastel along with thin acrylic dust layers and charcoal as the background of his paintings. The acrylic and charcoal dust generate amazing textures, along with a mystique aura on the surface of the canvas. He often makes impromptu paintings with female models. \"A true artist always experiments with new techniques. Abstract art is easier to do while realistic art is hard to portray,\" says Ahmed. \"I do two types of paintings. Some of my works are meant to communicate with the general audience, while others are designed to satisfy the artist in me. At the end of day, an artist never truly retires. He lives on through his work.\" For Ahmed, painting is similar to composing music. \"People often become emotional while listening to melodious songs. However, singers who sing only with their voices and not with their hearts, fail to leave lasting impressions. The same is true for art,\" he says. \"Great artists always put their heart and soul into their creations.\" Referring to renowned artists Turner and Monet, he said that the forthcoming generation of artists should regularly go for outdoor projects. He also suggested the re-launching of compulsory art education in schools.   Ahmed was a visiting teacher and artist in residence in the Art and Design Department at the North Carolina State University in 1995. He is currently a Professor at the Department of Drawing and Painting of the Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka. He is also the current President of Bangladesh Charushilpi Sangsad.  "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-09 00:00:00      \nIf you go to Motijheel and look for the proverbial \"jheel\" the financial hub of the capital is named after, you will be disappointed.  But after putting in some effort and asking around, you will find a waterbody behind Bangladesh Water Development Board where ferrying service is still in operation. The waterbody (at present resembling a pond) stretches over an area of about one acre, and has two boat services -- benefitting hundreds of people who take the route. This \"pond\" is the last remaining vestige of the fabled jheel in the area which supposedly linked Buriganga and Shitalakhya rivers to Sengunbagicha, Arambagh and Gopibagh canals, said locals. Many used to commute to Motijheel using boats, they claimed. Gopibagh canal was turned into a road in the 1990s and most parts of the jheel were filled up around that time, says Jahangir Alam, a resident of Gopibagh. Buildings and roads were constructed on it (parts of the jheel), said a former Wasa official. As tragic as the death of the many waterbodies in the city is, many still use the pond that remains as a shortcut and save 10-15 minutes to go to Motijheel from Kamalapur, Gopibagh, Tikatuli and other adjoining areas. Fare is Tk 2 during peak hours, and Tk 5 after 9pm and in weekends. Enamul Haque, an official of Bangladesh Water Development Board, who was in a hurry to cross the pond on a Monday morning, said that in the morning even five minutes are crucial to office-goers. Logically, a huge number of them use the boat services to get to work within a short time. The route is so popular among office-goers that queues form at both ends of the waterbody during peak hours every workday, he said. Ripon Ali, a first-year student of Kamalapur Sher-e-Bangla Railway School and College, said every day he goes to school on foot and takes this shortcut on a boat. \"It takes only a couple of minutes to cross the waterbody. I can reach my school in 10-15 minutes,\" said Ripon, a resident of Tikatuli. \"It would cost Tk 30-40 if I take a rickshaw to school,\" said Ripon. Kholilur Rahman, a resident of Gopibagh, said there was a huge waterbody named \"Matimia'r Jheel\" in the area and several thousand boats would come to the gudaraghat (where people embark and disembark) every day from different areas like Demra, Nandipara, Isapur, Trimohoni and Razarbagh. The jheel was linked to rivers at that time, he said. \"We had taken relief materials on boats from here to Demra, Madartek and Bashabo during the 1998 flood,\" he added. Encroachers started filling up the waterbody in the 1990s, which sped up in the early 2000s, said locals. At present, some individuals are claiming ownership of the pond -- putting up signs -- though it is government khas land, they alleged. Heju Miah, a boatman at the ghat, said there are two boats on the small waterbody. Ferrying service starts very early in the morning and continues till 11pm. Ekhlamul Islam, a resident of Gopibagh, said though it is still a vital waterbody in the area, it remains neglected by the authorities concerned. The water of the pond looks polluted and a big part of it has been occupied, he said. Authorities should take immediate measures to beautify this area -- as done with Hatijheel -- as it is the last remaining waterbody in the heart of Motijheel, he urged.

Moreover, around 50 families have also become waterlogged in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishti Nandan villages under Pratapnagar union. Locals say the 100-ft dam was already in a risky state, so it naturally could not sustain the strong pressure of tidal current and collapsed into the bottom of the Kopotakkho River. Many local residents have started volunteering to repair the embankment with whatever materials currently available. They fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands. Contacted, Pratapnagar Union Parishad Chairman Jakir Hossain held the water development board responsible in this regard, saying it was their negligence that led to the collapse of the embankment every year. \"Despite repeated complaints and appeals seeking sustainable protection of the embankment, the water development board failed to acknowledge the urgency of the issue. \"Now, due to this recklessness, farmlands and fish enclosures on around 1,000 bighas of lands have been flooded in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishtinandan villages. Moreover, almost 50 families have become waterlogged.\" Contacted, Md Arifuzzaman, of the local water development board, after visiting the site said he had arranged sandbags for the temporary emergency repair of the damaged embankment to minimize the extent of damage and protect remaining lands. \"The higher authorities will be notified promptly so that the necessary steps may be taken to permanently repair embankment.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-10 00:00:00      \nAt least 266 people have been arrested for posting coronavirus-related information in 10 Asian countries Hundreds of people have been arrested across Asia for posting purported false coronavirus information, according to an AFP investigation, deepening concerns that growing government efforts to combat \"fake news\" will target the wrong people and silence dissent. From teenagers to a TV star, people have been wrongly detained under vaguely worded cybercrime laws or broad state-of-emergency powers ushered in since the outbreak began, rights groups say. \"Governments are using the 'fake news' label to dress up their rights-abusing efforts to censor views and statements that are at odds with whatever strategy they have taken to deal with the Covid-19 crisis,\" said Phil Robertson, Asia deputy director for Human Rights Watch (HRW). \"It's insane frankly. In many cases it's people being dragged out of their homes to the lock-up, put in pre-trial detention, in crowded spaces where they're more likely to get Covid-19.\" At least 266 people have been arrested for posting coronavirus-related information in 10 Asian countries, from Thailand to India and Mongolia, according to an AFP tally based on police reports. They include a local politician in India who claimed on Facebook that the government was downplaying virus fatalities, and a Malaysian TV personality made to pay a fine of several thousand US dollars after he posted a YouTube video criticising a hospital's handling of the pandemic. Authorities say criminalisation is needed to curb the online flood of dangerous fake cures and conspiracy theories that the World Health Organization (WHO) has called an \"infodemic.\" But HRW and other campaigners point to cases where opposition figures or journalists have been targeted - as well as questioning the fairness of arresting ordinary people who may not even realize they are spreading misinformation. A middle-aged woman in Sri Lanka spent three days in custody this week after posting a prank message on Facebook saying the president had tested positive for Covid-19, police said. In Cambodia, a Facebook pundit who posted a quote from Prime Minister Hun Sen was charged with incitement to commit felony and is facing up to two years in jail, according to a court warrant seen by AFP. Officials say Hun Sen was joking when he told motorbike taxi drivers to sell their vehicles if they cannot make money in the pandemic. 'Rumour mongering' Cambodian authorities have also detained four opposition politicians, according to HRW, while a local rights group and police sources said a 14-year-old girl was among more than a dozen people arrested. She was released soon after questioning with no charges. The surge in arrests in Asia focused on coronoavirus misinformation has come after various countries toughened laws or introduced new ones on so-called fake news. \"Regulating misinformation by either introducing new legislation or by expanding the scope of existing laws has been the trend in Asia for the last few years,\" said Masato Kajimoto, a journalism researcher at the University of Hong Kong. The pandemic has accelerated this because a crackdown can be perceived as protecting public health, rather than infringing on freedom of speech, he said. In Thailand, a state-of-emergency decree passed in late March criminalised sharing misinformation online about Covid-19 that could \"instigate fear.\" This is on top of the Computer Crimes Act, which has a five-year maximum jail penalty and is often used to stifle dissent online. The Philippines also recently adopted an emergency law giving it more powers to combat the pandemic, including arresting people who share false information about the disease. Nearly 100 people in India have been arrested for spreading virus misinformation under existing penal laws and the disaster management act - with punishments including up to one year in prison. \"While India lacks any specific fake news law, there do exist provisions of laws that can be used for 'rumour mongering,'\" said Apar Gupta, director of the Delhi-based Internet Freedom Foundation. \"It is fair to state that these laws are broadly phrased and can result in arbitrary action, given India's slow judicial system that also generally displays a prosecutorial bias,\" he said. Karuna Nandy, an Indian Supreme Court lawyer, told AFP that such arrests were particularly alarming in a lockdown, when courts are mostly shut."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-11 00:00:00      \nVC says sorry for 'lacking' in his role; protest to continue Amid growing protests by students demanding justice for Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology's (Buet) slain student Abrar Fahad, the university authorities have banned student politics on the campus. This apart, Buet also suspended 19 of its students who have been named in the Abrar murder case. Buet Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Saiful Islam announced the decisions around 5:45pm yesterday, nearly four hours after the 2pm deadline the agitating students set for him to meet them, clarifying his stance on a 10-point demand. The meeting between Buet authorities led by the VC, and the protesters started at Buet auditorium around 5:30pm, on the fifth day of demonstrations that erupted after several now-expelled Buet Chhatra League leaders killed Abrar Fahad in the early hours on Monday. Earlier yesterday, several hundred students of the university gathered in front of Buet Shaheed Minar at 11am with placards, and chanted different slogans demanding capital punishment for Abrar's killers.  On Thursday afternoon, the students placing a charter of 10 demands threatened to lock down all the academic, and administrative buildings of the university, if the VC failed to meet them by 2pm on Friday.   The protesters, at that time, clarified that they demanded the banning of political party-affiliated student organizations on campus, not student politics as a whole. Several hours later, the VC agreed to sit with them to decide on their demands.  Abrar, a second year student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of Buet, was beaten to death at Sher-e-Bangla Hall. The killers-- all Buet students--beat him for his alleged involvement with Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, an unsubstantiated claim which is yet to be proven. VC says sorry for his role  During the meeting, the VC apologized to the students for \"lacking\" in the role he should have played immediately after the incident.  \"I did have some shortcomings. I beg apology,\" said the VC adding: \"I am extremely sorry as I could not appear on time.\" VC Saiful went on saying that the Buet authorities will bear all the expenses needed to run the murder case, as well as to compensate the victim's family.  Promising to take necessary measures to stop ragging by the students, he assured that the university authorities will write to the government seeking speedy trial of the killers.  The VC has been drawing the protesters' wrath since he did not show up on the campus until after 5pm on Tuesday, nearly 40 hours after Abrar was reported dead.  His finally made a public appearance, and issued a statement around 5:30pm that day, after the students set a 5pm deadline.  However, sources at his office claimed that the VC failed to make public appearance due to illness.  Protesters also demanded his resignation.  Criticism over the matter did not just stop there. The Awami League-led 14-party alliance, too, yesterday lashed out at him. The alliance's spokesperson Mohammed Nasim at a meeting in Dhaka said: \"We're hurt over the delay by Buet VC in reaching there (Sher-e-Bangla Hall). This is so unfortunate, something we cannot expect from a VC.\"  Protests to continue as campus still 'unsafe' Despite assurance from the authorities regarding meeting their demands, protesters announced to keep protesting on campus until the entire campus becomes safe for all students.  According to them, leaders and activists of some student fronts including Chhatra League are still residing at different dormitories of Buet.  For this reason, they did not even retreat from their decision of boycotting Buet admission test slated for October 14. The murder sparked protests not only in a number of higher educational institutions in Dhaka, but also in many universities, cities, and divisional headquarters across the country.  Abrar, a second year student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of the university, was beaten to death by some activists, and leaders of Bangladesh Chhatra League's Buet unit inside the university's Sher-e-Bangla Hall in the early hours of Monday. Abrar's father filed a murder case against 19 people-- all Buet students--with Chawkbazar police station on Monday evening.  Until yesterday evening, 18 accused were arrested. Of them, 17 have been placed on remand for different periods."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-25 00:00:00      \nIn the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, a large number of people have opted for ordering groceries online from the safety of their homes. Customers want to avoid the danger of interacting with people and at the same time, stock up on necessities as people fear a drawn-out self-isolation period until the crisis passes. Home deliveries are considered a safe option. Waseem Alim, co-founder and CEO of Chaldal, an online grocery and delivery platform, says they have been serving 4,000 customers a day in Dhaka through their 350 delivery workers. Such platforms have seen a surge in business in the past weeks. Chaldal has been inundated with orders and has been operating at maximum capacity. Due to this, customers now need to wait for almost a week for their next available slot for delivery. Sabrina Fatema, a resident of Dhanmondi, said she was trying to order a disinfectant item on the site on March 21. The first available slot she found was March 28. Farhana Lubaba, a resident of the Kazipara area of Mirpur, said she had to wait four days to get her order from Shwapno. \"I was expecting that I wouldn't be getting my order anymore. I was surprised to get a phone call from a delivery worker on the fourth day,\" she said. Since more and more people are ordering groceries and other items online since the outbreak, delivery workers have been working tirelessly from morning till night. According to some delivery workers this correspondent interviewed, they would earlier make around 18 to 25 deliveries daily. In the past ten days, they have been doing between 30 and 40 home deliveries a day. \"The situation has changed massively. Now, customers are madly buying online to avoid public gathering at the supershops and bazaars,\" said Md Shaown Hazari, a Chaldal delivery worker. The rise in demand means Arif Hawlader, another Chaldal delivery worker, leaves for work at 7:00am and returns home at 10:00pm. The coronavirus outbreak has also forced delivery workers and customers to maintain cleanliness and hygiene standards in their interactions. Deen Islam Imran of Chaldal is wearing a mask while delivering orders, and sanitising his hands after handling cash. \"Our office has provided safety kits and has been monitoring whether we are strictly maintaining these standards,\" he said. According to Chaldal's CEO, the platform has taken precautions to prevent the risk of the virus passing on to their delivery workers. From March 16, they have formed an internal policy. \"Bike handles, bike seats, and steering wheels should be disinfected with hexisol or Savlon by the respective driver at the beginning of every shift. Deliverymen should maintain a distance of at least one metre from customers when delivering orders,\" mentioned the policy provided by the Chaldal CEO. Supershop Shwapno is also providing hand sanitisers, gloves, and masks for its delivery workers. Delivery and logistics businesses in general have also taken new policies to reduce risks of the virus spreading by giving customers the option of contactless delivery. Pathao, for example, is promoting contactless delivery by dropping off items at doors and asking users to pay digitally. \"We have also taken extra precautions for the safety of users and delivery agents and distributed over 5,000 safety kits to foodmen, couriers, and delivery agents,\" said Syeda Nabila Mahbub, director of marketing and public relations at Pathao. Recently, it also started Pathao Tong service, a shopping service where users could buy daily necessities and get those delivered to their doorsteps, to deliver groceries in Gulshan and Banani. However, contactless delivery is not a standard, as many customers choose to pay cash on delivery. \"It is not possible to avoid contact especially when we need to give change,\" said Arif. In spite of this, riders notice a visible change in customer behaviour. \"Many customers want to make sure that we are wearing masks. Some also offer us handwash or sanitiser before entering their house,\" said Deen. Promi Islam, a Dhanmondi resident, said she keeps a hand sanitiser and deodorant at her door. \"At first, I sanitise the parcel with the deodorant containing alcohol and then we offer hand sanitiser to the deliverymen after they touch our money,\" she said. But the question of the riders' safety still remains. According to the riders, their job involves interacting with a lot of customers every day. \"Most often, we need to enter their house to leave the products. My family worries about whether I end up making deliveries to a home where someone has the virus,\" said a Shwapno delivery worker in the Mirpur area. \"Contactless delivery can be a great way to reduce our risks of being infected, especially in the days to come as we don't know what is going next,\" he stated. \"We have been caring for the customers, and we hope, they too will assist us for the safety of both parties.\""

Only about half of medical facilities in the wedge of rebel-held Syria are operational. Nearly a million people recently displaced by violence are living in make-shift housing or crowded camps. \"We are hoping ... to have the machinery and the tests sometime this week so we can start testing,\" said Dr Rick Brennan, emergency director for the region, told Reuters. \"And we are very concerned. All of the surrounding countries have documented cases.\" Syria's government has started testing in areas in the rest of the country, although has not yet reported a case to the WHO. Turkey to the north confirmed its first case last week and Iraq has at least 93 confirmed cases. Further east, Iran has the third highest case load after China and Italy, with nearly 13,000 confirmed cases, according to WHO data. However, Brennan, who just returned from a mission to Iran last week, said that the number of cases reported could represent only about a fifth of the real numbers. The reason was that testing, as is the case even in some wealthy European countries, was restricted to severe cases. \"We've said the weakest link in their chain is the data,\" he said. \"They are rapidly increasing their ability to test and so the numbers will go up,\" he said. Iran's response to the pandemic has drawn strong criticism, both from government critics, and a UN official last week. However, Brennan was generally upbeat about Tehran's response. \"There's a great commitment and they are taking it seriously from the highest level of government.\" Iranian authorities say they have been especially hard hit by global supply shortages for tests and protective equipment, blaming the impact of US sanctions. Brennan described visiting new centres with dozens of beds where everything from the bed sheets, to the oxygen masks had been made locally. However, he said that some of the locally-produced personal protective equipment was exposing medical workers to risks. He acknowledged that some health care workers had been infected, although the cause of infection was not clear. \"We are impressed that Iranians have acknowledged their weaknesses and are working on them,\" Brennan said.

The minister also said: \"The highways all over the country are in good shape at the moment, and better than any time prior - except the ones in flood-affected areas, which got damaged and are being repaired on an emergency basis.\" He made the statement at a press briefing held at the Secretariat on Monday.

The two city corporations in Dhaka have also been requested to look after the matter, so roads do not get blocked for cattle markets, he added. Quader said to ensure smooth movement for homebound people, trucks, lorries and covered vans will be off the roads for three days before and after Eid.  Vehicles carrying medicine, export-oriented garments, goods and fuel will be outside the purview of the restrictions. The expected date for Eid-ul-Azha is August 12.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-21 00:00:00      \nDespite serious discord and disputes between the countries of South Asia, the concept of a common future of the region based on increasing cooperation among the people and governments has somehow survived because of strong geographical, economic and cultural factors. More recently however, this concept itself has been increasingly threatened. India has moved closer towards its eastern borders. Pakistan had already leaned more closely towards both China and some Arab countries. To a lesser extent, Nepal and Sri Lanka have also moved towards China. Sectarianism has weakened cultural relationships in South Asia level. Terrorism has become an issue of relentless discord and tension. The decline of the overall prospects of close cooperation at this juncture is tragic as this is probably the time when close cooperation is most needed. South Asia is passing through a critical phase of climate change which requires various countries to focus on new emerging developmental and environmental challenges as well as increase cooperation to face these extremely difficult challenges for which the region is not at all well prepared. South Asia has 16 percent of the world's population, over 30 percent of the world's poor, only 2 percent of its land and 1 percent of oil resources. So, the developmental challenges here were already acute before the advent of the disruptive manifestations of climate change. Experts see South Asia as a region where some of the most serious impacts of climate change are likely to emerge. In addition, a range of related life-threatening environmental problems have also been worsening in the region, including freshwater scarcity, decline in water tables, serious threats to rivers, deforestation, soil/land erosion and sharp decline in natural fertility, air quality, threats to safe food and proliferation of various hazards. The need to reduce GHG emissions while meeting basic needs of all people with dignity is a huge challenge, the most important real challenge for South Asia. South Asia can stand up to this challenge in a sustained situation of peace and stability where it is possible to devote most efforts, talents and resources for this. The actual situation, sadly, is a very different one. South Asia is commonly seen to consist of eight countries--India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bhutan and Maldives. Two of these are nuclear powers. The chances of actual use of nuclear weapons have increased in recent times. It is well known that any use of nuclear weapons, or any accident relating to these, can have destructive impacts not just in the nuclear weapon countries but also in neighbouring countries. While six out of eight countries of South Asia have absolutely no involvement with nuclear weapons, they may have to bear the consequences of their use or even deployment/storage by two countries. South Asia has emerged as one of highest arms-importing regions of the world. Combining direct and indirect expenses, the total military expenditure may be much higher than what is stated officially, denying precious resources for urgent development and environment protection tasks. South Asia has seen two extremely violent partitions and a much higher number of violent secessionist movements and insurgencies. It has also seen four wars involving India and Pakistan, and a persistent state of foreign invasion and internal violence in Afghanistan for over four decades. Terrorism is a big source of violence but also has a larger and more destructive role as a trigger for an all-out war. On the whole, war and civil war, secession and insurgency are likely to have claimed nearly six million lives in South Asia in the post-World War II phase. The number of people who were displaced or ruined in other ways is higher. Sectarianism and sectarian violence remain at high levels. Secularism has very dim prospects. Democracy has had its ups and downs in various countries of the region. It survives at rather low levels of achievement. Democracy needs to be strengthened from many points of view, one of the most important being the creation of conducive conditions in which alternative viewpoints can emerge and acquire strength. These alternative views should seek peace, harmony, environment protection, justice and equality (including gender-based justice and equality). An accompanying effort would be to make dedicated efforts to spread values of universal peace, non-violence, non-dominance, non-discrimination and social equality (including at the gender level), a wider understanding of honesty and sincerity as well as some basic human rights and duties. Such an effort if sustained for about five years can help to change public perceptions so that democratic leaderships devoted to peace, justice and environment protection can emerge.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-29 00:00:00      \nIndia is the second largest onion producer and exporter in the world after China India's ban on onion export will not affect the local market as the country has sufficient stock, a top trade official has claimed, saying a large quantity of onion imports from Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar are in the pipeline. \"There is nothing to be worried about India's ban. We have adequate stock,\" Commerce Secretary Jafar Uddin told Dhaka Tribune last night. He said two ships carrying onions from Myanmar already anchored at Chittagong port, which would raise the domestic stock.  \"I don't see any possibility of instability in local market. What we need is coordinated efforts to strongly monitor the market to ensure smooth supply and check price manipulation,\" he maintained.     The Indian government on Sunday banned onion export amid growing prices in their domestic market after production of the vegetable fell short of target due to flood caused from incessant rainfall, India Today reports.  India is the second largest onion producer and exporter in the world after China. In last couple of months, the Union government of India started tightening onion export by imposing several initiatives leading to price hikes.  Apart from this, the Indian government firstly withdrew 10% incentives on onion export in June and later, in mid-September, it re-fixed the vegetable's minimum export price per ton at $850. Reuters adds: The Indian government said exports would be prohibited with immediate effect. In several cities, prices of the essential kitchen item have doubled in recent weeks, prompting the government of the world's major onion exporter to take steps to calm prices ahead of key state elections later this year. In June, India withdrew 10% export incentives on onions after prices started to rise due to dwindling supplies from last year's harvest and a delay in planting of the summer-sown crop. Excessive rainfall in the second half of the monsoon season has led to crop damage in several states and stocks held by traders are insufficient to meet demand until the new crop arrives in end-October.  The government has also attempted to bring down prices by releasing more onions from federal buffer stocks, prices have remained fairly high. The ban has sent waves of panic in the country that the essential cooking commodity will be costlier.  Bangladesh consumes a higher quantity of onions than the country produces annually.  According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the country's onion production in 2016-17 fiscal year was 1.86 million tons against the demand for 2.4 million tons. The country has been facing a price spiral of the cooking ingredient since the Eid-ul-Azha celebrations early last August. In recent weeks, prices of the commodity escalated further. On August 17, the commerce ministry came up with the statement that the country had 1.6 million tons of onions in stock and claimed that the quantity of stock was enough to meet domestic demand.  Onion prices in the country jumped from Tk45 to Tk70 per kg on September 14, a day after India fixed minimum onions export price per ton at $850. Usually, the minimum export price of onion at international market stays in between $250 and $300. Yesterday evening, visiting Sukrabad kitchen market, Dhaka Tribune found per kilogram local onion selling for Tk80-90 while imported one for Tk70-80. On the other hand, super shop Shwapno at Panthapath was selling Indian onion at Tk74 per kilogram.  Bangladeshi is eighth on the Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) list of top ten countries producing onion.  China tops the FAO list with annual production of 24.28 million tons, followed by India 22.42 million tons, USA 3.73 million tons, Iran 2.37 million tons, Egypt 2.37 million tons, Russian Federation 2.13 million tons, Turkey 2.13 million tons, Bangladesh 1.86 million tons, Pakistan 1.83 million tons and The Netherlands 1.77 million tons."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-17 00:00:00      \nThe government's market interventions have been largely ineffective Bangladesh's resilient farmers recouped the 2017 devastating flood-induced crop damages by growing more rice over the last few growing seasons including the current Boro. This high rice output brings much relief to the government that spent millions of Taka importing a record four million tons of rice in 2017-18 through public and private channels. But much to the misery of growers, the prices that they are being offered for their produces in the current marketing season is non-commensurate to their production costs.   For the past one week - news and pictures of aggrieved farmers taking to the streets demanding fair price for rice and different socio-cultural and student groups rallying supports for the same cause hogged the media attention big time and deservedly so.   Yesterday too, farmers blocked a highway in rice-rich northern region of Rangpur - spreading paddy grains on the road - demanding the government to purchase paddy directly from farms, and ensure a fair price.   Production projection Bangladesh's rice production is expected to increase for the second straight year in a row, thanks to good weather and increased yield due to continuing cultivation of hybrid and high-yielding varieties (HYV). Following the crop loss in 2017 due to Haor zone's flood and crop diseases, the country's rice growers bounced back with a higher production - nearly 35 million tons in 2018-19 making the country self reliant in staple production again.    According to the Ministry of Food, country's current stock of rice in public granaries is over one million tons, well above the comfortable food safety threshold level.   Farmers getting poor price  Polash Kanti Nath heads a farmers' organization goes by the name - Krishak Sangram Parishad (KSP).   He said, \"It costs around Tk700-Tk 800 to produce a maund of paddy but we can only sell it for Tk400. Even buyers are few in number.\" Another farmer Momtaj Uddin said: \"The government has promised to buy paddy directly from farmers, but we do not see that happening here. We are not getting a fair price for the paddy, so we are protesting.\"  And in Tangail, some college students came forward to help a local paddy farmer Abdul Malek harvest his crops after he set some of it on fire, protesting the steep fall in paddy prices and after not being able to afford the high labour costs for harvesting the paddy. Shahidul Islam runs a rice mill in Kushtia's Khwajanagar, one of the largest wholesale rice markets in the country. Talking to this correspondent over phone yesterday, Shahidul acknowledged that millers and traders are offering Boro farmers much lower a price this year compared to last year's prices. He said millers have already enough carryover rice in their stock and that's why there is no urgency to buy rice from the growers.  Lukewarm public procurement  On March 31 this year the government decided to procure over a million tons of paddy and rice from the farmers at a good price offers of Tk. 26 and Tk. 36 a kg respectively. Government's food department was supposed to provide the farmers with this price support from April 25 but eventually the public grain procurement process kicked start much later only in mid-May. Dr Akhter Ahmed of the Washington-based food policy think-tank International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) told Dhaka Tribune that government's late entry into the market and buying rice from traders and millers instead of farmers would not help offset the situation. He wondered if the government in West Bengal, India can buy paddy directly from the farmers why can't be it possible in Bangladesh.  Anwar Faruque, who served the agriculture ministry in Bangladesh for many years prior retiring as the ministry secretary, told this correspondent that with a paltry volume of public procurement the food department would not be able to make much impact on rice pricing in the market. \"Why shouldn't government procure three million tons of rice from farmers and give them the price support? If the public granaries suffer from space constraint, the government can always keep the procured rice in hired private godowns.\" Unwise tariff regime    Market is glutted with cheaper imported rice because of zero tariff still in place on rice import, said Faruque adding that \"Government said we lost 1.9 million tons of rice in Haor flood in 2017 and import tariff was cut from a whopping 28 percent to zero.\"  But after periodic reviews, he thinks, the government should have re-imposed tariffs on rice import thereby, giving much required protection to domestic rice growers.  Will exporting rice ease the solution? Agriculture Minister Dr Abdur Razzque told reporters yesterday that government would export rice to ease the situation. He said government is now in a position to even export over a million tons of rice. Dr Akhter considers entering into the rice export market is not that easy and such an intervention even if is conceived now its benefit would not trickle down to the farmers rather, it would only benefit the big millers and traders - who had purchased rice from farmers at a cheap rate and hoarded that for quite some time to make a windfall.  \"Countries like Thailand and Vietnam developed a place for them in a very competitive rice export market over a period of time. It'll not be so easy for Bangladesh to make a sudden inroad into that global rice market,\" explained Dr Akhter. If in tobacco, why not in rice? An expert, who has been following increasing instability in rice pricing in disfavor of paddy growers in Bangladesh, told Dhaka Tribune each year government facilitates fixing procurement price of tobacco from farmers for private tobacco companies.  \"Why can't it do it for the rice growers? It's understandable government will not be able to buy all 35 million tons of rice that Bangladeshi farmers grow a year but the least government can do is dictate the market by fixing floor price for rice for private buyers and sellers,\" said the expert, who works for an organization where he is not authorized to speak to the press on record. All the other experts that t Dhaka Tribune talked to were also of the view that the government needs to streamline its paddy procurement process so that farmers and not traders are benefited and it has to reign in the profit-mongering middlemen, millers who made most of the paddy profits depriving the principal stakeholder - the farmers."

India's 1.3 billion people have been ordered to remain indoors for 40 days under a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the virus so that the country's hospitals are not overwhelmed by a flood of infections. Indian authorities have confirmed 18,985 cases of Covid-19, including 603 deaths from the respiratory disease, a relatively low toll compared with Western countries with much smaller populations, though health officials say a lack of widespread testing may mean many more cases have not been reported. The alarm was raised at President Ram Nath Kovind's residence in the centre of Delhi after the daughter-in-law of a sanitation worker living in employee quarters there tested positive for Covid-19, officials said. Neither Kovind, 74, nor his aides were required to self-isolate as they would not have come into contact with lower-level workers on the premises, officials said. But the families of palace workers living in 114 apartments on the grounds were ordered to stay inside, while the seven members of the sanitation worker's family were moved to a quarantine facility. No one on the premises is known to be infected so far.  \"It may be clarified that to date no employee of the President's Secretariat has tested positive for Covid-19 and the Secretariat along with the Local Administration are taking all the preventive measures required under the government guidelines,\" Kovind's office said in a statement. Under India's constitution, the president is a titular head of the republic only with the prime minister and his cabinet holding the executive powers. An employee of India's parliament has also tested positive, but did not come to work, an official said, as the administrative wing of the legislature reopened on Monday as part of a staggered exit from the lockdown. While the total number of confirmed infections is still increasing, Indian health officials said the speed of transmission was slowing thanks to the lockdown, which at the moment is due to be lifted on May 3. The \"doubling rate\" - the number of days it takes infections to multiply by two - had increased to 7.5 days, up from 3.4 days before the lockdown, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said. \"This is an extremely positive trend,\" he said."

      "text": "Deaths and Illness Rise in Bangladesh\n1988-09-10T05:00:00.000Z\nReports of illness and deaths from gastrointestinal diseases began to rise suddenly today, increasing fears of an epidemic even as the waters of this country's devastating flood continue to recede.\n''This year, we may surpass all records,'' Dr. Ziaul Islam, a medical officer in the Presidential Secretariat, said as he studied data coming in to the Government Health Information Center tonight.\nMillions of Bangladeshis are thought to be out of communication, marooned in villages or farmsteads built above water by a people experienced in the ways of rivers. Some relief groups say that even in normal times, only a small fraction of those afflicted by epidemic illnesses are ever recorded.\nNevertheless, the statistical jump today was dramatic. For the last few days, incidence of illness and deaths from gastrointestinal diseases remained fairly constant - 16,813 new illnesses and 4 people dead on Sept. 7; 16,827 newly ill and 6 dead on Sept. 8.\nToday, 21,412 people were reported sick and 13 died by early evening. Dr. Zia said the most frequent diseases were amoebic dysentery and gastroenteritis. Official Toll of 500 Dead\nBangladesh and relief agency officials fear that a rising incidence of disease will push up a death toll that initially was low. The official figure remained at about 500 today with much of the country still out of touch and unable to report.\nPast flooding, while not as extensive as this year's, has taken far larger tolls, particularly in the case of cyclones. This year, officials say, many people survived because they had time to reach higher ground.\nBangladesh is facing this rise in disease without adequate supplies of water purification tablets and medicines, officials say. But even if these were available, there is no way to deliver them to most affected areas.\nIn all of last year, Government health records reported 2,993,192 cases of serious gastrointestinal disease, with 4,720 deaths. Most of those occurred in September and October during another devastating flood.\n''Already this year there is a dangerous trend all over the country,'' Dr. Zia said. ''We are making all efforts to prevent an epidemic.''\nGrim forecasts by Government officials are worsened by the knowledge that only a few of the local authorities in Bangladesh have been able to report flood-related diseases.\nIn addition to amoebic dysentery and gastroenteritis, shigellosis, known here as ''blood dysentery,'' and cholera have been reported. Purification Tablets Needed\nDr. Zia and relief officials said the most pressing needs were for clean water or water purification tablets.\n''Our second line of defense is medicine and oral rehydration therapy,'' the doctor said. He added that most important was public education. Many villages now have contaminated wells and ground water, and people who can be reached - a minority now - will have to be persuaded to filter and boil all the water they consume.\nBangladesh continues to receive pledges of assistance from many foreign nations as it begins to assess flood damage and distribute relief supplies. U.S. OFFERING $150 MILLION\nWASHINGTON, Sept. 9 (Reuters) -The United States said today that it is prepared to give about $150 million to Bangladesh to help it recover from the flooding.\nThe Agency for International Development said it would contribute $4.6 million in direct disaster aid, $60 million in grain and $84 million for reconstruction."

      "text": "Economic Watch; Curing the Greenhouse Effect Could Run Into the Trillions\n1989-11-19T05:00:00.000Z\nWorld political leaders may be rushing to broad accord on the urgent need to halt global warming, but since the mid-1980's economists have been worrying about the bill. Their misgivings have been deepened by recent estimates of the cost of limiting emissions of carbon dioxide, which is the primary cause of the problem.\nEconomic analysts do not speak with one voice on the issue. But all recent studies, including those carried out by environmentalists, implicitly share one conclusion: unless it proves remarkably easy to adapt technologies that drastically cut the need for oil, natural gas and coal, the price of correcting the carbon dioxide problem will run to trillions of dollars through the next century.\nBy one pessimistic but not implausible estimate, the United States' annual cost of holding the line on carbon dioxide production could rival the current level of military spending. Obstacles to Consensus\nEconomists also agree that the benefits of reducing carbon dioxide are sure to vary greatly from place to place. That will make it difficult for countries to develop a consensus for a collective response to the problem.\nCarbon dioxide and other pollutants trap infrared radiation from the sun in the earth's atmosphere, in much the same way a greenhouse works.\nSome effort to curb carbon dioxide may eventually prove to be a cost-effective means of coping with the greenhouse effect. But in the near term, most economists conclude, a major effort to limit carbon effluent makes little economic sense unless it can be justified on grounds of energy security or tax revenue. Overwhelmed Natural Processes\nScientists have long understood that certain trace-gases in the atmosphere efficiently trap solar energy and heat the planet. Some are naturally produced. But many, notably carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons, are also byproducts of modern civilization, and are being spewed out faster than the biosphere can neutralize their effects. It is now generally if not universally believed that a resulting warming effect is overwhelming natural processes that tend to cool the atmosphere.\nHow fast the greenhouse gases are heating the air is not known. Neither the heating effect nor the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the air is thought to have direct effects on human health. But there is at least a chance that another century or perhaps less of unchecked accumulation would melt polar ice and alter weather patterns, leading to coastal flooding and radical changes in land fertility patterns.\nFor many environmental advocates, those who believe in the ethical obligation to pass on the biosphere intact to future generations, the policy message is clear and simple: move quickly to reduce the production of carbon dioxide, which accounts for about half the greenhouse effect. Using Fear to Get Action\nThe cause has drawn support from diverse interests who share what David Harrison of the National Economic Research Associates consulting firm, calls ''the Christmas tree view.'' These groups hope to use greenhouse worries as a lever for everything from promoting nuclear power to tightening automobile mileage regulations.\nThis month, all 68 nations taking part in a high-level conference in the Netherlands agreed that carbon dioxide emissions would have to be stabilized.\nOnly objections from the United States, the Soviet Union and Japan prevented the conference from endorsing a goal of cutting emissions to 1988 levels by the year 2000. But William Nitze, a State Department official coordinating Bush Administration policy, acknowledges there is now heavy diplomatic pressure for an accord next year. Simulations by Computer\nGreenhouse politics have yet to be influenced by sober economic analysis, however. And while environmental groups would generally be inclined to draw different lessons from a new utility-financed simulation by Alan Manne of Stanford University and Richard Richels of the Electric Power Research Institute, almost everyone agrees that the computer model does illustrate the potential cost dimensions of carbon-dioxide containment.\nThe Manne-Richels model compares a hypothetical future of unconstrained carbon dioxide output with one in which carbon emissions are limited to the 1990 rate through 2000 and then gradually cut by 20 percent.\nEven if no technological adaptation to break the link between energy production and fossil fuels proved possible, consumers could muddle through for a while by switching to natural gas, which delivers 70 percent more energy per pound of carbon effluent. But the carbon limit begins to bite deeply around the year 2010.\nWith cheap supplies of gas exhausted, the model estimates that a twentyfold increase in the price of coal would be needed to force sufficient changes toward energy conservation. Annual losses in output would reach about 5 percent of national income, or about $500 billion, in the year 2030.\nOptimists, including the economist Irving Mintzer of the World Resources Institute, argue that technological innovations might sharply cut these costs. And the computer model bears him out. Some reasonably priced way of trapping smokestack carbon would reduce the economic impact by one-tenth.\nA low-cost source of electricity from non-carbon fuels, providing solar, nuclear or geothermal energy, would trim it further. Technical change that increased the efficiency of energy use for the entire economy by 1 percent each year at low cost would do yet more. Drop in American Incomes\nBut even the happy circumstance of technological victories on every front would still permanently reduce American incomes by about 1 percent, according to the Manne-Richels model. And 1 percent in a $5 trillion economy is a whopping $50 billion a year.\nOther studies suggest that this most optimistic Manne-Richels scenario is too optimistic. William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University, pegs the cost of containing carbon emissions to 1990 levels at 1 percent to 2 percent of national income by the middle of the next century. A study in progress by the Congressional Budget Office is reportedly yielding numbers in the same range.\nHigh cost alone need not rule out action, of course, if the alternative is catastrophe. The mere possibility that the greenhouse effect could lead to greater climatic changes in the next 100 years than those experienced in the previous 10,000 might be expected to give even the most detached bean-counters cause to lose sleep.\nBut according to Thomas Schelling, an economist at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, such projections can be misleading. While climate has not changed rapidly in the last century, both the will and technological ability to adapt to radically different weather obviously has. In 1860, he says, 2 percent of Americans lived outside temperate or subtropical zones. By 1980, the percentage had increased to 22 percent. Adjusting to Climate Changes\nWhile changes in rainfall, temperature and sea level could be dramatic, there is yet no reason to believe that the process would be completed too quickly to allow evolutionary responses - expanding irrigation, for example, or building dikes. The cost of growing food might conceivably rise by 20 percent, Mr. Schelling speculates. But this loss, he argues, is almost certain to be overwhelmed by a century's worth of improvements in seed strains and growing techniques.\nBy the same logic, Mr. Schelling says, the appealing idea of bequeathing the biosphere intact seems arbitrary. The quality of life in 100 years, he suspects, will depend as much or more on the endowment of technology and capital as on the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air. And if money to contain carbon emissions comes out of other investment, future civilizations could be the losers.\nThis hardly means that the greenhouse effect can be safely ignored. But it does imply that it should be viewed as a problem in balancing costs against benefits. And here, crude initial estimates suggest that for the next half-century or more it may be cheapest to deal with the effects of global warming rather than the causes.\nFor example, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the cost of protecting America's coastal cities against a three-foot rise in sea level would be $73 billion to $111 billion, a lot of money but not so much compared with the likely cost of prevention.\nA doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide, likely to occur by the middle of the next century if output is not constrained, would dramatically reduce yields for some crops in some regions. But according to a 1989 study by three Agriculture Department economists, the net losses would be less than one-tenth of 1 percent of income in industrial countries. Argentina and Australia would actually be economic winners, since the likely fall in yields would be smaller than the increases in world prices. Nations Most at Risk\nThis illustrates a looming problem in prevention strategies. The benefits from controlling greenhouse gases would be far greater in some countries than in others. Bangladesh, India and the Netherlands are at great risk from coastal flooding. But many countries would be able to expand farming into regions that are now too cold or too dry to support it. And a few, like Saudi Arabia, would lose much of their national income in a successful attempt to curb the use of fossil fuels.\nThe costs of carbon conservation would vary enormously. China, for example, is counting on its rich supplies of coal to develop with limited dependence on imported energy and capital.\nYet without a broad, enforceable agreement on containing carbon, expenditures by individual countries would not pay off. Lester Lave, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University, argues that an early commitment by the United States to tough carbon standards could lead to the worst of both worlds. ''We pay attention to treaties,'' he says. But big carbon emitters like China and the Soviet Union might ignore their obligations, undermining the whole logic of collective action.''\nSuch considerations lead many economists, including Mr. Lave, to counsel waiting until more is known before trying to devise preventative measures. Dan Dudek, an economist for the Environmental Defense Fund, draws a different conclusion. He wants to buy a modest amount of insurance against the small possibility of a true greenhouse effect disaster, some as yet undiscovered ecological effect that is impossible to reverse.\nThis is the time, he argues, to experiment with flexible ''emissions-trading'' systems that ''improve the menu of options'' for slowing global warming at minimum cost. Electric utilities might, for example, buy the right to emit carbon from existing emitters, or plant a sufficient number of trees to absorb an equivalent amount of carbon effluent.\nMr. Nordhaus offers a different rationale for action soon. The potential damage from the greenhouse effect has not been pinned down yet, he concludes; but some damage is almost certainly being done. And any sensible approach to balancing costs and benefits in the future will almost certainly involve a limited attempt to control greenhouse gas emissions, along with parallel efforts to sequestor carbon and mitigate the effects of global warming. A Financial Incentive\nA modest tax on greenhouse gases, one targeted at heavily damaging chlorofluorocarbons as well as carbon dioxide, would thus be very likely to increase economic efficiency; it would also give emitters a financial incentive to search for alternative carbon-free technologies. And it could provide billions in taxes to offset the Federal deficit.\nVirtually all economists seem to agree on the need to get beyond what Mr. Lave calls the ''Earth Day come back'' syndrome. The symbol of greenhouse effect, they argue, cannot be allowed to obscure the dimensions of the perplexing, high-stakes problem that lies beneath."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-05 00:00:00      \nSince the outbreak of Covid-19, many countries have been implementing lockdown measures as well as travel restrictions. China, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, India and many if the 187 countries affected have imposed strict conditions and curtailed entry into their borders. These limitations are creating serious supply-chain disruptions, production delays and distribution slowdowns, resulting in major impediments for many businesses that depend on international supplies. Industries such as travel, hospitality, healthcare and education are facing extreme difficulties in this turmoil. Most businesses in Bangladesh and beyond are complaining of serious consequential disruptions and, as a result, speculating reduced revenue and possible losses. As it is still unclear exactly how much disruption this pandemic will be causing, the businesses are unable to foresee the total impact. The unforeseen coronavirus crisis has been causing an inevitable and maybe a necessary market correction. Although if anything is obvious in business, it is that there will always be threats and upheavals for the CxOs to grapple with. Some of these threats are within the organizations, and some are external or superficial. The coronavirus crisis is just the newest such case in point. The successful leaders are the ones who can be the most aware and prepared as possible. A major learning from this ongoing crisis, is the significance of the supply-chain system, and to keep fallback plans for not jeopardizing it as much as possible. If the risks associated with using a supplier from a specific country or region are higher than justifiable levels, businesses should be prepared to use other sources where the risks are lower. Multi-sourcing in supply-chain is essential to make sure that if one source becomes precarious or uncertain, there are alternatives whose risks have been pre-assessed. Finance and risk management mechanisms can enable businesses to make informed and strategic decisions about identifying stable and resilient supply-chains. Supply-chains play a vital role in a company's ability to absorb shocks in turbulent times.  The 'FM Global Resilience Index 2019' is a great reference tool for the CxOs across businesses for making more conscious key decisions when it comes to the resiliency of their companies. The index ranks countries on various economic, risk-grades and supply-chain related standards. The CxOs can refer to the index and comprehend the effects of local and global factors on a country's resilience to crises. It highlights that vital manufacturing sources in Asia - Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, are ranked equally at no.112 for natural calamity. Vietnam ranked last (at no.130) for natural hazard risk-grade, because of their substandard state and implementation of building-codes to address natural disasters. CxOs can also determine the risks to natural calamities by referring to several technology-based tools available in the market that provide a global view of tolerable and high-risk flood areas. It can provide businesses with advance information they need to choose sources for their supply-chains. These tools can help businesses to devise two-to-five-year long plans based on risk-grades that include natural calamities and other pertinent standards, such as corporate governance. The coronavirus crisis has already exposed the vulnerabilities of many businesses, especially those who source their raw materials or finished products from China. Any extensive interruption in the \"world's factory\" means putting supply-chains at risk worldwide. Most of the Fortune Global 500 companies source their products from China. Those companies whose supply-chain relies on direct or secondary suppliers in China will experience major impediments. Apple recently shifted its manufacturing contracts to India, moving out of China to avoid the fallout of the ongoing trade-war with the US. It may pay dividends as the continuing coronavirus crisis would have forced Apple to look for alternatives anyway. Bangladesh should grab this opportunity to become an alternative source taking full advantage of the backlashes China is facing worldwide because of being the origin of the coronavirus. Bangladeshi businesses should also learn from this outbreak and start looking for alternative sources for its imports. The Covid-19 outbreak has led to shutdowns, resulting in stoppage of production in the supply-chain system. Logistics companies can no longer transport goods without interruptions, especially across borders. Pundits have repeatedly said that obtaining more visibility across the supply-chain is crucial for the success of businesses. Companies that sell finished products usually are aware of the manufacturing and shipping schedules of their direct suppliers, but they have little to no knowledge of suppliers further up the chain. Gaining this visibility is important for an efficient and deft supply-chain. During precarious situations, this visibility becomes vital for estimating and realizing the effect of the disruption on the rest of the chain, so that others in the business ecosystem can think of alternatives and act accordingly, such as planning ways for substitute suppliers. Digitising records will make supply-chains more resilient to future shocks. Digitising provides visibility and reduces risks. It is vital to make information available digitally to reduce the impact of points-of-failure in a supply-chain model. In the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, businesses with strong digital infrastructure are dealing with the supply-chain disruptions much better than those without. Blockchain technology can help ensure data privacy for suppliers. Traditional centralized supply-chain models cannot grant independent and auditable access controls to each party. Using blockchain, which is a decentralized system, is the best way to give suppliers the privacy they need and buyers the visibility they want. When created properly, suppliers can audit their data-sharing permissions directly on their own blockchain node. Concurrently, their data can be securely distributed to others in the blockchain network without requiring the point-to-point integration that centralized systems do. The Covid-19 pandemic should be a lesson well learned for all businesses whether or not that have been unfavourably affected by it. Apart from underscoring the significance of diversifying supply-chain and assessing risks, it shows the benefit of regularly gauging backup plans to be prepared for and to lessen damage from unanticipated events. Companies with plausible Business Continuity Plans (BCP) will do better than those companies that are under-prepared for crises and hindrances. While there is no prescribed user-manual for what should happen in cases of emergencies, it is essential that all businesses make plans beforehand for situations like the current times. While pandemics may not be a regular event, unforeseen disruptions to supply-chain systems are not. It is in a company's best interest to make sure that there is a contingency plan well-prepared in advance.

      "text": "SALMAN RUSHDIE: FICTION'S EMBATTLED INFIDEL\n1989-01-29T05:00:00.000Z\nBRICK LANE, IN LONDON'S EAST END, IS A neighborhood peopled by those whom the city never expected to accommodate. It is a neighborhood of Asians - as they are called by the English, who are comfortable still with the old colonial term that did not distinguish among the many peoples east of Europe. There are thought to be 40,000 Asians in Brick Lane, mostly Muslims from Bengal, a region cleaved in 1947 when India was partitioned and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) created. They have come for many reasons - exiles, refugees, schemers - and they have not always been welcomed. ''Asian'' suggests not only the distance the immigrants have traveled but also the distance at which they remain. And something more troubling, a sense of unease and estrangement, is suggested by newer, post-colonial terms: quotas, fourth world, National Front, Paki-bashing.\nI walked in Brick Lane one morning last November with the novelist Salman Rushdie. Rushdie, who is 41, was born in Bombay; he was sent to England to be schooled, and later chose to settle in London because London was where he could write the fiction he wanted to. In Bombay or in any other city in that part of the world, there wasn't the climate for the writer he wanted to be, not yet.\n''I wanted to write globe-swallowing, capacious books, ones with that sense of size, novels that expressed history, the public side of things as well as the private, the intimate,'' he had told me when I'd first met him, in New York, early last fall.\nAnd he did write such books. Two sweeping, stylistically dazzling novels - ''Midnight's Children'' and ''Shame'' - established his reputation in the early 1980's as one of the most important writers of his generation in England. Moreover, he is the only one among them - I am thinking of such writers as Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, Ian McEwan - whose books have traveled well. Rushdie, in the United States especially, is discussed in the company of our world storytellers: Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Milan Kundera, Gunter Grass.\nWhen I first met Rushdie, I had just finished reading his extraordinary new novel, ''The Satanic Verses,'' now making its way into American bookstores. (A review appears today in The Times Book Review.) The book may be understood as the third volume of an unintended trilogy, one in which a novelist named Salman Rushdie moves not only westward but inward, searching for yet another way to redescribe a world increasingly connected, but in no way whole.\nThe societal fissures that Rushdie examines in ''The Satanic Verses'' have been sharply, if strangely, mirrored in the book's reception. In England, it has attracted praise, award nominations (it won Britain's Whitbread prize as best novel), and many, many readers. In England, it has also been vilified and even burned at rallies by Islamic fundamentalists. The controversy - and it is not just England's controversy; the book has been banned in India, Egypt and Saudi Arabia - is about more than the book, of course. But like all controversies surrounding novels, it has reopened one of our great cultural questions: how and why does fiction mean so much?\nThe book's opening pages tell of an astonishing, fantastical immigration: Two middle-aged Indian actors, Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha, hurtle through cold thin air toward the English coast - singing, razzing each other, and already, like all immigrants, longing at once to remember and to forget. They have been blown out of a hijacked airliner, and miraculously, after a 29,000-foot free-fall, survive and make their ways to London. In episode after episode of the loose, shifting narrative that moves the novel forward and frames its many stories, they struggle to get a fix on London, and on themselves. They learn new ways of construing the world. They are mugged by ghosts - old lovers, old habits of mind and feeling. They return to the East, in jumbo jets and dreams, but never fully, never again. (An excerpt appears on page 48.)\nDeep, at times fathomless questions are plumbed: what is the nature of Good? Of Evil? Is Farishta an archangel? Chumcha Satan? Was their fall a contemporary version of The Fall? But the novel never strays too far or too long from London's streets: Rushdie's prose - the lustrous, alloyed English he's fused from street slang, Great Books, rock songs, ad jingles, immigrant patois, everything - has a way of keeping us in the crowded, gritty here and now, even in the book's most phantasmagoric pages. Farishta and Chumcha, and the Dickensian array of characters they encounter (or imagine), people what is ultimately the first major novel of the new England, an England with more than two million immigrants, one in which it is no longer clear, exactly, what ''English life'' comprises, what ''being English'' means.\nA good deal of the novel unfolds in a neighborhood called Brickhall - a neighborhood, Rushdie had told me, utilizing one of his favorite locutions, that ''is and is not'' Brick Lane. I had asked him when I'd met him in New York if he might show me around - Brick Lane is not a part of London a Western visitor sees - and he had agreed. But when I'd arrived in London and phoned him, I'd expected he would tell me he had changed his mind. In places like Brick Lane now, there were individuals vowing to kill him.\nEARLY IN OCTOBER, ''THE SATANIC Verses'' had been banned by the Indian Government under pressure from several Muslim leaders, who insisted that the novel - two hallucinatory chapters of which involve a prophet who is and is not Mohammed - was insulting to Islam, blasphemous. By the end of October, the controversy had surfaced elsewhere, and angrily - in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt, South Africa, every country or city with a sizable Muslim population, including London, where the book had been published in late September and had quickly become a best seller.\nRushdie and his book were denounced in mosques around the city. Hundreds of protest letters (most of them form letters, a sign of an organized campaign) were arriving each day at the London offices of Viking, the book's publisher. Leaders of Islamic groups attending the annual Conservative Party convention in Brighton called on the Thatcher Government to ban the book; and it was reported that Britain's Attorney General had been asked to begin criminal proceedings against Rushdie under the archaic blasphemy laws. Rushdie received several phone threats. When, on the night of Oct. 25, he attended the awards dinner for Britain's most prestigious literary prize, the Booker -''The Satanic Verses,'' with its many good reviews, was among the six novels nominated, but did not win - he was accompanied by a bodyguard.\nIn the months that followed, the controversy would not abate. Two weeks ago, in the city of Bradford in northern England, 1,500 Muslims held a demonstration at which they burned copies of the novel. W.H. Smith, Britain's biggest bookseller (it has 430 shops), withdrew the book from display in its two Bradford outlets - this at a time when it remained high on the best-seller lists. Officials at Viking, which is believed to have paid an advance of about $800,000 for world hardbound and paperback rights to the book - a huge sum for a literary work - is bracing for similar protests here next month, when Rushdie arrives in the United States to give public readings from the book. Already, in New York, Viking has received protest letters and calls from thousands of American Muslims, and there have also been a number of bomb scares, which are being investigated by the F.B.I., at the company's offices.\nI had suggested to Rushdie, when I'd talked with him on the phone, that it might not be such a safe thing for him to walk around Brick Lane.\n''You cannot let something like this take over your life, or you have lost,'' he said. He sounded frustrated, beleaguered.\nWas he sure?\n''They're not going to know my face from the book jacket. They're not allowed to buy the book.''\nI took a taxi to Rushdie's home in a northern borough of London, and he greeted me at the door, smiling and shaking his head. ''So strange, all this, isn't it,'' he said. Rushdie's face was dominated last fall by a black, gray-flecked and somewhat pointy beard, which he has since shaved off - and a number of cartoonists in the English papers had been inspired by it, working him up for the review columns as Satan. But it didn't convince; his eyes, heavy-lidded behind thick glasses, are too soft. There is no hardness, either, to the way he holds himself and speaks. You see in his small gestures and phrasings a hint of formality once adhered to, but this has given way to gentlemanly casualness. The tautness, the sharp edges, are kept within somewhere, to emerge only in the writing.\nWe drove down to Brick Lane in Rushdie's Saab, and parked along a small, charmless side street of small factories and tenements. It was a cold, damp morning, the sky the color of fine ash, and the only ones on the block were three young men unloading heavy rolls of cloth from the back of a truck. Rushdie explained that this was still London's garment district. The garment business had once been owned by English Jews who employed other English Jews, but now it was dominated by the Bengalis. ''That is the mosque down on the corner,'' pointing down the block to what looked to me to be simply a large meeting hall. ''It used to be a synagogue.''\nWe walked down the block, and turned onto Brick Lane, the narrow shopping street from which the neighborhood derives its name. There was a Muslim butcher shop, and the Aladdin Sweet Center, and signs in Arabic script above all the storefronts, and in the air the smell of curry. ''The thing you have to understand about a neighborhood like this,'' Rushdie said now, ''is that when people board an Air India jet and come halfway across the planet, they don't just bring their suitcases. They bring everything. And even as they reinvent themselves in the new city - which is what they do - there remain these old selves, old traditions erased in part but not fully. So what you get are these fragmented, multifaceted, multicultural selves.\n''And this can lead to such strange things,'' he continued. ''You will find teen-age girls in this neighborhood who in so many ways are London kids: Levi 501's, Madonna T-shirts, spiky hair. They never think at all of going back to India or Pakistan, even for a visit. They might actually have been born here in London. And yet you may find among them a willingness, an eagerness in some cases, to have an arranged marriage. An arranged marriage.\n''Or this story: In this very neighborhood, it was early in the 1980's. A Pakistani father stabbed and murdered his daughter, his only child, because he heard she had made love to a white boy. Which turned out not to be true, but that is not my point: My point is that he had brought with him this idea of honor and shame. And when I wrote about this later, I said that although I was obviously appalled - I mean, what can be more awful than murdering your own child? - I understood what had motivated him. I am a first-generation immigrant from that part of the world. I know how you can be here, and, in a way, still there.''\nThe setting for ''Midnight's Children'' is Rushdie's boyhood Bombay, that for ''Shame'' a country he describes as ''not quite Pakistan'' - he had written here but about there. ''The Satanic Verses'' is his first novel to deal with London, with the city that has been his home for 20 years. I asked him why it had taken him so long to write about it.\n''I think I just had to do a lot of things first,'' he said. ''I had to make my reckonings with those other parts of the world I had come from. Before I had the platform from which to approach this country.''\nAs we walked down the street, he pointed out a video shop that rents tapes of Bombay-produced Hindi films, hundreds of different ones.\n''Watching these films is entertainment of course,'' he said, ''but this also nourishes, yes? And in a way, when I go back - inside me, when I've written, if you understand -this going back to the East nourishes me. More than anything else, I would say.''\nLater, as we got back into his car, I asked him if he thought those who wanted his book banned - if he thought they too were, inside themselves, ''going back,'' seeking some kind of nourishment in their religion, their orthodoxy.\n''If you are asking me if I understand them, well yes, I understand them. But in a way they are not 'going back' to something. Their extremism is actually something fairly new. I have written about Islamic culture in the novel - Islamic culture set against the background of the West. Basically, Islamic culture is the one in which I grew up - I know it well. Its narratives are my narratives.''\n''But their Islamic culture is something new and dangerous. You have a situation where a handful of extremists are defining Islam. And what makes it even sadder for me is that they are simply feeding the Western stereotype: the backward, cruel, rigid Muslim, burning books and threatening to kill the blasphemer.''\nTHE FOLLOWING morning, I walked up to the London Central Mosque in St. John's Wood -the city's largest mosque and, I was told, the organizational base for the protest against ''The Satanic Verses.''\nThe mosque is huge, with a glittering golden dome I could glimpse, despite the day's thick fog, as I walked toward it through Regent's Park. I wanted to see Dr. Ali Mugram al-Ghamdi, director general of the Islamic Cultural Center, which has its offices at the mosque. Dr. al-Ghamdi was leading the fight against ''The Satanic Verses'' in London - he had been quoted as calling the novel ''the most offensive, filthy and abusive book ever written by any hostile enemy of Islam.'' I had tried to phone him, and could not get through, and so I'd decided to simply present myself.\nIt was a Friday, prayer day, not the best day to talk, his secretary explained, but yes, Dr. al-Ghamdi would see me. He emerged from his office minutes later. He was a short and round man, elegantly dressed in a pin-stripe suit and fine silk tie. He extended his hand in greeting, invited me in, and pushed closely together two chairs, where we sat.\nI explained how I had spoken the day before with Rushdie about his novel, its spiritual themes. After our walk in Brick Lane, we had gone to a pub, and at one point, as we talked, he had said, ''I obviously did not set out to write a novel about Islam - and it is not a novel about Islam. The novel does deal with spiritual life, very much so - that's one aspect of the book. There is a hole inside me where God used to be - I am no longer an observant Muslim - and I wanted to explore this hole. And of course that's what novels do, isn't it? Explore.''\nAnd now, sitting with Dr. al-Ghamdi, I asked if he could understand the book in this way - as an inquiry.\n''The book is really very, very offensive,'' he said gently, with no bitterness. ''I cannot overstate this. And I cannot expect you - you who are not a Muslim - to feel this.'' Then, addressing my question more directly: ''This was something that the author deliberately did. This was not just a slip of the pen.''\nWe discussed the parts of ''The Satanic Verses'' that have caused most offense to fundamentalist Muslims. Gibreel Farishta, who back in Bombay had starred in popular religious films, suffers a breakdown, and we are made privy to his mad dreams, dreams in which he supposes himself to be the Archangel Gabriel. For many Muslims, the Koran is held to be the ''uncreated'' Word of God, dictated by the Archangel Gabriel through the Prophet Mohammed, and written down, perfect and unaltered, by the Prophet's scribes.\nIn the dreams of Rushdie's Gibreel, a certain Salman the Persian, in the employ of the Prophet Mahound, makes a deliberate mistake in his transcription - he wants to see just how divine the Prophet is - and when the Prophet reads over the text, the mistake goes unnoticed.\nRushdie also ''redreams'' (his word) the famous episode in Islam of the ''Satanic verses,'' from which the novel takes its title. Historians of Islam explain it this way: Mohammed was under pressure from the citizens of Mecca to moderate his staunch monotheism, to accommodate his new faith to the city's traditional polytheism, to make room in Islam for three local goddesses. He did; he had his scribes write down verses praising al-Lat, al-Uzza and Manat as the ''swans exalted, whose intercession is hoped for.'' But he soon revoked these verses. He'd had a true revelation from the Archangel Gabriel, who told him they had been dictated by Satan.\nMahound, too, is visited by Satan and tempted to do more than utter compromised verse to scribes. Mahound likes to eat what he forbids others to - ''those fabled and legendary unclean creatures, what's their name, prawns.'' He also likes the whores. Where, in the Koran, Mohammed has many wives, revered as the Mothers of the Believers, the fictional Mahound has a brothel.\nI said to Dr. al-Ghamdi that even though Christian fundamentalists might object to the use of Christian allegory and symbol in a novel like ''The Scarlet Letter,'' or to historical depictions of Christ in movies like ''The Last Temptation of Christ,'' they have come to see that in Western society, there is no way to enforce religious orthodoxy. Anyway, I said, most Western readers would understand Mahound as a religious hypocrite, a satiric creation, nothing more, nothing historical.\nDr. al-Ghamdi looked now to be practicing patience. ''For us,'' he said, ''this is not a matter of long ago. The Prophet Mohammed and his family are alive for us. They are here, with us, and we love them so much. I am prepared - and not only me - I am prepared to die one thousand deaths to assure that Mohammed and his family are not hurt. Such anguish this book has caused.''\nI asked him what the solution was.\nHe wanted the book banned, he said. He would like Viking to act on its own, to withdraw the book from the stores.\nI told him that Viking had issued statements saying it had not meant to offend anyone, that it regretted any distress the book may cause, but that it believed in Rushdie, his novel - and especially in freedom of expression. I said that freedom of expression was a very important Western concept.\n''Islam has never been accepted here all through history,'' Dr. al-Ghamdi said. ''Here, you can just trample on people's feelings. You call that freedom of expression? And then you are shocked when emotions run high.''\nI asked him about the threats made on Rushdie's life. What did he feel about these threats? Wasn't he, whether he realized it or not, inciting people with his talk?\nHis face tensed. ''We are trying to project a mature community here,'' he said. ''I am doing my best to keep the community in check.''\nHe got up from his chair, walked over to his desk, and lifted from it a manila folder thick with papers. ''These letters,'' he said, ''you should see what people say.'' I asked if I could read them. ''They are in Arabic,'' he said. ''You do not read Arabic.'' He picked one up himself, then another, then another. And now he giggled a little. What did it say? ''This is not for you,'' he said. Our meeting was over.\nTHAT EVENING, I was invited to a dinner party at Rushdie's home. It was to be a New England-style Thanksgiving feast, planned and cooked by Rushdie's wife, the American writer Marianne Wiggins. (Rushdie's first marriage ended in divorce several years ago. He has a 9-year-old son by the marriage, Zafar.) Their house is a four-story row house on what had not long ago been a working-class block, and Rushdie's studio is on the top floor; there, each morning at an electric typewriter, he tries to write 700 good words. He had yet to begin a new novel, that would take time, much thinking. He would travel first, write essays. Rushdie is a writer in the very English way of Orwell - he takes stands. He has written a slim, sympathetic book about Sandinista Nicaragua, and he has frequently spoken out - in the British papers, on television -on what he sees as Britain's two great problems: ''institutionalized'' racism (in employment practices and housing), and the domestic policies of the Thatcher Government.\nRushdie's politics do not sit well with many in English literary circles, and especially, it would seem, with the press. He is described as arrogant, self-righteous. Challenging Rushdie's thinking about racism in England, and his sincerity as well - and perhaps revealing the very tension he is seeking to deny - a reporter in The Sunday Times of London Magazine recently wrote: ''Certainly he is assimilated to the extent of being one of the 20 just persons summoned to the [ Harold ] Pinter dinner table in Campden Hill Square to discuss opposition to Thatcherism.''\nIn the front room on the parlor floor as I entered Rushdie's house that night, I saw two large tables: There were to be many guests. A number of them were already downstairs, clustered in the kitchen and in Wiggins's study: the critic Michael Ignatieff; the American writer Michael Herr, author of the Vietnam book ''Dispatches''; the poet Tess Gallagher, in town for a memorial held in honor of her husband, Raymond Carver. A literary crowd; Rushdie has many friends in literary circles, too. And Rushdie was in good spirits, truly at home (as most writers are) among writers he likes.\nUpstairs later, watching Rushdie propose a toast above the all-American turkey and stuffing and sweet potatoes, I recalled a passage from ''The Satanic Verses'': An Indian boy, at boarding school in England only a few days, comes down to breakfast to find a kipper on his plate. He has no idea how to eat it, and his fellow students have no intention of telling him.\n'' [ H ] e cut into it, and got a mouthful of tiny bones. And after extracting them all, another mouthful, more bones. It took him ninety minutes to eat the fish.'' Chewing, he has this revelation: ''England was a peculiar tasting smoked fish full of spikes and bones, and nobody would ever tell him how to eat it.'' He discovers he is tough and vengeful. ''I'll show them all,'' he swears. ''See if I don't.''\nAfter dinner, I asked Rushdie about the kipper: It seemed too painful, too sadly funny, to be anything but autobiographical. ''Yes, I'm afraid it's only slightly embellished,'' he said. ''And I've never eaten another one.''\nHe'd been sent from India to Rugby at age 13. His family was Bombay upper-middle-class; his grandfather had made the family money and his father, who died two years ago, had, in Rushdie's words, ''spent the rest of his life losing it.'' Salman, the only son (he has three sisters), had attended the British-style Cathedral School in Bombay before being sent abroad.\n''I was miserable at Rugby,'' he told me a couple of days later when we sat and talked again at his home. ''I think I had actually wanted to go - I was groomed for it. Very conventional. Bookish - I was the kind of boy who got books for presents. No good at games.\n''But at Rugby I was suddenly an Indian. There are no Indians in India. There are classes, of course, and regional identifications. Here in England, however, it is largely understood as a race - and at the school-boy level, back then, that was no fun.'' The boys at Rugby not only watched Rushdie struggle with his kipper, but scrawled racist graffiti. He has told friends of his that he never really made a friend there.\nHis father had attended King's College, Cambridge, and he expected his son to follow when he was graduated from Rugby. Rushdie refused, then pleaded, then enrolled for classes in the fall of 1964. He knew he wanted to be a writer, he told me - his hero, he said, was the acclaimed Urdu poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz. However, he chose to study not literature but history. (Most of the references to Islamic history in ''The Satanic Verses'' are drawn from one of his college papers.) Rushdie liked Cambridge. It was the 1960's: ''Everyone was rethinking things,'' he said. ''I was too.'' He became interested in the theater, got parts and worked backstage as well in a number of college productions.\nIn the spring of 1968, he graduated from Cambridge, and returned home - not to Bombay, but to Karachi. His parents had moved there several years before. ''I was so angry they had moved to Pakistan,'' he said. ''But in truth when I'd left England, I'd only purchased a one-way ticket.''\nHis stay in Pakistan turned out to be short, sour. Not long after arriving, he began putting together a production of Edward Albee's ''Zoo Story'' for the country's new government-operated television station.\n''Well,'' he said. ''it turned out one of the lines in the play includes the word 'pork.' A character is regularly attacked by his landlady's dog, and to keep the dog away he goes and buys these hamburgers, which he tosses to it. It doesn't work: The dog doesn't go for the hamburgers. And the character has to say something to the effect that he can't understand why the dog doesn't like the hamburgers. After all, there isn't enough pork in them to make them disgusting.\n''O.K. The play is censored. One can't say the word 'pork' on TV in Pakistan. So I appeal. I say, What more could you ask for? Here is a play in which an actor points up how disgusting pork is. I mean, this is very sophisticated antipork propaganda if you consider it. But no one saw it that way. Pork was simply a four-letter word.''\nAn article he wrote for a small magazine on his first impressions of Pakistan was also censored. Before the end of the year, he was back in England. He would return East in the future only to visit.\nIt was in 1970, after having worked for a time in experimental theater, when Rushdie turned his energies to writing fiction. ''I'd always imagined myself telling stories, and now I imagined I had stories to tell,'' he said.\nBeginning at that time as well, and then for 10 years, he worked to support himself as an advertising copywriter, first at Ogilvy and Mather, then at Charles Barker. Nights, weekends he devoted to his novels. Drafts came slowly (and still do; it took Rushdie five years to complete ''The Satanic Verses''). He abandoned one novel, about a Muslim holy man. Late in 1973, having taken time off from his advertising job, he completed what would be his first published novel, ''Grimus'' - a dystopian allegory set on an imaginary island, a novel quite remote from the kind of writing he would do later. (The book was poorly received.) However, the language, aural and eclectic, hints at things to come, as does this line from the book: ''It is the natural condition of the exile, putting down roots in memory.''\nThis process of using one's own stories and experiences began for Rushdie with ''Midnight's Children,'' which he completed in 1979. He had traveled to Bombay shortly after finishing ''Grimus,'' and the trip had been important to him. He decided at that time not only to write an autobiographical novel, but to write one that would encompass the biggest of India's cities, its people and history.\n''I think I saw the Bombay I had grown up in slipping away,'' he told me, ''and that made me get on with the writing. I felt I had to reclaim the city - and also my own memories of it. I wanted to tell India's story, or stories, as well as my own.'' ''Floating in the amniotic fluid of the past,'' as he writes in ''Midnight's Children,'' Rushdie not only found his own story, and that of the nation of India; he found a way of telling. He mixed the fabulous and the historic, he made room for anecdotes, tales, essayistic asides, political commentary, digressions, retracings, sidetracks - the draft of the novel ran to 900 pages.\n''Midnight's Children'' was a huge critical success. It won the 1981 Booker Prize, and along with the prestige came a check for $10,000. Rushdie was 34, but in a photo I have seen of him holding up the check, he could be a struggling graduate student, save for the grin that conveys: I guess I showed you.\nON MY LAST DAY IN London, I visited Rushdie again, and we talked more about his novel. But talk kept spilling beyond strictly literary matters. The Islamic fundamentalists came up again. ''I am most afraid that they will succeed in reducing the novel in people's minds to a pamphlet,'' he said.\nTwo weeks ago, after the Bradford book burning, I spoke with Rushdie on the phone, and he said: ''When they burned my book, in a way as if it were a pamphlet, I think they went too far. It is such a charged image. It got people concerned about me, sympathetic toward me, who had been content to sit on the sidelines. There were Labor Party M.P.'s - Asians representing Bradford - who attended that book burning; that's a horrible thought for many people. They get to thinking, 'If it's him today, it's me tomorrow.' ''\nIt struck me, his use of ''him,'' ''me,'' ''they.'' I remembered what he had told me just before I left his house that day in London:\n''In writing 'The Satanic Verses,' I think I was writing for the first time from the whole of myself. The English part, the Indian part. The part of me that loves London, and the part that longs for Bombay. And at my typewriter, alone, I could indulge this.\n''But most of the time, people will ask me - will ask anyone like me - are you Indian? Pakistani? English?\n''What is being expresssed is a discomfort with a plural identity. And what I am saying to you - and saying in the novel - is that we have got to come to terms with this. We are increasingly becoming a world of migrants, made up of bits and fragments from here, there. We are here. And we have never really left anywhere we have been.'' THE TROPICAL ISLE\nGibreel Farishta floating on his cloud formed the opinion that the moral fuzziness of the English was meteorologically induced. 'When the day is not warmer than the night,' he reasoned, 'when the light is not brighter than the dark, when the land is not drier than the sea, then clearly a people will lose the power to make distinctions, and commence to see everything -from political parties to sexual partners to religious beliefs - as much-the-same, nothing-to-chose, give-or-take. What folly! For truth is extreme, it is so and not thus, it is him and not her; a partisan matter, not a spectator sport. It is, in brief, heated. City,' he cried, and his voice rolled over the metropolis like thunder, 'I am going to tropicalize you.'\nGibreel enumerated the benefits of the proposed metamorphosis of London into a tropical city: increased moral definition, institution of a national siesta, development of vivid and expansive patterns of behaviour among the populace, higher-quality popular music, new birds in the trees (macaws, peacocks, cockatoos), new trees under the birds (coco-palms, tamarind, banyans with hanging beards). Improved street-life, outrageously coloured flowers (magenta, vermilion, neon-green), spider-monkeys in the oaks. A new mass market for domestic air-conditioning units, ceiling fans, anti-mosquito coils and sprays. A coir and copra industry. Increased appeal of London as a centre for conferences, etc.; better cricketers; higher emphasis on ball-control among professional footballers, the traditional and soulless English commitment to 'high workrate' having been rendered obsolete by the heat. Religious fervour, political ferment, renewal of interest in the intelligentsia. No more British reserve; hot-water bottles to be banished forever, replaced in the foetid nights by the making of slow and odorous love. Emergence of new social values: friends to commence dropping in on one another without making appointments, closure of old folks' homes, emphasis on the extended family. Spicier food; the use of water as well as paper in English toilets; the joy of running fully dressed through the first rains of the monsoon.\nDisadvantages: cholera, typhoid, legionnaires' disease, cockroaches, dust, noise, a culture of excess.\nStanding upon the horizon, spreading his arms to fill the sky, Gibreel cried: 'Let it be.'

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-23 00:00:00      \nA case was filed against the bus driver with Sreenagar police station on Friday night The bus driver's negligence caused the fatal road accident that claimed nine lives in Sreenagar upazila of Munshiganj, highway police has said. Hashara highway police outpost in-charge Inspector Md Abdul Based said vehicles were temporarily plying through the single lane on the highway's accident's spot, as another lane was blocked for development work. \"The maximum speed of a vehicle should be no more than 30kmph on that specific road. But, seeing the mangled microbus, we can assume that the bus hit the vehicle at a speed between 70-80kmp,\" he said. \"Besides, the microbus was travelling on the designated side, while the bus driver lost his control over the steering and rammed the microbus,\" the police official added. The Dhaka-bound microbus, which was carrying a groom's party from Louhajang upazila in Munshiganj, met a head-on collision with the bus of Swadhin Paribahan on the Dhaka-Mawa Highway in Shologhar area on Friday afternoon. Nine people, including five women and children, were killed and 13 others were injured in the accident. A case was filed against the bus driver with Sreenagar police station on Friday night. A five-member probe committee led by Additional District Magistrate Asma Shahin was formed to investigate the incident. Inspector Based said: \"Although the case was filed only against the driver, the bus owner will also be brought to book if he is found guilty in our investigation.\" Hashara highway police outpost Sub-Inspector (SI) Md Shahjahan, also the investigation officer of the case, said: \"We are conducting drives to arrest the bus driver.\" Meanwhile, all the nine deceased were buried after their funeral prayers on Saturday. The deceased are  Abdur Rashid Bepari, 70, Liza, 24, Tabassum, 6, Runa, 24, Renu, 12, Tahsan, 4, Keramat Bepari, 70, Mofizul Molla, 65, and the microbus driver Billal, 40. The  deceased were all residents of Louhajang, except for Billal,who hailed from Sreenagar. "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-30 00:00:00      \nA team of soon-to-retire engineers and an administration official are leaving for the US and the UK on a two-week trip ostensibly to learn about digging canals, protecting river banks, restoring embankments, and dredging rivers, which they had been doing for over three decades. Of the four officials approved for the trip by the water resources ministry, one is a senior engineer who would retire in December. Another engineer has about five months before he too would retire, official documents reveal. The officials going on the trip are: Additional Director General AKM Shamsul Karim, Additional Chief Engineer Mir Mosharrof Hossain and Superintendent Engineer Md Ruhul Amin of Bangladesh Water Development Board (WDB). They will be accompanied by Mahmudul Islam, additional secretary of the water resources ministry. The trip is part of a Tk195-crore project being implemented by Dockyard and Engineering Works Limited, an enterprise of Bangladesh Navy. The government officials have no direct role, except coordinating, in the project implementation, said water development board officials, requesting anonymity. Only three days before their scheduled trip, the officials couldn't even tell this correspondent what advanced knowledge they were hoping to gain and from which institutions in the US and the UK. The BWDB has a training institute in Munshiganj for its engineers. It also jointly runs Kaptai Training Institute with the Power Development Board.   Officials of the board said the expensive foreign trip was a farce and complete waste of public money. Asked what they are going to learn in the USA and the UK, Superintendent Engineer Ruhul Amin said, \"We will learn about Chicago harbour management, and see management of beaches, rivers, and coasts in the US and the UK.\" Asked which institution they would visit, he said, \"Dockyard and Engineering Works Limited will most likely hire an event management firm to conduct the study tour. There is a tentative programme, but I don't know much about it.\" He added that the event management firm will prepare the itinerary and estimate the expenses. He declined to disclose the name of the event management firm. The proposed expense is Tk 10 lakh per person, but that may change later, he said.   Asked how the people of this country would benefit from the training of Shamsul Karim, who is going to retire in December, Ruhul Amin said, \"The water resources ministry would be in a better position to respond to the question.\"   He added that he had made the proposal for the tour by the officials and then the water development board endorsed it. The additional secretary was included by the ministry. To a similar question asked over phone, Mir Mosharrof Hossain, additional chief engineer who retires in May, said, \"What will you do with this information?\" and hung up when pressed further. As to why the ministry approved the trip of soon-to-retire engineers,Mahmudul Islam, additional secretary to the water resources ministry, said, \"Normally, we don't intervene in what the board recommends.\" As to why the ministry endorsed the foreign tour of an engineer, who is retiring in a month, he said, \"I don't know.\"     Asked why he, being an administration official, is going on the trip, he said, \"It will help develop the knowledge base of the society.\" According to official records, Mahmudul Islam went on at least two foreign tours in October: one in Hungary and another in Japan.   Abdul Matin, professor of water resources engineering at Buet, said, \"I was not aware that senior engineers and non-engineers like them go abroad to get knowledge on river bank protection, dredging, canal digging, and embankment restoration.  \"We at Buet offer professional training and courses on water engineering,\" he said, \"Our department has given professional training to water board and LGED engineers with World Bank and ADB support.\" The foreign visit was proposed under Bakkhali River Flood Control, Drainage, Irrigation and Dredging project. The three-and-a-half-year project is scheduled to be completed in June next year and has made about 40 percent physical progress. Officials familiar with the proceedings said the trip was going to cost almost half a crore taka. According to a water resources ministry order issued on November 17, the officers would be deemed on duty while on the trip and they would be able to draw the regular pays and allowances. It is unlikely that the country would benefit from such an expensive trip by an admin cadre officer to learn technical matters, said a senior engineer of Water Development Board, adding that the officer in question might even get transferred to some other ministry in future. According to records, WDB engineers have built 16,261km of embankments, including 5,757km in coastal region, dredged 1,388km of rivers, and had done many other water development work.       Some of the WDB engineers are eminent experts with global recognition, said officials. The water resources ministry on November 24 sanctioned a nine-day \"experience sharing\" tour by eight officials in Australia and Malaysia to learn river bank protection, dredging and construction of earthen embankment under a Tk-510 crore project in Sirajganj. Among the officials chosen for the tour are a WDB chief engineer who would in December."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-23 00:00:00      \nThe prime minister is in the process of evaluating the first year of her running cabinet  A reshuffle in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's cabinet is likely to take place as soon as January, government high-ups have said.  The prime minister is now assessing the performances of all the cabinet members during the first year of the current government to this end, they added. \"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already discussed this issue with President Abdul Hamid,\" a top official from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) told Dhaka Tribune, requesting not to be named. \"The cabinet reshuffle was scheduled a day or two before the Awami League National Council, but was put on hold. It is most likely to take place during the first week of January.\" Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader, who just got re-elected as the general secretary of the ruling Awami League, has also hinted at the possibility of a reshuffle in the cabinet at the beginning of the new year.  \"There may be changes in the cabinet in the coming year,\" he told the media on Sunday. \"The ministers who did not perform as they were expected to in their respective offices may be reshuffled. Those who failed to do their job will be removed.\" Quader, party chief Sheikh Hasina's second-in-command, further said the prime minister is aiming at separating the roles of Awami League leaders within the party and the government.  That is the reason why seven influential leaders of the party, who are also members of the cabinet, are not a part of the new, partially announced Central Working Committee of the ruling party.  If the prime minister is adamant about separating the party from the government, then some ministers, who are also central leaders of the Awami League, may be gradually dropped from the cabinet.  When contacted on Monday, Abdur Rahman, a newly-elected presidium member of Awami League, told Dhaka Tribune: \"Awami League President Sheikh Hasina is the only authorized person who can tell why some of the ministers are dropped and some retained in the new central committee. I strongly believe that her decision will strengthen our party as well as our government.\"    According to speculations by some government high-ups, cabinet members like State Minister for Shipping Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Enamur Rahman, Deputy Minister for Water Resources AKM Enamul Hoque Shameem, and Deputy Minister for Education Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury Nowfel may get promoted during the reshuffle. Khalid, Enamul Hoque and Nowfel, who were organizing secretaries in the previous central committee of the Awami League, were dropped from the new committee.  The government sources further said some cabinet members' portfolios might be changed in the upcoming reshuffle, but the chances of cabinet members losing office is very slim as they have had only a year to work.  Requesting anonymity, a cabinet member recently told Dhaka Tribune that the Prime Minister's Office sought information on the cabinet members' performance over the past one year. \"The PMO issued a letter asking us how many days each of the cabinet members had spent abroad last year,\" the cabinet member said. \"We think the PMO is working on our ACR as January 7 is this cabinet's first anniversary.\" Winning the December 30 general election last year, the new, 46-member strong cabinet, led by Awami League President Sheikh Hasina, was sworn in on January 7 this year, with Hasina as the prime minister for the third consecutive term.  Five months later, on May 19, State Minister Murad Hassan was moved to the Ministry of Information from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The prime minister also shuffled personnel at the Ministries of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives, and the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology. On July 13, the prime minister promoted State Minister for Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment Imran Ahmad to the rank of minister. On the same day, she appointed Fazilatun Nessa Indira as the state minister for women and children affairs. "

Work on the bridge is stopped as the construction firm withdrew the workers around three months ago. Sadar Upazila Engineer of Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) Saiful Islam said the old bridge was washed away in the flood of 2015, so they floated a tender to build a new 190-foot-long and 20-foot-wide concrete bridge at a cost of Tk 2.41 crore. Local firm Messrs Mofakkharul Islam got work order in November, 2016, to complete it within two years. Visiting the site on January 22, this correspondent found that girders, wing walls and three pairs of pillars have been completed, but the railings on both sides of the bridge are still incomplete. No labourers or masons were present at the site, he added. The upazila engineer said only 70 percent of the work has been completed so far. The contractor did not build the approach roads but just dumped some sand on the two ends of the bridge, he added. Locals said they made a bamboo bridge on one side so that bikes and rickshaw vans can cross, but it is risky and people sometimes fall from it and get hurt. Tafser Ali of the area said a biker, Laxmikanta Roy, 50, was injured when he slipped from the risky makeshift bridge and fell on the dried river bed last week. He is undergoing treatment at Rangpur Medical College Hospital, Tafser added. Giriza Prosonna Roy, 60, a resident and an ex-schoolteacher, said the contractor took his workers to work at another site, leaving the bridge incomplete.  \"We are now compelled to bring groceries on trucks, travelling an additional 30 km,\" said Abdus Sattar, 45, a grocer of nearby Bahalipara market. Wahidul Islam, 55, headmaster of Ramnagar High School, said there are five schools on both sides of the river and many students cannot attend classes in the rainy season for want of a bridge. Contractor Mofakhkharul Islam Mamun refuted the allegatiosn, alleging that some people stopped the construction, claiming that the land belongs to them.  \"Initially, locals donated land to build the bridge and approach roads but now they are demanding compensation, which we cannot give as the government has not allocated any money. We want to solve the problems with the help of elected public representatives,\" said Md Belal Hossain, executive engineer of district LGED."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-01-11 00:00:00      \nThe internet has had a complete ball of a year, thanks to millennials turning older and 'CRAY-zier' and fighting the growing costs of living. If you think that this 'I cannot buy a home because I spent all my money on avocadoes and that is why I am sad' is a problem just in the west, just drag your mouse and zoom in on Dhaka on the map (especially on the tri-state area). While in the west millennials are struggling with how to finance their avocadoes, millennials in the east (yes, the privileged middle-class ones) are worried about how to appease their moms after breaking their 11:00pm curfew.  And then there was this past one year in Bangladesh, especially Dhaka, which was rocked by protest after protest. Some demanding better jobs, some for safer roads, and some completely losing their wits over Raba Khan as a panelist at the Dhaka Lit Fest. There was too much happening too fast and it felt as though the whole country was hopped up on steroids. And yours truly, was no different, what with constantly shielding numerous triggers and also succumbing to it time to time. Through all this, I also found very personal, often minute problems around me take centre stage; and while we all write for a particular audience or a cause whenever we pen a piece, I feel this article is a little bit of everything. By everything, I mean, it is a piece of writing for me, it is for those kindred spirits around me who have been overwhelmed by everything around them and it is my first, real attempt at writing about a life with anxiety and mental-health problems through the last and final years of 2010s and my own 20s. It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that this is a very real, sometimes debilitating health condition, and it was this very year that I finally acknowledged the need for help. Be it through therapy, through reading, through cooking or through long, sometimes hyperactive, conversations with friends going through the same. And in all of this, constantly questioning everything, my job, my education, my choices, is this shirt too loose? After all, Sigmund Freud proclaimed in his classic introductory lectures on psychoanalysis, \"There is no question that the problem of anxiety is a nodal point at which the most various and important questions converge, a riddle whose solution would be bound to throw a flood of light on our whole mental existence.\" Like I said, this past year has had its fair share of triggers: the violent turn of the quota-reform movement, mass arrests of student leaders, another violent turn of the movement for safer roads, the passing of the Digital Security Act, the definitive knowledge that the areas near Sundarbans will become an industrial zone and all the concerns that come with living in Dhaka. And that some form of anxiety stopped me from even vocalising these concerns on a social media platform was something I realised much later. It is exactly the splitting image of what Montreal-based designer and illustrator Catherine Lepage drew in her Thin Slices of Anxiety: Observations and Advice to Ease a Worried Mind. In the image, there are two faces, one of a \"normal person\" and the other of an anxious person and much like Freud's take on anxiety, the field of vision for an anxious person is essentially gazing inward; it is a convergent world view. Despite this newfound knowledge (that everything just converges inside my head) of anxiety and (ir)regular visits to the therapist, I still felt something was amiss. Thus, began a journey of reading, finding out and turning that gaze more and more inward to understand what is it that has us millennials (the very numbered few in Bangladesh with access to internet and the vast world of memes and a grasp of the language English) in such a frenzy. Despite the nonchalant use of the term these days, the notion of anxiety as a clinical category only appeared as recently as thirty years ago, according to a mental health memoir--My Age of Anxiety: Fear, Hope, Dread, and the Search for Peace of Mind--by Scott Stossel, familiar to most as the editor of The Atlantic. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, some forty million Americans, nearly one in seven, are suffering from some kind of anxiety disorder at any given time, accounting for 31 percent of expenditures on mental health care in the United States. This is not a purely American phenomenon though, as studies have revealed this is a problem in Britain and Canada too. And without resorting to any study, I can say that I have successfully managed to only make friends or associate with people who, a. either suffer from a mental health problem or, b. have a family member with said problem and have an acute understanding of it. Whether this helps us connect, I do not know. But these friends, for me, managed to bring to life the classic Beatles song \"I get by with a little help from my friends\". And this network of people constantly battling the everyday kept me afloat with a supply of books to read, articles to bookmark and recipes to try out, all just in an attempt to fight the inner demons that sometimes threaten to overthrow us all. One Friday, with one friend I would conduct a long-distance cook off, making as many egg dishes as we could, exchanging photos of our breakfast bonanza and then launching a day-long discussion on why social media is pure evil and everyone just showcases a life living in hyperboles. It was also while trying to navigate anxiety I chanced upon old hobbies, things my grandparents always advised would ease a troubled mind. I took up painting (essentially stroking paintbrushes on a blank canvas, soothing nonetheless), I started going to the gym and oh, of course, I continued with the therapy. These home \"remedies\" of ours also found validation through an article published on The Guardian by Gaby Hinsliff which says \"Run, swim, cook: the new prescription for happiness\". While, cooking, swimming, reading or running are by no means meant to cure/solve mental health problems, they have in many ways helped me cope and tackle the everyday. These activities were of course supplemented with professional help. I also reread some old favorites--Heidi and The Magic Faraway Tree--and I read some new ones, ones that were written either by anxious people themselves or with a storyline that I identified with. My personal favorite was First, We Make the Beast Beautiful by Sarah Wilson. Anxiety is layered and is complex. No one better than Stossel can put it though: \"The truth is that anxiety is at once a function of biology and philosophy, body and mind, instinct and reason, personality and culture. Even as anxiety is experienced at a spiritual and psychological level, it is scientifically measurable at the molecular level and the physiological level.\" On a parting note, I want to say one last thing. I am no philosopher but I do believe philosophies are born either out of luxuries or trying times. While navigating the upset and worry of Bangladesh's politics (I categorise this as a trying time) and the debate on \"WHY IS RABA KHAN on a DLF panel\" (this I categorise as a luxury by all means) did not give birth to a thinker in me, it surely got me musing on a life full of fleeting thoughts and fighting anxiety."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-31 00:00:00      \nA necessity for the vulnerable sector    Bangladesh is recognized as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change because of its geographical location and socio-demographic features. Agriculture is the most significant economic sector in Bangladesh. Despite Bangladesh's remarkable achievement in improving agricultural productivity, the sector is facing risk from climate change, extreme weather events, and sea level rise to address the adverse impact of climate change on agriculture. Climate change is expected to decrease Bangladesh's agriculture GDP by 3.1 % each year (World Bank). For example, the damage from climate change effect in 2007 and 2009 cyclones were estimated at around 2 million metric tons of rice, which is enough to feed 10 million people.  Transforming the agricultural sector and building resilience will not be possible if there is no significant amount of capital available for climate-smart investments in agriculture. Moreover, robust financial investments are needed to support the global food system. Climate finance plays a pivotal role by supporting developing countries to reduce emissions, decarbonize their economies. Climate finance in agricultural sector innovates ways to use climate finance to improve and increases access to finance for smallholder farmers in the agricultural sector while delivering positive outcomes namely increased resilience and reduced emissions intensity. The smallholder farmers are the most vulnerable vast majority of farmers who have little or no capacity to adapt, lack a safety net, and are highly exposed threat in their livelihood and food security risks. Bangladesh is among the largest recipients of climate funds from International Finance Corporation, World Bank mostly for adaptation in the agricultural sector. Climate finance budget allocation for the Ministry of Agriculture in 2018-19 is Tk13,915 crore where climate-relevant allocation is 39 percent (Finance Division, Ministry of Finance). Adaptations to climate change for agricultural sectors include: resilient variety crops, new and diverse cropping pattern, irrigation techniques, sustainable land management, early warning systems, new research. In this case, climate finance acts as a remedy as it helps to adopt many strategies to cope with the existing situations and those expected to impact the country in the future. Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) mainly focuses on the promotion of agricultural practises focusing on floating gardens, community-based adaptation, advocacy for climate change adaptation measures, coastline and flood defences. Bangladeshi agricultural scientists have encouraged adopting new technologies and developing climate-smart crop varieties, as a means to diversify the agrarian practices of subsistence farmers. Due to the fund, many farmers are reporting experiencing increasing bumper yields. Thus through the use of new practices and new technologies climate change finance has, for now, improved the situation for some farmers.   CourtesyExamples of adaptation for the agriculture sector Floating Gardens are a process used in many regions during the monsoon season, ingenious farmers create their floating seedbeds and grow plants on floating gardens. Hydroponics system in Bangladesh, based on floating gardens, was recognized in December 2014 by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) for innovation, sustainability, and adaptability. Farmers in some parts of the country where flood waters can remain for a prolonged period have developed floating gardens in which plants can grow on the water on floating organic beds of water hyacinth, algae and other plant residues. This environmentally friendly traditional cultivation technique utilizes the natural resources of wetlands to grow vegetables and other crops almost all year round, providing numerous social, economic, agricultural, and ecological benefits to the local population. It helps the farmers to cope with the situation. Sunflower oil production is recently introduced as a quality-based oilseed crop and is gaining popularity among local farmers because of its easy extraction method. Sunflower is categorised as a low to medium drought sensitive crop. The cultivation of sunflower may be suitable in the coastal environment because of its high yield and wide adaptability. In 16 districts of Bangladesh, sunflower oil is being harvested, and the average production is about 1.2t/ha, which is relatively encouraging. Shrimp farming is a relatively new form of agriculture introduced in Bangladesh on a commercial scale. Shrimp can cultivation is possible in both brackish and freshwater. Currently, shrimp fish cultivation is widespread throughout the coastal region and Bangladesh produces more than 2.5 % of the global production of shrimp and has become the seventh largest exporter of shrimp to the Japanese and USA markets. Rainwater harvesting is a method of inducing, collecting, storing, and conserving local surface runoff for agricultural production. Farmers in water-scarce areas face difficulties in agricultural output due to unavailability of water at the right time and in the right amount. It is expected that the use of rainwater will save farmers' money as well as increase production. Rainwater harvesting can be effectively used by farmers to overcome the hardships of nature. The method of rainwater harvesting for agriculture is standard as a result of the irregular nature of rain in many countries and is widely practised in areas where there is an irregularity in seasonal rains. Rainwater harvesting technology help store water in the rainy seasons, for usage, during the drought period. Agriculture is the most vulnerable sector as its productivity depends on climatic factors like temperature, rainfall, light intensity, radiation and sunshine duration, which are predicted to become increasingly erratic. The number of climate change induced disasters has and will continue to increase over the coming years. Therefore, climate finance mechanisms have the potential to continue to strengthen the links between financial institutions and smallholder farmers by addressing some of the critical financial-sector constraints on agriculture.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-02 00:00:00      \nIs this unprecedented or is history repeating itself? \"War is Peace/Freedom is Slavery/Ignorance is Strength\" runs the slogan of the \"Party\" ruling fictional Oceania in George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984. The motto illustrates the seductive appeal of Doublethink -- the ability to juxtapose mutually contradictory themes or ideas simultaneously. Seven decades after its initial publication, Orwell's grim vision of a dystopia envisages a society run by a repressive totalitarian state through intrusive surveillance and coercive censorship; the stamping out of even the mildest form of disagreement or dissent; relentless barrage of counter-factual propaganda; promotion of perpetual war and unabashedly eulogizing and extolling the cult of personality. Orwell partially based his work on the nightmarish horrors of Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Terms such as thoughtcrime, unperson, Ministry of Truth, and Big Brother have entered the popular lexicon and become emblematic of oppressive societal control by the state through bureaucratic, technological, and economic means.  The wave of populism that seems to have swept the world is often pointed out to be the beginning of dystopia. Populism rests on the twin pillars of disconnect and discontent of the masses with the extant political, economic and social system, and the polarization and fragmentation of the body politic of the nation.  The populist movement basks on a binary, exclusionary principle of the righteous versus the damned; us versus them; hard working patriotic populace versus the corrupt elite; the son of the soil versus the foreigner. The perception of an imminent threat or danger captures the public's imagination. The populist leader, like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, plays upon these fears and magnifies them. By whipping the crowd to a feverish frenzy, through nonstop agitprop, he consolidates their support, and converts it to favourable tangible electoral outcome, which in turn helps him to acquire the reins of power of the state. Once in power, he chips away at the old system and shows scant regard for convention and long-established tradition, in a bid to centralize power and shore up his authority. Sooner rather than later, key components of a functioning democracy such as transparency, accountability, stakeholder consultation, and engagement, are diluted or are dispensed with, on the spurious plea of efficacious governance or averting a national catastrophe.  The media is coaxed, cajoled, or coerced into pliant submission; segments of the intelligentsia and civil society are brought on board by the lure of lucre and plush appointments; the independence of the judiciary is diluted and compromised. Dissenting voices and conscientious objectors are singled out, vilified and ostracized by a baying mob which supports the populist leader to the hilt. The progressive dumbing down of the populace is accompanied by an exponential decay in the civil and democratic rights of the citizens and the journey to dystopia has started in earnest. Look no farther than the Third Reich, under Adolf Hitler, for corroboration of this denouement. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, Orwell's dark musings of an undesirable future appears eerily prophetic in an era of nihilism, anarchism, sectarianism, racism, casteism, ethnocentrism, bigotism, religious radicalism, corporatism, majoritarianism, populism, nativism, protectionism, hyper nationalism, and unilateralism. The prevalent mood of cynicism stands in stark contrast to the brief period of heady optimism following the end of the Cold War, courtesy of the implosion and spectacular collapse of the mighty monolith called the Soviet Union. A false dawn It was erroneously believed that the \"benign\" forces of free market capitalism, rules-based free trade-centric globalization, western style liberal democracy, and technological advancement, under the aegis of Pax Americana, would usher in an era of unrivaled peace and prosperity for all humanity and make the world a truly global village. Yet, within a brief span of three decades, it increasingly seems to be a false dawn. The global hegemon, instead of displaying robust leadership, has been assailed by self-inflicted contradictions. The lone superpower of the world, the United States of America, rallies to the chant of \"Make America Great Again\" which in itself is problematic as it shows a loss of confidence and serious self-doubt in its manifest destiny. The locomotive of global growth in the world seems unduly perturbed by the rise of China, which in essence is an upper-middle-income country, whose per capita income is still only about a quarter of that of high-income countries. The country that invented the global trade order, WTO, and championed free trade, now is trigger-happy at lashing punitive tariffs and starting bruising trade wars with trusted partners and allies; not to mention, renegotiating trade agreements and distancing itself from multilateral institutions and initiatives.  A country founded by immigrants wanting to escape the ravages of a sectarian, war-weary old world now talks of fencing its borders; a country possessing the mightiest military in recorded history wastes time, energy, and resources picking up a fight with Iran, which by all accounts is a regional power at best in the Middle East (ranking way behind Israel and Turkey); a country which boasts of technological behemoths like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and is still a magnet for the best and brightest in the world, worries about losing its competitive edge to rivals; a country which has a proud and long-running democratic tradition loudly champions petty dictators and autocrats.  The United States of America was supposed to be a shining beacon of hope for the rest of the world to admire and emulate. Yet, it has become subsumed with angst, torpor, and inherent self contradictions. The only country limiting the US's boundless potential is the US itself. A lot has been written and speculated about the most powerful man in the world by virtue of being the elected leader of the lone superpower. President Donald Trump basically exhibits the traits of a dyed-in-the-wool third-world demagogic populist leader which includes his penchant for indulging in diplomacy by Twitter; reliance on transactional diplomacy; belittling heads of states of allies; intolerance towards criticism (a genuine South Asian trait); dismissing unflattering reports and coverage as fake news; engaging in perilous brinkmanship with puny regional rivals; a constant showman's urge to steal the thunder and be in the spotlight; the desire to be surrounded by \"yes men\" and sycophants; the overt reliance on immediate family members for state-related affairs; the politically incorrect statements and lack of diplomatic finesse; the penchant for vitriolic statements and stoking of sectarian divide; the impatience with nuanced, multifaceted arguments and complex reasoning; the tendency to run roughshod over bipartisanship and common consensus. Yet, it is an incontrovertible fact that he retains the fervent support of large swathes of decent, ordinary Americans who feel cheated by the system at Capitol Hill and are disenchanted with the status quo; who are struggling to make ends meet; whose livelihoods are threatened by outsourcing, rash of cheap imports, and automation and lopsided trade agreements; flood of unskilled and semi-skilled immigrant workers who take up the bulk of blue collar jobs; ballooning cost of health care and education; tired with America's never-ending engagement in military conflicts in remote corners of the globe and the funds that flow out of taxpayers' money to shore up tottering regimes.  It would be a disservice to dismiss Trump as merely a populist leader. He has, by the perfect sleight of hand (despite being a privileged insider), posed as an outsider, to arrive at the epicentre of power -- skillfully playing to the anxiety and fears of the ordinary Caucasian American. Lessons from Ancient Rome America has been long compared to the other superpower of yesteryears, Ancient Rome. Indeed, the Founding Fathers had been keen students of the Roman Republic and drew inspiration from it to devise a host of checks and balances and separation of power between the executive, legislative, and the judiciary.  The decline and fall of the Roman Empire is keenly studied by American scholars and strategists to draw lessons from, in order to avert a similar fate for American global hegemony. Hence, it is not surprising that Trump's ascent to power and mannerisms have often been compared to eccentric and notorious Roman emperors.  Case in point, he has been compared to the infamous second emperor of Rome, Caligula, who loved to put on a spectacle, reveled in insulting and humiliating people, and treated the then elites, the senatorial class, like dirt. He despised traditional Roman values and practices and wanted to mold Rome in his own image. Yet he was wildly popular with the ordinary Romans, who were grateful for the games and circuses that Caligula lavishly funded at his own expense. Caligula had the unstinting support of the Roman mob till his last day before his assassination.   On the other hand, supporters of Trump could compare him to the legendary Gracchi brothers, during the Roman Republic era, who, despite being born in a wealthy aristocratic family, went into collision course with the elites who ruled Rome. By taking on the side of the urban poor masses of Rome -- the plebeians -- they swept to power and enacted sweeping land and other economic reforms (which in today's parlance could be called pro-poor).  Both brothers ended up being killed by a vengeful elite, resentful at its loss of power. However, that set in a chain of instability and violence, which sounded the death knell of the Republic and paved the way for autocratic control. Which emperor Trump resembles is a matter of debate amongst classicists and historians. However, one thing is certain: America will not be the same after Trump. Trump joins a spate of maverick leaders who have had a brush with populism, who draw strength from polarization and divisiveness and are considered as a threat to the established political order, yet cannot be beaten outright in elections -- Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Narendra Modi of India, Rodrigo Duterte of Philippines, Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom and, to a certain extent, Vladimir Putin of Russia (who is more of a nationalist leader, emulating the footsteps of past Russian Tsars and Tsarinas such as Peter the Great and Catherine the Great). All of these leaders can be considered as Novus Homo in the political arena who have upset the apple cart and jettisoned the existing power brokers, and are seen as an embodiment of the voices of the overlooked, neglected, and marginalized stratum of the population. In a desire to get rid of sheer lawlessness, endemic corruption, and weak  governance, they have reposed their trust in these leaders.  Often, religious revivalism has gone hand in hand with populism to raise these leaders to the crest of popularity and mass adulation. The common man has derived vicarious pleasure as these leaders have proceeded to displace the effete elite and the chattering classes to ignominious oblivion. Populism thus can be seen as the revenge of the masses against the elite and the intelligentsia and is often viewed as an anti-intellectual, revisionist movement.  Inevitably, there have been accusations of derailment and displacement of democratic practices and concomitant increase in authoritarianism. Europe, too, is brimming with populist leaders such as Marine Le Pen of France, Viktor Orban of Poland, Matteo Salvini of Italy, and Geert Wilders of Netherlands, to name a few. It is feared that the wave of populism may have a cascading effect on other countries with dysfunctional democracies and weak institutions.  A long history However, contrary to popular perception, populism and its inherent dangers is not a new phenomenon. It too has a long history. Ancient Athens has been hailed as the birthplace of western democracy. In fact, the very word democracy is derived from the Greek demokratia (popular government) combining demos (common people) and kratos (rule or strength). The Ancient Athenians were among the handful few, who pioneered directly representative government based on free male citizen suffrage, two and a half millennia back.  However, the system was not truly democratic as it excluded women and slaves. It was also vulnerable to the threat of demagogues (yet another Greek term) who adroitly manipulated the emotions of the mob. Socrates, the father of Western philosophy was highly skeptical of the benefits of democracy and wary of the danger of demagogues usurping power through popular support.  Socrates asserted that voting in an election required skill, rational thinking, and prior education and should not be based on intuition and emotion. He routinely attacked the democratic government of the day and eventually paid a steep price for it as he was sentenced to death in 399 BCE for disturbing the peace and corrupting the impressionable youth of the city state.  No wonder, that his most famous disciple, Plato, looked down on democracy with barely concealed contempt and envisaged an ideal state as run by a philosopher king who would be aided by a select handful of elites. Athenian experiment with democracy soon petered out due to bitter infighting and foreign Macedonian occupation. Republican Rome was determined to resist the rule of autocratic tyrants and kings. Yet the late republic's history was a violent and chequered one as it was marked by increasing conflict between different factions vying for control of the most powerful city in the world, with mob support. Populist leaders like Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus (the Gracchi brothers), Clodius Pulcher, Lucius Cataline, and even the great Julius Caesar all chose to entice the Roman mob with promises of land redistribution, the waiving off of debt, and provision of free bread, circus, and games.  Wave after wave of populist leaders bred conflict and civil war and irreparably damaged the republican institutions of Rome. It was with weary resignation that Republican Rome voluntarily transitioned to Imperial Rome, under the rule of Augustus in 27 BCE. The intellectual raison d'etre behind the enduring appeal of populism, despite the inherent dangers of chaos and dystopia, can partially be found in the works of Thomas Carlyle, Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, and Max Weber. Carlyle, a nineteenth century British polymath, in his collection of lectures, later published as On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History, he famously stated that the world's history is nothing more than a collection of biographies belonging to great men.  He posited that great leaders throughout history were destined to lead and deserved to do so because of their inherent abilities. This in effect reduced the surrounding institutions and structures to little or no import. Great leaders arose at a time of great need, when the society or nation was facing a grave existential crisis. This laid the modern foundation for the Cult of Personality and the Messiah Complex.  Then there is the German philosopher, Nietzsche, who had the most outsized influence in history with his concept of the Ubermensch or Overman/Superman that he introduced and fleshed upon in his seminal work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra. An Overman is one who is able to influence and affect history indefinitely. He is one who is willing to risk all for the sake of upliftment and enhancement of humanity. An Overman does not shy away from creating and propagating his own values, independent from the rest of humanity who are prone to follow herd-instinct.  One of Nietzsche's claim to infamy is that his works influenced later day Anarchist movement and Nazism. (Hitler greatly admired his work and fancied himself as an Ubermensch). Max Weber, a German sociologist and political economist, introduced his concept of charismatic authority in the Essay, \"The Three Types of Legitimate Rule.\" The charismatic leadership style relies on the charm and persuasiveness of the leader. Charismatic leaders are driven by their convictions and commitment to their cause. Charismatic leadership, according to Weber, is found in a leader with extraordinary characteristics of individual, whose mission and vision inspire others. All the three theories have a common thread running through them -- that of a larger than life figure, who is capable of exerting great influence on the society and reshaping history. Despite the criticisms, these theories are able to explain somewhat the hypnotic appeal of populist leaders in a post-modern age of mechanization, standardization, regulation, automation, virtual reality, and low sense of self-worth and absence of clear direction.  In a time of uncertainty and confusion, people flock to leaders with firm opinions and explicitly stated convictions who do not shy away from being politically incorrect or scapegoating a minority for the ills that afflict them. The peril of dystopia is ignored for the warm comfort of firm, decisive leadership.  Ibn Khaldun, the brilliant medieval Arab scholar, believed that history repeated itself in a cyclical manner. If so then the experiment with Western style liberal democracy may have run out of steam and the age of populist dystopia may have begun. Only time will tell.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-18 00:00:00      \nAccording to the Global Risks Report 2020 from the World Economic Forum (WEF), biodiversity loss is now the third most serious risk our world is facing in terms of impact. In its 15-year history, the Global Risks Report has never listed biodiversity loss as one of the top five global crises in terms of impact, although it did make the top five global risks in terms of likelihood in 2011, and is featured in the latter list for 2020 as well. Weapons of mass destruction occupied the top position for global risks in terms of impact for the last three years. It is now number two, losing its position to climate change or more specifically, our failure to take proper action against climate change. Biodiversity conservation and climate change are topics that often come to the fore in discussions. The Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) is an example of this. The BCCSAP talks about adaptations in the fisheries sector, livelihoods in ecologically sensitive areas, and the creation of coastal forests to fight cyclones. \"Monitoring of the ecosystem and biodiversity changes and their impacts\" is, however, the only programme in that document that explicitly mentions biodiversity. Nevertheless, given the urgency of other climate actions, like flood risk management or inventing climate-resilient crops, one may expect biodiversity-related actions to get less priority among the 44 programmes listed in the BCCSAP. Back in 2010, when Bangladeshi climate change activists and environmentalists were disappointed with the outcome of the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in December 2009 and the country's own Bangladesh Climate Change Trust (BCCT) and the donor-funded Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) were yet to be functional, something fantastic happened. Two long-term development partners of Bangladesh, the British Department for International Development (DFID) and the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), supported the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to produce the \"Protocol for Monitoring of Impacts of Climate Change and Climate Variability in Bangladesh\". This was indeed a ground-breaking effort by Bangladesh. After rigorous exercise, detailed methodologies and indicators were developed to measure climate change impacts on the biodiversity of our rivers, wetlands, coasts, sea, and forests. It also did the same for other important areas, like hydro-meteorology, agriculture, livestock, human health, livelihoods, and poverty. After its publication in 2011, if used, this comprehensive impact monitoring protocol could have helped us to learn how our biodiversity has been changing over the past decade due to climate change and how to respond to that. Unfortunately, this never happened--a missed opportunity indeed. In fact, this document and long-term biodiversity monitoring simply disappeared from the climate change discussions in Bangladesh. It is not mentioned, for example, in the second and third National Communications on climate change submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2012 and 2018, respectively, or in the sixth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) submitted in November 2019. The BCCRF has so far allocated around USD 385 million to a wide range of ministries, agencies and NGOs to implement about 660 climate change projects. However, it did not fund any large-scale, long-term biodiversity and ecosystem monitoring project; it only supported a short-term one in the coastal areas, with the Nature Conservation Management (NACOM), through the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF) in 2013. Bangladesh has completed a good number of biodiversity projects since the impact monitoring protocol was finalised. Large, multi-year conservation projects, like the Integrated Protected Area Conservation (2009-2012) and Climate Resilient Ecosystems and Livelihoods (2013-2018), both supported by USAID, engaged in biodiversity monitoring in the protected areas to check project impacts. The Wetland Biodiversity Rehabilitation Project (2009-2016), supported by the German agency GIZ, monitored the aquatic biodiversity of the wetlands and rivers of the Rajshahi region, continuing two years after the main project activities were finished. However, none of these projects, such as the USD 36 million Strengthening Regional Cooperation for Wildlife Project (2011-2016) of the Bangladesh Forest Department or the Switzerland-funded Tanguar Haor project (2006-2016) of the IUCN, thought of monitoring climate change impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. These missed opportunities show that even long-term conservation initiatives that are sufficiently funded by single donors can fail to acknowledge the need for long-term biodiversity monitoring with regard to climate change. They failed to see beyond the project tenure. Our recent conservation projects have been thinking more of people, rather than biodiversity per se. It is true--we have lost a decade and are still yet to combine biodiversity monitoring with climate change, but let us now look forward by looking into the past. One of the best examples of long-term monitoring of biodiversity in Bangladesh is the migratory water bird census. Every winter, the Bangladesh Bird Club (BBC), a group of bird-enthusiasts, coordinates this survey in haors, riverine chars, and the coastal areas of Bangladesh. Over the last three decades, this census has been giving us a yearly picture of migratory water birds, their numbers and diversity. We can now use this large database and link it with national and regional climate data from the past 30 years to explain changes in the migratory birds' visits to Bangladesh. We can do the same for other ecosystems. Numerous projects and individual researchers have been collecting biodiversity and ecological data from different forests and wetlands, as well as natural and modified ecosystems, for a long time. We can compile the data, analyse it, and study the trends of change in certain wildlife, plants or other elements of a particular ecosystem over the past few decades. Relating biodiversity data with changes in our climate could help us to forecast the future trends and plan for it. But who will lead or coordinate such ventures? We have two real opportunities before us. The Bangladesh Forest Department is now implementing the USD 175 million Sustainable Forests and Livelihoods (SUFAL) project, funded by the World Bank, to be run till 2023. This project has an \"Innovation Window\" to fund research proposals, including those related to climate change impacts on forests and biodiversity conservation. SUFAL can take up the impact monitoring protocol developed by the IUCN in 2011, update it, and start implementation. This would be a fantastic step forward, one which should have started long ago. The second opportunity comes with the second phase of the Sundarban Management Project (2019-22). In this phase, GIZ plans to establish a model of ecological monitoring of the Sundarbans, which will later be scaled up for the whole forest. UNESCO's World Heritage Committee (WHC) has been expecting ecological monitoring reports on the Bangladesh Sundarbans since 2016. In 2017, the Bangladesh Forest Department compiled available ecological data and submitted a report to the WHC. That report could be a good starting point and climate change-biodiversity aspects could be included in it, which is also what the WHC suggested. We talk about creating new forests with billions of seedlings to remove extra carbon dioxide from the air and fight climate change. Stopping ecological destruction, protecting existing forests and wetlands, and restoring damaged ecosystems are also an important part of reducing climate change impacts. At the same time, we should immediately put together our biodiversity information and climate data, in order to analyse the past changes, predict the future, and make preparations for what lies ahead.

      "text": "Shaping a Summit Agenda: Mitterrand and Bush Goals\n1989-07-11T05:00:00.000Z\nAs the leaders of the seven leading industrialized democracies prepare to meet here on Friday, President Francois Mitterrand of France is pushing for the annual Group of Seven summit conference to focus on helping the world's poor nations.\nWith France celebrating the 200th anniversary of its Revolution, Mr. Mitterrand wants the talks to help lighten the third world's $1.3 trillion debt burden and to underwrite a $5 billion project to fight flooding in Bangladesh.\nBut President Bush, attending his first summit meeting as President, already appears to be undercutting, or at least sidetracking, Mr. Mitterrand's agenda by pushing for the talks to focus more on Eastern Europe. Mr. Bush, who will have just visited Poland and Hungary, will press the leaders to make a strong statement supporting the moves toward democracy in those countries.\nOfficials planning the three-day talks say Mr. Bush, who today announced a six-part program of American aid to Poland, will call on his partners to provide more aid to Poland. But there is already some dispute among the meeting nations about how much of the aid should come from deficit-ridden Washington and how much from Eastern Europe's neighbors in Western Europe. The Group of Seven nations that will be meeting in Paris - the United States, France, Britain, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan - are expected to back President Bush's call for debt relief for Poland, including rescheduling its $39 billion in debt. 5,000 Journalists With 5,000 journalists converging on Paris, the summit conference could become, like some of the 14 previous meetings, a klieg-light-filled stage. With the world watching, the leaders seize the occasion to try to carve out the image they want.\nWhile some French politicians and newspapers have accused President Mitterrand of trying to turn the ''bicentennial'' summit meeting into a coronation, Mr. Mitterrand's aides say he his goal for the talks is to carry on the ideals of the French Revolution.\nFor his part, President Bush, some French commentators say, wants to show that he is leader of the West and that Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, has nothing on him in setting the world's agenda.\nWith the rise of the Green movement in many countries, the leaders are also jockeying to show they are friends of the earth. Thus the environment will be high on the agenda, with agreements in sight on protecting the ozone layer and oceans. There is a dispute, however, on the best approach to take on the problem of global warming.\nNonetheless, one senior official working on preparations for the talks said, ''The fact that this will be the first time the environment is looked at fully at a summit shows that this is a turning point.''\nWith the dollar sliding in recent days back into a range that finance ministers find comfortable, several officials said the dollar would not be a big issue. They said the Group of Seven would repeat past statements about the benefits of currency stability, fighting inflation and international economic cooperation. Often a Maverick\nMr. Mitterrand, often an unpredictable maverick at international gatherings, is under intense criticism at home for making the celebration of the French Revolution an event dominated by the rich - or at least the rich nations. Thus, Mr. Mitterrand's aides say, he will use the summit conference itself to show his critics he is the best friend the poor nations have in the industrial world.\nTo make sure the bicentennial celebrations are not an exclusive preserve of the rich nations, the French Government also plans to entertain leaders from two dozen developing nations, including India, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil, the Philippines, Senegal and Zaire.\nThe visiting leaders from poor and rich nations alike will be treated by the French to dinner at the new Glass Pyramid at the Louvre, the opening of the new Bastille Opera House and good seats for the Bicentennial Parade on the Champs-Elysees on Friday. There will be 30,000 soldiers and police officers for security. Extending Hand to Poor\nThe summit conference itself will extend a hand to poor nations in several ways.\nFirst, the industrial world's leaders will seek to give some impetus to the four-month-old debt plan proposed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. This plan calls for commercial banks to reduce the annual debt service of middle-income countries.\nSeveral officials from several countries said they wanted to continue putting pressure on commercial banks to make concessions to the middle-income debtor nations like Brazil and Mexico. They said it was not yet time for the industrial nations to adopt a more generous debt strategy because that could reduce the pressure on the commercial banks.\nSeveral months ago French officials said they would push for a plan in which the International Monetary Fund would use $10 billion in special drawing rights to guarantee interest payments owed by debtor nations. This would give banks an incentive to forgive some debts or lend new money. Time Is Not Right\nFrench officials now say that the time is not right for a new plan and that the Brady plan should be given a chance to work. However, since President Mitterrand is under such pressure to show he is a friend of the poor, some officials believe he might begin arguing that the Brady plan is inadequate and a new plan is needed.\nIn another measure to help the poor, the seven leaders are expected to agree to pursue a $5 billion, 20-year program to protect Bangladesh against flooding. President Mitterrand is pushing for a program to build embankments and take other flood-prevention measures. In September, more than 2,000 people died in Bangladesh from flooding that left millions homeless.\n''This will prove to the world that we can provide concrete help to people in need,'' one aide said.\nFrance also hopes to win backing for a plan that would combine scientific studies and land-management programs to fight the expansion of the Sahara. Some 20 million acres are lost each year to desert, and the plan aims to help reverse the loss of grazing land.\nOn the issue of global warming, France is seeking an agreement to cut carbon dioxide emissions contingent upon scientific findings that global warming is, in fact, taking place. Many scientists say heat is trapped as carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere. Approach Called Hasty\nBut some officials say the French approach is too hasty because so many scientists are not convinced that global warming is occurring. ''The idea of reducing carbon dioxide emissions will hurt because it involves cars, power plants and factories,'' one aide said.\nSeveral officials foresee a compromise in which the leaders call for an international conference on global warming.\n''Environmental protection has to be based on sound science, but we also need to say on sound economics as well,'' one senior British official said.\nSeveral aides said the seven nations would affirm in strong language May's Helsinki agreement, in which 81 nations declared their intent to phase out the use of chlorofluorocarbons by 2000."

      "text": "World Hunger Found Still Growing\n1987-06-28T05:00:00.000Z\nDespite repeated international pledges to eliminate hunger in the world, the number of hungry, undernourished people now appears to be increasing at a quickening pace, according to new findings by a United Nations agency.\nMoreover, the increase in hunger is coming at a time when the world is awash with cheap surplus food, disproving the grim Malthusian prediction that rising population levels will eventually outrun the world's ability to feed its inhabitants.\nAt the 13th ministerial meeting of the United Nations World Food Council in Beijing this month, food and agriculture ministers from more than 30 countries received new estimates suggesting that the problem of hunger and malnutrition in parts of the developing world was getting worse.\nAccording to calculations made by the council and its parent body, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, based in Rome, the number of hungry people in the world grew by 15 million from 1970 to 1980, to some 475 million, a rate of increase of about 1.5 million a year. The world's population is about five billion. Slower Growth Fuels Poverty\nIn the early 1980's, however, as economic growth slowed in the industrial nations, increasing the poverty of the developing nations, the pool of hungry people grew at a rate of nearly eight million a year, reaching 512 million in 1985, according to the World Food Council.\nDevelopment experts calculate that an economic slowdown in the industrial world reduces third-world income almost twice as much, with the poorest populations suffering even more, although hunger exists in virtually every nation.\nMost of those described as hungry by the council are not starving. But the council's chief of policy development, Uwe Kracht, said: ''They are chronically deprived of the food needed to enjoy an active, healthy life. Their lives are significantly impaired by poor diet.''\nEvidence that hunger is still increasing despite record harvests in many places comes from a World Bank study published last year. The study estimated the number of hungry people in 1980 at 340 million to 720 million and said the number had increased in the previous decade. 'A Reasonable Midpoint'\nThe lower figure referred to those with a calorie intake below that necessary ''to prevent serious health risks and stunted children,'' according to the study, and the higher number was based on a calorie intake allowing ''an active working life.''\n''Definitions of hunger vary,'' Dr. Kracht said, ''but our figure of 512 million seriously hungry people is a reasonable midpoint between the World Bank's low and high figures.''\nAlthough hunger effects the largest proportion of the population in the nations of black Africa with crippled economies, about two-thirds of the undernourished are found in the more densely populated Asian countries.\nChildren appear to be the prime victims. The World Food Council estimates that 40,000 children die of hunger-related causes every day. Rise in Child Mortality\nA recent report by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, supported this broad picture. The report found that after a significant decline in infant and child mortality in the 1960's and 1970's, the decline slowed in the 1980's and in some countries has been reversed.\n''In the last two years, more children have died in India and Pakistan than in all the 46 nations of Africa together,'' Unicef said. ''In 1986 more children died in Bangladesh than in Ethiopia, more in Mexico than in the Sudan, more in Indonesia than in all eight drought-stricken countries of the Sahel.''\nThe continuing increase in the number of underfed people highlights the failure of at least two international campaigns to make a dent in hunger.\nIn 1974, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger backed a World Food Council commitment to eradicate hunger from the world within 10 years, saying that by 1980 ''not a single child should go to bed hungry.''\nThen, in opening the Second United Nations Development Decade in 1980, the General Assembly set the year 2000 as the new deadline for eliminating hunger. 'Pledges Look Empty'\n''Such pledges look empty now,'' said Alain Vidal Naquet, another council official.\nHunger is increasing at a time when food has probably never been as abundant or as cheap as it is today.\nThis month, the Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization, Edouard Saouma, told his group's governing council that stocks of grains, sugar and butter were all at record levels and likely to increase, and even in the developing world food production was continuing to grow faster than the population.\nAs a result, countries like India and Indonesia, which were prone to disastrous famines, now export food even though increasing numbers of their people cannot afford enough to eat.\n''Thus the process of polarization in the global food system is continuing,'' Mr. Saouma said. Hunger is still on the rise in many developing countries because sections of the population, mainly marginal farmers, landless laborers and urban slum dwellers, are being left behind in the slow move toward economic development."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-24 00:00:00      \nSeveral hundred people, mostly children, gathered at a paddy field in Bankina village of Kalihati upazila of Tangail district. They were witnessing something they had never seen before. A part of a paddy field, overflowing with fully-ripened harvest-ready paddy, was set ablaze by its owner. While the children were cheering at the \"bonfire,\" as they could not perceive the gravity of the incident, some people were trying to console a weeping Abdul Malek Shikder, the owner of the paddy field, while others were trying to extinguish the fire. Abdul set fire to the fruit of his hard labour out of sheer desperation. He had already spent more than Tk 25,000 to cultivate and irrigate his 52 decimals of land. Then, he just learnt that he had to pay at least Tk 900-1000 to a labourer, along with providing food and accommodation, to harvest the crop. A land of this size required at least 10 to 15 labourers. However, he would not get more than Tk 500 from selling one maund (one maund is 40 kilogrammes) of paddy. Abdul was shocked to his core when he learnt about this rate. This meant that he would not be able to hire a single labourer to harvest his crop. He says, \"When I saw my fully ripened paddy was being reduced to food for rats and birds, I could not control myself. Sometimes I thought of committing suicide. I had taken a loan to purchase seeds, pesticides and fertiliser and I didn't know how I would pay back the loan when the price of paddy is this low. Then, out of desperation, I set my field on fire.\" Abdul was not alone. Another farmer named Nazrul Islam also set fire to his paddy field because he could not afford to harvest his crop due to the low price of paddy. In several districts, farmers like Abdul have taken to the streets demanding fair prices for paddy. And while the farmers are being given a nominal price for their hard-earned harvest, the costs of rice and all other essential commodities are on the rise. This year, in different parts of the country, the price per kilogram of rice has increased up by Tk 3-5. Now, a farmer has to purchase a kilogram of coarse rice at Tk 50 and half a litre of bottled water at Tk 15 whereas he is being forced to sell every kilogramme of paddy only at Tk 12.  Kazi Sazzad Zahir Chandan, general secretary of Bangladesh Krishak Shamiti (Bangladesh Farmers' Association) says, \"Farmers have agreed to sell paddy at the government fixed rate of Tk 1,040 per maund of paddy. Despite the fact that a rate has been declared by the government, they are being forced to sell their paddy at less than half this rate. The middlemen and millers are making a huge profit by depriving the farmers.\" Every year the government takes the initiative to procure rice and paddy directly from the farmers at a fixed price. However, the government procures such an insignificant amount of paddy that it cannot influence the market at all. For instance, last year, 19.5 million tonnes of Boro rice was harvested in Bangladesh and the government procured only one million tonne of that. As a result, most of the farmers have to sell their paddy to the middlemen and millers. According to Abdul and his neighbours, \"During every harvest season, the local political leaders and their henchmen suddenly become rice-paddy traders. Many of us cannot afford the transport cost of shipping our crops to the rice mills. We are forced to sell our paddy harvest to these seasonal traders. They are rich people and have sufficient storage facility. Sometimes, they sell the paddy to the rice mills at a profit, and sometimes they trade with the government.\" These middlemen sell their stock to the government buyers and the millers at the government fixed rate of Tk 1040 per maund of paddy but they purchase paddy from the farmers at only Tk 500-600 per maund. In this way, these middlemen make more than a hundred percent profit while the farmers incur huge losses.  Considering increasing production costs, the government is supposed to increase the buying rate of paddy to ensure a fair price for the farmers. For instance, in 2017, the government's fixed price for each kilogramme was Tk 24 and in 2018 it was increased to Tk 26. However, this year, the government did not increase the price at a time when price of rice and all other commodities are increasing. Dr Mohammad Yunus, senior research fellow, Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) says, \"We should keep in mind that the government procures paddy from the farmers not to ensure a fair price for them. They make the procurements only to replenish the government granaries. The Bangladesh government procures a very small amount of paddy from the farmers. China, Japan and Vietnam have formed purchase commissions to buy crops directly from the farmers and also to ensure that they get a fair price. Unfortunately, we have not formed any such body in Bangladesh yet.\" Just several days earlier, minister for agriculture, Dr Abdur Razzaque told the media that it would not be possible to increase the price of paddy. \"This season, the farmers will have to bear with the loss. We don't see any alternative at this moment. We will try to purchase as much paddy as possible. But the government's stockpiles are already full with imported rice. We are thinking of exporting paddy to increase its price but we need to think about making such commitments because Bangladesh is extremely prone to natural calamities,\" states Dr Abdur Razzaque. While the state is being indifferent to the plight of the farmers, hundreds of thousands of them are passing days in poverty and starvation. Many of them are moving to the cities to avoid meeting their debtors. Some of them like Abdul are taking desperate and destructive measures. This year on March 29, a farmer named Arjun Sarker from Naogaon district killed his wife and son by poisoning their food and then committed suicide. The officer-in-charge of Mohadebpur police station of Naogaon district says, \"Arjun borrowed money from several non-government organisations and individuals. Due to repeated loss in agriculture, he could not repay the debts. His debtors had been pursuing him for months.\" On April 19 this year, another farmer named Subroto Pramanik from Magura district committed suicide as his debtors seized all of his lands and his house when he failed to repay the interest of his debts. Subrata and Arjun's suicides are not isolated incidents. According to a 2013 research conducted by Centre for Injury Prevention and Research, Bangladesh, the monthly income of 55 percent of the suicide victims was less than Tk 4000 and most of them were involved in agricultural activities. In 2016, a local NGO of Jhenaidah called Society for Voluntary Activities (SOVA), conducted a survey on the suicide victims of the district and found that 63 percent of them were involved in agriculture and most of them committed suicide due to poverty and debt-related reasons. So far, loan default cases have been filed against at least 168,000 farmers by different NGOs, individuals and banks. Among these cases, arrest warrant has been issued against at least 12,000 farmers. Some NGOs and banks announced the names of the defaulters in the local bazaars. Md Mokbul Hossain, a farmer from Joatpur village of Cumilla's Burichong upazila says, \"I took Tk 20,000 as a loan from the Bangladesh Krishi Bank. When my name was announced in the market as a defaulter, I felt ashamed. I don't know how to pay the debt because I took out only Tk 20,000 but they filed a case claiming Tk 55,000 from me. How will I pay such a huge amount of interest? So, I have fled from my village and am now pulling a rickshaw in Dhaka.\" According to an official of the bank who requested anonymity, \"We announced names and filed these cases to create psychological pressure among the farmers. This measure has worked out already. Many of them have partially paid their debts back.\" However, the total amount of money owed by all the 168,000 farmers who have been prosecuted, is only Tk 561 crore. Muhammad Nazrul Islam, chairman of Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank, a specialised state-owned financial institution that finances the farmers of Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions, says, \"Most of the farmers take very small loans. And, according to my experience, they usually repay the loan in time unless they are hit by severe loss or crop failure. In this area, we are disbursing the loan at four percent interest and we never give any pressure to the farmers. I think we should decrease the rate of interest and make the loan payment system more popular and easier so that farmers feel more interested to take out loans from banks than from usurers and NGOs. This year, we are thinking of launching an agricultural fair where farmers will be able to sell their produces and repay their loan at the same spot.\" According to experts, the lack of a farmer-friendly policy has led to this crisis and it might worsen the situation in the near future. Dr MA Sattar Mondol, professor emeritus, department of agricultural economics and rural sociology at Bangladesh Agricultural University says, \"The agricultural ministry should conduct area-wise customised research to predict crop production all over the country. If we could conduct this research annually, such is being conducted even in India, our farmers and traders could prepare accordingly. Secondly, we must ensure automation in agriculture. We have ensured almost 100 percent automation in ploughing the land but we could not ensure it in sowing and harvesting the crop which are extremely labour intensive. We should also formulate a concrete policy regarding export and import of rice. After the flash flood of 2017, the government withdrew tariffs on rice import but did not reinstate the tariff in 2018. As a result, the government granaries are now flooded with imported rice and there is hardly any place left for the home-grown rice.\"     Just on May 20, the parliamentary standing committee on ministry of food recommended to stop all kinds of rice import immediately to recover from the situation. The committee has also recommended procuring more paddy from the farmers than the amount previously determined. However, according to experts, this decision has come too late to make any impact on the situation. According to Kazi Sazzad Jahir Chandan of Bangladesh Krishak Samity, \"The government must build temporary granaries in all the major rice producing areas. In this way, they can purchase paddy directly from the farmers and stockpile it properly. They should provide incentives to the farmers who have suffered irreparable losses so that they feel motivated to harvest paddy again. Otherwise, the situation will not improve.\" Development of high-yield crops has ensured sustained agricultural production in Bangladesh but due to the lack of a farmer-friendly agricultural policy, the farmers are not getting any benefit from the increased production. A manipulated and unstable market has been pushing a large number of farmers below the poverty line. If the state does not address this issue immediately with a sustainable and pro-farmer policy, our agriculture, our country's economic backbone will be broken in the near future.

      "text": "BARTER IS HIS STOCK IN TRADE\n1988-09-25T05:00:00.000Z\nIN THE FALL OF 1986, W. DOUGLASS LEE Jr., an American commodities trader based in London, received a call for help from a representative of a major chemical producer. The United States multinational corporation had sold $8 million in chemicals to Zimbabwe and had agreed to take payment in tobacco rather than cash. The company had resold the tobacco to Egypt and, in the process, had negotiated a $12 million chemicals sale as well. In lieu of cash, Egypt was offering in payment for both deals a shopping list of commodities ranging from pig iron to rice and coriander.\nSoon afterward, Lee was on a red-eye flight from London's Heathrow Airport to Cairo, arriving at 4 A.M. on a Monday in November to begin long rounds of negotiations with senior government officials and top executives of Egypt's state-owned enterprises. His mission: to insure that $20 million in hard currency wound up in the company's coffers.\nThe first trickle of goods traded for cash finally came out of Egypt last February: Lee peddled Egyptian aluminum to a British manufacturer, Egyptian pig iron in Italy and Bangladesh. Sales of Egyptian steel to the Far East are still pending. But the route to obtaining the cash for the chemical company was arduous and littered with obstacles. Over the past 22 months, for instance, Lee has become intimately familiar with Egyptian metals factories, personally inspecting manufacturing methods and quality control and working out the details of product specifications, delivery schedules and pricing contracts.\nThe negotiating etiquette required lengthy meetings refreshed by rounds of the muddy, nerve-jolting coffee favored by the Egyptians and long talks over late dinners, ending, Lee recalls, ''about 2 A.M. after the belly dancers and everything else.'' There were even political delays, such as the cabinet reshuffle that came the night before Lee was scheduled to have a crucial meeting with Egypt's trade minister, who was ousted in the government shake-up.\n''It rarely goes smoothly,'' says Lee, a 40-year-old expatriate who has made his home in England for the last 15 years. ''But when you're successful, the country has a new market for its goods and your client makes its sale and gets its cash.''\nDOUGLASS LEE IS ONE OF A NEW BREED OF FREELANCE middlemen who operate on the cutting edge of world trade - the shadowy but expanding niche known as countertrade. In the 1980's, a growing number of American industrial and financial giants such as General Motors, Dow Chemical and American Express have been engaging in the controversial practice, often with the assistance of experts like Lee.\nIn its broadest sense, the term covers all international trade in which payment is in some form other than cash. A more sophisticated version of barter, the world's oldest form of commerce, countertrade encompasses basic swaps of goods for goods, but also goods for technology, goods for services and even goods for debt.\nCountertrade deals such as Lee's three-legged United States-Zimbabwe-Egypt exchange, starting with chemicals and moving through agricultural products and metals to hard currency, are crafted mainly between Western corporations and the world's least creditworthy big customers, the nations of the Eastern bloc and the third world.\nEastern European governments spawned the international countertrade business in the 50's. Communist bureaucrats wanted advanced machinery and factories for postwar development but, lacking sufficient foreign currency, forced Western exporters to accept some of the payment in goods. They still do. Developing countries have been pushed to countertrade by the debt crunch. With foreign loans scarce, they trade goods to buy necessary imports and new technology.\nOnce shunned by the United States Government and most corporations, countertrade is being reappraised as a tool to open up untapped markets for American products and to help trim the massive trade deficit. ''Countertrade is everywhere now,'' says Leo G. B. Welt, a Washington-based international trade consultant. ''Countries and corporations are increasingly using countertrade as a marketing tool. It gives you a vehicle for doing business when, otherwise, there would be no business.''\nEstimates of the size of this gray area of world trade range from 8 percent to more than 25 percent, depending on definition and method of calculation. More than 60 governments now encourage countertrade, including such major developing markets as China, India and Brazil. Indonesia has made countertrade mandatory on most government import contracts. Peru has elected goods-for-debt transactions as the main vehicle for paying off its $6 billion in foreign bank loans. As a result, British and American financial institutions, including Chase Manhattan, First Interstate of California and American Express, are scrambling to find buyers for everything from Peruvian fish meal to Peruvian vacations.\nStill, countertrade is frowned upon by global organizations such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund. Critics argue that countertrade is not only economically inefficient but also a convenient cover for unfair trade practices and graft.\n''COUNTERTRADE IS A WORLD for the lateral thinker, the innovative entrepreneur, the unconventional businessman,'' says Gilbert Nockles, trade finance director of the countertrade unit of Britain's Midland Bank, a leader among banks in the field. It seems an ideal milieu for a freelance operator like Doug Lee, bearded, informal and quick-witted.\nThe son of a General Electric Company executive who served as an assistant secretary in the Commerce Department during the Nixon Administration, Lee was born in Salem, Mass., and reared in cities on the Eastern seaboard - ''a different one every three years,'' he says - before attending DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind. He graduated in 1970, after spending his junior year at the London School of Economics.\nRecalling that turbulent era, Lee says he did not want ''to grow up in a corporate structure, as I saw my father do.'' If life as an organization man did not appeal to him, he quickly admits, neither did he want ''to end up in my 30's in some pensione in Italy or Spain with nothing.''\nBecoming a commodities trader appeared to offer a lucrative middle ground. He traded metals in New York for three years but realized that London, the hub of the international metals market, was the place to be. Over the next 12 years, Lee worked for several British trading houses, building a network of contacts.\nHis social circle extended far beyond the trading rooms. In the 70's, his apartment in Chelsea served as a gathering spot for writers, artists and rock musicians with origins in the counterculture and anti-Vietnam War movement.\nLee came to countertrade by the traditional route, metals trading. Many of the big countertrading houses, such as West Germany's Metallgesellschaft A.G., Austria's Allgemeine Waren-Treuhand Aktiengesellschaft and Philipp Brothers of New York, got into the business through trading and financing metals deals with Eastern bloc nations.\nHe acquired his first taste of countertrade four years ago, when Rumania offered aluminum coil in payment for tungsten trioxide. Rumania, like many Eastern European nations, did not have the international marketing organization to handle the sale itself. Thereafter, Lee became increasingly interested in countertrade, finding the intricate fashioning of deals more stimulating than the frenetic daily grind of metals trading. Countertrade also presented an entrepreneurial opportunity. In 1985, Lee began working for himself full time, having set up Intertech Resources Ltd. earlier, to handle a few consulting jobs. The business grew slowly, with Lee straining to keep ahead of the American Express bills.\nCountertrade is not a get-rich-quick business like commodities trading, Lee says, nor is it as treacherous. He describes it as a service business for which he collects fees without investing his own capital. The risk is in the possibility of the deal's collapsing. Deals require ''front-end loading'' in time and energy, he says, and have to be nurtured. But once they get going, they tend to be rolled over, and generate a steady stream of revenue.\nCurrently, Lee has a handful of clients, including Dow Chemical, Rank Xerox, Continental Tire and the countertrade arm of Chase Manhattan. Adhering to the unwritten code of confidentiality that governs the business, he will not name the companies that are involved in his deals.\nAlthough he still trades metals, most of his efforts these days are bent toward countertrade. This year he figures Intertech will handle deals valued at $25 million on which he will collect fees of 1 to 10 percent, although usually toward the lower end of that range.\nTo cope with the increased business, last spring Lee hired two experienced traders, Gordon Davidson, a metals specialist with aviation expertise, and Yvonne Tallantire, a dealer in so-called soft commodities. Tallantire has been involved in trading chemicals in China for frozen vegetables. Intertech Resources markets the snow peas, water chestnuts and mushrooms to such European food companies as pizza chains.\nIntertech Resources occupies an unpretentious office on the fifth floor of a converted Victorian residence overlooking Hanover Square in London's fashionable West End. The building's antique cage elevator is shielded from replacement by a historic preservation order. Riding it is the slowest-moving minute and a half in Lee's day. For countertraders, work is usually a matter of juggling several marathon deals at once, keeping in touch with locations spread across a series of continents and time zones by means of telephone, telex and facsimile machine. Frequent travel is a given. To Lee, airports are a second home. He flew 200 times last year, logging 200,000 miles, the equivalent of circling the globe eight times. ''My travel agent loves me,'' Lee says. ''He calls me up for advice.'' Lee travels mostly to places like Bucharest, Skopje, Zagreb and Guangzhou, a far cry from the luxury hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants of the international business circuit. He has learned to welcome the sight of lizards scurrying up the walls of a hotel room in provincial India or China because, he says, ''they're working for you, eating the insects.''\nIn Rumania, Lee never conducts business in his hotel room; he is sure it is bugged. On more than one occasion, he has been tailed. He was roughed up during a left-wing demonstration in Istanbul, and some third world taxi drivers have come close to transporting him off a cliff.\nCorporate clients, even those with in-house countertrade units, hire Lee for his technical expertise and his useful contacts. As a freelance operator, he can sometimes move more easily and wheel and deal a bit more than an employee of a large corporation. ''It doesn't matter what bizarre commodity you hit him with, Lee either knows people who can handle it or he can find them in a few hours,'' says Michael Shaddick, an Australia-based countertrade specialist, who has dealt with Lee. ''He has the contacts to get the deal done.''\nKey officials in the national and regional foreign trade organizations of the Soviet bloc know Lee; they answer his telexes and take his telephone calls. ''It's all very personal and there's no replacing the face-to-face contact,'' he says.\nThus, at times, Lee can put together a deal where others fail or get a shipment into or out of a country that a company could not arrange on its own. Last spring, he was called in to rescue a countertrade in Yugoslavia. A major European tire maker had agreed to take payment for tires in the form of zinc oxide, which can be used in tire production. The arrangement was 500 tons of zinc oxide for each shipment of 30,000 tires. ''I was brought in after the deal was signed,'' Lee recalls. ''The meter was running, but no one had ever thought about the packaging problem.'' The tire manufacturer's machinery was made for grappling efficiently with zinc oxide in one-ton polypropylene ''supersacks.'' The Yugoslavian regional corporation used only 55- and 110-pound bags. Lee's assignment was to find a buyer for Yugoslavia's zinc oxide. The large amount was a potential problem, while the matter of the packaging limited its appeal to Western customers. Lee scoured his Eastern bloc contacts and, within three weeks, found a buyer. ''There was only one country that would take that much - the Soviet Union,'' he says. For the countertrader, at least, the planned economies can be extremely efficient because, when a sale is made, they often place huge orders.\nThough countertrading may seem a less hectic activity than sitting in front of a computer screen trading commodities, the pressures of time and complexity are enormous. A typical contract will stipulate that if one party does not pay for goods with goods within a specified time, usually 90 to 180 days, it must pay in international currency. ''You've got to be constantly asking yourself, 'Do they have us or do we have them?' '' Lee says.\nIn the Zimbabwe-Egypt deal, the American company arranged with British banks to set up escrow accounts covering the chemicals sales. So far, two shipments of tobacco worth $3.6 million have been sent from Zimbabwe, reducing that country's account to $4.4 million.\nThe Egyptian escrow account was not so easily reckoned. Shipments have produced only $600,000 in cash to date. Several deals for commodities on Egypt's list fell through. Trades of salt to Brazil and rice and coriander to Singapore foundered on problems of import licenses and shipping costs; textiles bound for the United States were snagged by quota restrictions. Although contracts can be rolled over, tempers must be kept in check and care taken not to offend third world customers with repeated rejection of their offerings.\nWhen Lee completes trades of Egyptian steel to Taiwan, Singapore and India for dollars - deals he has been working on - the company will have received $13 million in cash. But more than two years will have elapsed before he secures the final payment on the $20 million deal.\nOccasionally, the countertrader becomes, in effect, part of the state planning mechanism. In one ongoing program, Lee is taking computer floppy diskettes out of Bulgaria. The state manufacturer is producing five-and-one-quarter-inch floppies. To meet a shift in the world market to smaller diskettes compatible with the new generation of I.B.M. computers, Lee is advising them to gear up for production of a three-and-a-half-inch size. ''If I can teach them how to make their product more marketable, then I'm doing a lot more for that country than by just trading something with them,'' Lee observes.\nEVEN THOSE WHO ARE CONcerned about the practice agree that countertrade performs an economically beneficial role by supplying some nations with scarce materials, marketing and manufacturing skills. ''Countertrade can be an efficient way of overcoming handicaps and distortions in economies that are rigidly controlled,'' says Michel Kostecki, an economist with GATT in Geneva. ''That is why one must be careful about condemning countertrade generally and, instead, look at it on a pragmatic case-by-case basis.''\nCountertrade comes in many forms, from a straightforward swap of goods to a ''buyback,'' as, for example, when China agrees to buy a television-tube factory from a Japanese manufacturer, but only on the condition that the seller takes part of the payment in television tubes produced by the plant. ''Offsets'' are increasingly required to sell arms and commercial aircraft, even in deals involving Western countries. Two years ago, Britain agreed to buy six airborne warning and control aircraft from the Boeing Company for $1.3 billion only after the American manufacturer promised to farm out $1.30 worth of work on various projects to British subcontractors for every $1 spent on its Awacs.\nThere is one common thread to countertrade: Buyers are using their purchasing power to guarantee markets for their exports. Critics say countertrade deals are a regressive step toward ''bilateralism'' - restrictive, two-way trade - instead of multilateral free trade. So GATT, the World Bank, the I.M.F. and other official bodies view countertrade as a practice that tends to dampen growth.\nCompanies invariably tack a premium onto the price of the products they trade to countries that insist on paying with goods because the sellers expect to be forced to resell what they take in exchange at cut-rate prices. As a result, the country pays above-market prices for its imports while its exports are being dumped on international markets.\nBECAUSE COUNTERTRADE deals are less visible than cash transactions, it is easier to hide such unfair trade practices as subsidies and dumping, as well as illicit payments and graft.\nA countertrader like Lee, with American clients, must operate in the gray area between pragmatism and illegality. One delicate matter is the use of agents. ''There are some countries where you simply won't get in to see the key people without hiring the right agent,'' Lee says. ''American companies may not like it, but it's a fact of life.''\nHe stresses that he would never knowingly hand out a bribe, but admits that agents' commissions (typically, 1 to 5 percent) do open the door to corruption. ''But if the agent gives a kickback to some government official, I don't know about it,'' he says.\nIn Washington, the regulatory climate concerning overseas payments seems to be easing. The trade bill that President Reagan signed last month includes amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that contain exceptions to the ban on payments and gifts to officials to influence a business decision. And there are other signs that attitudes are moderating as countertrade grows.\n''The United States is at a turning point, where companies are deciding whether they are going to make the investment and effort to be competitive globally,'' says Fred Howell, an international economist at the Commerce Department. Last March, Commerce Secretary C. William Verity Jr. told Congress that barter was ''essential'' to America's drive to boost exports. More countertrade was likely, Verity predicted, ''for the simple reason that if we increase exports, as we hope, a lot of developing countries are going to have to pay for them and there is a limit to their liquidity.'' The 1988 trade bill calls for the setting up of an Office of Barter within the Commerce Department to examine how companies can exploit countertrade opportunities.\nIncreasingly, American corporations are doing just that. Dozens of America's biggest companies, such as McDonnell Douglas, Caterpillar, Fluor and Pepsico, as well as the banks, have in-house countertrade teams. But the business can be risky for the unskilled and overly ambitious, as the experience of Sears World Trade proved. The retailing giant set up a countertrade arm in 1982 with a staff of 1,000. After four years of red ink, the subsidiary was shut down.\n''Countertrade is a more difficult and higher-risk business,'' says Charles J. Borg, global manager of the countertrading arm Dow Chemical set up in Zurich four years ago. ''But it does exist. You can't ignore half the world and have any genuine global growth strategy. And if you want to grow, you have to help them.''\nPerhaps the most innovative bank deals are the debt-for-export programs under way in Peru. The banks are trying to recover some of the $6 billion they lent to Lima by taking out such items as shellfish, asparagus, onions, garlic, copper wire and wood products. For every $3 generated by such sales, the banks will keep $1 and give the rest to Peru.\nBritain's Midland Bank signed the first such debt-for-export deal in 1987 and began marketing Peruvian goods earlier this year. ''At the time, there was some debate as to whether this is the sort of thing banks should do,'' notes Gilbert Nockles of Midland. ''But now, everybody and his brother is down there trying to do the same thing.''\nLee is currently working on a few proposals in Brazil, another country with crippling bank debt. He hopes to double Intertech's volume of countertrade deals by entering new markets like Brazil as well as by increasing activity in Eastern Europe and Asia. But there is one commodity he refuses to handle - a carryover from his youth in the counterculture. ''I get offered arms all the time, but I never touch them,'' he says. ''It's a moral thing for me. I just won't.''\nLee derives an income from his business ''in the low six figures,'' he says. It affords him a comfortable style of life. Divorced from an English wife, he tries to spend every other weekend with their three children, ages 11, 14 and 16. He has a house in the London borough of Chiswick and belongs to two private clubs, Groucho's, a hangout for people in the arts and advertising, and the Royal Automobile Club. ''I could never get into the real English clubs,'' he says cheerfully. He has ample firsthand knowledge of the city's night life, though he insists that his pace has slowed. He now tries to begin his days in London at 6:30 A.M., working out on a Nautilus machine.\nHe is also studying Mandarin, building on a linguistic capability he describes as ''restaurant French, German and Spanish.'' For Lee, it's strictly business: ''I want to pick up enough to be seen as making the effort in those Chinese deals.''"

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-20 00:00:00      \nThe Chattogram Development Authority has been filling up vast swaths of low-lying land, designated as water reservoirs, in the name of building residential areas. The state-run agency is building 4,533 plots at its Ananya Abasik area in Kuwaish and Panchlaish. In the 1995 Master Plan, these areas are earmarked as farmland and wetland. Filling up of farmland and wetland or changing their nature by any means is illegal. Moreover, the housing project, launched in 2011, does not have the mandatory clearance from the environment ministry, officials said. In a letter in 2018, the environment department ordered the CDA to halt the project, but the city development authority paid no heed to the call.   Ironically, however, the CDA is implementing a separate Tk 5,616 crore project to solve the port city's waterlogging problem that affects millions. Since the project's approval in 2017, the CDA has been able to do only 17 percent work. Town planners and locals say the housing projects are intensifying the problem. With thousands of residential plots occupying some 778 acres of water retention area, localities that were once known as flood-free zone now quickly go under rainwater. Oxygen Mor area is the worst affected. After last week's rain, the busy intersection remained waterlogged for at least five days. Locals said they never saw this area go under water.     Sholoshohor Gate-2, Muradpur, Probortok and Chwakbazar are among the main city thoroughfares that get waterlogged even after a light rain. Until four to five years ago, rain water would recede in couple of hours. Now, it takes up to 10 hours. In the first phase of the housing schemes, the CDA completed the work of 1,733 plots last year and is now building another 2,800 plots in the second phase. The city development authority is implementing a separate housing scheme, Kolpolok Abasik, in Bakolia, also a water reservoir.   Additionally, the CDA has approved construction of hundreds of buildings on wetland, including Bogar Beel, Chandrima Abasik, Gaochiya Abasik, over the last few years. Yeasin Mahfuz, a resident of Kuwaish, said they never had waterlogging problem in their neighbourhood in the past. \"The waterlogging problem began after the CDA completed its first phase of the Ananya Abasik project. It's sad that the CDA is aggravating the waterlogging problem while it's implementing a project to solve it,\" he said, clearly frustrated. Asik Imran, an eminent town planner and also board member of the CDA, told The Daily Star that the CDA did not do any feasibility and other relevant studies before taking up the housing projects. \"So these residential areas are intensifying the waterlogging problem in nearby areas. Such whimsical actions are essentially taking the city on the verge of destruction. The CDA can't avoid its responsibility,\" he said. CDA's Chief Town Planner Sahinul Islam Khan admitted that portions of their residential areas occupied some land earmarked as agricultural land. \"Waterlogging is sure to happen when any housing project is taken up in low-lying areas. We should have 'honoured' [spared] the water retention areas. But there is the pressure to build homes for the increasing population as well,\" he added. He would not comment on why the CDA did not take the required clearance from the environment department. But even as the city development authority's housing schemes are inundating new areas, it's project to mitigate the waterlogging problem sees little progress. After government approval in August 2017, the CDA signed an agreement with the army in April 2018 for its implementation by 2020. But with less than a quarter of the work completed, the CDA authorities are now seeking to push the deadline. Excavation of 16 out of the 36 canals have been completed while only five kilometres of retaining wall have been built out of 176 kilometres. That is the only progress. The project also include building of 12 sluice gates, renovating 500 drains, constructing five water reservoirs, 42 silt trap and 15 feet-wide roads on both side of the 36 canals. The project will also construct 48 bridges, six culverts and ten kilometres of drains. Asked about the slow pace, Project Director Ahmed Moinuddin said the consulting firm appointed to study the canals submitted their report on only 13 canals in April this year. \"It's a huge job and sometimes deadlines can be missed. The consulting firm will be able to submit their report on all the canals by August. In the meantime, we initiated a move to extend the deadline,\" he said. "

Addressing an online press briefing from his office at the secretariat in Dhaka, Dr Enamur Rahman said: \"There are 120 cyclone shelters in Bhashan Char. However, all the Rohingya people currently living in the char have been taken to one of them.\" Bangladesh Navy personnel are taking care of them, he said, adding that all necessary facilities were being provided to the refugees. Some 308 Rohingyas were sent to live in Bhashan Char, an island off the coast of Noakhali, earlier this month after they were rescued from boats in the sea during their failed illegal attempt to travel to Malaysia on different occasions. The government plans to keep the refugees, who were among the 1.1 million living in the sprawling and cramped camps outside the town of Cox's Bazar, there permanently. Meanwhile, different quarters have expressed concern over the authorities moving the Rohingyas on the \"flood-prone island\" to storm shelters as cyclone Amphan, the strongest recorded in the region, is set to make landfall on Bangladesh coast on Wednesday evening. The eastern edge of the storm headed for Bangladesh and neighbouring India is also expected to batter Bhashan Char island. \"Each block has a cyclone centre and they have been moved to the centre,\" Bimal Chakma, a senior official of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission, told Reuters. The United Nations has called for the refugees to be moved to the camps in Cox's Bazar. Although the Cox's Bazar settlement, the world's largest refugee camp, is expected to escape the worst of the storm, the danger level has been raised to nine from six, signifying a severe threat. Heavy rain and high winds lashed the flimsy shelters, built on hills prone to landslides, and red flags were raised to warn refugees to stay inside. Aid workers say the cyclone could hamper efforts to control the novel coronavirus outbreak in the camps, which reported their first infections last week. \"It is already a huge challenge to contain the spread of coronavirus amongst the Rohingya refugees living in over-crowded camps, sharing water and toilet facilities,\" said Dipankar Datta, the country director of charity Oxfam in Bangladesh. Water-borne and other infections were also a threat, he added in a statement. Bangladeshis and Rohingya are among thousands of volunteers trained in emergency response measures who received life-jackets and torches. \"We are using megaphones and the mosque microphones to warn people,\" said Sabbir Ahmed, a 24-year-old Rohingya volunteer. Refugees have been told to head for madrasas and schools if the storm destroys shelters, he told Reuters by telephone, adding: \"If it hits the camps there will be huge destruction.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-17 00:00:00      \nThe world celebrated Valentine's Day on 14 February. Wishes were exchanged, special parties were planned and dear ones were busy trying to do something beautiful on the occasion. But former Bhutan Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay won the Internet with a Valentine's Day photo posted on his official Facebook page. Tobgay, who was the Prime Minister of Bhutan from 2013 to 2018, is married to Tashi Dolma, who has accompanied him on many of his official foreign trips including a visit to India in 2015.  On Thursday, Tobgay shared a beautiful picture which quickly went viral. In the photo, Tobgay is seen in the front seat of a vehicle grimacing in pain as his wife, seated in the back seat, pulls on his ears. Tobgay captioned the photo with a Valentine's Day greeting and an emoji. The photo left the Internet in splits. The post garnered over 4K likes in less than 2 hours. Many wished the couple on Valentine's Day while some joked that Tashi is \"punishing\" Tobgay for his loss in last year's general elections. This is not the first time Tobgay won the Internet with a post featuring the couple. In September 2018, Tobgay, who is the president of People's Democratic Party (PDP) of Bhutan, had posted a photo on Twitter showing him carrying Tashi on his back through a muddy road. \"Not as dashing as Sir Walter Raleigh, but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do to keep his lady's feet clean,\" Tobgay captioned the photo referring to the 17th century English nobleman. That post, too, went viral, attracting 5.5K likes and a flood of comments praising the former PM for his humility and love for his wife. The 53-year-old Tobgay completed his schooling in India and went for higher studies in the US. A keen environmentalist, he married Tashi in 1998. The couple have two children. His party badly lost the 2018 general elections in the landlocked country, finishing third in the first round and thereby losing all 32 seats in the 47 member House it had won in 2013.

Maulana Zubair Hassan, the imam of Kakrail mosque in Dhaka, conducted the Akheri Munajat at 11am, praying for the country's welfare and continued growth, and peace for the Muslim Ummah in their worldly life and thereafter. The Munajat, offered both in Bangla and Urdu, lasted for nearly 45 minutes amid heightened security measures. Women participate in Akheri Munajat of Bishwa Ijtema on the banks of the Turag River, in Tongi, on Sunday, January 12, 2020 | Rajib Dhar/Dhaka TribunePakistani alem Maulana Ziaul Haq delivered a sermon after Fajr prayers, followed by a special speech by Indian Islamic scholar Ibrahim Dewla on different aspects, including Imaan and Akhlaq, in the light of the holy Quran and the Hadiths.  The first phase of the annual congregation -- the second largest of its kind after Hajj -- on the outskirts of Dhaka, was mainly participated by the followers of Maulana Zubair, the head of Tabligh Jamaat in Bangladesh.  The second phase of the Ijtema, spanning three days is scheduled to begin on January 17 at the same venue, after a four-day break. Followers of Indian alem Maulana Saad Kandhalvi will participate in the closing phase of the annual congregation, where he will conduct the Akheri Munajat.  Muslim devotees from different walks of life, in great numbers, started thronging the Ijtema venue from the dawn, in order to attend the Munajat. Failing to board a vehicle on the way to the Ijtema grounds, many opted to commute on foot.  The venue was brimming soon after the Fajr prayers, with roads and lanes leading to the grounds packed with crowds of devotees despite the cold weather. Even parts of the Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway were occupied by devotees joining the Munajat.   Train passengers participate in Akheri Munajat of Bishwa Ijtema on the banks of the Turag River, in Tongi, on Sunday, January 12, 2020 | Rajib Dhar/Dhaka TribuneMoreover, the rooftops of residential and industrial buildings around the venue were also packed.  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, accompanied by her younger sister Sheikh Rehana, also joined the Akheri Munajat from her official residence Ganabhaban in Dhaka, in the presence of  State Minister for Religious Affairs, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah. Educational institutions, factories, kitchen markets, shopping malls and offices located in Uttara, Tongi and Gazipur were closed due to the huge rush of people centering the Akheri Munajat.     In order to manage the growing number of devotees coming from home and abroad, the holy congregation is being held in two phases since 2011. Devotees outnumbering transportation vehicles, causing misery Traffic from Airport Road in the capital to Joydevpur Chowrasta, Mirer Bazar of Gazipur Sadar upazila to Tongi, Abdullahpur up until the Bypass Road were suspended for nearly six hours since the Fajr prayers. However, the movement of vehicles started around 12 noon, after the Munajat ended, causing a large number of crowds to pour into nearby roads and highways.   Very few vehicles operated in proportion to the huge crowd leaving the Ijtema premises for their destinations outside Tongi, leading to immense suffering for the devotees. They were left walking towards their destined locations. Cashing in on the situation, transport workers charged exorbitant fares from the devotees.    They were charging up to Tk100 from Azampur, Uttara to Motijheel, Sayedabad, Gulistan, Sadarghat, Azimpur, New Market and Gabtoli. Similar fares were being charged by the driver's assistant of a BRTC bus, for the same distance.   In addition, a large number of motorbikes added to the troubles of devotees leaving the Ijtema premises.  Meanwhile, Bangladesh Railway arranged a special rail service engaging 16 trains to carry passengers to and from Tongi, on the occasion, as it does every year. Plus, every inter-city train crossing Tongi Railway Station stopped there for five minutes.    Schedule set for next year's Bishwa Ijtema The faction of Tabligh Jamaat, led by Maulana Zubair, has fixed the dates for the two phases of Ijtema to be held in January 2021.  Md Mejbah Uddin, a leader of the faction, informed reporters that the first phase of the three-day-long congregation will start on January 8, while the second and last one will be held from January 15. Prior to that, a five-day Jor Ijtema, a gathering organized ahead of the two-phase Bishwa Ijtema, will be held from November 27 this year.  Dowry-free mass marriage  Unlike last year, this year's first phase of Ijtema ended with a dowry-free mass marriage ceremony. On Saturday, the second day of the three-day phase, 101 couples were married without dowry.  The brides and grooms were listed for the event on Thursday, upon their consent.   The second mass marriage is scheduled for the second day of the closing phase of the annual gathering.  A mass marriage is held on the second day of each phase of the Ijtema every year, but it did not take place in 2019 following a Tabligh Jamaat factional feud. "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-26 00:00:00      \nThis newspaper on March 24 reported how Rajuk is trying to change land allotted for educational institutions and environmental preservation in the Purbachal Project into commercial and business plots. Since the scheme was launched in 1995, due to pressure from \"influential people\", the plans have been changed five times, leading to arable land and flood flow zones being gradually reduced. In the latest revision, Rajuk intends to decrease the 269 acres dedicated to 157 educational institutions to 119 acres for more residential, commercial and other purposes. We reported insiders telling us that this has been done to increase the number of plots, thus allowing allotment to more applicants. More importantly, we also learned that doing so would compromise \"some indispensable standard characters and features\". One result would be that educational institutions, which would have had their own playing fields, would now share common fields. That a planned project is being changed over and over again as per the wishes of the wealthy, influential and politically-connected people, is absurd. More so because a common complaint about our rapidly urbanising city is the lack of green spaces and playing fields for children. The High Court's comment, in declining to approve the proposed revision earlier this year, comparing it to a \"smart trick\" turning playgrounds of educational institutions into commercial plots, is revealing. Yet, Rajuk has now appealed the HC's directive. Going back further, we see more anomalies in this project. There are allegations of secretly allotting institutional plots from areas earmarked for schools and playgrounds, violating a 2014 HC judgment. Officials approached for our report turned out to be evasive or vague in their answers. Trees have been felled and water bodies have been filled up indiscriminately, which could harm the environment and make the area concrete jungles with very little open spaces. No one in Dhaka is unfamiliar with the consequences of such a scenario. The court's decision is yet to come. But we would urge the authorities to launch an independent investigation into the anomalies and allegations of pressure from certain quarters. Otherwise, it is public money that will be spent in an unaccountable manner according to the whims of the rich and influential."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-29 00:00:00      \n The underprivileged people of Borangile village in Sirajganj's Chauhali upazila can sleep a little better at night, knowing that if they are ever unable to find work as day labourers the next day, they can easily borrow some rice from the community food bank. Such little comfort is all thanks to the smart thinking of Kohinoor Begum, who along with some 40 other villagers, set up the food bank for times of need. The initiative is now a source of inspiration for neighbouring villages. Situated around a hundred kilometres from Sirajganj town, the people of Borangile often fall out of the purview of receiving government amenities or relief, even though they are among those critically affected by flood. The village lies on char lands of the Jamuna basin, where people are mostly dependent on finding work as day labourers to survive. They are able to grow some crops when the water in the river recedes and the char lands are exposed. Kohinoor, a housewife, and the others set up the food bank last year to meet food demands during times like off-crop periods. She is chairman of the reserve. When this correspondent visited the village on August 9, he attended one of the meetings of the reserve at the chairman's house along with the other members. \"Early in 2018, a few women of our underprivileged community and I walked back barefoot for a couple of hours after we went to collect relief materials from the local government. However, we were let down as relatives of the local member-chairman got the relief items instead of us,\" said Kohinoor, reminiscing the time when the reserve came into being. \"I then called a meeting at home to take matters in my hand and shared my decision to form a food bank.\" The community is poor and destitute, but there are some who are needier than the others, she added. \"We should do something for them. During hard times, any member can take rice from our bank.\" On avoiding total dependence on government support, she said, \"We are also trying to gather financial support from other villagers as donations.\" Members of this food bank started setting aside whatever little they could manage in 2018. They now have 45 members and their savings crossed Tk 30,000. \"A few days ago, our family fell into a crisis. I borrowed eight kilograms of rice from the food bank and overcame the crisis,\" said Aduri Khatun, also a member of the bank. The bank does not charge any interest for such services, said Shumi Khatun, 28, one of the beneficiaries of the bank. Another villager, Rajib Siddique, 27, who recently completed his graduation, said, \"Kohinoor Khala [aunt] is an inspiration for all of us. Her lone initiative has saved us from extreme hunger.\" \"The food bank is a laudable example. They can now solve some of their problems from their own resources,\" said Romjan Ali, chairman of Ghorjan union of the district. \"At least 3,000 families were gravely flood affected in our union and the government budget hardly covered all the victims. In this situation, this type of a food bank is really beneficial,\" he added.  "

Between February and April, authorities swooped on labs in the lawless Kutkai area of Shan State, seizing nearly 200 million meth tablets, 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of crystal meth, some 300 kgs of heroin, and 3,750 litres of methyl fentanyl. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime described the haul as one of the largest and most successful counter-narcotics operations in the history of the region. \"What has been unearthed through this operation is truly off-the-charts,\" UNODC Southeast Asia and Pacific representative Jeremy Douglas said in a statement. The production network could only have been possible with the backing of serious transnational criminal groups, he added. The raids unearthed \"unprecedented\" methyl fentanyl, the sign of a new trend of synthetic opioid production emerging \"on a scale nobody anticipated\", said Douglas. Fifty times stronger than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl can be lethal from as little as two milligrams -- the equivalent of a few grains of sand. It has fueled an opioid crisis in the US which killed 32,000 people in 2018.  Myanmar is under pressure to stem the deluge of drugs from its freewheeling border regions. Shan State is part of the \"Golden Triangle\" -- a wedge of land cutting into Myanmar, Laos, China and Thailand and virtually untroubled by authorities despite its multi-billion-dollar trade. Myanmar is the world's second-biggest producer of heroin after Afghanistan, and is now widely thought to be the largest global source of meth, fueled by the flood of pre-cursor chemicals from China. Cheap, caffeine-cut \"yaba\" pills -- Southeast Asia's favorite high -- are pushed regionally, prices tripling as they cross borders into Thailand and Malaysia. The more addictive crystal meth, or \"ice\", is smuggled to Tokyo, Seoul or Sydney, where it sells for around $150,000 a kilo on the streets. \"Made-in-Myanmar\" drugs are trafficked south through Thailand, north into China and west towards Bangladesh -- a cascade of stimulants overwhelming regional policing efforts and seeding a crisis of addiction, corruption and money laundering. Thirty-three people were arrested in the operations with authorities vowing to bring to justice criminal groups, traffickers and accomplices. Colonel Zaw Lin from Myanmar's anti-drugs police acknowledged the challenges ahead, but said the traffickers' \"days of operating... are numbered.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-20 00:00:00      \nIt is believed that around 1.3 crore people have become jobless in the country so far due to the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic and the resulting lockdown. Over a two-week period, the poverty rate in Bangladesh also shot up to about 30-35 per cent range from an estimated 20 per cent plus level in 2019. Much of the remarkable gains achieved on the poverty reduction front over the more than one decade have been reversed, at least temporarily, in just a few weeks. Thus, ensuring food security for the newly poor households, along with the previously poor and vulnerable ones, is a major challenge for the government. On the overall supply side, although Bangladesh was almost self-sufficient in terms of main staple rice in 2019, we are still skating on thin ice because any major or even moderate shocks like a flood at national and regional levels or cyclone can make the supply situation precarious, as we have seen very recently in 2018 and earlier in 2008. The coronavirus-induced mass unemployment and the resulting income loss is also likely to create a major mismatch between effective demand (backed by purchasing power) and the overall supply of food, including rice, vegetables, fruits, fish, eggs and poultry, milk and livestock.  Managing the mismatch will be critical for ensuring food security for all. In the past, in our battle for food security, we generally dealt with supply shocks of various origins, and none of those events was associated with a concurrent massive nationwide demand shock as it is happening this time.  This makes the current situation unprecedented. Complicating the matter further, there is the nationwide lockdown that is disrupting not only normal life but also the flow of essential foods from farmers and producers to the ultimate consumers across Bangladesh. Under these circumstances, food security can only be ensured if: (i) we have enough domestic production of essential foods to meet domestic demand; (ii) we ensure that normal marketing chains continue to operate effectively and uninterrupted to bring foods near the neighbourhoods of consumers; and (iii) all citizens have the minimum income to meet their minimum food requirements, which in itself is a major undertaking. A review of the current supply situation for rice indicate a generally satisfactory condition except for two concerns: (i) because of lower rice price last year, the farmers have reduced the cropping area for boro cultivation by about 10 per cent, which is likely to contribute to a corresponding shortfall in realising the boro output target, the most important source of rice in Bangladesh; and (ii) boro cultivation in haor areas has already started from mid-April, and if this crop is not quickly harvested it may be significantly lost to early flooding in those areas, which is a normal phenomenon. The haor areas produce about 20 per cent of the marketable surplus of rice and the farmers generally depend on migrant labors from Northern and Southern parts of Bangladesh to complete the harvesting. The government is reportedly preparing to send a few hundred harvesters to the haor areas, which is a commendable move. But it should be executed very quickly to salvage the crop. Also, there may still be a need for about 500,000 guest labours to complete the harvesting in haor areas. The government has to make sure that the workers are there when needed. This is an opportune moment for the workers and a desperate moment for the farmers. However, the problem is lockdown -- which does not allow the conventional mechanism for the flow of workers to function. The intervention of the government is urgently needed. If the reported shortfall in boro acreage target is true, which should be verified independently and not through the Department of Agricultural Extension that has the reputation of overstating the acreage and output, the government should make advance arrangements for imports to cover the projected shortfall.  Outside the main crop of rice, if we look at the agriculture sector with a broader perspective, we are afraid of a massive shortfall in supplies despite abundant production at the farm level. This is happening with vegetables, fruits, eggs and milk. A few days back, I was watching an award-winning farmer from Gaibandaha crying on television because he could not sell his tomatoes for even Tk 3 per kg -- whereas tomatoes are being sold at Tk 90 a kg in Dhaka. We are hearing stories of watermelons and bungees rotting in the fields because those cannot be transported to major cities and urban centres. Egg price has shot up to more than Tk 150 per dozen, whereas the poultry farmers are getting only a fraction of that.  Hundreds of thousands of litres of milk are being wasted every day due to lack of transport and local processing, whereas people are suffering from malnutrition. Hundreds of thousands of containers are piled up at the Chittagong port, waiting to be shipped to domestic markets, while Ramadan is less than two weeks away. Most bank branches across Bangladesh, including in district towns, are closed and those that are open are only open for 2-3 hours. Most business transactions including the payment of salaries are being held up due to the closure of banks. Businesses cannot go on without payment of taxes, salaries, payments for transportations, and deposits and withdrawals of cash in banks. Most mobile financial service (MFS) agents cannot function without cash liquidity at hand. Ensuring the supply of essential products stuck at Chittagong port, which are already paid for, cannot wait -- these essential imports must reach the markets across Bangladesh before Ramadan. Special initiatives must be taken to ship containers from our international ports to domestic destinations and to keep banks and MFS outlets open for the financing of essential business transactions.  We cannot afford to continue with this kind of induced market failure and liquidity shortage for long. The season of mangoes, lychees and jackfruits are coming next month. The livelihoods of millions of growers would depend on selling these fruits across Bangladesh and the fruits will also provide vital nutrients to all of us in the coming months. We cannot afford to let these delicious and nutritious fruits rot. Emergency measures have to be taken to allow the market mechanisms to function while complying with the basic norms of social distancing and associated hygiene. We just cannot shut down all our village markets and prevent the middlemen from collecting the essential agricultural products from farmers. Continuing to shut down local agricultural markets and transportation will ruin our farmers as well as consumers. We have to remember, farmers do not want credit, they simply want the right price for their products. Only through effectively functioning market networks the farmers will be able to get necessary price support and that is the best incentive for ensuring future food supply. The distribution network has to reach up to the consumers while maintaining appropriate coronavirus-related norms and practices. If we look at Dhaka, the heavy-handed approach by the law-enforcement agencies to close down all retail outlets of essentials by 6 pm is self-defeating. Why cannot super shops like Shwapno and Agora or corner groceries remain open for 24 hours? That will allow people to maintain the norms of social distancing better by shopping at their convenient times. If anyone visits supermarkets in Gulshan area, he/she will find at least 40-50 people standing in line in front of the store and a crowded back to back people at the cash counters. Why should it be like that? What sort of social distancing is this? All this crowding is happening because few groceries are open and the very short store opening hours.  Around the world, grocery stores and pharmacies continue to remain open for long hours so that people can go out any time and get their essentials while complying with the norms of social distancing. What we are doing is further diminishing the level of demand that is already diminished. All medical facilities, pharmacies and essential grocery stores must be allowed to remain open as long as it is commercially viable. To ensure food security for all, we have look at the demand side along with the supply side considerations noted above. With tens of millions of people unemployed in the last several weeks, most of them will not have the purchasing power to buy the food in the required amounts. Just ensuring supplies at the right prices would not be enough to bring foods to the plates of hungry jobless households. Massive income or food support programmes will be immediately needed to bring food to their mouth. Otherwise, the resulting collapse in demand will keep crores of people hungry and starved, while agricultural product prices will collapse at the farm level and farmers will suffer badly. There will be widespread hunger and malnutrition, which is not a desirable outcome under any circumstances.  It is the responsibility of the state to ensure food security for all Bangladeshi citizens by ensuring that the minimum required amount of food reaches the plates of all citizens. Bangladesh today can afford it. But, for that to materialise the government has to provide income support for the millions unemployed and remain extremely vigilant on both supply and demand sides. We have to ensure that no food -- be it rice, fruits, vegetables, milk or eggs -- is wasted while millions remain hungry. We must keep the marketing chains open as part of essential services and work towards removing the barriers to efficient marketing through better coordination among policymakers and law enforcement agencies. We have to let the marketing chains work uninterrupted supported by inflows of liquidity from financial institutions. All necessary coordination issues related to income support, availability of monetary liquidity and opening up of the marketing chains must be resolved urgently to ensure food security.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-14 00:00:00      \nForeign critics of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan deride him as a quasi-dictatorial megalomaniac. But Erdogan--who was Turkey's prime minister for 11 years before being elected president in 2014--is now a reckless gambler, too. In short order, Turkey will send troops to Libya at the request of the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), which has been besieged in Tripoli for the last eight months by the advancing forces of Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). This will be a military and diplomatic folly. Erdogan already has the distressing example of the Syrian conflict on Turkey's own doorstep. Does he really imagine that sending a few hundred--or even many thousand--Turkish troops to aid the beleaguered GNA will somehow resolve Libya's tragic and bloody turmoil, itself the result of the 2011 intervention by foreign powers that toppled Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime? If Erdogan expects either a GNA victory or an imminent peace settlement, he is deluding himself. Haftar's well-equipped LNA has the support of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and (at least covertly) France. With mercenaries from Russia and Sudan on his side, Haftar must feel rather more optimistic than Fayez al-Sarraj, the GNA's prime minister. Support for the GNA from Turkey and Qatar, along with the fig leaf of UN recognition, weighs rather less in the military balance. So, what explains Turkey's entry into Libya's dreadful conflict as yet another proxy warrior? One factor, often baffling to outsiders, is the ideological and political influence throughout the Middle East--or at least its Sunni Muslim parts--of the Muslim Brotherhood. Founded in Egypt almost a century ago, the Brotherhood favours a transition (peaceful, it has always maintained) to theocratic government. As its slogan proclaims, \"Islam is the solution.\" That is a problem for the ruling families of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain, all of which regard the Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation seeking to undermine their power. So, too, does the oppressive Egyptian regime led by President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who mounted the 2013 military coup that ended the Brotherhood's disastrous year governing the Arab world's most populous country. Only Turkey--specifically, Erdogan's Justice and Development Party (AKP)--and tiny Qatar (very much at odds with neighbouring Saudi Arabia) view the Brotherhood with enthusiasm rather than alarm. On the almost frivolous premise that my enemy's enemy is my friend, the fact that Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt support Haftar is excuse enough for Turkey and Qatar to support Sarraj and the GNA. The bigger reason for Erdogan's adventurism in Libya, though, is that it fits his desire for Turkey to play a determining role in its region for the first time since the demise of the Ottoman empire (of which Libya was once a part). On the surface, that ambition sounds reasonable enough. Turkey has a population of more than 80 million, the second-largest military in NATO, and a relatively developed economy. It deserves to be treated with respect--which is why the European Union's obvious reluctance to advance the country's membership bid is a blow to Turkish pride. But Turkey's pursuit of its regional leadership ambition has come at a high cost. When the AKP came to power in Turkey almost two decades ago, Erdogan's mentor was Ahmet Davutoglu, an academic who then became foreign minister and eventually prime minister. Davutoglu was keen to expand Turkey's influence abroad, but under the slogan \"zero problems with our neighbours.\" How ironic, then, that Erdogan has created problems with almost all of his neighbours. The EU cannot accept Turkey's appalling record on human rights, especially following the military's failed coup attempt of 2016. Israel cannot abide Turkey's support for Hamas (which is aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood) in Gaza. And virtually everyone is exasperated by Turkey's policy in Syria, which features attacking the Kurds--the most effective fighters against the Islamic State--and ambivalence towards several jihadist groups. Significantly, Davutoglu has broken with Erdogan and formed a rival political party. True, Erdogan's supporters can justifiably argue that Turkey has become a regional player to be reckoned with. The EU has to be financially generous, or else Turkey may let hundreds of thousands of Syrian and other refugees from war and poverty flood into Europe. Russia and Iran, which both support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, recognise that a settlement of the Syrian conflict will depend on Turkey's acquiescence--hence the continuing three-party peace process that began three years ago in Astana, Kazakhstan. Even the United States under President Donald Trump has had to eat a slice of humble pie: Turkey, regardless of NATO sensitivities and American economic threats, stands by its decision to buy a Russian air-defence system. But the Libyan venture may be a step too far. On December 5, the Turkish parliament ratified an agreement between Erdogan and Sarraj that sets a maritime border between their two countries. The Turkish-Libyan deal ignores international law--as the EU, Cyprus, Greece, and Egypt have pointed out. It also ignores geography, because the Greek island of Crete lies halfway between the two countries. And it threatens the January 2019 agreement between Egypt, Israel, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority to exploit the gas reserves of the eastern Mediterranean. Erdogan is the epitome of today's strongman political leader. But by the time his Libyan gamble sours, as it inevitably will, he will have run out of both luck and friends.

The Earth-sized exoplanet orbits around its star's habitable zone, meaning that the temperature is mild enough to allow a rocky planet to support liquid water. The distant world was discovered when scientists were picking through old observations that came from the Kepler space telescope, which stopped its work in 2018 but provided a vast trove of data from the stars before it did. The planet had previously been discarded by a computer algorithm that misidentified it. But as part of new research, scientists were able to have another look at the information in the Kepler data and see that it really was a previously undiscovered planet. In fact, it is the most similar to Earth of any planet discovered by the Kepler space telescope, in terms of its size and estimated temperature. While other exoplanets may be more similar in size or temperature, no world has been discovered that has quite such a combination of those two qualities, as well as lying in the habitable zone. The planet is 300 light-years from us, just a little larger than our Earth and receives about 75% of the light that we get from our own Sun. That means the temperature could be similar, too, allowing for the conditions required for life. Scientists are concerned, however, that its star is a red dwarf, unlike our own more stable Sun. Such stars are known for throwing out stellar flare-ups that could destroy any potential life before it takes hold on the planet. Scientists now hope to learn more about the planet, including any information about its atmosphere and to get more specific knowledge of its size and conditions."

      "text": "DINING OUT; A REWARDING PASSAGE TO INDIA\n1988-02-21T05:00:00.000Z\nA QUICK and delicious passage to India can be made enjoyably at a modest storefront restaurant named Bonani in Stamford.\nNamed for a wooded garden in Bangladesh (the owner's home), Bonani evokes a sense of India, in limited space, through photographs on the pine wainscotted walls, Indian music and especially through the seductive aroma of cumin, cardamom and curry spices wafting from the kitchen.\nThough it began as a take-out shop in Westport (which is still going strong), Bonani has blossomed into a bona fide restaurant with a large menu featuring many chicken, lamb, beef and shrimp variations, and a vegetarian corner. Emphasis is on South Indian cuisine, though there are dishes from across the map of India.\nIf you are a novice at Indian food, you might begin with the assorted Indian hors d'oeuvres, which give you a sampling of pakora (vegetable fritters), samosa (minced meat fritters), kebabs (minced, spiced and tightly pressed beef patties) and spicy pappadams (large crispy wafers).\nAn admirable starter was the chef's special appetizer: pieces of marinated chicken breast in a green pepper-onion sauce enlivened with fresh coriander. Consider also steaming hot mughlai paratha, an oven-browned envelope of dough filled with minced meat, eggs, chopped green pepper and onions. Listed under breads, it makes a generous appetizer as well.\nMost successfully seasoned of many entrees were chicken tikka masala (chunks of marinated breast in an aromatic pale pink yogurt-almond sauce), chicken dhansak (well spiced in a tangy herb sauce with bay leaf), shrimp Madras (jumbo shrimp in a smartly spiced coriander-tomato sauce) and chicken patiala (white meat in a resonant tomato paste). Mattar paneer, a vegetable dish of cheese cubes and peas, had a hint of cardamom and considerable subtlety.\nThe platter of light basmati rice served with entrees is a special treat, seasoned with whole cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and ghee (clarified butter). All three condiments offered as add-ons to the meal were satisfying, from the mild mango chutney to the very hot mango lime pickle. The soothingly cool cucumber raita (a yogurt-based refresher, intended to offset the heat of the various spicy dishes) was a standout.\nLamb vindaloo, one of the most incendiary creations in the Indian repertoire, made with a variety of spices, was mild at Bonani, as though concern for customers' palates led the chef to hold the chilies. We vindaloo lovers were disappointed, though others might find this dish (and the chicken vindaloo) adequately seasoned.\nSome dishes at Bonani were acceptable, but somewhat pale renderings of their usual selves: rogan josh (lamb with tomato, red pepper pods and fresh coriander), shag gosht (lamb with spinach) and aloo-mutter-gobi (a vegetable dish that had only phantom seasoning). A large platter of lamb biryani (rice with lamb and vegetables) was surprisingly characterless, devoid of the nuts and saffron mentioned on the menu and served with a soupy dhal (lentil) sauce and a fiery onion chutney.\nYou should avoid such tepid offerings as the bland, thin mulligatawny soup, with a whisper of lemon but no other semblance to this old Anglo-Indian standby, and the vegetable soup, a similar broth, with the addition of a few peas and cauliflower bits. The pappadams and poori (deep-fried, puffy, crisp bread)had excellent flavor, but were excessively greasy.\nThe mystique of Indian desserts often eludes western tastebuds, but the intention is to have something light, delicate and restful after a hotly seasoned meal. The dessert trio at Bonani filled the bill exactly: rasmalai (cream-soaked Indian cheese), gulab jaman (small, honey-soaked dough balls) and firni (pink custard with rose water).\nThe price at Bonani is certainly right: $25.35 for a three-course dinner for two, with beverages, tax and tip extra. That's hard to beat for a different and, on the whole, satisfying dining adventure. The menu is large enough, with sufficient succulent choices, to make dining at Bonani a rewarding Indian voyage. BONANI Good 2333 Summer Street, Stamford. 348-8138. Atmosphere: A narrow storefront crowded with booths, knotty pine, wainscotted walls decorated with pictures of India and background Indian music. Service: Well trained and expeditious. Recommended dishes: Assorted Indian hors d'oeuvres, chef's special appetizer, mughlai paratha, poori, pappadam, cucumber raita, chicken dhansak, shrimp Madras, chicken tikka masala, chicken patiala, mattar paneer, rasmalai, gulab jaman, firni. Prices: Lunch: entrees $4.95 to $5.95; dinner: entrees $6.95 to $10.95. Hours: Lunch: 12 to 3 P.M. daily; dinner: 5 to 10 P.M. daily. Credit cards: All major cards. Reservations: Accepted.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-02 00:00:00      \nFarmers are unable to derive enough profits from their regular jhuming while the poppy fields are offering much more to them The cultivation of opium has been surging in Bandarban despite regular drives by joint forces comprising Bangladesh Army, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and other law enforcement agencies. Almost 25 acres of the poppy crop  were destroyed in different upazilas of the district. Even so, the reason behind the increased interest in poppy cultivation is somewhat surprising for some locals, as this correspondent found during a visit to the area. Most recently, on February 19, the Bangladesh Army destroyed an acre of poppy field in Ruma. On February 16, BGB destroyed three acres of poppy field in Thanchi's Ko-Ong area and just the previous day, on February 15, the army destroyed another acre in Ruma upazila's Tuikkajhiri area, according to law enforcement sources. Bangladesh Army Ruma zone Commander Lt Col Md Goulam Akbar, psc, explained how poppy plants are being used in making the deadly opium and as the drugs are sold at high prices, he said, locals are getting more interested day by day in investing more in poppy cultivation than in their yearly Jhum yields. \"Despite all the challenges we are patrolling even in the most inaccessible parts of the hill tracts to free the region from drugs and we will continue our drives as long as it is necessary,\" said Commander Akbar. On February 4, the security forces in a joint drive led by East Bengal Regiment (EB) Commander Md Ashiqur Rahman destroyed 12 poppy fields across 10 acres of hilly slopes in Saikot and Khulen Khumi areas. The farmers made good their escape. Shoihlaching Marma, a local journalist in Ruma, said that poppy plants grew more in quantity in winter, and as this year's winter was colder, cultivation reached a peak.   Uhlaching Marma, chairman of Ruma upazila, said the local authorities were taking different measures to discourage the farmers from growing poppy, including arranging meetings to raise awareness about the consequences of the illicit cultivation.  \"Jhuming\", an age-old practice of the indigenous people of the hill tracts, is now facing a challenge because of the flawed transportation system that bars farmers from selling their produce and earn an easy livelihood, said Lu Pru Ong Marma, a Ruma resident. Farmers are unable to derive enough profits from their regular jhuming while the poppy fields are offering much more to them. This factor might be making the farmers inclined to take risks and despite the drives, cultivation is on the rise this year, the local added. Members of the Arakan Liberation Party (ALP), which is a Rakhine political party in Myanmar, and its armed wing, the Arakan Liberation Army (ALA), somehow cross the border near Ruma, Thanchi and Alikadam upazilas and cultivate the illicit plant with help from locals, smuggling it back to Myanmar, said local sources. The profits gained from these drugs are the main source of income for the insurgent militant group, locals say. Md Shamsul Alam, upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) of Ruma, said the authorities had directed the local representatives to warn residents about the aftermath of such illegal cultivation and would arrange regular meetings to raise awareness about the problem. He said: \"Despite our warnings, if anybody tries to break the law, they will face punishment.\""

And I hope his role will not be lost sight of in the shadows of formal events recalling everything that he did for us.  \"If someone fails to understand Sir Abed, he or she will never understand what Bangladesh is,\" said the noted economist, adding, \"Sir Abed kept in touch with almost everyone he knew.\"  \"Since its inception, Brac has discovered itself in many ways and also encouraged the formation of many other organisations of such kind. \"Writing a book can never depict Sir Abed's works.

In her remarks, educationist Rasheda K Choudhury recalled that Sir Abed not only used to dream of a prosperous future for all but also tirelessly worked towards attaining it. \"He fought radicals all his life in order to empower women in society. There was even a time when a school run by Brac was set afire, but Sir Abed was relaxed about that.  \"I hope those groomed by Sir Abed will take the responsibility of taking his vision ahead and implement it fully,\" she added.  Chandra Shekhar Saha, executive member of National Crafts Council, said: \"Sir Abed never wanted any children to be deprived of schooling. He dreamt of making education an enjoyable exercise.\"  Sukhendra Kumar Sarkar, former treasurer of Brac University, noted that Sir Abed was a visionary who used to plan the future in advance. He added, \"Other than fighting poverty, education and health for all were the other two top priorities of his.\"  Among others, former cultural affairs minister and eminent media personality Asaduzzaman Noor, Martha Chen of Harvard University, Erum Mariam of Brac University, Majeda Khanam of Brac, and Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman, Brac's incumbent chairperson, were present at the event."

On Tuesday, at Karwanbazar wholesale market, five kg of local onion sold at Tk190 and the imported one at Tk170, while three days ago they were Tk220 and Tk180 respectively. At wholesale rate, per kg local onion costs Tk38 while the imported one Tk34.  But in retail market, per kg local onion was selling at Tk60 and the imported onion at Tk45 to Tk50, Dhaka Tribune found while visiting different kitchen markets in the capital.  Md Masud, a trader at Karwanbazar, said: \"There is no sign of the price going down as Eid-ul-Azha is drawing near. Besides, flood is another reason for high price of onion.\"  Another importer and trader of the market Abdul Karim claimed that in the last three days, the price remained stable and feared that it would increase as the transportation cost would be high because of inclement weather.  Meanwhile, prices of garlic and ginger have fallen by Tk10 to Tk15 per kg in the wholesale market. But in the retail market per kg garlic is selling at Tk230 to Tk250 which is Tk180 to Tk130 in the wholesale market. Similarly, per kg ginger is selling at Tk200 to Tk220 in retail market which is sold at Tk140 to Tk180 in the wholesale market.  Asked about price gap between retail and wholesale market, Md Matin, a trader at Panthapath, said: \"We cannot preserve onion because of bad weather. So, to minimize our loss, we have to sell at higher prices.\"  He also blamed short supply for the price hike. Government plans to sell onion through TCB The government is considering measures to rein in the price spiral of onion. \"Prices of onion increased due to supply shortage as imports from India slowed down. In addition, rain has had negative impact on the supply chain,\" said Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi. The minister made the comment while briefing journalists at his secretariat on export performance of the just concluded fiscal year yesterday. To monitor prices, especially those of onion and garlic, ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the government already directed the deputy commissioners, said Tipu. \"We have come to know that the Indian government has withdrawn incentives against export of onion, which may be a reason for the price hike. I have already asked the commerce secretary to check it and take necessary steps,\" said the minister. \"We are closely monitoring the prices of essentials and if needed, onion will be sold at open market through Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB),\" said Tipu.

Three local influential men, who took lease for sand lifting from a portion of the Manu river area six months ago, are extracting sand from a depth of around 50 feet of the waterbody near the bridge in Sharifpur union of Kulaura, said stakeholders. During a visit to the spot a couple of days ago, this correspondent found three dredgers engaged in extracting sand near the bridge. \"Flood control embankment in Manu bridge area got damaged more than once due to unplanned sand lifting from the riverbed. Later authorities repaired it with sandbags,\" said Makhlisur Rahman of Namaja area in Kulaura. Many houses and other set-ups in the area are on the verge of extinction due to the sand lifting, said locals, adding that they observed different programmes including human chains on several occasions over the issue. Seeking anonymity, several locals said the lease-holders conduct the illegal act at night amid lax monitoring by the authorities. \"I am going to lose three acres of land due to erosion caused by illegal sand lifting,\" said Firoz Khan, a local. Md Junab Ali, chairman of Sharifpur union parishad (UP), said they submitted a complaint to the deputy commissioner of Moulvibazar demanding immediate steps to stop illegal sand lifting from the bridge area. \"If the callous act is not prevented, Manu Bridge will face threat, especially during the monsoon, when the water level sees an alarming rise. \"Once the bridge becomes unusable, import and export from and to India through Chatlapur land port will stop, causing trouble for a large number of people on both sides,\" he said. Abdul Malik, former president of Shamshernagar Banik Samity, said he along with former local UP member Nashibur Rahman Nashim and Noor Ahmed Chowdhury Bulbul took the lease for sand lifting from the river area for 2019-2020 fiscal year. Asked whether the deal allows them to lift sand from near the bridge, he declined to make any comment. According to the Balu Mohal O Mati Babosthapona Ain, 2010 (Sand Fields and Soil Management Act, 2010), sand lifting is not allowed within 500 metres of any bridge area, said Abdul Karim Kim, executive member of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon. But the syndicate of influential traders having political connections continued lifting sand near the bridge with powerful dredgers, he said. Asked about the matter, Kulaura Upazila Assistant Commissioner (Land) Nazratun Naim said, \"I seized different equipment from the spot several times and ordered the sand lifters to remove the dredgers from the bridge area. Administrative action will be taken if sand lifting is done there again.\" Upazila Nirbahi Officer ATM Farhad Chowdhury said he will look into the matter and take action against the perpetrators."

A branch of the Arialkha river flows on the west of Natun Torki. The area is well-known in Barishal for Torki Bandar, a narrow but flowing river on the west. The Bede huts are just on the outskirts of the crowded Natun Torki market. Soud Khan, a Bede Sardar from Kharia in Munshiganj, and two other Bedes--Md Zakir Hossain and Md Nurun Nabi--guide me into their tents, many in the open space and some under the shade of a tree. It is a bright, sunny afternoon in June 29, 2018. Each tent seems to have everything a family needs, all crammed into a 100 to 150 square-feet space. Most tents are also fitted with solar panels. The tents facing west glow in the golden sunshine. It is Friday, an off-day here. I inspect the tents and take photos in the daylight before finally sitting down for a chat with the elderly Bedes, surrounded by everyone of the little Bede community. Md Zakir Hossain, in his late forties, informs me that all 14 families there had started their journey from Khari in Munshiganj in October 2017. Since then they have set up their tents and set up businesses in 14 places! Their journey through these months saw them moving through Shariatpur, Madaripur, Barguna, Jhalakathi and Barishal. Before coming to Natun Torki, they spent a month and ten days in the Doari Bridge area in Barishal.  \"We stay in an area for as long as the business is good,\" says Hossain, admitting that the business is actually not that good anywhere. \"We survive on minimal income and the scope of business dries out pretty quickly. So, we keep moving.\" The 14 families are all Mal Manta, one of a dozen groups among the Bede. One main business of the female Mal Bede is making use of singe, a metal pipe that sucks out bad blood from the human body to give relief from pain. Other businesses of Mal Bede include the search of lost gold, and sale of imitation ornaments, cosmetics, amulets, cups and other light utensils. Hossain and his group plan to stay at Natun Torki for no longer than two weeks. They do not think business will be good here. I call Hossain some 20 days after I meet them to check if they have moved on. \"Yes, we are now at Haturia Launch Ghat in Goshairhat Thana under Shariatpur district,\" he tells me. \"We stayed at Natun Torki for 15 days.\" The life of the Bedes is tough indeed. \"Because we are always on the run, our children cannot attend school,\" laments Rubina Akhtar, 45, explaining that none of the 25 children of the 14 families receive education.  \"Many years back, Father Renato, a Catholic priest, used to assist us and had a school that would travel with us,\" recalls Rubina's husband Nurun Nabi, 55, who had been a teacher of the floating school. Nurun Nabi studied up to class ten and is ready to teach the Bede children again.  \"Give us a school and a teacher,\" Rubina demands of me repeatedly. \"We want education for our children.\" When I mention that Bangladesh reportedly has a 100 percent enrollment for children, Rubina shouts in disagreement, \"It is a lie.\" A large percentage of the Bede is on the move like these 14 families; and their children do not get any education. About 15 years ago, these groups used to glide through the country in boats. Their economic condition was better back then. Now, none them have a boat. Grambangla Unnayan Committee, a non-profit organisation that works closely with Bedes, estimates that there are 5,000 Bede groups roaming around the country for 10 months around the year. Then they assemble at 75 locations in 39 districts. Normally, they get together during Eid-ul-Azha or national and local elections. Most of them were not allowed to vote until 2007.However, a great percentage of Bede households do not have land or houses where they are registered as voters. They simply carry their tents everywhere. According to a survey by the NGO, more than 90 percent of Bedes are illiterate. An overwhelming percentage live below the poverty line. Very few children are vaccinated. As they change locations often, they do not enjoy any government family welfare schemes or health assistance. Although they belong to the poorest of the poor and are landless, they hardly get khas land for settlement. Their access to safety net programmes such as old age allowance, VGF cards, disability allowance, flood relief etc. is minimal. Before visiting Natun Torki, we also spend hours at Torki Char Bede Palli. The hamlet is located along a half kilometer stretch on a western branch of the Arialkha river that snakes through Torki Bandar. The Bede hamlet, with its two-storey concrete and wooden houses, is neat and clean. Some houses, of course, reveal the poverty of the 60 families staying there. The shabbier houses are built like boats on plinths, perhaps in fond memory of their long-lost boats. The differences between the well-off and poorer Bede are clearly visible. Md Nannu Sarder tells me that in addition to the 60 families settled on tiny plots of land purchased as far back as 25 years ago, another 60 to 70 families assembled here on boats for two months in October. Torki Char Bazar is home for them. Some families have small plots of land but they are yet to build houses. For a month or two in October and November they relax, organise parties with singing and dancing, repair their boats, and settle social matters such as disputes and marriages. \"About half of the 70 families who don't own houses and have their boats under repair set up tents,\" explains the Sardar (leader of the Bede hamlet). The hamlet grows lively with the assembled crowds. But during business season, most working men and women go out to sell their business ware. Some women roam around with singe leaving the hamlet nearly empty. Beside the village, the river flows quietly--lifeblood of the wandering people, eager to settle down as agriculturists.  \"But we have been able to purchase only tiny plots of land on which to build our houses,\" says Nannu Sarder, his strong features not once reveal his age of 75. \"None of us have agricultural land.\" This is a change they want now. \"Once we settle down, our children can go to school,\" asserts Nannu. Two of Sarder's friends--Md Jahangir and Md Abdur Rab--join us as we chat. They reminisce about their life 25 years back, when they all had boats. \"We used to come here twice a year since 1972. The river had a magnetic power. We would repair our boats here,\" recalls Md Jahangir, 65, who was the first to buy five decimals of land for Tk 40,000 back in the day. \"The local Gale (non-Bede Bangalee) offered to sell land to us,\" says Md Jahangir. Others followed Jahangir too. The Manta of Torki Char Bede Palli in Gournadi Pourashava are all from Amanatganj, Barishal, and all are Muslims. They believe that they are different from Bedes of Dhaka Division and other areas. Soud Khan of Kharia in Munshiganj who accompanied us agrees. \"I can see the Bede of Barishal are the homely kind,\" observes Khan. The benefit of a permanent address is clear. However, even after settling down, they face social difficulties with the Gale. \"They look down upon us and do not want to socialise with us,\" says Nannu Sarder. \"We pray in separate mosques and we do not mix with the Gale who envy our economic well-being.\" Relations between the Bede and Gale turned bitter after a fight two years ago. Like the Bede who have settled in the Torki Bandar area, other Bede groups are also trying to settle on land. One such group is seen in Kakalia village in the Nagari union of Kaliganj upazila in Gazipur. Even a year and half ago, around 60 Bedes had boats beautifully lined up in the Turag river close to the Tongi-Ghorashal Highway. At one time, 200 boats would float in this part of the Turag, serving as a reminder of the river gypsy tradition in riverine Bengal. But in July 2018, only eight boats were left. Quite a few of the awnings were set on the land close to the river. Others have disappeared from the river with signs of dilapidation around. Around 60 families have now built their houses on khas land on the Turag bank. The majority of the families have built tin shed houses, some with concrete floor. One family has constructed a two-storey home with a wooden deck--a typical house of a well-off Bede family. Others have set the awnings of their boats right on the banks of Turag. Mosammat Rezia, 70, born and brought up on a boat, feels sad about the boat life that has recently ended for her and others. She has sold cosmetics and ornaments on foot all her life, a typical mode of work for Sandar Manta women. She has two sons who sell cosmetics and supplement their income by fishing in the Belai beel and river during monsoon.  \"We are destitute,\" sighs Rezia. \"We have to buy everything except for water.\" The families, however, have received two concrete toilets and one tubewell from the government.\" Land and agriculture are mirages to the Bede of Kakalia or elsewhere. 60 Bede families have settled on 51 decimals of khas land; but not for free. Abu Miah, Tabu Miah and Ali have taken yearly leases of 20 decimals of land and divided it into 10 tiny plots. Fazlul Haque, Rezia's son, took one of the plots for BDT 8,000 15 years ago. Others have taken plots for between BDT 40,000 and BDT 50,000.  It is here that we find Nuru Miah, aged 110. He stoops low, yet he walks fast and his eyesight is perfect. Born in Demra, he came here 10 years back. His wife Gedi Begum is 90 years old. Both husband and wife were born, and have spent all their life, on boats.  \"Since then we have set the awnings of our boat on land and we live under it,\" he says, pointing to the oval-shaped structure that he set up after his boat broke. Everybody in the little hamlet is sympathetic to the aged couple. A few families in Kakalia that still live there will soon abandon their boats. \"We do not want to go back,\" says Sadhina Begum, 47, who with a son and two daughters left their boat about a year back. Sadhina's son works at a garment factory at College Gate, 10 minutes away from Kakalia. Like Sadhina's son, 15 other young boys and girls go to work in the nearby garment factory. A much bigger group of Sandar Bede, around 320 families, have been living on the Turag bank attached to the Tongi bridge. It is actually an age-old Bede slum comprising small huts crammed on a narrow strip of public land. The men of this Bede squalid are in the fish trade. They buy fish from Abdullahpur, Jatrabari, Karwan Bazar, etc and sell it in the local market. \"The Turag was wider and clearer in the past,\" says octogenarian Ismail, \"but now it is too polluted with hardly any fish to catch.\" The women, as usual, sell cosmetics and utensils in villages far and near. Bedana, aged 70, sits in front of her hut in great despair. She has heard that many of the Bede houses would have to be dismantled for the construction of another bridge in Tongi. \"We have no land and no means. We do not know where to go if we are required to move out,\" says Bedana. When I checked with Giashuddin Sarker, councillor of Ward No. 57, Gazipur City Corporation, in late September last year, he reported that, \"94 Bede families have already been evicted for Tongi bridge construction. They have taken shelter in their relatives' houses and a few families have gone to Savar Bede villages.\"  Other Sandars at Tongi are equally concerned. In fact, this has Bedes all around the country concerned. They want change in their lifestyles. They want to settle on land and become agriculturists. It is a century-old desire as reflected in W.W. Hunter's writing on Bediyas around a century and half ago: \"They mostly wander about in boats, and subsist by jugglery and thieving, but some of them have now settled down as agriculturists.\" However, Bede life on land is not easy. Unemployment and social ills such as drug addiction thrived in Bede villages. But years back, things began to improve with the help of a police officer, Habibur Rahman, then a superintendent police of Dhaka and now a deputy inspector general of police. The police official appeared as a great friend to the Bede. \"He motivated the drug addicts and dealers in the villages to engage in productive work,\" says Ramjan Ahmed, an educated Bede leader from Badda and managing director of Uttaran Fashion, a small garment factory that exclusively employs Bede girls and boys. \"Many girls who previously charmed snakes and sold cosmetics now operate modern sewing machines and make clothes for export.\" The factory is also a training ground. \"So far 105 girls and boys have been trained and about 50 of them work at the factory,\" states Ramjan Ahmed. \"The factory keeps training girls with a financial incentive. They seek work in other factories after learning the skills of the trade. This is how many are transitioning from traditional work to modern-day work.\"  \"The profits are spent on the welfare of the Bedes,\" says Habibur Rahman, who has a comprehensive plan for the Bedes of Savar in particular. A primary school dedicated for the Bede children is months away. A cluster village on about four acres of land for the landless Bede is becoming visible on the other side of the Bongshi river, which was the life blood of the Bede not long ago. With Habibur Rahman's initiative, 36 young people have learned to drive. Many others have passed the test to become police officers and got other jobs. He set up four schools in Khari in Munshiganj, and also helps when Bedes face trouble anywhere in the country.  \"I also want to set up a Bede museum in Savar where people will see the Bede artefacts and learn about their history,\" says Habibur Rahman with confidence. The Bedes are clear enough on one thing: they are falling behind in the race for progress. They realise if their nomadic existence continues, they cannot send their children to schools, access public health services and attain skills to move out of extreme poverty. So, their appeal to the state is that they are permanently allocated some khas land or that arrangements are made so that they can purchase small plots in areas they feel comfortable to live in.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-08 00:00:00      \nAbout 280 Rohingyas, who had been adrift in the Bay of Bengal for weeks, were rescued by the Bangladesh Navy and taken to Bhashan Char in Noakhali today. \"They were taken to Bhashan Char earlier today,\" Mahbubul Alam Talukder, Refugee, Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) of Bangladesh, confirmed to The Daily Star today. Earlier, the rights bodies said two boats carrying around 500 Rohingyas were refused by Malaysia and Thailand in mid-April and were adrift in the sea. The UN, European Union and a number of rights bodies had called on Bangladesh to rescue the Rohingya and shelter them. Bangladesh, however, had responded that it was not possible to shelter any more Rohingya, as it was already facing huge pressures to shelter and manage the 1.1 million Rohingya in Cox's Bazar. However, Bangladesh today rescued a portion of them. \"It is a very tiny boat compared to its 280 passengers. They are starving. The navy has given them food, water and first aid,\" a navy official told AFP. The men, women, and children on the boat -- found some 40 kilometres south of Saint Martin's Island -- were seen squatting with their hands on their knees, he said. Authorities say they are likely to have come from Myanmar's Rakhine state rather than camps in southeastern Bangladesh where nearly one million refugees live, as they did not have identity cards issued by UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, AFP reports. On May 3, Bangladesh Navy sheltered at least 29 Rohingyas, who swam to the coast of Teknaf in Cox's Bazar, were then rescued by locals and finally handed over to the navy. Earlier on April 16, some 400 Rohingyas were rescued by Bangladesh authorities. They were, however, quarantined in the Rohingya camp healthcare facilities. On May 4, Bangladesh Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen said no more Rohingya would be sheltered in Cox's Bazar camps because of the risk of a coronavirus infection in the camps. \"If any new Rohingya is to be sheltered, we will take them to Bhashan Char,\" he told The Daily Star. Bangladesh Navy has built a housing facility of 120 cluster villages on the 40sqkm island in Bhashan Chair under a Tk 2,312 crore project for accommodating one lakh of the nearly 1 million Rohingyas sheltered at the crowded camps in Cox's Bazar. However, the authorities were considering shelving the relocation plan after the UN and other aid agencies opposed the plan, saying there were risks of flood and cyclones and that the location did not have facilities for accommodating aid agency officials."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-02 00:00:00      \nMany are victims of trafficking, but have little redress for the crimes they have suffered in Bangladesh Like many poor Bangladeshis, Komol Shohlagar thought moving overseas for work would change his life. It did - but not in the way he hoped. Shohlagar, 33, travelled to Libya with people smugglers in the hope of reaching Europe, but when he got there, the smugglers held him captive to extort money from his family. He was only freed after they paid $14,000 to get him back - money they had to borrow from loan sharks. When he finally returned to Bangladesh last year, he was jobless and saddled with huge debts - a situation that left him feeling suicidal. \"I was really depressed. My family had borrowed a lot of money to save me,\" Shohlagar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"The lenders came home every other day and threatened us. There were times when I thought about taking a rope and hanging myself.\" Charities in Bangladesh say thousands of returning migrants face such struggles and little official help is available. Many are victims of trafficking, but have little redress for the crimes they have suffered in Bangladesh. The country depends heavily on foreign remittances and has an official policy of encouraging citizens to look for jobs abroad. According to official data, at least 1 million Bangladeshis secured jobs overseas in 2017 - the highest number ever recorded. But the system depends largely on unlicensed brokers working in rural areas and opens the door to trafficking and cheating. Last month, 64 Bangladeshi migrants hoping to get to Europe had to be rescued from a boat off Tunisia. In May, 37 drowned in the same region when their boat capsized. \"The state does not have a proper system to support the returnees,\" said Shariful Hasan, who heads the migration department of Bangladeshi aid group Brac. \"All our policies are focused on sending people abroad. We don't even have a system that can count the total number of returnees every year.\" Abu Bakar Siddique, the civil servant who leads the Home Ministry's anti-trafficking work, acknowledged the government needed to develop a system of support for the returnees. \"For now, what we do is, we ensure that the victims reach their families,\" he said. \"With the kind of capacity that we have, this is what's possible. \"We do work with girls who were trafficked to India. We also have shelters for victims. But as far as counselling is concerned, it's not something that we have not managed to do effectively. We have to develop our system.\" False promise There is no official data on how many migrants are defrauded, but charities say thousands return to Bangladesh every year after being cheated abroad. A 2017 study by the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit, a migrants rights group, found 51% of returning migrants had experienced fraud or degrading treatment while abroad. Nearly one in five of those who paid to be taken abroad did not even make it out of the country, it found. Stories like Shohlagar's are common. The International Organization for Migration (IOM), which helps repatriate migrants, said many were left with little choice but to go abroad again to try to pay off their debts. \"Due to the mounting pressure from the money lenders to pay back the loan, they migrants are unable to stay in their house upon return,\" said Pravina Gurung, the IOM's head of migration and development. \"The result of an inability to achieve economic self-sufficiency, social re-integration and psychosocial suffering often lead them to another unsafe migration attempt, further debt, and even suicide.\" Mohammad Jakir Hossen, 40, worked as a technician in a garment factory before he paid a broker to take him to Italy in search of more lucrative work. Instead he was taken to Libya, where he was made to work by traffickers who took a cut of his salary, holding him there with the false promise that he would eventually make it to Italy. Since he returned to Dhaka he has been running a roadside fruit stall, with little hope of making back the $5,000 he borrowed to pay for the trip. But he said he would do the same again. \"You may think that I am crazy, but if I get a chance to go outside, I will take a loan again,\" Hossen said. \"Five people including my old mother depend upon me right now. And what I earn is clearly not enough.\" Brac, one of the few local organisations that provides support to the returnees, follows a three-fold approach, said Hasan, offering practical help with their return, financial help, and counselling. Kamal Chowdhury, an associate professor at the Department of Clinical Psychology at Dhaka University, has counselled migrant returnees. Some had been raped or sexually harassed and all need help, he said, urging the government to make assessments of returnees mandatory. \"Migrant workers return home with dreams that are broken,\" he said."

A statement issued by the Chief Minister Office said the victims had attended the three-day religious congregation and contracted Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The state government said two had died while undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad, one each in Apollo Hospital and Global Hospital. Two other deaths were reported from Nizamabad and Gadwal. It also added that special teams under district collectors have identified those who came in contact with these people, and they were shifted to hospitals.  The authorities also urged people who attended the prayers in Delhi to contact officials. \"Telangana health department requests those who attended the congregation at Markaz to voluntarily report at hospitals,\" it said, adding that the government would conduct tests and offer treatment to them free of cost. Thousands of Indians and hundreds of foreigners had attended the conference that took place on March 9 and 10 in the densely populated Nizamuddin area of Delhi. Ten of the 17 confirmed cases in Tamil Nadu on March 30 were also of people who had participated in the congregation. India has recorded 1,251 cases of the coronavirus, with 32 deaths, but health experts say the country of 1.3 billion people could see a major surge in cases that could overwhelm its weak public health system."

Local sources said erosion by Padma River has intensified in Rajbari, and is gradually receding in Shariatpur, causing immense sufferings to the people. A large number of houses, structures, trees, and crops on vast tracts of land were washed away by floodwaters, and strong river currents in different flood-hit areas. In Rajbari, erosion in the Padma River has taken an alarming turn, it already forced thousands of families, under the Sadar, Goalanda, and Kalukhali upazila, to leave their houses, due to rise in water levels, villages within the district are becoming more vulnerable. According to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), they are dumping sand bags in the river to prevent erosion in the area. But locals claimed that BWDB's efforts aren't enough as forceful current, and rising water level is washing the sand bags away. They hoped the authority would take more effective measures to prevent erosion, which eroded at least 19 points of the district. Goalanda's Bhakla Union Parishad Chairman Md Amjad Hossain said: \"Not only the houses, but acres of croplands are underwater. BWDB initiatives are praiseworthy, but not enough to avert the erosion.\"  Arifur Rahman Angkur, Sub-Divisional Engineer BWDB's Rajbari office, said: \"We are dumping Geo bags to lessen the casualties. We will take more measures if needed.\" In Shariatpur, at least 20 establishments, including a mosque, 5 business centres, and houses were devoured by the Padma River, and it is threatening more areas in Naria upazila of Shariatpur district due to a wild rise in water level, causing severe river erosion in the past couple of days. Around 200 meters of the river protection dam has collapsed in the district on Thursday, making hundreds of residents, around the riverbank, to shift from the spot instantly. Locals said, the water level of the Padma was increasing since Thursday but has receded on Sunday.  Member of Parliament (MP), Deputy Minister for Water Resources AKM Enamul Haque Shamim, State Minister Zahid Faruque, and Director General of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) Mahfuzur Rahman, visited the area Sunday. They said there was no negligence with the construction of the protection dam. The damage was a result of increased current, and rise of water level in the river. It is to be noted that last year, more than 6,000 houses, around 1,000 business centres, and many other establishments were washed away due to devastating erosion of the Padma River in Naria upazila."

On the real-time rankings, Dhaka showed an average AQI score of 99 at 10:02am on Wednesday, according to IQAir, which monitors global air quality. Dhaka's air quality was classified as \"moderate.\" Residential areas like Bashundhara and Gulshan showed AQI scores of 118 and 88 respectively. India's Delhi, China's Chengdu, and Vietnam's Hanoi occupied the first, second, and third spots in the list of cities with the worst air quality with AQI scores of 191, 168, and 163 respectively. A numerical value between 151 and 200 indicates that everyone may begin to experience health effects. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. Air quality between 201 and 300 is classified as \"very unhealthy.\" If the score is between 301 and 500, then it is classified as \"hazardous.\"  The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants -- Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh has been struggling with air pollution for a long time. Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Brick kilns, vehicles run on fuel containing higher levels of sulphur, as well as construction work, have all been identified as major sources of air pollution. Air quality further declines during the dry months -- from October to April -- but improves during the monsoon."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-10 00:00:00      \nEid no longer means joy for the residents of five upazilas in Sirajganj, as they have lost everything in the recent flood. Over 15 thousand people in the five upazilas have been affected by the flood. They lost their homes, croplands and livelihoods, and had to seek shelter in flood protection embankments and became scattered to different areas in the district for survival.  Shahitan Begum, 60, of Pachil village under Shahzadpur upazila, lost her home in the flood last month and is now living in a small makeshift shanty on a piece of rented land near the village market. She no longer affords food twice a day as the flood and river erosion took away everything she had. \"When the village got flooded, I could not save food grains, furniture and money at my home. Now my home no longer exists as the hungry Jamuna devoured my homestead and everything of my family-owned. I am struggling to survive as I have nothing and there is also no work for me,\" Shahitan said. \"We are barely surviving with minimum food; in most of the days we don't get to eat twice due to the lack of food grains,\" she lamented. \"At a time when it is costly to even survive barely, Eid festivities have no meaning to us,\" Shahitan said adding \"our joy of Eid got washed away into the river.\" Johura Begum, another flood victim of the same village now living at a temporary flood shelter near the village market, also echoed what Shahitan had said. \"We are struggling to manage food for everyone in the family for the last couple of months as the recent flood washed away all we had. Eid hardly means anything anymore,\" Johura said.   \"We feel happy if we can manage just some rice and salt to eat for the whole family,\" she said. \"Amid such destitute situation, the joy of Eid with new clothes and tasty food items seem too farfetched for us. Eid cannot make us happy anymore,\" Johura added. A total of 15,434 people from over 3,079 families of 408 villages in the five upazilas were greatly affected having lost everything in the recent flood. Meanwhile, another 3,13,997 people in the district were partially affected by the flood, according to the Sirajganj relief and rehabilitation office. A total of 6,505 houses were entirely damaged while 44,013 houses were partially damaged during the flood. Talking to The Daily Star, Hasen Ali, a resident of Ghatabari village under Enayetpur upazila, urged the authorities concerned to provide them relief materials and rehabilitation for their survival. \"Victims like us, who have lost everything in the recent flood in last one month, need more relief materials and rehabilitation so that we can return to our normal life,\" he said. Dr Faruk Ahmed, deputy commissioner of Sirajganj district, told The Daily Star that they have already submitted a report about the flood damage to the ministry concerned for getting fund for rehabilitation of the victims."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-19 00:00:00      \nFeisal Hussain, Team Lead, BFP-B\n Weather index-based insurance is one of BFP-B's 30 live innovation-investments in Bangladesh. We do rigorous impact assessments to see how the business models are faring. We have completed the assessment of the weather index-based insurance model and have identified the opportunities and challenges the business model presents for the insurance industry, the government of Bangladesh and other private sector actors. One of the crucial challenges is that investments in business models to support agricultural insurance is being held back, given complex and time-consuming regulatory approvals are required across multiple regulators. For example, viable business models require partnerships between insurance companies (regulated by IDRA) and channel partners such as MNOs (regulated by BTRC), MFIs (regulated by MRA), payment service providers (regulated by Bangladesh Bank), and weather data providers (regulated by the meteorological department).  Can we have a one-stop shop (OSS) for insurance companies through for instance, BIDA, where investors in agricultural insurance can secure approval for all regulatory requirements conveniently, efficiently and predictably? Farzanah Chowdhury, MD & CEO, Green Delta Insurance Company Limited\n Agriculture is one of the key driving forces of our economy. More than 72 million people are engaged in the agriculture sector. Its contribution to GDP is around 14 percent. In 2015, we started a pilot project with International Finance Corporation (IFC) to mitigate the risk of financial loss in the cultivation process, thus helping the farmers in risk coverage. IFC has helped us create historical weather data grid and Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) has also supported us by providing historical data from 1981. In 2016, we joined hands with BFP-B. We have covered more than 15,000 farmers through awareness and policies who possess 5,000 acres of land and settled claims of 3,200 farmers till date. One of our unique features is quick claim settlement with an easy and transparent process. The momentum has already been created but we need to create more awareness not only among farmers but also among seed companies, NGO/MFI, banks, input retailers and policymakers about weather-based insurance products. We need robust support from the Ministry of Agriculture, and the government should provide incentives to private organisations to invest in this critical sector. We believe that agri insurance will be the game changer in the insurance sector. We are using the satellite data to track the weather conditions of the insured areas but currently we are dependent on international weather data service provider which is very costly. If we can develop a platform where researchers, practitioners and development partners work together, we can cut down the cost of weather data procurement to one-third of the present cost.   Ali Tareque Parvez, Senior Vice President, Green Delta Insurance Company Limited\n The weather index is basically a weather parametric index with a predetermined trigger point based on historical weather data. We have historical weather data since 1981 coupled with satellite data. We analyse this data, prepare the term sheet and take up coverage collaborating with our distribution partners and finally settle the claims. It is a comprehensive business model that combines multiple channel partners to reach the marginal farmers. We customise our insurance products according to the requirements of customers, so that it is beneficial for their investments. Our system operates in a way that avoids the need for on-site damage verification on a case-by-case basis and eliminates the need to collect payout claims from farmers. We have interpolated data stations in each 10 square kilometers which inform us about the weather in specific locality. Currently, we have more than 1,477 such stations. So far, we have covered perils like droughts, unseasonal rainfall, heavy rain, cold wave, humidity, high temperature etc. We have provided insurance for various cash crops such as industrial potatoes, vegetables, hybrid rice and so on. In 2016, and 2017 we insured against heavy rainfall. According to our offer, farmers could claim payouts if the rainfall was of 16mm. During the period the rainfall was 125mm. We settled the farmers' claims fast, and it helped us gain confidence of the farmers. We arranged a programme in the presence of the then State Minister for Finance and Planning, MA Mannan and IDRA Chairman and local authorities and handed over the claims to the affected 1,000 farmers. In 2018, there was an unprecedented cold wave and we settled claims of 2,000 farmers. Through Value Added Services, enrolled farmers get a weather forecast for seven days and crop advisory in Bangla. We have also launched a toll-free number where farmers can call for any agriculture-related queries. We are trying to cover new areas and new cash crops. For that, we have partnered with distinguished stakeholders such as Info Corp, Syngenta, CARE Bangladesh; there are many more on the pipeline to broaden our service spectrum. If we get adequate support from the government, we can achieve highest coverage of weather index- based insurance products. We are also working on Flood Index Based Crop Insurance in the northern part of Bangladesh and in the haor region with the support of Ministry of Finance, IDRA & SBC. Future technology driven products such as satellite products, germination coverage, bundle with service providers etc. need to be introduced. We should also cover natural disasters such as hailstorm and flash flood. However, as Bangladesh has different weather calamities and parameters like temperature, humidity, sunshine hour, only satellite data will not work. We need to track different types of weather parameters to successfully implement agri insurance across the country.   Muhymin Chowdhury, Deputy Challenge Fund Manager, BFP-B\n We wanted to test whether there is a need for weather index-based insurance. After doing the end-line assessment, we saw that there is a strong need for such a product, and it should be replicated in the market. We have also discovered how insurance companies can partner with field-level players such as farmers' hub and agro-input retailers. Another key finding is that farmers are keen to pay for insurance if the product can address their pain points. When we piloted this project most of the heavy-lifting was done by Green Delta as there is a lack of an appropriate ecosystem to support agricultural insurance market. Due to the absence of structured crop data, Green Delta had to develop crop data through engaging farmers and the Ministry of Agriculture. Green Delta had to undertake a lot of awareness activities to promote the benefits of having weather index-based insurance. There is a willingness to deliver the value, but this willingness is restrained by the high-capital expenditure and operational cost of launching these products. One of the major cost components of launching weather index-based insurance is weather data (37 percent of the total cost of launching a product). Bangladesh Meteorological Department's infrastructure is not available across the country which limits the ability to get government-supplied data. Hence there is an increasing reliance on international weather service providers which is pushing up the cost and limiting the value of the insurance product. There is a misunderstanding about the market potential. The agricultural insurance market is twice the market size of e-commerce. If you look at the total portfolio of non-life insurance companies in Bangladesh, the agri-insurance market would be comparable to the entire sector. There is huge potential of this agri-insurance sector, and the benefit can only be achieved if we can ensure strong coordination between the insurance industry and other relevant stakeholders. There is also an absence of competition and cooperation within the insurance sector.   Shubasish Barua, Head of Product Development & Executive Vice President, Green Delta Insurance Company Limited\n India has made it mandatory for all the insurance companies to do 7 percent business through crop insurance. It has proved to be successful in promoting agri-insurance and supporting farmers. Bangladesh can learn from the example. As per insurance Act 2010 the non-life insurance companies are not allowed to have any corporate agent agreement with any corporate agent. Now if any MNO is interested to provide crop insurance, and deduct the premium from usage, they won't be able to do it as they are not the  authorised premium collector/Agent. Same is applicable for MFIs as agent.  We need to reform the law so that non-life insurance companies can get the same opportunity as life insurance companies.  Moreover, if an insurance company wants to be a content provider to an MNO, they need to have TVAS (Telecom Value Added Service) license from BTRC. An insurance company is not allowed to obtain that license. In that case, they need a fourth party to work as a TVAS content provider which will increase the cost further. IDRA may support us in increasing the insurance awareness and reaching the mass  people with crop insurance by allowing an MoU agreement between NGO/ MFI/MNOs and insurance service providers   Dr. Shameem Hassan Bhuiyan, Consultant, World Bank\n If we can build a strong weather database and necessary infrastructure, we can lower the cost. We have already established 20 weather stations in Bangladesh. But that is not enough for collecting data on the whole country. A weather station can cover only a 20 km radius. If the private sector joins hands with us, we can build a strong weather database and necessary infrastructure for the whole country. The main component for weather index based insurance is real-time location-specific data, not forecast. As per World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommendations, one Automatic Weather Station (AWS) is required for covering a 10km radius for ensuring accurate and transparent weather data. Through AWS database, every farmer can see the current weather situation. One-stop service (OSS) is a new phenomenon. It has already been established in some sectors such as Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) and Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA). The industry-promoting agencies have all opened OSS to keep pace with the current demand for OSS. Though our insurance industry is an emerging sector, it still has a long way to go. Our insurance companies have less than one percent coverage while other countries have approximately five percent coverage. Therefore, attention is required to increase the coverage in our country. The government is very accommodating and keen for the insurance sector to grow.     Md. Arafat Hussain, Challenge Fund Manager, BFP-B\n In Africa there are some AWS solutions that costs less than USD 200. In these AWSs, four or five sensors are combined in a small device. We can easily adopt this solution in Bangladesh.       Ahmed Ali, Co-founder, MARS Limited\n We provide weather data for almost all areas of the country. Our forecast accuracy level is more than 93 percent. We work with tea estates, tobacco companies and farmer communities. We have bought two AWS (tile basis) from Canada, each of which cost TK 25,000. If we set it up in Khulna, we can monitor data from our office.             AKM Iftekhar Ahmad, Consultant, Green Delta Insurance Company Limited\n The success story of crop insurance in India is due to patronisation and cooperation of the government of India. Bangladesh's crop insurance also requires the support and patronisation of the government. All the loan giving agencies including microfinance in agri sector needs to be brought under insurance. This will generate higher premium and encourage farmers to join the insurance umbrella.           M. A. Karim, Deputy Manager, Sadharan Bima Corporation\n Sadharan Bima Corporation has tested crop insurance on potato and rice in three areas. It has been found scalable and viable. Also, in the SBC project, 20 AWS (Automatic Weather Station) has been installed in two districts. It is high time for Bangladesh to scale up crop insurance, and a common platform is required for weather data support.             Md. Moneruzzaman, Head of Pricing, Banglalink\n We can support any positive initiative through our distribution system. Currently, we are working with BRAC to distribute different products in deep rural areas.             Gokul Chand Das, Member, IDRA\n The Insurance Act states that it is not possible to do insurance business in Bangladesh without obtaining license from IDRA. Many countries have policies to cover the loan book of the borrower by non-life insurance companies. We simply need to collaborate with the banks. When banks roll out their credit, insurance companies can be there to provide insurance. There are some differences in the types of crop insurance services provided by the insurance providers in our country. For instance, the finance minister directed us to have crop insurance in the low-lying haor areas of Bangladesh. But, companies such as Green Delta Insurance Company and SBC Insurance don't have experience of working in these vulnerable areas which badly require crop insurance or catastrophe insurance. If we want to expand these types of insurance throughout the country, we need to create a win-win situation for both the insurance providers and customers.         Afsana Islam, Deputy Team Leader, Growth & Private Sector Development, DFID\n The importance of agriculture is critical for our economy. We must find ways to provide funding to our farmers. Bangladesh is committed to achieving the SDGs. In this context, one of our goals is to provide people with appropriate financial services. This doesn't involve providing these services solely through banks or MFIs. We need to ensure that they don't get adversely affected by losses arising from instances like natural calamities. Though insurance is an important product, its penetration is quite low in our country. So, the question is, how can we make the insurance market more attractive to the users? And how can we ensure that we provide such services to those who need it the most? The current market requires a one-stop shop(OSS) for demand-driven solutions. I think FID can take the central authority by being the regulator or reporting body of all the regulators; they can take the driving seat to provide solutions which will benefit everyone in the market.   Ajit Kumar Paul, Additional Secretary, FID, Ministry of Finance\n There is a committee known as the co-ordination committee chaired by the central bank governor. A meeting is held on a quarterly basis with Bangladesh Bank, other banks, insurance sector, micro-credit regulatory authorities, registrars of joint stock companies and some other coordinators and regulators. The issue of OSS can be raised in the forum. IDRA has been instructed to implement agriculture insurance in the haor areas. We need to focus on supporting people suffering in haor areas due to such natural disasters and the Government is taking various steps to help them. We are also holding talks with multiple insurance companies in this regard. The government has implemented the VAT law to accommodate people. I would request the organisations present here to make recommendations as to how we can be more accommodating and can resolve the VAT issues. All the concerns will be adjusted in the upcoming budget.  "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-08 00:00:00      \nDisasters are a threat to human rights In September 2019, a UN panel of scientists associated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a report on the future impact of climate change and rising temperatures. It signaled a red alert pertaining to devastating effects that would arise from ice melting in our seas and frozen regions.  The oceans have soaked up more than 90% of the extra heat generated by humans over the past decades.  This rising water level is now being driven principally by the melting of Greenland and Antarctica.  It has also been observed that glaciers are also melting at a fast pace in areas like the tropical Andes, Central Europe, and North Asia.  These regions will lose 80% of their ice by 2100 under the high carbon emissions scenario. The global average sea levels could increase by up to 1.1m by 2100. Coastal flooding will hit nearly 42 million people in Bangladesh by 2050.  Researchers have found that nearly 300 million people across the world will be vulnerable by 2050 to flooding made worse by climate change.  By 2050, low-lying areas in some South and Southeast Asian cities not far from the coast (without proper embankments) are likely to face inundation during high tide as part of the flood zone.  Bangladeshi climate experts have denoted that 100km away from the coastal zones, the districts of Pirojpur and Shariatpur might be badly affected as there are no embankments there. These debacles that are staring us in the face have raised several questions as to how the concerned countries are expected to respond to the evolving disastrous situation, and how basic human rights of the affected people need to be safeguarded while tackling and managing this growing emergency. This aspect is receiving attention because environmental sustainability and the promotion of human rights are closely intertwined and complementary objectives that are at the core of sustainable development. Efforts to promote environmental sustainability can only be effective if they occur in the context of conductive legal frameworks, and by the exercise of certain human rights, such as the rights to information, public participation in decision-making, and access to justice. It needs to be understood that the implementation of any agenda to tackle the impending climate change disaster will require relevant actors to adopt policies and mobilize resources to advance equitable, human-rights-based, and sustainable development.  Human rights mechanisms will have to address issues within the right to a healthy environment directly and also focus on the environmental dimensions of more established rights, through emerging rights, such as the right to water and development.  A number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) recognize the link between the environment and human health, and many MEAs also include provisions regarding civil liability and compensation for damage caused by environmental degradation. Human rights tribunals in the context of environmental law have also dealt with the protection of collective intellectual property rights, through principles of benefit sharing, ie in the context of genetic resources.  In addition, the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on certain groups could amount to a violation of rights to freedom from discrimination. This potential is referred primarily in the context of discrimination against indigenous peoples or racial minorities. There is also the question of environmental degradation playing a decisive role in many conflict situations. Such degradation can contribute to the outbreak of a conflict and result in the infringement of fundamental human rights, such as the right to life and health.  These infringements would include damages to the life and properties of victims of conflict, disruption of normal living conditions, and loss of access to basic services. Conflicts can also fuel environmental degradation by weakening governance structures, undermining positive environmental practices, and promoting uncontrolled systems of resource exploitation.  Thus it is crucial that conflict management is taken into account from the outset, along with humanitarian, economic, and social needs.  Neglect in the establishment of strong governance systems that factor in the environmental rule of law can consequently jeopardize the peace process and the well-being of the population and environment. Ensuring a human rights framework also denotes the importance of accountability mechanisms in the implementation of measures and policies in the area of climate change that requires access to administrative and judicial remedies. Such an approach can then serve to bring greater clarity about the underlying causes of positive or negative impacts of various economic measures related to environmental protection.  It will also allow for better choices among policies and projects. This can then improve outcomes by facilitating positive synergies, and generally improving the governance of natural resources.  It will also facilitate and increase the legitimacy of activities, programs, and policies by integrating social concerns with environmental goals and responsibilities of all actors.  This will ensure the accountability of governments, the private sector, and environmental or human rights organizations with regard to the impact of their activities on the environment.

Men, women and children belonging to the stateless and long-persecuted Muslim minority were among nearly 25,000 prisoners freed last week by a presidential pardon to mark the country's April New Year celebrations. A Navy vessel transported the group from Yangon to western Rakhine state, where most Rohingya live under tight movement restrictions and in conditions Amnesty International has condemned as \"apartheid.\" More than 600 disembarked near state capital Sittwe, while another 200 were taken further north to townships on the border with Bangladesh, state immigration department chief Soe Lwin told AFP. \"They will be quarantined,\" he added, without giving further details. Myanmar's biggest prisoner release in years came as coronavirus fears gripped the country, with calls for low-risk inmates to be released from what Human Rights Watch describes as Myanmar's \"horribly overcrowded and unsanitary\" jails. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that prison populations are particularly vulnerable to the spread of the disease. Myanmar has only 111 confirmed Covid-19 cases but experts fear the real number is many times higher because of the low numbers tested and the country's chronically underfunded healthcare system."

In the small village of Kartikpur in Bhedarganj upazila of Shariatpur, a dynasty of potters, namely Pals and Kumars, have sustained the rare pottery industry in spite of the onslaught of technological advancements. Although still producing earthen pots and utensils, lack of innovation and inability to use technology has held them back without ever reaching their full potential. A host of potters in Kartikpur, namely Samir Pal, Pradip Pal, Sandip Pal, Gobind Pal, Jawahar Lal Pal and Uttam Pal, have a few factories set up in the region, where they create at least 3,000 items, including utensils, collectibles, and household products. These items include terracotta shades, tiles, candle stands, flower vases, coin boxes, wall coverings, wall pots, visiting card boxes and scores of other such products. Hundreds of workers from the neighbouring villages of Rambhadrapur and Dingamanik are also recruited in the factories, breaking an age-old tradition of only Pal community members working in the craft. A wide range of NGOs and other development agencies, namely Aarong, Caritas, Heed Bangladesh, Usha Handicrafts and more, usually purchase products from Kartikpur's potters, which are sold across the country, as well as internationally in countries spanning Europe, North America, the Middle East, and neighbouring countries like India. Every factory etches their logo on their products for authenticity. Work reportedly goes on throughout the year, with products ranging between 1.5 inches to 6 feet, costing anywhere between Tk5,000-30,000. Potters said they usually begin the process by gathering alluvial soil and mixing it with water. The clay mixture is then processed, using an imported filter from Germany, and kept on a special pan for 20 days. After 20 days, the excess water is drained and the clay formation that remains, known locally as mundu, is dried in the sun and mixed with very little water, forming the base for all their pottery items. They said that newly-formed pottery items and must be stored in closed rooms for 10-12 days before fire curing, after which they are colored as required and are then delivered to clients.  Previously, clients would market the products for the potters, but now they have taken over the marketing process themselves. Sandip Kumar Pal, a potter, said his family has been in the pottery business for generations. He was first inspired by an art faculty of then-Dhaka Art College in 1976 to showcase his products and to sell them in Dhaka and Chittagong. After gaining exposure, he was approached by several NGOs and other agencies, who signed contracts with him to market his products further and beyond Bangladesh. He also said the agencies are now showcasing his products in countries across the world, fetching foreign currency in the process. Uttam Kumar Pal, another potter, lamented that the production price of a night lamp is between Tk70-80, but sells for only Tk90-95. Even worse, when it is sent to Dhaka it sells for anywhere between Tk400-500. \"My factory also builds clay elephants 5-7ft long, which cost Tk15,000-20,000 to make,\" he added, \"but they sell in Dhaka for Tk30,000-40,000.\" Rangadip Pal lamented that at one point, he used to earn Tk60,000 a month from selling his pottery items, but now the scenario is not as rosy as before. He has gained a lot more in state honors and recognition than before, but his income has not been the same, as the revenue numbers are not good enough to replenish his working capital on a monthly basis. The potters sought government intervention for the sustainability of the industry. Enam Ahmed, deputy manager of the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) industry assistance centre in the district, acknowledged the contribution of these potters to the economy and culture. He added they will provide more technical support to the potters if they request their assistance, in terms of innovation, integrating technology into their trade, and financial support, if necessary."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-17 00:00:00      \nThe government has planned to construct a four-storey building on Bhashan Char for the UN and aid agency representatives to ensure effective monitoring of humanitarian activities for one lakh Rohingya refugees to be relocated to the island from Cox's Bazar.  It also planned to increase the height of the flood-protection embankment around Bhashan Char housing project from the present nine feet to 19 feet.  These are part of the 43 new infrastructure components meant to improve the facilities on Bhashan Char under a revised project which will be placed at the Executive Committee on National Economic Council meeting today.  The housing project on the 40 square km Bhashan Char, an island in Noakhali around 37 miles from the coast of the Bay of Bengal, was initiated by the Prime Minister's Office after vast tracts of forests and hills in Cox's Bazar were damaged due to some one million Rohingyas being housed there. Besides, there were also risks of landslides in Cox's Bazar.   By October this year, the Bangladesh Navy, which is implementing the project, completed the construction of 120 cluster villages on the island. Disaster management ministry officials said the concrete houses built were constructed four feet above the ground. The entire housing site is protected by a flood embankment.   There are also 120 cyclone shelters, which will also be used as schools, medical centres and community centres. Disaster management ministry officials said there are large swathes of land that could be used for livestock farming and fisheries on Bhashan Char.  There will also be education facilities in Bhashan Char as well, along with eight speedboats which will be used for transit, government sources said.   The refugees now live in crowded camps in Cox's Bazar. The government considers Bhashan Char cluster village a safer and better place for them.  The UN and other rights bodies, however, have been critical of the relocation plan of the Rohingyas to Bhashan Char, saying the island was isolated and flood-prone. They also asked to establish a regular ship service between Bhashan Char and the mainland.  Against this backdrop, the UN had proposed a visit to Bhashan Char by a technical mission on November 17 and 19. It, however, was postponed as Bangladesh asked for the terms of reference for the visit. Until now, the visit has not taken place, but its reason could not be known.  Meanwhile, the planning ministry proposed a revision to the project, increasing the budget to Tk 3,095 crore from Tk 2,312 crore. It has also proposed extending the project until November 2021. Shah Kamal, senior secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, said the government planned to build a residential building and other facilities so that the UN and other aid agencies involved in the humanitarian assistance could stay there and operate their activities.    The government also wants to take all measures to ensure protection of all those involved in the humanitarian works and the Rohingyas who are to be relocated, he told The Daily Star on Sunday.  Officials said increasing the height of the embankment around the cluster villages was a new component of the project. Aid agencies had feared tidal surges and cyclones could make the housing project vulnerable.   Disaster management officials said the government wanted to ensure full protection and amenities for all in Bhashan Char.    Other new components in the project include construction of a jetty, helipads, two hospitals, four community clinics, a water discharge system, internal roads, shore protection work, land development, solar panels and an electric sub-station.  \"Once the displaced Myanmar residents are repatriated, the landless people of Bangladesh will be rehabilitated there. It will contribute to their socio-economic development,\" said a planning ministry brief. "

      "text": "Key Sections of the Paris Communique by the Group of Seven\n1989-07-17T05:00:00.000Z\nFollowing are key sections of the communique issued today by the Group of Seven major industrialized democracies:\n1. We, the heads of state or government of seven major industrial nations and the president of the Commission of the European Communities, have met in Paris for the 15th annual Economic Summit. The Summit of the Arch initiates a new round of summits to succeed those begun at Rambouillet in 1975 and at Versailles in 1982. The round beginning in 1982 has seen one of the longest periods of sustained growth since the Second World War. These summits have permitted effective consultations, offered the opportunity to launch initiatives and to strengthen international cooperation.\n2. This year's world economic situation presents three main challenges:\n* The choice and the implementation of measures needed to maintain balanced and sustained growth, counter inflation, create jobs and promote social justice. These measures should also facilitate the adjustment of external imbalances, promote international trade and investment, and improve the economic situation of developing countries.\n* The development and the further integration of developing countries into the world economy. Whilst there has been substantial progress in many developing countries, particularly those implementing sound economic policies, the debt burden and the persistence of poverty, often made worse by natural disasters affecting hundreds of millions of people, are problems of deep concern which we must continue to face in a spirit of solidarity.\n* The urgent need to safeguard the environment for future generations. Scientific studies have revealed the existence of serious threats to our environment such as the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer, excessive emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which could lead to future climate changes. Protecting the environment calls for a determined and concerted international response and for the early adoption, worldwide, of policies based on sustainable development. International Economic Situation\n3. Growth has been sustained by focusing policies on improving the efficiency and flexibility of our economies and by strengthening our cooperative efforts and the coordination process. In the medium term, the current buoyant investment seen during this period should pave the way for an increased supply of goods and services and help reduce the dangers of inflation. The outlook is not, however, without risks.\n4. Until now, the threat of inflation in many countries has been contained, thanks to the concerted efforts of governments and monetary authorities. But continued vigilance is required and inflation, where it has increased, will continue to receive a firm policy response. . . .\n5. While some progress has been made in reducing external imbalances, the momentum of adjustment has recently weakened markedly; there needs to be further progress in adjusting external imbalances through cooperation.\n6. In countries with fiscal and current-account deficits, including the United States of America, Canada and Italy, further reductions in budget deficits are needed. Action will be taken to bring them down. This may help reduce the savings-investment gap and external imbalances, contribute to countering inflation and encourage greater exchange rate stability in a context of decreasing interest rates.\n7. Countries with external surpluses, including Japan and Germany, should continue to pursue appropriate macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that will encourage non-inflationary growth of domestic demand and facilitate external adjustment.\n8. All our countries share the responsibility for the sound development of the world economy. Over the medium term, deficit countries have to play a key role in global adjustment through their external adjustment and increased exports; surplus countries have to contribute to sustaining global expansion through policies providing favorable conditions for growth of domestic demand and imports.\n9. The emergence of the newly industrializing economies and the initiation of a dialogue with them are welcome. We call on those with substantial surpluses to contribute to the adjustment of external imbalances and the open trade and payments system. To that end, they should permit exchange rates to reflect their competitive position, implement GATT commitments and reduce trade barriers. International Monetary Developments and Coordination\n10. Under the Plaza and Louvre agreements, our countries agreed to pursue, in a mutually reinforcing way, policies of surveillance and coordination aimed at improving their economic fundamentals and at fostering stability of exchange rates consistent with those economic fundamentals.\nThere has been progress in the multilateral surveillance and coordination of economic policies with a view to ensuring internal consistency of domestic policies and their international compatibility. . . .\n11. The coordination process has made a positive contribution to world economic development and it has also contributed greatly to improving the functioning of the International Monetary System. There has also been continued cooperation in exchange markets.\nIt is important to continue and, where appropriate, to develop this cooperative and flexible approach to improve the functioning and the stability of the International Monetary System in a manner consistent with economic fundamentals. . . .\n12. We welcome the decision to complete the work on the ninth review of the International Monetary Fund quotas with a view to a decision on this matter before the end of the years.\n13. Within the European Community, the European Monetary System has contributed to a significant degree of economic policy convergence and monetary stability. Improving Economic Efficiency\n14. We will continue to promote measures in order to remove inefficiencies in our economies. . . . Tax reforms, modernization of financial markets, strengthening of competition policies and reducing rigidities in all sectors including energy, industry and agriculture are necessary. So are the improvement of education and vocational training, transportation and distribution systems and further policies aimed at giving more flexibility and mobility to the labor market and reducing unemployment.\nWithin the European Community, the steady progress toward completion by the end of 1992 of the program contained in the Single Act has already given a strong momentum to economic efficiency.\n15. The decline of saving in some of our countries in this decade is a cause of concern. This lower level of saving can contribute to high real interest rates and therefore hamper growth. Inadequate saving and large fiscal deficits are associated with large external deficits. We recommend . . . policies to encourage saving and remove hinderances. . . .\n16. Financial activities are being increasingly carried out with new techniques on a worldwide basis. As regards insider trading, which could hamper the credibility of financial markets, regulations vary greatly among our countries. These regulations have been recently, or are in the process of being strengthened. International cooperation should be pursued and enhanced. Trade Issues\n17. World trade developed rapidly last year. Yet protectionism remains a real threat. We strongly reaffirm our determination to fight it in all its forms.\nWe agree to make effective use of the improved GATT dispute settlement mechanism and to make progress in negotiations for further improvements. We will avoid any discriminatory or autonomous actions, which undermined the principles of the GATT. . . .\nWe also are pledged to oppose the tendency toward unilateralism, bilateralism, sectoralism and managed trade which threatens to undermine the multilateral system and Uruguay Round negotiations.\n18. The successful negotiation of the Trade Negotiations Committee of the Uruguay Round in Geneva last April, thereby completing the midterm review, is a very important achievement. It gives a clear framework for future work in all sectors including the pursuit of agricultural reform in the short term as well as in the long term. . . .\nWe express our full commitment to making further substantive progress in the Uruguay Round in order to complete it by the end of 1990.\n19. We note with satisfaction the entry into force of the Free Trade Agreement betwen Canada and the United States, as well as more recent initiatives to intensify the close economic relations between the European Community and E.F.T.A. countries. . . .\n20. It is the firm intention of the European Community that the trade aspects of the single market program should also be trade-creating and complementary to the multilateral liberalization process. 21. We note with satisfaction the progress that has been made in strengthening the multilateral disciplines on trade and aid distorting export credit subsidies. This effort must be pursued actively and completed in the competent bodies of the O.E.C.D. . . . at the earliest possible date. General Problems Of Development\n22. Development is a shared global challenge. We shall help developing countries by opening the world trading system and by supporting their structural adjustment. We shall encourage too, economic diversification in commodity-dependent countries and the creation of a favorable environment for transfers of technology and capital flows.\nWe underline the continuing importance of official development assistance and welcome the increased efforts of summit participants in this respect. . . .\n23. We urge developing countries to implement sound economic policies. A vital factor will be the adoption of financial and fiscal policies which attract inward investment and encourage growth and the return of flight capital.\n24. We note with satisfaction that there has been substantial progress in the multilateral aid initiative for the Philippines that was given special attention in the Toronto economic declaration. 25. Faced with the worrying economic situation of Yugoslavia, we encourage its Government to implement a strong economic reforms program that can command bilateral and multilateral support. The Situation In the Poorest Countries\n26. The enhancement of the International Monetary Fund Structural Adjustment Facility, the World Bank special program of assistance for the poorest and most indebted countries and the fifth replenishment of the African Development Fund are all important measures. . . . We stress the importance attached to a substantial replenishment of Intenational Development Association resources.\n27. As we urged last year in Toronto, the Paris Club reached a consensus in September 1988 on the conditions of implementation of significant reduction of debt-service payments for the poorest countries. Thirteen countries have already benefited by this decision.\n28. We welcome the increasing grant element in the development assistance as well as the steps taken to convert loans into grants and we urge further steps. . . . Flexibility in development aid as much as in debt rescheduling is required. 29. We attach great importance to the efficient and successful preparation of the next general conference of the United Nations on the least developed countries, which will take place in Paris in 1990. Strengthened Debt Strategy for the Heavily Indebted Countries\n30. Our approach to the debt problems has produced signficant results, but serious challenges remain: In many countries the ratio of debt service to exports remains high, financing for growth promoting investment is scarce, and capital flight is a key problem. An improvement in the investment climate must be a critical part of efforts to achieve a sustainable level of growth without excessive levels of debt. These improvements . . . depend above all on sustained and effective adjustment policies in the debtor countries.\n31. To address these challenges, we are strongly committed to the strengthened debt strategy. This will rely, on a case-by-case basis, on the following actions:\n* Borrowing countries should implement, with the assistance of the Fund and the Bank, sound economic policies, particularly designed to mobilize savings, stimulate investment and reverse capital flight;\n* Banks should increasingly focus on voluntary, market-based debt and debt-service reduction operations, as a complement to new lending;\n* The International Monetary Fund and World Bank will support significant debt reduction by setting aside a portion of policy-based loans;\n* Limited interest support will be provided, through additional financing by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, for transactions involving significant debt and debt service reduction. For that purpose the use of escrow accounts is agreed;\n* Continued Paris Club rescheduling and flexibility of export-credit agencies;\n* Strengthening of the international financial institutions capability for supporting medium-term macroeconomic and structural adjustment programs and for compensating the negative effects of export shortfalls and external shocks.\n32. In the framework of this strategy:\n* We welcome the recent decisions taken by the two institutions to encourage debt and debt service reduction which provide adequate resources for these purposes;\n* We urge debtor countries to move ahead promptly to develop strong economic reform programs that may lead to debt and debt service reductions in accordance with the guidelines defined by the two Bretton Woods institutions;\n* We urge banks to take realistic and constructive approaches in their negotiations with the debtor countries and to move promptly to conclude agreements on financial packages including debt reduction, debt service reduction and new money. We stress that official creditors should not substitute for private lenders. . . . Environment\n33. There is growing awareness throughout the world of the necessity to preserve better the global ecological balance. This includes serious threats to the atmosphere, which could lead to future climate changes. We note with great concern the growing pollution of air, lakes, rivers, oceans and seas; acid rain; dangerous substances; and the rapid desertification and deforestation. . . .\nDecisive action is urgently needed to understand and protect the Earth's ecological balance. We will work together to achieve the common goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environment in order to meet shared economic and social objectives. . . .\n34. We urge all countries to give further impetus to scientific research on environmental issues, to develop necessary technologies and to make clear evaluations of the economic costs and benefits . . .\nIn this connection, we ask all countries to combine their efforts in order to improve observation and monitoring on a global scale.\n35. We believe that international cooperation also needs to be enhanced in the field of technology and technology transfer in order to reduce pollution. . . .\n36. We believe that industry has a crucial role in preventing pollution at source, in waste minimization, in energy conservation, and in the design and marketing of cost-effective clean technologies. The agricultural sector must also contribute to tackling problems such as water pollution, soil erosion and desertification.\n37. Environmental protection is integral to issues such as trade, development, energy, transport, agriculture and economic planning. Therefore, environmental considerations must be taken into account into economic decision-making. . . .\nIn order to achieve sustainable development, we shall ensure the compatibility of economic growth and development with the protection of the environment. Environmental protection and related investment should contribute to economic growth. . . .\nClear assessments of the costs, benefits and resource implications of environmental protection should help Governments take the necessary decisions on the mix of price signals (e.g. taxes or expenditures) and regulatory actions, reflecting where possible the full value of natural resources.\nWe encourage the World Bank and regional development banks to integrate environmental considerations into their activities. . . .\n38. To help developing countries deal with past damage and to encourage them to take environmentally desirable action, economic incentives may include the use of aid mechanisms and specific transfer of technology. . . .\nWe also emphasize the necessity to take into account the interests and needs of developing countries in sustaining the growth of their economies and the financial and technological requirements to meet environmental challenges.\n39. The depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is alarming and calls for prompt action.\nWe welcome the Helsinki conclusions related, among other issues, to the complete abandonment of the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons covered by the Montreal protocol as soon as possible and not later than the end of the century. . . . We shall promote the development and use of suitable substitute substances and technologies. . . .\n40. We strongly advocate common efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which threaten to induce climate change, endangering the environment and the economy. . . .\n41. We agree that increasing energy efficiency could make a substantial contribution to these goals. We urge international organizations concerned to encourage measures, including economic measures, to improve energy conservation and, more broadly, efficiency in the use of energy. . . .\nWe are committed to maintaining the highest safety standards for nuclear power plants and to strengthening international cooperation in safe operation of power plants and waste management, and we recognize that nuclear power also plays an important role in limiting output of greenhouse gases.\n42. Deforestation also damages the atmosphere and must be reversed. We call for the adoption of sustainable forest management practices, with a view to preserving the scale of world forests. . . .\n43. Preserving the tropical forests is an urgent need for the world as a whole. While recognizing the sovereign rights of developing countries to make use of their natural resources, we encourage, through a sustainable use of tropical forests, the protection of all the species therein and the traditional rights to land and other resources of local communities. We welcome the German initiative in this field as a basis for progress.\nTo this end, we give strong support to rapid implementation of the Tropical Forest Action Plan which was adopted in 1986 in the framework of the Food and Agricultural Organization. . . .\n45. The increasing complexity of the issues related to the protection of the atmosphere calls for innovative solutions. New instruments may be contemplated. We believe that the conclusion of a framework or umbrella convention on climate change to set out general principles or guidelines is urgently required. . . .\nWe welcome the work under way by the United Nations Environment Program, in cooperation with the World Meteorological Organization, drawing on the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the results of other international meetings. . . .\n46. We condemn indiscriminate use of oceans as dumping grounds for polluting waste. . . .\n47. We are committed to insuring full implementation of existing rules for the environment. In this respect, we note with interest the initiative of the Italian Government to host in 1990 a forum on international law for the environment. . . .\n48. We advocate that existing environment institutions be strengthened within the United Nations system. In particular, the United Nations Environment Program urgently requires strengthening and increased financial support. . . .\n50. It is a matter of international concern that Bangladesh, one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world, is periodically devastated by catastrophic floods.\nWe stress the urgent need for effective, coordinated action by the international community, in support of the government of Bangladesh, in order to find solutions to this major problem which are technically, financially, economically and environmentally sound. In that spirit, and taking account of help already given, we take note of the different studies concerning flood alleviation, initiated by France, Japan, the U.S. and the United Nations Development Program, which have been reviewed by experts from all our countries. We welcome the World Bank's agreement, following those studies, to coordinate the efforts of the international community so that a sound basis for achieving a real improvement in alleviating the effects of flood can be established. . . .\n51. We give political support to projects such as the joint project to set up an observatory of the Saharan areas, which answers the need to monitor the development of that rapidly deteriorating, fragile, arid region. Drug Issues\n52. The drug problem has reached devastating proportions. We stress the urgent need for decisive action, both on a national and international basis. We urge all countries, especially those where drug production, trading and consumption are large, to join our efforts to counter drug production, to reduce demand, and to carry forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and the laundering of its proceeds.\n53. Accordingly, we resolve to take the following measures within relevant fora:\n* Give greater emphasis on bilateral and United Nations programs for the conversion of illicit cultivation in the producer countries. The United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC), and other United Nations and multilateral organizations should be supported, strengthened and made more effective. These efforts could include particular support for the implementation of effective programs to stop drug cultivation and trading as well as developmental and technical assistance.\n* Support the efforts of producing countries who ask for assistance to counter illegal production or trafficking.\n* Strengthen the role of the United Nations through an increase in its resources and through reinforced effectiveness of its operation.\n* Intensify the exchange of information on the prevention of addiction, and rehabilitation of drug addicts.\n* Support the international conference planned for l990 on cocaine and drug demand reduction.\n* Strengthen the efficiency of the cooperative and mutual assistance on these issues, the first steps being a prompt adhesion to, ratification and implementation of the Vienna Convention on illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.\n* Conclude further bilateral or multilateral agreements and support initiatives and cooperation, where appropriate, which include measures to facilitate the identification, tracing, freezing, seizure and forfeiture of drug crime proceeds.\n* Convene a financial action task force from summit participants and other countries interested in these problems. Its mandate is to assess the results of cooperation already undertaken in order to prevent the utilization of the banking system and financial institutions for the purpose of money laundering, and to consider additional preventive efforts in this field. The first meeting will be called by France and its report will be completed by April 1990. International Cooperation Against AIDS\n54. We take note of the creation of an International Ethics Committee on AIDS which met in Paris in May 1989, as decided at the Summit of Venice (June 1987). It assembled the summit participants and the other members of the European Community, together with the World Health Organization.\n55. We take note of the representations that we received from various heads of state or government and organizations and we will study them with interest. Next Economic Summit\n56. We have accepted the invitation of the president of the United States to meet next year in the United States of America."

He said this after meeting with top officials of the division, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), and the transport owners' association's leaders on ensuring a safe, comfortable, and hassle-free journey for homebound people, on Thursday. However, vehicles carrying daily essentials and medicines will not fall under the purview of the instructions, he added.  The secretary said the condition of the roads is better than in previous years, and the authorities concerned will take immediate steps to resolve any issues that might arise.  \"The public will not suffer on the roads [during the Eid holidays], this year,\" Nazrul said.  Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC), and the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges, will operate control rooms that will work round-the-clock with the BRTA to ease the movement of the holidaymakers.  BTRC will also operate a special bus service. Mobile courts will remain active at all times, and will conduct drives to check on ticket prices and unfit vehicles.  Public transport owners have also been asked to remain alert, Nazrul said. Law enforcement will ensure that no makeshift markets are set up on highways, and no buses are parked arbitrarily. The government has asked garment factory owners to provide Eid workers their holidays in phases, to avoid an extra rush prior to Eid day, the secretary added."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-02 00:00:00      \nAs part of a class assignment last semester a group of architecture students asked me a question: what makes a city inspiring? This set me thinking. It could very well be a policy question, particularly for countries that are undergoing accelerated urbanisation and envisioning the next phase of their social, political, and national evolution. As experts demonstrate, cities have become not only the drivers of economy but also sites of national soul-searching. I answered the students this way: a city is most inspiring when it is fair to all its inhabitants. A city is fair when it creates a culture of social justice across all its domains. A city ensures social justice when it offers equal opportunities to all its people. But fairness, social justice, and equal opportunity are abstract ideas. How does one institute them in the physical conditions of the city? Is it possible to transform the abstract idea of social justice into something that we can visualise, feel, and experience in the spaces of the city? As I pondered these questions, I recalled what the American poet and civil rights activist Maya Angelou once said: \"I always knew from that moment, from the time I found myself at home in that little segregated library in the South, all the way up until I walked up the steps of the New York City library, I always felt, in any town, if I can get to a library, I'll be OK. It really helped me as a child, and that never left me.\" A public library in the city--accessible to all, irrespective of their economic and social backgrounds--could be one of the most poignant symbols of a city that values social justice for all. Maya Angelou's racial discrimination in a segregated library in the American South could be mitigated by the robust publicness of the New York City library, where she didn't have to face the inhumanity of racism. She could walk up the steps of this library and feel that she could enter it without having to pass any discriminatory barriers. Angelou provided a most incisive physical portrayal of social justice in an urban condition with this simplest statement: \"... in any town, if I can get to a library, I'll be OK.\" The feeling that you can access any opportunity and facility in the city without any social and economic hurdle is a monumentally empowering condition. When that feeling is pervasive among the city's people of all ages, economic and social classes, gender, ethnicities, and physical abilities, a city is fair and practices social justice as its moral foundation. As the year ends, I have been thinking about the \"fairness\" measure of cities in Bangladesh. As I go around in Dhaka I keep wondering, is this city fair to all its people? Is this city guided by a basic philosophy of social justice? Again, fairness and social justice are abstract notions, and often ignored quietly and cleverly as left-leaning obstacles to a neoliberal worldview, typically rigged to favour the privileged and the powerful. But we need to decide how we develop our cities and what kind of humanity we institute in them. This is important for two main reasons. First, the middle-income status that we seek will be meaningful and sustainable only when that status is fair and achieved not at the expense of a vast majority of people. Second, around the world today, city administrators tasked with creating liveable cities are increasingly concerned with how to embody fairness in the city's planning. Liveability is not guaranteed by Smart City and its techno-glitz and seamless mobility. A Smart City could be liveable, provided it is fair to all its people, not just to its power-wielding CEOs and corporate executives. So, I ask: How do we qualitatively measure something as abstract as fairness in the city's infrastructure, roads, footpaths, buildings, water sources, public transportation, green spaces, shops, and public places? Let me offer an example before I address my key contention today. Consider public transportation from a fairness or social justice angle. Are we offering safe and gender-friendly mobility options for women in the public domain? If not, we are perpetuating patriarchy by means of public transportation, complicit in the creation of a biased social system that is inherently unfair. For me the most glaring case of unfairness in the city resides in the way we define, confine, and manage poverty in our cities. It is unhelpful that in Bangladesh urban poverty is still largely understood through the lens of slum studies. To frame urban poverty in terms of the inadequacy of urban amenities (such as toilets and piped water supplies) in slums alone is to ignore a deeper social question: What is society's attitude towards the \"poor\"? It is important to revisit this age-old question to disrupt the cycle of urban poverty in a sustainable way. Urban economists, social analysts, urban planners, and others produce a vast body of data on poverty in cities. But the big data can also overwhelm our compassion, our humane instincts. Any empirical study of the poor must be coupled with a fundamental ethical position that the poor is not the Other. The poor shouldn't be abstracted as a social category--a binary opposite of the bourgeois self--to be quarantined for research and experimentation. While empirical research is essential, without human compassion it bureaucratises the concept of poverty and dehumanises the poor. It is not that empirical knowledge of the poor is unnecessary. But without compassion as public policy, big data keeps on calcifying the poor as a category, one that is isolated from any decision-making power structures. Without any real agency, this category is on perpetual life support. In his work on gender justice, Amartya Sen argued that real societal progress is made when women's empowerment takes a strong hold on the public's ethical imagination. A similar argument could be made in the case of poverty studies. An ethically based view of the poor as fellow citizens, rather than as an objectified research category, is urgently needed for any sustained alleviation of poverty. It is time policymakers, municipal administrators, and urban planners rethought urban poverty as a problem of social justice, not just as a problem of economic development. The issue of urban poverty should be examined with a bit of moral quandary and introspection into how the class-conscious bourgeoisie defines itself as the opposite of the poor. This very definition constitutes the central problem of urban poverty. The poor must be seen with a human face, not as an abstraction. The problem is that the poor's social invisibility is very much embedded in how we define poverty as an unrelatable experience of the Other. And, big data tends to preserve the invisibility of the poor. Lest we forget, the idea of poverty has not been static in history. Both the idea and strategies for its relief have changed since the Industrial Revolution and industrial cities grew manifold in the modern era. Consider London, for instance. In the wake of the city's intense urbanisation in the 19th century, a highly divisive political and philosophical debate raged about reforming laws related to poor people. At the centre of this vexing debate was this question: would top-down \"help\" (from the state and wealthy private citizens) diminish the poor's ability to take personal responsibility? So intense a philosophical discussion was it that even Tocqueville and Hegel followed the English turmoil with much fascination. The dichotomy of state- and donor-driven top-down strategies of poverty alleviation and empathetic, bottom-up, and activist NGO efforts in capacity building among the poor continues to animate the urban poverty debate. In designing cities in our country, urban planners can begin by acknowledging that urban poverty is, first and foremost, a crisis of social justice. City professionals must debunk the urban mythology that the poor is a closed social group in need of an improved ghetto. It is important not to forget that the poor are typically stuck in spatial traps, often legitimised through official planning processes. These spatial traps are slums, unsanitary industrial zones, flood-prone river banks, and footpaths. By keeping the poor confined to the urban fringe and hazardous areas, cities often deny them social justice and access to networks of economic mobility. By ghettoising the poor in undesirable, environmentally precarious areas, both cities and capitalistic systems seek to fortify a false sense of social hygiene. To mitigate this problem, urban planners need to see the disenfranchised classes not as the poor but as fellow \"social citizens,\" who deserve, like anybody else, equitable access to healthcare, housing, education, and economic opportunities. But, at the same time, social citizenship comes with responsibility. All people of the city must accept the basic idea of the greater good--Greeks called it eunomia or good order--for the city to function as a fair place. An inclusive and liveable city treats all its citizens with fairness and humanity.

      "text": "INDIA'S AID TO TAMILS IS 'AGGRESSION' TO SRI LANKA\n1987-06-07T05:00:00.000Z\nIT was portrayed by India as a mission of mercy and by Sri Lanka as ''naked act of aggression.'' But diplomats and other experts said the air drop of aid to the ethnic Tamil minority in northern Sri Lanka last week mainly underscored India's growing aspirations to regional power status. The air drop was made after Sri Lankan naval vessels turned back a flotilla of fishing boats carrying the aid. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's unexpected decision to dispatch 25 tons of food and medicine, most of it to territory held by Tamil guerrillas battling for an independent nation in Sri Lanka, abruptly transformed perceptions and politics in South Asia.\nIndia's attitude toward the small island country off its southern coast derives from both geopolitics and myth. In India's ancient epic, the Ramayana, the Hindu god Rama slays the demon king of Sri Lanka who had kidnapped his wife. Some Indians drew metaphorical comparisons to Mr. Gandhi. They saw him as the hero trying to recapture the lost love of the public by battling the demon of his own perceived weakness in the face of domestic scandals and disarray in his Congress Party.\nThe strained relationship with Sri Lanka also grows from India's aspirations to nationhood, reviving a once-glorious 5,000-year-old civilization. India remains strangled by poverty and overpopulation, but its young leaders believe economic growth and science and technology will make it a global power.\nIndians fear that they may not have a unified country after all, but only a disparate collection of warring ethnic, regional, linguistic and religious groups. Their greatest security threats are internal - Sikh separatists in the northern state of Punjab, the growing disaffection of Indian Moslems, the restiveness of southern ethnic groups, including Tamils. The Tamil insurgency against Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority poses another such test.\nThe ethnic and religious ties between India's 50 million Hindu Tamils and Sri Lanka's two million Tamils are a fact of life for any Indian leader. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi channeled aid to Tamil secessionists in Sri Lanka to placate secessionist Tamil sentiment in southern India. Her son, Rajiv Gandhi, shifted course in 1985, apparently recognizing that stoking a neighboring insurgency weakened India's case against Pakistan, which it accuses of doing the same with India's Sikhs and Moslems. Mr. Gandhi then sought to mediate, backing greater autonomy for Tamils in Sri Lanka. When the guerrillas balked, apparently feeling strong militarily, he angrily authorized the seizure of Tamil arms caches in India last year. Since then, however, the tide has shifted to favor the increasingly better-trained Sri Lanka Government forces. The rebels have been rolled back in the north and largely confined to the small Jaffna peninsula, vulnerable to blockade and encirclement. Exaggerated Reports\nThis year, it was President J. R. Jayewardene's turn to be intransigent as Sri Lankan emotions surged after Tamil-inspired bomb attacks on civilians. Ignoring Mr. Gandhi's appeal for restraint, Sri Lanka stepped up air strikes and naval shelling against the guerrillas, also inflicting extensive civilian damages. When Tamil spokesmen fed the Indian press exaggerated reports of thousands killed, Mr. Gandhi had little choice, diplomats said, but to stop Mr. Jayewardene.\nWhen the Sri Lankan leader blocked India's first attempt last week to send aid to the Tamils in a flotilla of fishing boats, the Indian leader's aides say, he felt his credibility was at stake with the Tamils, in particular, and Hindus in general. Sikh extremists have been attacking Hindus in Punjab, and Moslems clashed with Hindus last month in northern India. Suddenly Hindus were seen as threatened by Sikhs, Moslems and, in Sri Lanka, by Buddhists - who predominate in the Sinhalese majority.\nAn Indian official called the air drop ''a case of force majeure.'' ''In any such case,'' he said, ''one may not be able to defend it in terms of morality or international law. But here's a democratically elected political leader doing what he feels he must do. That is the real world, after all.'' Sri Lankan officials fear Mr. Gandhi may invade northern Sri Lanka to help establish a Tamil state, just as his mother invaded East Pakistan in 1971, helping to create the independent nation of Bangladesh.\nIn the short run, helping the Tamil guerrillas may help Mr. Gandhi win an election in the Hindu-dominated northern state of Haryana. The costs of such a move could be high, however. India accuses Pakistan of interfering with its neighbors and also indignantly contends that Washington is using Pakistan to channel covert assistance to the rebels battling the Soviet-backed regime in Afghanistan. But if India continues to put pressure on Sri Lanka, New Delhi's chances of having its complaints taken seriously may be expected to dwindle."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-18 00:00:00      \nA spat between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic escalated when United States President Donald Trump angered China by referring to the pathogen as the 'Chinese Virus' Coronavirus disease or Covid-19 is an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus. It is now an officially declared global pandemic. The number of coronavirus cases globally stood at 202,270 with 8,212 deaths, across 167 countries and territories at 5pm Wednesday, according to a tally compiled by Dhaka Tribune from official sources. A lot of explanations have been advanced regarding the source of the coronavirus. Understandably, public-health officials want to pin down the virus's source so that they can prevent new outbreaks.  A lot of conspiracy theories are also making the rounds. The question essentially boils down to one point: was Covid-19 developed in a laboratory, and is it being used as a biological weapon? A related question is whether the virus was made in the laboratory purposefully, or did the virus made in the laboratory accidentally escape the laboratory.  The lab-escape theory is so far the more widely accepted conspiracy theory.  Chinese authorities maintain that Covid-19 likely originated at a market in Wuhan where people were selling wild animals. But Iranian, Russian, and some Chinese media outlets claim that the emerging public health crisis comes from US biological weapons.  A spat between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic escalated when United States President Donald Trump angered China by referring to the pathogen as the \"Chinese Virus.\" The two countries have sparred over the origin of the virus for days, with a Chinese official promoting theories claiming it was brought to China by the US army and Washington officials using terms seen as stigmatizing a nation.  \"The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus,\" Trump tweeted on Monday night. Some skepticals including politicians in the US and China have both suggested that the Covid-19 may actually be a bioweapon that was manufactured in a lab.  The only difference between their conspiracy theories is who's being accused of doing the manufacturing. On the one corner are some people in the US who are hinting or in some cases openly claiming that China put together this virus.  Steve Mosher, a social scientist, wrote on February 22 an opinion piece for the New York Post entitled, \"Don't buy China's story: The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab.\"  In the piece, Mosher summarises why he believes Covid-19 may have been accidentally spread by China's National Biosafety Laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where researchers have studied bat coronaviruses.  Mosher says that the lab is less than 10 miles away from the seafood market where a clustre of Covid-19 cases was first discovered. Mosher believes that the said lab is located in the Institute of Virology in Wuhan, where the dangerous pathogens were purportedly kept and looked at as potential bioweapons.  There were reports that in the 2003 SARS outbreak, the SARS-CoV virus escaped from virology labs in China. He says Chinese virologist and bioweapons expert Major General Chen Wei's visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology with military scientists in January was an exercise in damage control. But not only in China, there are at least six same kind of facilities in the US in Georgia, Maryland, Texas and Montana.  According to the Federation of American Scientists website, seven others may be planned, under construction, or possibly finished in various cities such as Massachusetts, and Virginia. These labs also study and house a range of dangerous pathogens.  Not to be outdone, some in China have made similar suggestions, except that it's the US that built the virus and released it in China.  One of the most popular topics on the Chinese microblog Weibo was a one-minute clip of a US congressional hearing this week on how the country was dealing with the coronavirus. In the video posted by the People's Daily, Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is asked whether there may have been deaths attributed to influenza that could actually have been the result of Covid-19.  Redfield responds in the affirmative: \"Some cases have been actually diagnosed that way in the United States today.\" Redfield's answer was enough to add fuel to a conspiracy theory that has been gaining traction over the past two weeks in China - that the coronavirus did not originate in China but may have come from the US instead. \"The US has finally acknowledged that among those who had died of the influenza previously were cases of the coronavirus. The true source of the virus was the US!\" one commentator said.  \"The US owes the world, especially China, an apology,\" another said. \"American coronavirus,\" one wrote. The theory has gained traction over the past few weeks, after a respected epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, said in a passing remark at a press conference on February 27 that although the virus first appeared in China \"it may not have originated in China.\" Zhong later clarified his statement, saying that the first place where a disease is discovered does not \"equate to it being the source.\"  China's ambassador to South Africa said last week on Twitter that the virus was not necessarily \"made in China.\" So till now it looks like conspiracy theorists on both sides haven't really provided any compelling evidence that SARS-CoV2 was produced in a lab, whether in the US, in China, in Iran or in the other world."

Four villages of Pratapnagar and Shriula unions went underwater as the 120 ft BWDB embankment of Zone-2 suddenly collapsed, locals said. Many local residents have started volunteering to repair the embankment with whatever materials currently available. They fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands. On a field visit, thousands of villagers were seen to have volunteered to construct a temporary embankment while the district administration is said to have been busy controlling the coronavirus outbreak in the area. Moreover, the Kopotakkho River embankment collapsed earlier on April 8, flooding 1,000 bighas of farmlands and fish enclosures in three low-lying villages of the same area, waterlogging around 50 families in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishti Nandan villages under Pratapnagar union.  Locals say the 100-ft dam was already in a risky state, so it naturally could not sustain the strong pressure of tidal current and collapsed into the bottom of the Kopotakkho River. Contacted,  Pratapnagar Union Parishad Chairman Jakir Hossain held the water development board responsible in this regard, saying it was their negligence that led to the collapse of the embankment every year. \"Despite repeated complaints and appeals seeking sustainable protection of the embankment, the water development board failed to acknowledge the urgency of the issue.  \"Now, due to this recklessness, farmlands and fish enclosures on around 2,500 bigha of land have been flooded in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishtinandan villages. Moreover, almost 50 families have become waterlogged after two back-to-back incidents of flooding.\"  Md Arifuzzaman, of the local water development board, after visiting the site said he had arranged sandbags for the temporary emergency repair of the damaged embankment to minimize the extent of damage and protect the remaining lands.  \"The higher authorities will be notified promptly so that the necessary steps may be taken to permanently repair embankment.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-07 00:00:00      \nAt the end of April, at a joint conference that included Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers' Association (BELA), Bangladesh Institute of Planners (BIP), Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) and other groups came together to share the findings of a study spanning the last nine years on how there has been a systematic degradation of Dhaka's overall environment to benefit business. The study covers six areas including the Thana(s) Savar, Roopganj, Keraniganj, DAP (2010), the Gazipur part under DAP and the Dhaka metropolitan area. We learned that since 2010, the city has lost around 43,200 out of the total 187,958 acres of wetlands that Dhaka had. That means we have lost 22 percent of our wetlands over the span of nearly a decade. When we look at wetland, there are three types: flood flow zones, water retention areas and water bodies like rivers, canals, lakes and beels. In the DAP area alone, we are losing 2,500 acres of wetland every year. Breaking down the overall loss over the nine-year period, we find that 27 percent of 141,069 acres of free flow flood zones, around 34 percent of 10,419 acres of water retention areas and eight percent of 36,497 acres of other wetlands were grabbed or filled up. In the main city, we have areas like Basila, Bashundhara residential area, Beraid, Amin Bazar, and North Uttara that have been severely affected. The conversion of wetlands which should have been conserved has been done in the name of development and urbanisation, but the reality of course is that such massive violation of DAP has been made possible because of a lack of good governance and oversight. When we look at the fact that Dhaka has been a magnate for economic activity and that has been drawing people by the millions hailing from diverse backgrounds, it is easy to imagine why the realtors have cashed in on a building boom to support an expanding economy. As put by Professor Adil Mohammed Khan, General Secretary, BIP, \"conservation of water bodies like rivers and canals, wetland, retention areas and flood flow zones are all vital to making development and urbanisation sustainable maintaining an ecological balance.\" This is where policymakers got it wrong. By touting Dhaka as the premier investment hub without thinking about developing townships or smaller towns in the periphery of the capital city, we have been left with demand for housing that far outstrips the availability of land. The irresponsible planning and development of the city which simply ignored the DAP and where Rajuk has turned a blind eye to the all-out grabbing of water bodies was highlighted during a thought sharing episode back in 2017 between Rajuk and realtors where the latter basically told Rajuk that it is ludicrous for Rajuk to try and reclaim what has already been grabbed. They went on to state that Dhaka is actually better off without its wetlands because the only purpose water bodies serve is to increase the mosquito population. Experts contend that without these water bodies, the city faces many problems, one of which is water-logging. Back in April, 2018, the city had witnessed 55mm of rainfall in six hours which was enough to produce knee-deep water in major residential and commercial areas. Although city authorities had been working on a major overhaul of the drainage system, the fact of the matter is that today, the city is lacking in enough canals and lowland to let the water run out. But because we have been lacking in foresight, Dhaka's lowlands and canals are being filled up at an unprecedented rate and it simply cannot handle any heavy deluge. That explains why Dhaka has only two percent area dedicated to water retention against a requirement of 12 percent for a city of this size and when we factor in that nearly 90 percent of Dhaka is covered in concrete, the rainy season water has no way to drain out to water bodies and we end up with water-logging on city roads. Filling up wetlands in violation of DAP has been made possible because the custodians of the city turned a blind eye to the syndicate of businessmen backed up by political influence, working with corrupt officials over the years. The bad practices have now become institutional and with no accountability to speak of, laws are violated at will for profit is king and there is enough money to go around superseding the need for a balanced approach to city development.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-10 00:00:00      \nA city is not mere buildings, streets and spaces; it is a theatre of social actions. And it is in that theatre, according to the American urbanist Lewis Mumford, that \"man's more purposive activities...work out, through conflicting cooperative personalities, events, groups, into more significant culminations.\" I see the city as an existential theatre of our actions, practices, dreams and imaginations. Cities are millions of stories. A city is neither hell nor heaven; we make cities in the shadows of our selves. We are the city. In experiencing Dhaka as the toughest city in the world, the challenge is not one of solving its endless crises but in imagining and presenting the idea of how one should live in the theatre of the collective. The narrative of Dhaka as a city continues to be framed by technical or economic notions around urbanisation. Urbanisation is a poor term to embrace the fullness of a city. Talks of urbanisation distract the discourse of cities with number games, not taking into account that a city is shaped, bit by bit, not only by policies and ordinances, but imaginations and practices. Statistics do not show how a city can be designed and lived in its fullest human, social, aesthetical and ecological potential. Such a dynamic is best approached by the term \"urbanism.\" While the city is about material and spatial facts, urbanism, the French urban thinker Henri Lefebvre points out, is about social relations staged there. Our definition of the city has to be revised, and planners have to learn how to engage with the existential quotient of the city. As the most ancient human artifact, the city now reverberates with a greater poignancy as a human collective. In much of Asia, there has been a quantum leap in the urban domain. Ushered by economic and climate migration, and administrative impetus, more people now live in cities. China is literally building 20 cities every year, and India proposes spending USD 20 billion in seven years for its National Urban Renewal Mission. Despite the fact that contemporary cities are responsible, according to architectural critic Warnock-Smith, for \"history's greatest disparity between the wealthy and the poor,\" cities are the key catalyst for the future of the planet, its transformation, but most importantly, the destiny of subsequent generations. Cities can still be the most beautiful collective dream, as the urban wizard from Brazil, Jaime Lerner, claims. Rejecting the notion that the city is a problem, Lerner insists that cities instead are solutions to the human nature of living in a socialised manner. In transforming the Brazilian city Curitiba as its mayor, the architect Lerner proved that the city is not defined by smog, crisis and deluge, but as an exemplar of how we should live as a decent society in which the fruits of urbanism are available to all citizens. What about Dhaka then? Drawing people from different economic, ethnic, social and professional categories in one space, Dhaka first of all needs a civilised mode for addressing differences and diversities. Awash with many building enterprises in a booming economy, most buildings in Dhaka remain as enclaves unsure of how to form civic precincts or connect to the public fora. What should be celebrated are designs of spaces that engage the civic realm, from the larger and monumental scale to micro levels, and from the planned to the spontaneous. At the same time, Bangladesh's urban future cannot be all about Dhaka even if it hogs up all our investments and imaginations. To think beyond Dhaka, to engage the multitude of small towns--the mofussils--is now critical. Unmapped and untheorised, small towns are developing on a faulty premise: adopting a spurious Dhaka as a role model while abandoning their own stories. From the deluge of the late 1980s that drowned Dhaka to the unforgettable tragedy of the Rana Plaza factory, Dhaka can be easily written off as evidence of an apocalyptic city-site, a landscape of unruly industrial globalisation. Death in the Plaza was also a consequence of Dhaka's irresponsible planning, a result of an abysmal failure by city leaders to establish what should be built where and how. This is the dark side of urban development, when economic growth and consumer capitalism connive to drive human desires. Along the way to Gazipur in the north of the city, on the riverbanks towards Narayanganj, and on the road past Savar, concrete and steel rods replace the vernacular of bamboo and thatch. Multi-storied buildings--six- to ten-story high--hum with the music of a far-off Gap or Walmart. Freshly laid sand-beds on wetland announce the arrival of an upcoming housing society. The transformation of Dhaka and its regions, in the name of urbanisation, has been relentless and brutal. Nalas, dobas and pukurs--the lowlands--are filled to shore up tottering towers, without any basic recourse to safety and buildability, and petit goons with the blessings of bigger leaders become crorepatis, and enter the mystical chain of globalisation. By creating one landfill after another, emaciating rivers and canals, and decimating flood-plains and agriculture, Dhaka makes for a perfect candidate for an urbanisation without urbanism. An urbanism for Dhaka, I have argued, has to be conceptualised from the hydrological property of the delta, the foundational basis of our existence. Surrounded and infiltrated by a labyrinthine and delicate network of rivers and canals, tissues of wetlands and floodplains, and organic formations of mounds and settlements, Dhaka needs a new approach to city-thinking. Dhaka's primary urban challenge is one of imagination, of not being able to think of an appropriate form even when there are inspiring clues. Once Dhaka City hosted spacious green spaces, majestic trees, crisscrossing canals, civilised riverbanks, and boats in the heart of the city. Dhaka can actually be the garden city and a place by the water it always was. The idea of the city as a garden is not a fantasy but an urban ideology that combines civic wellbeing and environmental sustainability. The master architect Muzharul Islam imagined \"the whole country as a concentration of population in certain areas in a certain way, but even then within gardens.\" He perceived Dhaka not just having a collection of large gardens but the city itself as a garden. \"If you can do this [tall buildings] utilising the highlands of Dhaka city,\" he suggested, \"even now, you can place here a population three times its current number, and, at the same time, keep the lowlands as lowlands, keep the water bodies, and create gardens\" (1992). A big part of the challenge in re-imagining Dhaka lies in appreciating its landscape reality--the lowlands, the water bodies, in short, the powerful hydrology that surrounds and infiltrates it, and creates an \"ecology of the edge.\" The edge is made of a magnificent but precious terrain of land-water mass of wetlands, flood-plains, canals, and agricultural fields. The edge is where the dry meets the wet, the \"developed\" meets the \"primitive,\" and infrastructure meets the structure-less. This is also where the urbanite meets the farmer, the land-grabber discovers his opportunity, and the uprooted often makes her habitation. Site/s of the biggest battle in the city, the terrain of the edge, is determined by the presence and flux of water. It is a battle because it is in that terrain the instruments of landfill and embankments are in play. Most urban planners and policymakers focus on the core city. Even when they are dealing with the edge, they see it in the image of the core. Official planning is unable to conceptualise the special and unique condition of this edge. Without that realisation it is easy to participate in the destruction of the city's hydro-geographical landscape. An audacious vision for Dhaka has to begin from the edge so that the norm of planning, in which the core is privileged, is reversed. The edge conditions of Dhaka present the possibility of re-negotiating the social and economic--as well as conceptual--separation between the city and its conventional anti-thesis, whether the village or agricultural plains. The edge is where new forms of space organisation will have to be reorganised in response to a fluctuating landscape, along with devising newer types of economic, civic and social opportunities. In the meeting of an older form of the city with agricultural and hydrological landscape, a new conception of a city will have to be developed that integrates urbanism, agriculture, infrastructure and flooding. Only then will a water ethos circulate in the veins of a city's imagination. Kazi Khaleed Ashraf is an architect and directs the Bengal Institute for Architecture, Landscapes and Settlements."

That itinerary - scheduled to start next week, to coincide with the official American publication Feb. 22 - was largely completed before the book was banned in India last October.\nA Viking publicist suggested yesterday that in view of the recent violent protests, Mr. Rushdie might tape interviews to be broadcast.\nBoth Mr. Rushdie and Viking issued statements yesterday denying that the book was intended to defame or insult.\nIn a statement issued in Britain, Mr. Rushdie said: ''The novel is not an attack on Islam or any other religion, but an attempt to challenge preconceptions and to examine the conflict between the secular and religious views of the world. Ironically, it is precisely this conflict which has now engulfed the book.''\nHe added that many Muslim writers and readers had expressed support for the book and strong disapproval of the campaign against it.\nMr. Wylie said that two writers' groups, PEN and the Authors Guild, ''voiced their strong support for him.''\nAfter a meeting of Viking officials yesterday, the publisher released a statement deploring the violence and loss of life.\nThe book has now been banned in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and South Africa.\nNoting the Khomeini threat and the violent protests over the book in Pakistan and India, the statement said: ''Neither we nor the author of this novel published this book with intent to offend. We very much regret the distress the book has caused.'' The statement added that publication of the novel ''rests upon the principle of freedom of expression, which is one of the cornerstones of all democracy.''\nIn December, Viking employees were forced to vacate their building on West 23d Street twice because of bomb scares over the book, but things appeared calm yesterday. The company has hired plainclothes security officers since those incidents, and they are posted at the front and rear entrances to the building. The Viking offices are on the fifth floor.\nThere were no demonstrators near the Viking office, and there were only a few phone calls all day protesting Viking's publishing ''The Satanic Verses.'' Asked if there has been any activity, a plainclothes security guard in the reception room replied, ''Not too much; it's been too quiet,'' emphasizing the word ''too.''"

Who cares about the pain of those removed working under the soil in this city of always Spring? How many wails make this earth tremble?   Let me tell my tale, a tale of exiles from the land of flames- I am an exile lost in the hot womb of soil. Solitude holds me, makes my heart weep and drills a hole; every moment accumulates eternities.   Everyday, when dusk ceases, my existence is obscured in the darkness of the deep. I can hardly remember that I belong to this earth. Once had chores, had Springs, had a childhood on the wings of dreams, an urge to love and be loved by someone, a home of happiness, blessings from my mother.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-21 00:00:00      \nBoat making charge has doubled this year in the district, much to the worry of char people, especially fishermen and boatmen. Boat is very essential transport for them in the upcoming rainy season, but many of them cannot afford boats due to its high prices. Meanwhile, boat craftsmen are also not happy as they are not getting expected orders this year, said locals. It is charged Tk 1.20 lakh for making a 50-feet length boat, Tk 1 lakh for a 40-feet length boat and Tk 80,000 for a 30-feet length boat according to sizes but it was charged Tk 30,000 to Tk 70,000 last year and more less in 2017, said boat craftsmen and fishermen. Meher Ali, 48, of Teesta River Char Bairati in Kaliganj upazila, said around 30 to 40 char people jointly buy a big size boat for carrying people and goods during flood. Besides, a number of affluent men buy new boats during the time but they are showing less interest in this regard this time due to higher prices. So, old boats are now being repaired, said Meher.  Shafiqul Islam, project manager of a local NGO working for char people's livelihood, said there are 95 char areas in the Teesta and Dharla rivers. There are 42 ghats and two or four boats are anchored at each ghat. Around 5,000 fishermen are dependent on the rivers. Four to six fishermen use a big size boat for netting fish in the rivers, said Shafiqul, adding that there are two or three big boats for the villagers in each char area. Many char people have also middle size boat for personal uses. Craftsman Nazrul Islam, 44, of Teesta river Char Gaddimari in Hatibandha upazila, said the charge of boat making jumped as the price of wood shot up at a rapid speed this year. Another craftsman Abdus Samad, 55, of the area, said boat making order has fallen drastically this year. He got order for making three boats only this year while it was six last year and eight in 2017, Samad said, adding that they all 60 boat craftsmen in Teesta and Dharla char areas are facing same situation.

      "text": "In Bangladesh, Too Much Water and Not Enough\n1988-09-18T05:00:00.000Z\nWith two jerrycans in hand, Muklesha Khatun waited impatiently for about four hours for the water trucks to arrive, and finally took home her allotted daily quota, two gallons.\n''I have to make do with these two pots for my entire family of five,'' Mrs. Khatun said, ''but in a way I'm thankful to Allah that we're still getting it.''\nMrs. Khatun, 45 years old, is one of about 30,000 residents of the overcrowded, low-lying neighborhood of Mugdapara here in the capital who have been at the mercy of such erratic water deliveries since Bangladesh was inundated with widespread flooding late last month. It is estimated that at least a third of the capital's five million people have been without regular water supplies because of the flooding.\nWith reservoir tanks and pumping stations submerged in many areas, hundreds of thousands of people are now dependent on drinking water brought from outside. The water and sewerage authority and political and volunteer organizations have mounted a major operation to bring drinking water to the affected areas, but, as Mrs. Khatun's experience shows, their efforts sometimes fall short.\nMuch of the country is still under water. The Government says that 935 people have died in the flooding, but its count is generally considered too low, and Dhaka newspapers put the toll at more than 1,800. The Health Ministry says that about 220,000 people are suffering from gastrointestinal diseases like diarrhea and dysentery as a result of the flooding, and that 185 people have died from such diseases. [ Railroad service from Dhaka to Chittagong, the main port, and Sylhet, the business center, has been restored after repairs to a railroad bridge outside the capital, Reuters reported. The bridge was washed away two weeks ago in the flooding. ] Getting water to Mugdapara, Mrs. Khatun's neighborhood, is an arduous and time-consuming exercise.\nVolunteers of the Family Planning Association of Bangladesh must first negotiate by rickshaw through waterlogged roads to reach the municipal pumping station, where their drums are filled. The drums are taken by pickup truck for a distance, but transferred again to rickshaws for delivery through streets where the water is still too deep. A stretch of mud has to be covered by men who carry the drums on their heads. Finally, when the drums reach the neighborhood, they are loaded onto boats that set off down serpentine lanes and bylanes to the community center, where the family planning association has set up its distribution camp.\n''It's a killing job,'' said Kazi Anisur Rahman, secretary general of the association. ''We spend nearly two hours to deliver five drums to this area less than three miles from our headquarters.'' Land for Dead and Living\nThe wan smile never left Nuruddin Mia's face as he wearily maneuvered his boat past submerged trees and houses under a blazing sun, on his way to Paschimgaon, a village of about 5,000 people 12 miles southwest of Dhaka.\nFor 30 years, Mr. Mia, who is from the village, has been ferrying people to and from the village of Demraghat three miles away. His route is the Balu River, which in the flooding has become a huge lake stretching as far as the eye can see.\n''Never, ever have I heard or seen such a flood and horror in my life,'' said Mr. Mia, who is 46. ''There's not a single house in this area that has escaped its wrath.''\nHis own house has been inundated by waist-deep water and looks as if it might crumble at any moment.\nMr. Mia and his 18-year-old son, Sohrab Hossain, spend nights in the boat. The other five members of his family sleep on the tin roof of the house, exposed to the elements. ''My own nephew, born 20 days ago, died of cold, and there is no doctor here who could be consulted with,'' he said.\nHe said the family had a hard time finding a dry spot where the body could be buried. ''Ultimately we took him to an adjoining area where a small parcel of land was found and we buried him there,'' he said.\nThe parcel holding the burial site is also haven for at least 200 people, mostly women and children huddling together with cattle, ducks and chickens.\n''This flood has leveled everybody -rich and poor, high and low,'' said Janab Ali Matbar, 65, the village headman. 'Living Like Animals'\nIn another neighborhood, 30 minutes ride by boat, an incomplete two-story rural health center converted into a relief camp houses more than 300 men, women and children. Of the four toilets in the building, two in the ground floor are under water, so many of those taking refuge in the building relieve themselves in the surrounding flood water. Many people were seen bathing and washing in the contaminated water.\n''You can't really call it life,'' said Rafiqul Islam Khandker, 40, who is in charge of the camp and who is also the headmaster of the local high school. ''They're living like animals.'' Still, many of those in the center appeared grateful to have found a place where one meal is provided daily, since they are extremely poor even in their normal circumstances.\nMr. Khandker said that there have been surprisingly few cases of diarrhea, dysentery and flu, diseases normally inevitable in such conditions.\n''There's no death yet due to these diseases,'' Mr. Khandker said.\nAzimul Baki, a rural health assistant, interjected: ''If there is any, we simply have to put the dead on a makeshift raft for lack of dry space for burial.''"

      "text": "IDEAS & TRENDS; Once More, the Earth Visits Disaster on the Plains of Bangladesh\n1988-09-11T05:00:00.000Z\nSPRAWLING across a vast delta where three of the world's great rivers meet, Bangladesh is the drainpipe of Central Asia. In bountiful times, the rich alluvial silt that covers most of the country yields as many as three rice crops a year. But when the drainpipe overflows, as it did two weeks ago, Bangladesh becomes a land reminiscent of Bruegel's visions of triumphant death.\nIn a 10-day period of torrential monsoon rain that ended last week, more than 22 inches fell in some regions, and rainfall throughout the country was twice as much as normal for such a period. When the rain finally let up, 50 of the country's 64 administrative districts lay under a sheet of water that covered roads to depths of up to eight feet.\nGovernments and relief organizations throughout the world hastened to send food and medicine, but as usual in such disasters, most of Bangladesh's 110 million inhabitants were isolated by the flood and beyond immediate help.\nHundreds died when the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna Rivers overflowed. When the bacteria-laden water began to subside last week, germinating intestinal diseases lingered, tainting wells, rice paddies and streams. Water-borne illness is a principal cause of Bangladesh's 12 percent infant mortality rate.\nFor the people of long-suffering Bengal, disaster never seems to end. Though this year's floods were particularly destructive in the region, some flooding occurs nearly every year, shifting land, dispossessing farmers and spreading disease.\nSince the bloody birth of Bangladesh in 1971, some of the nation's leaders have blamed India, their one-time ally, for contributing to both floods and droughts. India and Bangladesh have often been at odds over the equitable division of water from the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and other rivers on which both countries depend. Bangladesh officials have accused India of disrupting the flow with its dams, and of worsening the silting problem by permitting extensive deforestation of regions drained by the rivers. Long, Slow Flooding\nThis year, although the overflowing of rivers originating in India, Nepal and Tibet apparently exacerbated matters, climatologists believe that the main cause of the disaster was rain in Bangladesh itself. Aside from the tea-growing hill country in the northeast, Bangladesh is as flat as a board and only a few feet above sea level. In hard rains, the shallow, sluggish rivers quickly overflow. Once inundated, the countryside takes weeks to drain.\nThe underlying problem is Bangladesh's yearly exposure to the southwest monsoon. As climatologists explain it, the monsoon affecting South Asia pivots around western China, where the sun warms the ground and the ground warms a rising column of air. This mass of rising air sucks in cooler air from the oceans, notably the Bay of Bengal, creating sea breezes in coastal areas.\nAs the moisture-filled air from the sea moves inland, it is warmed and pulled into the rising column. When the column reaches the cold air at high altitude, the moisture condenses. The rain is especially likely to begin over land that rises abruptly from a plain. This year, the rain was torrential where the Bangladesh highlands rise above the flat rice and jute fields.\nNo one knows why monsoon rains and the cyclonic storms that sometimes accompany them are destructive in some years and mild in others. But climatologists have a growing suspicion that ''active'' monsoons like the one Bangladesh has just been through are closely related to a phenomenon experts call the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.\nEvery few years, the surface water off the west coast of South America becomes warmer than usual, heating the air above it and disturbing circulation patterns in the atmosphere throughout the world. During a typical El Nino event, normally rainy regions are sometimes stricken by droughts, and normally parched areas are drenched. In 1982-83, the world experienced the most severe El Nino event on record, which damaged crops and fishing industries in regions as widely separated as New Zealand, California and Africa. Scientists believe it also perturbed carbon dioxide and ozone concentrations and may even have slightly slowed the Earth's rotation on its axis.\nOddly enough, however, the years when El Nino activity peaks seem to correspond to those in which the monsoon season in Bangladesh is mild, and vice versa. The most recent El Nino event ended last March, and some experts believe that this might have been taken as a sign that the monsoon in Bangladesh this summer would be severe.\nNo one yet knows what the connection between El Nino and the monsoon may be. Nor is anyone sure that being able to predict bad weather would really help Bangladesh much. The country's impoverished masses have nowhere to go, much as the many Bangladeshis who would like to emigrate to Pakistan or India. Flood control measures in a country that is mostly a big flood plain are limited.\n''At any rate,'' a public health official in Dhaka once said, ''the monsoon helps to assure our supply of the one commodity in which we are rich: misfortune.''"

      "text": "PARIS GROUP URGES 'DECISIVE ACTION' FOR ENVIRONMENT\n1989-07-17T05:00:00.000Z\nThe leaders of the Group of Seven industrial democracies today signaled a shift to a new realm of concern by dedicating a third of their final communique to an appeal for ''decisive action'' to ''understand and protect the earth's ecological balance.''\nConcluding one of their most harmonious summit gatherings ever, the seven nations also endorsed Washington's strategy for encouraging banks and third world nations to negotiate the terms of debt reductions; expressed prudent confidence in the general state of the world economy, and agreed to set up a task force to combat the laundering of money earned through drug trafficking. United Nations Aid Sought\nAsserting that ''the drug problem has reached devastating proportions,'' the seven leaders called for enlisting the United Nations ''to counter drug production, to reduce demand and to carry forward the fight against drug trafficking itself and the laundering of its proceeds.'' [ Text, page A7. ] While expressing concern, and at times alarm, about the environment, the leaders from Western Europe and North America fell short of making any firm commitments to remedy the situation.\nThe shift toward a new global agenda was underscored, too, by the detailed attention given by the seven leaders over dinner last night to a letter from Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet President, offering to integrate the Soviet Union ''fully and completely into the world economy'' and to help resolve the issue of third world debt.\nSummarizing the summit's deliberations at a news conference at the gleaming Arche de la Defense on the western outskirts of Paris, President Francois Mitterrand said that the seven leaders did not consider it necessary to respond collectively to Mr. Gorbachev's missive but that they ''hoped for the success of the democratization under way in the Soviet Union.'' 'We Will Contribute'\n''We are not charged with assuring its success but, to the extent that we can do so, we will contribute,'' said Mr. Mitterrand, who was host to Mr. Gorbachev during an official visit to Paris this month.\nChancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany effusively welcomed the Gorbachev initiative, but President Bush echoed Mr. Mitterrand's caution, saying it would take greater ''manifestations of freedom'' before the Soviet Union could become a full-fledged economic interlocutor for the seven.''\n''I think it's very premature,'' President Bush told a news conference. ''There's an awful lot that has to transpire in the Soviet Union, it seems to me, before anything of that nature could be considered here. We're talking about free market economies here.''\nSpeaking on the lawn of the American embassy residence, Mr. Bush said that he did not think the time was yet right for a summit encounter with Mr. Gorbachev and pronounced the Paris gathering ''a clear success'' that had been ''a watershed on the environment.''\nThe exceptionally smooth three days of deliberations in Paris were helped by a moderately buoyant world economy and the sharp reduction of East-West tensions that has flowed from Mr. Gorbachev's reforming efforts at home. President Bush also facilitated the discussions in Paris, European officials said, by his non-confrontational manner and his willingness to see the European Community take the lead on shaping policy toward Eastern Europe.\nAlthough the seven leaders were in a self-congratulatory mood on the world economy, they did not openly address troubling issues like the large American budget deficit and its contribution to high interest rates and third world debt. Moreover, hopes that Mexico would reach agreement here with its bank creditors on lowering its debt, in line with conditions laid down by Washington, were dashed.\nIn a break with recent summit practice, the seven nations today said nothing specific about their objectives for the dollar. High-ranking American and European delegates explained privately that the summit partners wanted to avoid any possibility that financial markets might determine that the Paris gathering had taken a new initiative on the dollar. Committed to Earlier Policy\nRather, the officials said, the seven remained committed to the policy announced at a finance ministers' meeting in April. That policy stated that a rise in the value of the dollar or any ''excessive'' decline would be ''counterproductive'' to the health of the world economy.\nMr. Mitterrand and other leaders concurred in highlighting the imperiled environment as a compelling issue.\n''The interaction between man's activities and the global environment is such that if we are to pass on the heritage safe to our children's future, we must take action now,'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain told a news conference before leaving Paris. ''That is the imperative.'' After calling for ''decisive action,'' the seven nations also pledged ''to work together to achieve the common goals of preserving a healthy and balanced global environment in order to meet shared economic and social objectives and to carry out obligations to future generations.'' Several Environmental Issues\nThe communique touched on virtually every major environmental issue, but offered no commitments to the problems, which include reducing carbon dioxide emissions even though the United States, Japan, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy and Canada account for about 40 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions generated by fossil fuel combustion.\nInstead, the seven said they ''strongly advocate common efforts to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which threaten to induce climate change, endangering the environment and ultimately the economy.'' Third World Debt Stance\nDespite its cautious tone, the communique did endorse the innovative notion of forgiving in ''special cases'' some third world debt in exchange for commitments to protect the environment.\nThe communique also urged giving ''specific attention'' to moving beyond the landmark Montreal Protocol of 1987 to eliminate the production of ozone-depleting gasses like carbon tetrachloride, halons and meethylchloroform.\nSeveral senior European officials said that the importance of the lengthy environmental declaration was not in its specifics but rather in having the issue so solemnly enshrined in a summit communique for the first time. One European Community official observed that the leaders ''have raised public expectations, and at next year's summit in America people are going to ask them what they've done in the meantime.''\nOn the topic of drugs, the summit nations announced that they and ''other countries interested in these problems'' would set up a task force to tighten efforts to prevent banks and other financial institutions from being used for the laundering of drug money. Some estimates put drug revenues at $300 billion.\nThe task force will have the mandate to consider new measures ''including the adaptation of the legal and regulatory systems so as to enhance multilateral judicial assistance.''\nMr. Mitterrand, the sole Socialist leader among the seven, had sought to use the summit gathering to advance the cause of heavily indebted third world nations. Inviting several African, Asian and Latin American leaders to the bicentennial celebrations of the French Revolution - which overlapped with the economic summit - he sponsored the idea of another so-called North-South summit on the model of the Cancun gathering in Mexico in 1981. Proposal Rebuffed\nBut this proposal was quietly rebuffed by the summit partners. Mr. Mitterrand finally was left with little to show for his engagement aside from backing in the communique for World Bank studies on the flooding in Bangladesh - after France had pushed for a $5 billion embankment undertaking there - and verbal support for the establishment of observatories to monitor land erosion in Saharan nations.\nIn backing the debt-reduction plan outlined by United States Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady last March, the summit did not incorporate elements of a more generous proposal outlined by President Mitterrand that would have effectively used taxpayers' money to ease the debt burden weighing on the third world.\n''We stress that official creditors should not substitute for private lenders,'' declared the communique, embracing the spirit of the Brady approach."

The holy fasting month of Ramadan begins next week. Saudi Arabia in mid-March stopped people performing their five daily prayers and the weekly Friday prayer inside mosques as part of efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus. On Thursday, the Prophet's Mosque in the holy city of Medina said it was banning events which dispense evening meals in the mosque to those in need during Ramadan to break their daily fast. The kingdom has reported 6,380 cases of Covid-19, the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, and 83 deaths so far."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-20 00:00:00      \nAnyone can be jailed for up to 14 years for for violating the law that was passed in September last year It has been a year now since the Digital Security Bill, 2018, was passed in the parliament on September 19, 2018, amid much criticism from journalists, and human rights activists.  Within the first year of its enactment, four cases were recorded under the Digital Security Act (DSA) in Khulna, where two journalists were sued.  Md Hedait Hossain Molla, local correspondent of Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune, was sued, and arrested on January 1, for publishing \"false\" information on the number of votes cast in a constituency in the aftermath of the general election.  Rashidul Islam, staff reporter of the daily Manab Zamin was also accused in the same case. According to the initial announcement of the election results, the number of votes cast in Khulna 1 was higher than the total number of voters in the constituency. As the matter was brought to the returning officer's attention, he said it was a mistake, and later came up with a correction. By the time the correction could be made, the two media outlets ran reports saying the number of votes cast was around 22,000 higher than the actual number of voters. Even though Hedayet was released on permanent bail two days later, the police have yet to submit the case investigation report in court, despite the passage of eight months. Yet, it is clearly mentioned in the law that, for cases filed under the act, the investigation reports must be submitted within 120 days. Later on August 22, publisher and editor of 'Prothom Shomoy', an online media portal, Shahin Rahman was arrested for allegedly spreading defamatory information on social media.  Khulna Press Club President SM Habib started a case against him under sections 29 and 31 of the Digital Security Act on August 9. Two more cases under the same act was filed against him by August 28. The law authorises prison sentences for up to 14 years for anyone who secretly records government officials, or gathers information from a government agency using a computer or other digital device. Mominul Islam, district convener of Bangladesh Society for the Enforcement of Human Rights (BSEHR), said: \"Each law poses some variations of pros and cons. However, in the first year of enactment of the Digital Security Act, it has mostly been abused, and journalists were victimized. This new law puts restraints on the media's freedom of expression. I think several sections of the act need to be revised again.\" Kudrot E Khoda, district general secretary of Shushashoner Jonno Nagorik (Shujan), said: \"The Digital Security Act was enacted after scrapping the ICT act. The law looks good on paper, but it is important to monitor if it is implemented objectively. The misuse of this law is preventing journalists in the district to practice their right to freedom of expression.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-17 00:00:00      \nTo combat this pandemic, we need to work together Bangladesh has already been hit hard with the global pandemic and experts and analysts are saying that management and duration will determine the depth of this crisis. After reading many articles and publications and teaching international business at a private university, outlined are my modest understanding and beliefs. Sadly vagrant or homeless people are part of our society and economy. Daily wage earners account for the chunk of what our economy is all about. This is a densely populated country.  We struggle every day to commute from Dhanmondi to Gulshan and albeit we talk about being digital, the mere effort of conducting an online video chat with co-workers from every nook of the country takes a nerve-wracking toll on the very essence of our souls.  Needless to say, we have our own epidemic -- dengue -- that chases us every monsoon season, and even during other times of the year. Not to mention a couple of days of heavy rain threatens us with a predicted flood.  We have a healthcare facility that is prickly and very much centralized to Dhaka only. Now this pandemic which has no cure yet, couldn't make the matter any worse for us. The West or the \"more sanitized\" countries are already failing in protecting their civilians in spite of having a much better health care system than ours.   Thus what right do we have to overestimate our power in combating this in regard to the public health sector when we have an approximate total of 1200 ICU beds (private and public sectors) for 170 million people according to World Economic Forum and World Bank data.  Like any other system, our policy-makers with sheer optimism are optimizing whatever resources we have to stem out the root cause. But leaving everything up to the policy-makers will be like living in a fool's paradise. We as citizens have a very big role to play. If these crises go beyond our control, there may be emotional, social, and economic unrest that we cannot fathom. The dire economic condition has already been discussed in many forums.  However, the differences in the social class system will be conspicuous. There are people in society who are privileged enough to have the disposable income to showcase how they are passing their leisure time and then there are daily wage earners who look at their empty pockets and stare at those tall buildings and wonder about the indifference.  Such indifference may lead to depression, anger, and in extreme cases civil unrest. Hence the flow of communication should be a continuous process to all levels of society for assurance that all is still not lost.  The official authorities are already doing their part in communicating about Covid-19. However, we as communities have a significant role to play in mitigating the crisis. As a nation, I do not believe we still fully understand its authenticity and implication.  Going for mass gathering for religious or social purposes shows that the significance and consequences of the pandemic have not registered in the minds of the people.   If the literate society has trouble in wrestling the idea of the preventive measures that need to be taken for Covid-19, then booing the underprivileged and illiterate society, when all they are doing is going out to look for work, is nothing but living in a bubble mindset of utter cluelessness. The utmost challenge is to shorten the crisis. The longer the crisis, the more difficult it will be to recover from the damages and scars it will inevitably leave behind in the economy.  According to an article in WEF, 90% workers are working in the informal sector. Due to the pandemic, work has stopped and people are out of work and thus no income. Most importantly, in rural areas, most people live on daily wages, and \"being quarantined\" is an extravagance to them.  There are people who live on remittance too. The pandemic has made many workers go out of work in the domestic market as well as abroad. When their livelihood and survival is at risk, it will take sufficient motivating factors to convince them to stay at home to avoid being infected.  It is essentially required that people are given the food delivery support and cash incentives until the curve is flattened, and the government is taking proper measures to ensure that.  Meanwhile, if we the privileged ones look after our own people who have over the years given their laboured skills for our comfort, then much pressure will be minimized from the economy to bounce back.  We are a small country with a distinctly huge population and a fragile infrastructure, hence we cannot afford a misstep in our policy-making.  To combat this pandemic and manage the foreseeable economic crisis, not only the government but the NGOs, business sectors, and other relevant organizations should work together with cohesion and strong linkages.  Not to mention \"us\" as citizens also have a strong role to play. We can have the intermittent opening of some manufacturing sectors or services, if not all. We have seen how the developed countries are doing it and we can learn and customize according to our needs and resources.  We are a country known for its strongest survival instincts and resilience; there is no doubt in my mind that we can fight this one too. Mahzabeen Faruque is Lecturer at State University. "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-10 00:00:00      \nA leader who was always one with the people For our generation who witnessed the birth of Bangladesh, it is a daunting task to express in words the unique role played by the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman in the creation of the new state. It is even more challenging to analyze the political ideas underpinning his life's work. Whenever I think of Bangabandhu I first remember those exciting and memorable days of March 1971.  I consider myself to be very lucky that I was able to witness the events of March 1971 and Bangabandhu's role in creating history. Very few people are fortunate enough to see the making of history. I witnessed the transformation of our movement for autonomy into our struggle for independence. I witnessed how the main actor of this historic transformation, Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman, realized an impossible dream. There have been leaders in other countries who led their nations. But few could create history. Bangabandhu was one such rare grand actor of history. It is unfortunate that even after 48 years of our independence and 43 years after his assassination there is no well-researched comprehensive biography of Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman. Fortunately two recent books, based on his personal diaries, have been published which can serve as original source that help us understand his ideals and political philosophy.  The first book, The Unfinished Memoirs, published in 2012, throws light on his childhood, and early political life. Though The Unfinished Memoirs does not include events after the late 1950s it still illuminates his political thoughts very clearly.    The second book, Karagarer Rojnamcha (prison diaries) which was published in 2017, is based on his diaries when he was in prison after he launched the six point movement in 1966. Here again his political thoughts are made very clear. He discusses at length the different methods of suppression of people's movements pursued by an autocratic state. He highlights the importance of fundamental civil and political rights, particularly the need for ensuring freedom of expressions for sustaining democracy. In this article I quote extensively from his writings so that we can hear his own voice. To understand his political philosophy we should always keep in mind that Bangabandhu spent most of his life as a political player outside state power. He struggled against colonial and undemocratic state power, first against the British and later against the Pakistan state to establish the economic, political, and cultural rights of the Bengalees.  He exercised state power only for a limited period of time -- barely three and a half years after independence. His political discourse, as illustrated in these two books, is that of a leader fighting authoritarian state power, not that of a leader who was using state power to govern a country.  One of the remarkable features of his political life was his transformation from an ordinary rank and file worker of a political party to an unparalleled leader of millions of people. Bangabandhu possessed outstanding organizational capacity; at the same time he was a great orator. Generally we do not find such a combination of qualities in one leader.  In his Unfinished Memoirs Bangabandhu notes that he was more interested in party organizational work than in discussing theoretical and ideological issues. Though he was not a political theoretician, Bangabandhu had a few specific political ideals and goals and he worked consistently to achieve them. His values are best captured in three sentences which Bangabandhu penned on May 3, 1973. He writes: \"As a man, what concerns mankind concerns me. As a Bengalee, I am deeply involved in all that concerns Bengalees. This abiding involvement is born of and nourished by love, enduring love, which gives meaning to my politics and to my very being.\" The above quote makes it clear that Bangabandhu identified himself both as a human being and as a Bengalee.  This self-identification helps us explore the main features of his political philosophy, such as nationalism, secularism, socialism, and people-orientation.  Nationalism Independence, liberation, and democracy  From the beginning of his political life, Bangabandhu was proud of his Bengali national identity. He was involved in the Pakistan movement but he believed that Pakistan should be established on the basis of the Lahore Resolution which envisaged two Muslim majority independent sovereign states.  He perceived the nationalist movement not simply as a struggle to gain independence from the rule of an external colonial power but also as a struggle for the economic and political emancipation of the down-trodden masses from various forms of oppression.  He joined the Pakistan movement in the hope that poor Muslim peasants will be liberated from the exploitation of the landlord classes. He had always viewed the Bengali nationalist movement as a movement for the achievement of democracy as well as liberation of the oppressed people. Thus on March 7, 1971 he called upon the people to launch simultaneously the struggle for independence and liberation.      Prior to the establishment of Pakistan, when as a student in Kolkata, Bangabandhu joined the Muslim League. He belonged to the Shaheed Suhrawardy and Abul Hashem faction of the party which was known as the progressives group. In his Unfinished Memoirs he writes: \"Under Mr Suhrawardy's leadership we wanted to make the Muslim League the party of the people and make it represent middle-class Bengali aspirations. Upto that time Muslim League had not become an organization that was rooted in the people. It used to serve the interests of landlords, moneyed men, and Nawabs and Khan Bahadurs.\" After the creation of Pakistan, Bangabandhu returned to Dhaka and became involved in various progressive movements and organizations which championed the linguistic, cultural, and economic rights of the Bengalis. In 1948 he was imprisoned for participating in the movement demanding recognition of Bengali as one of the state languages of Pakistan.  He was also involved in other social and political protest movements, such as the movement of poor peasants against prohibiting inter-district trade in rice known as the \"cordon\" system. He supported the movement of the fourth class employees of Dhaka university and was again imprisoned in 1949.  Within a relatively short period after the establishment of Pakistan he became convinced about the need for establishing an opposition political party not only for championing the rights of the Bengalis but also to challenge the authoritarian rule of the Muslim League. In his Unfinished Memoirs he explained the rationale for the establishment of the Awami League in the following way: \"There is no point in pursuing the Muslim League any longer. This party has now become the establishment. They can no longer be called a party of the people ... if we did not form an organization that could take on the role of the opposition the country would turn into a dictatorship.\" In 1949, the Awami Muslim League (AML) was founded and Bangabandhu was elected the joint secretary of the party though he was still in prison. In 1953 he became the general secretary of the party. The demand for self-rule gained increasing popular support in East Bengal from the mid-1950s. In 1955 Bangabandhu became a member of the Pakistan National Assembly (NA). In one of his speeches in the NA we already find a strong articulation of various demands of the Bengali nationalists and his strong sense of Bengali identity. He said:  \"They want to place the word 'East Pakistan' instead of 'East Bengal.' We have demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word Bengal has a history, has a tradition of its own. You can change it only after people have been consulted. If you want to change it then we have to go back to Bengal and ask them whether they accept it ... what about the state language Bengali? What about joint electorate? What about autonomy? ... I appeal to my friends on that side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of referendum or in the form of plebiscite.\" In the council session of the party in 1955 the Awami League (AL) dropped the word \"Muslim\" from its name and Bangabandhu again became the general secretary of the party. In February 1966, Bangabandhu presented his historic six points demand which put forward a very radical notion of provincial autonomy leaving only limited powers in the hands of the central government.  In March of that year he became the president of the AL and began a country-wide campaign to popularize the six points which soon became the sole agenda of the party. Six points captured the aspirations of the nation and it was billed as the charter for the liberation of the Bengalis. Following the launch of the six points, Bangabandhu was again imprisoned and he was charged with treason by the Pakistan government in the Agartala conspiracy case.  In 1969, Ayub fell from power in the face of massive students' movement. Bangabandhu was released from prison and the students conferred on him the title of Bangabandhu (friend of Bengal). During the 1970 election campaign Bangabandhu started using nationalist slogans such as \"Bangladesh\" and \"Joy Bangla.\"  Thus, within a relatively short span of four years, between 1966 to 1970, Bangabandhu was able to unite the whole Bengali nation behind his demand for liberation and independence. I do not think any other nationalist leader had been so successful in mobilizing such a huge number of people within such a short period of time.  It is noteworthy that though throughout his life Bangabandhu was involved in movement politics and talked about people's emancipation from exploitation and oppression, he believed in peaceful non-violent political movements. From 1947 till 1970 the Bengali nationalist movement became stronger day-by-day under his leadership but he stayed within the bounds of democratic politics.  Whenever Pakistani rulers gave opportunities for election he participated in them, though the elections were often not free and fair and attempts were made to foil the election results. In Karagarer Rojnamcha he points out repeatedly that by limiting the democratic space an autocratic regime ultimately leads the country towards terrorist politics. He writes:   \"Newspapers arrived. I was alarmed that they [the Pakistani government] are trying to shut down democratic politics ... If anybody criticizes the government there will be cases against them under the proposed secret act ... I myself am facing five cases under article 124, section 7 (3) for making public speeches ... My fear is they are leading Pakistan toward terrorist politics. We do not believe in that politics. But those of us who want to do good for the people through democratic politics, our space is shrinking.\"      Secularism Non-communalism and equal rights for all citizens Though he was a Bengali nationalist, Bangabandhu never tried to create division and hatred between different identity groups. Many nationalist politicians use provocative languages and symbols that encourage violence between different groups. These days we are witnessing the rise of such nationalist leaders even in Western democratic countries who are trying to instigate intolerance and violence towards minority groups. But Bangabandhu's nationalist politics was different. He believed in co-existence and mutual tolerance of different identity groups and talked about equal rights of all citizens. He always stood against communal violence.  Though he was involved in the Pakistan movement he believed that in India, Muslims and in Pakistan, Hindus should enjoy equal rights as citizens and live together in peace and harmony. He talked about equal rights of all groups to practice their respective religions.  He witnessed the communal riots in Kolkata on August 16, 1947. He points out that Suhrawardy asked his supporters to observe the day in a peaceful way so that no blame could fall on the Suhrawardy government. But unfortunately, communal riots did break out in Kolkata and later spread to Noakhali. Bangabandhu saved both Muslims and Hindus from acts of communal violence in Kolkata. Later when Suhrawardy joined Mahatma Gandhi in efforts to bring back communal harmony, Bangabandhu joined them. After returning to Dhaka he joined Gonotantrik Jubo League and took up the cause of building communal harmony as his main mission. He was against all forms of communal violence, not simply between Hindus and Muslims but also between different Muslim sects and between Bengalis and non-Bengalis.  In his Unfinished Memoirs he strongly condemns the anti-Kadiyani riots that took place in Lahore in 1953. In 1954, when riots broke out between Bengali and non-Bengali workers in Adamjee jute mills in Narayanganj, he rushed to the area to calm the situation. In 1964 when Hindu-Muslim riots spread in India he started a civic campaign to prevent communal riots in East Bengal. Even in his March 7, 1971 speech he asked people to remain vigilant against the threat of communal violence. He said: \"Be very careful, keep in mind that the enemy has infiltrated our ranks to engage in the work of provocateurs. Whether Bengalee or non-Bengalee, Hindu or Muslim, all are our brothers and it is our responsibility to ensure their safety.\" In his personal life he followed the preachings of Islam. But Bangabandhu was against the political use of religion. He condemned the Muslim League's practice of using the slogan of Islam and not paying attention to the economic well-being of the people which he argued was the goal for which \"the working class, the peasants, and the labourers had made sacrifice during the movement for independence.\"  Socialism Equality, freedom from exploitation, and oppression   In his Unfinished Memoirs Bangabandhu writes: \"I myself am no communist, but I believe in socialism and not in capitalism. I believe capital is a tool of the oppressor. As long as capitalism is the mainspring of the economic order people all over the world will continue to be oppressed.\" By socialism he meant a system that would free people from exploitation and oppression and remove inequality. He visited China in 1952 which left a deep imprint in his mind. He found great differences in the living conditions of people in Pakistan and China which he attributed to the differences in the two political systems.  Bangabandhu believed that the government has a role to play in removing inequality and freeing people from exploitation. He admired the priorities set by the Chinese government in improving the socio-economic conditions of the people. He writes:  \"Everywhere we could see new schools and colleges coming up. The government has taken charge of education.\" He further writes: \"The communist government had confiscated the land owned by landlords and had distributed it among all farmers. Thus landless peasants had become land owners. China now belonged to peasants and workers and the class that used to dominate and exploit had had their day.\" He did not want to see inequality grow in Bangladesh. In the council session of the AL held during April 7-8, 1972, he reiterated his commitment to promote an exploitation-free socio-economic system and socialism was formally adopted as one of the ideals of the party. In the next council session of the party held in 1974 he, again, pledged to work for freeing the nation of exploitation and oppression. People Orientation People's issues, people's politics   Often we find leaders who lead people towards great goals but they do not become emotionally involved with the people. Bangabandhu was an exception. When I compare the speeches of various leaders of the world with those of Bangabandhu, one of his off-repeated expressions -- \"love for people\" -- stands out as unique. He often talked about his love for people and people's love for him in return.  He always prioritized the issues that are upper-most in ordinary people's lives. His politics was people's politics. During the campaign for Pakistan when famine struck, he worked in feeding centres for the famine victims. He worked to rescue the victims of communal riots in Kolkata. He participated in street rallies demanding food security for the poor in East Bengal. His political philosophy was not centred only around the goal of getting state power: He developed his political ideas by being involved with the concerns of the ordinary masses.  This people's orientation made him a pragmatist. In his diaries he constantly refers to issues that would affect ordinary people's everyday life such as the rise in essential commodity prices or tax increase or flood or famine.    At one level, Bangabandhu was a man of the masses. He learned about people's aspirations from them. At another level he was the leader of the people. He carried forward ordinary people's aspirations. He had faith in people. That is why he could call upon people on March 7, 1971 to join the liberation struggle with \"whatever little they have.\"  Four guiding principles of state We see the reflections of Banganabdhu's political philosophy in the four guiding principles of state adopted by our constitution: Nationalism, democracy, secularism, and socialism. He defended these four principles in various speeches delivered in the parliament, in the party forums, and in addresses to the nation. Bangabandhu used to articulate the goals of his life's work in two simple words. He would either say he wants to build again \"Shonar Bangla\" or he would say he wants to bring \"a smile on the faces of the poor and unhappy people.\" Bangabandhu never talked about GDP growth or other theoretical issues. He knew very well how precious a smile was and his goal was to achieve that priceless objective.   Rounaq Jahan is a Distinguished Fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), Dhaka, Bangladesh."

The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) has recently approved a project titled 'Flood control, addressing water logging and improvement of drainage facilities of Chittagong Metropolis' to this end.  A senior Planning Commission official said: \"Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) under the Ministry of Water Resources will implement the project by June 2022 to be entirely borne from the state exchequer.\" He said that the main objectives of the project are to free the Chittagong metropolis from water logging as well as to protect the port city from tidal surge, high tide and flood by constructing retaining wall and flood wall on the right embankment of the Karnaphuli River. Moreover, steps will be taken to stop intrusion of salty water and speedy drainage of rain water in the city through construction of regulators and pump houses. Commenting on the project, Planning Minister MA Mannan said: \"Once the project is implemented, it would help addressing the water logging of the port city to a great extent.\"   The minister added that this project will protect Chittagong from flood and tidal surge and high tide. Another official at the Water Resources Ministry said that the rivers Karnaphuli and Halda are very important for drainage of water from the Chittagong Metropolitan City though the main industrial areas, Shah Amanat International Airport, railway areas near Pahartali, Kalurghat heavy industrial area are all situated near the Karnaphuli River. It is to be noted that the water flow of 23 city canals merges in the Karnaphuli River and three canals converges into the Halda River while the flow  of the remaining 14 canals go into the Bay of Bengal. Apart from this, excessive rain water and mixed impact of high tide and low tide at the Karnaphuli are one of the main reasons for water logging in the city. During high tide, water from the Karnaphuli River enters the city since there is no flood control embankment on the right side of both rivers Karnaphuli and Halda. Under these circumstances, Bangladesh Water Development Board formed a technical committee in December 2016 following request from the Chittagong City Corporation to address the problem side by side a study was carried out by Chittagong WASA. \"Based on that study and recommendations of the technical committee, the project was drafted and later was approved at the Planning Commission and subsequently at the ECNEC,\" added the Water Resources Ministry official. The main project operations include the construction of 2.7 kilometer retaining wall, 18.965 kilometer flood wall, installation of some 69 pumps, construction of 23 regulators, 1 kilometer slope protection and some 6 hectares of land acquisition. On July 15, 2018, the Pre Evaluation Committee (PEC) meeting on the project was held where the Planning Commission recommended for implementing the project."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-21 00:00:00      \nWhat if the fruit you love is available in the market not only for a few months, but throughout the whole year? And what if this very fruit does not need to be imported but is grown locally and sold at a street cart in your neighbourhood? That is the goal of the Year-Round Fruit Production for Nutrition Improvement project -- to make fruits available all over the year and meet the nutrition demand of the population. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) has been implementing it since 2014-15. An adult is supposed to consume 250 grams of fruit daily but per capita intake is 80 grams in Bangladesh at present, according to the agriculture ministry. Even a decade ago, local fruits were limited to Bangladesh's hot and humid summer. People keenly waited for May, June and July when mango, litchi, jackfruit and most other fruits would make their way to the market. The second month of the Bangla calendar, Jaistha (mid-May to mid-June), is aptly called the Madhu Mas (honey month) because most of these fruits become available around this time. However, the scenario has changed now. Several fruits are found almost all the time. Mehedi Masood, the project director, said earlier fruits would be available during the three summer months, but the government is focusing on year-round production. \"Now you will find guava, papaya, pineapple and some other fruits almost round the year. We are also expanding the production tenure of mango.\" Since the inception of the project, more than one lakh farmers were given training on fruit cultivation through the horticulture centres, the official said. In addition, 21-22 lakh fruit trees were planted across the country during the period, he added. \"Inspired by the initiative, farmers planted 2 crore fruit trees on their own.\" Not only are some fruits found for a longer period in the market, the cultivation of high-yielding varieties has increased the overall fruit production many times over. In 2006-07, 4.74 lakh hectares were under fruit cultivation yielding 87.86 lakh tonnes, according to DAE. The acreage has since jumped to 7.24 hectares, with an output of 1.21 crore tonnes in 2017-18. In these 11 years, fruit production went up by 33.26 lakh tonnes. \"Good profits and demand for fruits in local and international markets encourage the farmers to produce more fruits, using high yielding seeds,\" the project director said. Besides, more exotic fruits are grown locally now, catering to a larger fruit market. Alongside the traditional local varieties, foreign fruits like avocado, rambutan, strawberry, orange, date, dragon fruit, and fig have become popular and locally available. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Bangladesh is one of the highest fruit-growing countries in the world, and it is the 10th largest tropical fruit producer. Over the last 18 years, the country's fruit production has been increased by 11.5 percent on an average annually, the UN body estimates. According to the agriculture ministry, 56 varieties of fruits were cultivated in Bangladesh about a decade ago, the number of which has increased to 72 now. With the cultivation of fruits increasing and the list of new varieties growing, Bangladesh's dependency on fruit import has already come down. According to the customs department, the first eight months of 2017-18 fiscal year saw the import of 2.82 lakh tonnes of apples, mandarins, oranges, pears and grapes. It went down to 2.52 lakh tonnes during the same period of 2018-19. Agriculturalists say people usually buy imported fruits between September and January when fruit production and supply remain poor. After the launch of the round-the-year fruit project, various fruits have become available almost all over the year. Guava tops the list. It is available even in winter. Project director Masood said the farming of Thai guava, which was introduced in 2005-06, has expanded across the country because it bears fruit quickly and commands a good price. \"It takes only about five months to grow the fruit,\" he said. In 1980-81, Bangladesh's guava production was 9,000 tonnes, which rose to 506,478 tonnes in 2017-18, registering a 56-fold increase in 37 years. Bangladesh has also been among the top 10 countries in the production of significant fruits -- second in jackfruit, seventh in mango, and eighth in guava, according to FAO. The cultivation of nutritious varieties like dragon fruit, avocado, pomelo, watermelon, muskmelon, Burmese grapes or lotkon, jujube, hog plum, and Indian gooseberry or amlaki has largely increased over the last 4-5 years. \"A silent revolution has taken place in the country's fruit sector. People are taking Thai guava instead of apple. As a result, apple import is dwindling,\" project consultant SM Kamruzzaman told The Daily Star. \"We are planning to ensure availability of fruits round the year.\" He also said currently they are planning to produce mango round the year and expand the production of persimmon and high-yielding oranges. Project director Mehedi Masood said the government plans to ensure round-the-year availability of fruits by 2030."

Morris, the A.I.D. deputy administrator, concludes that the United States should immediately provide an additional $20 million in 80,000 tons of food aid, between $1 million and $2 million in urgently needed medical supplies, oral rehydration salts and water purification tablets as well as other disaster and surveillance assistance.\nThe report also recommends that the aid agency develop a plan with other countries to rehabilitate Bangladesh and address the long-term causes of flooding in the region.\n''It is a disaster of historic proportions, mind-numbing,'' said Mr. Morris, who returned last week from a six-day tour of the flood-ravaged country. ''I don't really know how to describe it except to say that it's certainly the largest flood I could ever imagine.'' During his visit, Mr. Morris met with officials, relief workers and flood victims and delivered a letter from President Reagan to President H. M. Ershad expressing concern and a promise ''to do what we can to help.''\nAs part of its relief effort, the United States has already speeded up the availability of about $150 million in aid to Bangladesh, including food aid, disaster relief supplies and local currency earnings.\nThe report stressed that the full effect of the flood and the ultimate needs of the people of Bangladesh will become known only over the next few months. It predicted the possibility of ''significant loss of life and degradation of human welfare over the next three to six months.''\nOfficials in Bangladesh say millions of people in the capital, Dhaka, have been exposed to disease by drinking contaminated water. #25 Million Homeless The flood has so far claimed 1,000 lives, according to official figures, but unofficial estimates put the dead at 2,000 or more. The Bangladeshi Government says that a fourth of the deaths were caused by diarrhea, and that the others were caused by drowning, building collapses and snake bites.\nAccording to the A.I.D. report, 25 million people lost their homes in the flood, which inundated five million acres of rice land and damaged 43,000 miles of roads."

      "text": "THE WORLD; Why India Is Still Failing To Stop Its Population Surge\n1989-07-09T05:00:00.000Z\nWHEN India's Ministry of Health submitted its annual report to be considered in framing the country's 1989-90 budget, it included a cry for help. ''Population control can no longer be the responsibility of one ministry or department,'' it said. ''The entire planning process must be geared toward controlling population.''\nMore than four decades after independence, India, along with its neighbors Pakistan and Bangladesh, has not been able to control the relentless climb in the numbers of its people. Recent reports project that India, with at least 810 million people now, will pass one billion by the end of the century or soon after. If Beijing maintains its current population policies, India could overtake China as the most populous nation before the middle of the next century.\nIndia has brought its annual population growth rate down to about 2.1 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in Bangladesh and 3.2 percent or higher in Pakistan. But while improvements in agriculture have left Indians statistically able to feed themselves, population remains a source of grave concern in a country where food is not evenly distributed, forests are being razed for firewood or furniture, and good drinking water is scarce.\nIndian experts say large families are fostered by low literacy, high infant mortality, inadequate health care and a dearth of sustained information and follow-up services.\n''The illiterate peasant does not perceive the danger in numbers, in crossing the one billion mark,'' says India's leading demographer, Ashish Bose, who has done 30 years of field work in villages.\n''One of the major failures in India has been the lack of communication between our planners and policy makers and the masses,'' Mr. Bose, head of the Population Research Center of Delhi University's Institute of Economic Growth, said in an interview. ''We do not know how to communicate with illiterate people.'' Ads and Sterilization\nPopulation growth and fertility rates leveled off during the 1970's, and today Indian women still have on average of four to five children. Almost all efforts have been concentrated in the hands of the central Government working through local health authorities, an approach that some experts now question because the country is so culturally diverse.\nRadio and television advertising and information from community health centers bring to all India the message that small families are healthier and happier. But this apparently has not been enough. In Rajasthan, with India's fastest-growing population, a survey found that 97 percent of women who refuse birth control were well informed on family planning programs.\nSterilization accounts for at least 90 percent of the successes. Intrauterine devices are a distant second, and some pills and condoms are distributed. Many sterilizations are carried out in temporary ''camps'' where critics say unsanitary and impersonal conditions are a deterrent. Cash or other rewards are offered for being sterilized - up to $12.50 per person - but villagers say some people turn up several times to collect them, distorting the statistics.\nSuccessive Indian Governments have recognized the population problem since independence in 1947, when the population was 342 million. In 1966, family planning was given a department of its own within the Ministry of Health, a step some demographers say was a mistake, since it separated population control from the general Government overview of development. In the mid-1970's, the family-planning drive was endowed with coercive powers that were used by supporters of the late Sanjay Gandhi, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's son and adviser and the brother of Rajiv Gandhi, the present Prime Minister. After widespread reports of forced sterilizations, Indians rebelled.\nIn 1977, the country's four most populous states voted heavily against Indira Gandhi on this issue, and the Congress Party suffered its first election defeat. The next Government, under Moraji Desai, erased the words ''family planning'' from the books, renaming the program ''family welfare,'' a name still in use.\nBut Indian experts say it was not only the Sanjay Gandhi program that set back population control. In the 1950's and 60's, the country's priorities were on industrial development, and its limited resources went into huge energy projects, steel mills and the production of consumer goods to replace imports.\n''If we had concentrated more on the software, the human resources element - female literacy, education - in the 1950's and 60's,'' said Sam Pitroda, a science adviser to Rajiv Gandhi, ''we would have a population of about 600 million now.'' A Grave Mistake\nMr. Bose said India made a catastrophic mistake in the 1960's when it accepted Western advice about introducing birth-control technology but didn't put enough effort into education and cultural change. Hundreds of thousands of Lippes loops, an intrauterine device, were inserted and large-scale sterilization began. Dirty equipment and a lack of follow-up advice to women led to rampant infections.\nOver the years, offers of cash and other incentives were introduced for those willing to undergo sterilization, a tactic Mr. Bose calls ''madness.'' Today, 85 percent of sterilizations are done on women, many of whom already have three or four children.\nFinally, Mr. Bose said, bureaucrats were taught to set numerical targets, which over time proved of little use because official figures measuring performance are manipulated to meet the targets.\n''We must move away from cold calculations of aggregate numbers to people,'' Mr. Bose said, arguing for enforcement of a 1978 law prohibiting women below the age of 18 from marrying and a change in emphasis in family planning programs so they will aim more at young married couples as they begin having families.\n''Looking back,'' he said, ''high tech, money and the bureaucracy -all three have failed.''"

On the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, the PEC noted a 56% decrease registering 20 victims in 12 countries from January 1 to April 30 against 46 during the same period last year, using the same metrics. The figure is the lowest figure since 2006.  PEC Secretary-General Blaise Lempen observed the lower intensity of conflict in Syria and Iraq contributed to this decrease. In addition, the continuous engagement of governments, associations and civil society in favor of the issue of the safety of journalists has certainly produced positive effects. It is also true that other means are used to neutralize journalists. The situation remains steadily hostile in Mexico with six journalists killed and Afghanistan with four killed, which adds up to half the victims since the beginning of 2019.  One journalist was killed in the following countries: Ghana, Honduras, India, Iraq, Northern Ireland, Kenya, Libya, Pakistan, the Philippines and Yemen.

It happens at a time when farmers are complaining of shortages of labourers due to the travel restrictions amid the nationwide shutdown enforced to fight the Covid-19 outbreak. Now, Boro harvesting is progressing amid the coronavirus scare and threat of impending flash flood. Teachers, students, political party activists, Village Defence Party members, transport workers, sand-stone workers, shopkeepers, NGO workers, and other professionals joined in the paddy harvesting. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension in Sylhet, around 1.68 lakh people are now involved in harvesting Boro in the division. Of them, over 1 lakh are in Sunamganj alone. Apart from volunteers, a good number of labourers from different districts are coming to the haor region under special arrangements. A team of 42 labourers from Lalmonirhat was sent to the haor region on Thursday, and the district administration already prepared a list of 500 labourers and they would be sent there soon, said Abu Jafor, deputy commissioner of the district. So far, around 6,000 labourers from different districts have gone there under special arrangements, said DAE officials. Abdul Ahad, deputy commissioner of Sunamganj, said, \"Labourers from different districts are coming. We are providing them with food, accommodation and ensuring their health safety as much as possible. We also arranged relief for them. Moreover, we are trying to encourage people from all social classes to take part in the harvesting.\" Arman Hossain, who runs a decorator shop at Gajaria Bazaar in the district's Jamalganj upazila, said, \"Since March 26, my shop has remained closed and it became difficult to survive. As I am a farmer's son, I know how to harvest and joined a team of 42 people to harvest the Boro paddy. We are getting relief, wage, and farmers are also getting help.\"  Around 4,000 VDP members have been working since April 21, said Rafiqul Islam, director of Bangladesh Ansar-VDP's Sylhet range. Ariful Haque, a farmer of Gajaria village in Jamalganj, said, \"I did not have enough money to employ labourers to harvest my paddy, but volunteers arranged by the local union parishad harvested an acre of Boro field without any wage. It helped me a lot.\" Meanwhile, the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) on April 21 issued a circular urging teachers and students to be in assistance of farmers during the harvest and permitting farmers and farm labourers to use schools and colleges. Prof Harunur Rashid, director of DSHE in Sylhet, said, \"We are getting immense responses from teachers and students. We are not sure how many of them are working. We urged all to work maintaining social distancing.\" Like others, leaders and activists of Bangladesh Krishak League, Chhatra League, and other pro-Awami League organisations are working as volunteers. Shamima Akther Khanam, a lawmaker from the reserved seats for women, has been monitoring the paddy harvesting in haor fields since April 14. Shamima, also human resource affairs secretary of Bangladesh Krishak League central committee, said more than 1,000 leaders and activists of the organisation were involved in harvesting the paddy. As people have extended their helping hands and the weather is favourable, 42 percent of Boro paddy in the region have been harvested till Thursday, said Srinibash Debnath, additional director of Department of Agricultural Extension in Sylhet. But farmers are in fear as it rained yesterday morning and Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board earlier issued a warning of flash flood on April 27 or later there. Sunamganj DC Ahad said, \"This year, the cultivation was late due to slow receding of haor water and most farmers cultivated BRRI 29 variety as neck blast disease hit BRRI 28 variety last year, which delayed the harvesting time.\" [Our Lalmonirhat correspondent contributed to this report]"

      "text": "TV REVIEW; 'ADAM SMITH'S MONEY WORLD' ON THE PACIFIC RIM\n1987-05-18T05:00:00.000Z\nASIAN economies now compete with the American economy; we know that already.\nCan ''Adam Smith's Money World'' say anything new about this, even in a five-part series? Perhaps not, but what it can and does do is assemble what we know and then offers fresh insights. The interesting series, ''The Eagle and the Dragons: The U.S. and the Challenge of the Pacific Rim Nations,'' begins on Channel 13 at 8:30 tonight.\nThe eagle is the United States, of course. The dragons are Japan and the newly industrialized countries of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. They make up, Mr. Smith says, the ''most productive manufacturing center in the world.''\nWhat does this mean? The flight of jobs from the United States to the Far East for one thing; a trade deficit for the eagle and a surplus for the dragons for another. In 1986, Japan had a $58 billion trade surplus with the United States. Even tiny Hong Hong, a city-state rather than a sovereign nation, had a surplus of $7 billion.\nNonetheless, the Pacific rim nations are unlikely candidates to challenge the United States economically. They have a scarcity of natural resources, and some of them must import all their food. They do have cheap labor pools, which counts for part of their competitive edge, but other countries have even cheaper labor pools and still are not nearly as productive.\nThe biggest part of the edge, says Mr. Smith, whose real name is George J. W. Goodman, comes from ''Confucian capitalism.'' Along the Pacific rim a free market has joined with 2,500 years of cultural values: hard work, formal education, family continuity. The result, Mr. Smith finds, is a mighty economic engine.\nThe episode tonight is an overview of the series. The next three programs will deal with specific countries; next week, for example, it's Taiwan. The final episode, on June 13, is a look ahead. Who wins and who loses under the new economic rules? Implicit in much of this are questions for American investors. Mutual funds that invest in the Pacific nations, for instance, have flourished.\nWill they continue to flourish? Mr. Smith and his colleagues - Lisa Hsia and John Mernit are the producers -don't get down to crass considerations like that, but they do give investors something to chew on. The Pacific rim nations don't compete only with the United States; they also compete with one another. At the same time, it is likely that they will be challenged by countries with even cheaper labor pools - Sri Lanka, say, or Bangladesh.\nMeanwhile, what about China? China has slowed its move toward a market economy, but what will happen under a new leader? Indeed, the question of political change along the Pacific rim may be the biggest question of all. South Korea has civil unrest. Hong Kong will become part of China in 1997. Taiwan has an aging leadership.\nEven though capitalism has scored a monumental triumph today -Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore notes that the North Vietnamese won the war but went on to lose the peace - what about tomorrow?\nThe series, with Alvin H. Perlmutter as executive producer, explores the question with interviews, graphics and visits to plants and companies along the Pacific rim. The program tonight opens with Mr. Smith outside a factory on Taiwan. (A sign, which he translates, says, ''We will make you anything.'') It concludes with Mr. Smith, cautiously optimistic, saying that now the Asian nations and the United States must ''fix the imbalances.'' The series is off to a nice start."

      "text": "In Bangladesh, Women Can't Go Home Again\n1988-04-17T05:00:00.000Z\nShafia Khatun has made a pioneering journey from rural poverty to a low-paying job in a crowded garment factory, and she may never be able to go home again.\nPart of a small new industry fueled by American imports, she and 200,000 other women have defied Islamic tradition and planted the seeds of a slow social transformation in this nation.\nVillage elders objected to her leaving home to work in the big city, Miss Khatun said in an interview at her tiny dirt-floored rented room. ''It will be difficult for me to live again in my village because I have been in the city earning money,'' she said.\nFor the same reason, and because she cannot afford the traditional wedding payment, her chances of finding a husband have also been reduced, said Miss Khatun, who at the age of 14 is already eligible for marriage.\nThe labor of women like Miss Khatun is a boon to this nation that has relied on exports of animal hides, jute and tea for most of its foreign earnings. Planners here now dare to talk, with guarded hope, of industrialization.\nThe garment boom began here only recently when the United States opened its quotas to Bangladesh while restricting imports from other Asian nations. America now takes in 85 percent of the country's garment exports.\nClothing exports to the United States grew from $45 million in 1984 to more than $300 million last year, making Bangladesh the sixth-largest supplier of apparel to America.\n''This is the cheapest country where you can work,'' said Paolo Tacchinardi, a garment manufacturer from Milan. ''You can pay the workers, the manager and the shipper, and the shirt is still three times less when it arrives in Italy.'' He added: ''You may think that we are wearing things made by women and children. But if we did not come here to give them work, these people would have nothing.''\nRedwan Ahmed, the owner of Saleha Garments Ltd., where Miss Khatun works, said women are essential to his industry.\nBred to subservience, he said, they will work for as little as $13 a month and accept harsh conditions and long hours without complaint.\n''If I appoint 400 men workers, they immediately start making union politics,'' he said. ''Not the women.''\nAnd with the low salaries they are willing to accept, he said, ''You get more workers for less investment.''\nRoushan Jahan, a scholar who has researched the new phenomenon of women workers, said factory owners sometimes lock their doors to keep women at their places for overtime work. She said the women often have too little schooling to compute the wages due them and are frequently shortchanged.\nDeepening poverty and landlessness throughout the country has forced a compromise with cultural norms, said Mrs. Jahan.\nIn traditional Bangladesh, women are in effect the property of their fathers or husbands. They receive less education, less food and poorer health care than their brothers.\nMiss Jahan said women had traditionally worked at home or in the homes of neighbors but that in times of famine or calamity, tradition had been set aside and women had been sent out to help in the fields or to scavenge.\nThe continuing crisis of poverty and overpopulation has now reached a level at which the social norms themselves may be changing, she said. Miss Khatun said her widowed mother had sent her to work because she could no longer afford to feed her.\nWhile some workers manage to send home a part of their earnings, Miss Khatun said she could barely survive on her own and was helping her family simply by feeding herself.\nAt work on her own, she said, she tries to maintain the standards of propriety to which she was bred, although she may already have cut herself off from a respectable future.\nShe said she leaves her home only for the short walk to her workplace and avoids improper comportment.\nAlthough she sometimes allows herself to watch television through the window of a neighbor, she said, she leaves whenever a movie is shown.\n''It is not proper for a young girl to watch a movie,'' she said."

      "text": "High Ground Is a Stranger In Bangladesh\n1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nBangladesh is a nation seemingly founded on unstable footing.\nIts very ground is, by and large, a swarm of islands created and washed away each year as the waggling, monsoon-swollen Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers reach across its vast delta and tumble into the Bay of Bengal.\nIts politics are no more predictable. Two presidents have been assassinated in its 17-year history, and Bangladesh has suffered waves of man-made terror. Terrible natural disasters are too frequent in this nation of 55,126 square miles, about the size of Wisconsin, which is bordered by India and Burma at the bend in the Bay of Bengal.\nThe majority of its population of more than 100 million is crammed onto the islands, most no more than 10 feet above sea level, that speckle the delta. When disaster strikes, there is no high ground upon which to seek refuge. Tidal Waves and Heavy Rains\nIn 1970, a tidal wave killed 300,000 people. In June 1976, heavy rains swept away the homes of 300,000 people and killed at least 143. In April 1977, waves created by a cyclone in the Indian Ocean killed 600 people. In 1980, flooding forced the evacuation of 500,000 people. In 1985, a cyclone killed at least 1,400 and perhaps as many as 10,000.\nAinslie Embree, a South Asia specialist at Columbia University, said, ''Man-made disasters are just as consequent as the natural disasters.''\nEver since the 12th century, when Moslem invaders brought Islam to Bengal, which encompasses Bangladesh and eastern India, there has been religious strife with Hindus. Most Bangladeshis are Moslem, with Hindus making up 14 percent of the population. The Moslem rulers were forced out by the British in the 18th century.\nIn 1947, predominantly Hindu India won independence from Britain and a separate Moslem state, Pakistan, was created in two parts, divided by 1,000 miles of Indian territory. The partition evoked ages-old religious enmity, and massacres ensued. Power Centered in West\nPower in the new Moslem nation was centered in West Pakistan, and by 1968, rioters in the more populous East were demanding autonomy. By 1970, separatists from the East had won a majority in the National Assembly and were pressing for more power. But Assembly sessions were postponed by Agha Yahya Khan, then President, and full-scale civil war erupted. ''Bangladesh suffered greatly during the civil war,'' Dr. Embree said. ''A great many of the intellectuals were killed.''\nDr. Embree said the Pakistani Army killed 100,000 Bangladeshis. With Indian troops invading in support of the separatists, independence was won in December 1971. Then, thousands of Pakistani collaborators were slaughtered.\nOne of the nation's continuing tragedies is the presence on its soil of more than a million people from Bihar State in India. These people, who do not speak Bengali, have remained in refugee camps since independence. ''They want to go to Pakistan, but the Pakistanis won't take them,'' Dr. Embree said. ''They are among the more miserable refugees in the world.'' Demonstrations in November\n''While these people are Moslems, they are regarded as foreigners because they don't speak Bengali,'' he said. ''They also supported the Pakistan Government, and so they are regarded as traitors.''\nAfter the nation gained independence, much of its Hindu population fled to India. ''India claims there were 10 million of them,'' Dr. Embree said.\nSince independence, two presidents have been assassinated, the founder of the nation, Mujibur Rahman, in 1975, and Ziaur Rahman, in 1981.\nLast November, there were major demonstrations against the Government of President H. M. Ershad, who took power in a military coup in March 1982. General Ershad ended martial law in 1986, retired from the army and successfully ran for election.\n''The riots in November just about disrupted the economy completely,'' said Craig Baxter, a professor of South Asian history at Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pa. ''There were strikes, transportation breakdowns, a failure to fulfill international contracts.'' Two Opposition Leaders\nThe demonstrations were led by two principal opposition leaders, Sheik Hasina, the daughter of Mujibur Rahman, and Begum Khaleda Zia, the widow of Ziaur Rahman. President Ershad was re-elected this year after a campaign in which the opposition leaders refused to take part, saying the elections could not be fair.\nAs it has been since its birth, Bangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world, primarily because its economy is based on agriculture. ''Most people live at an agricultural subsistence level,'' Dr. Embree said.\n''Very little industry has been developed,'' he continued, ''and they have very few exports.'' Jute, which is used to make rope and burlap, is Bangladesh's main export. ''But the world market for jute disappeared in recent years because of plastics and man-made fibers,'' Dr. Embree said.\nOf necessity, the people have developed a remarkable style of life, trying to adapt to the water that annually sweeps through the country with the monsoon. Many Bangladeshis live in homes built on earthen platforms of four yards or higher and sow varieties of rice that will grow in deep water."

It said the embassy is surprised to see that Senator Grassley had stated in his op-ed that citizens of Bangladesh live under an authoritarian regime and face persecution for faith and religious beliefs, reports UNB. Bangladesh is a secular democracy, where people from all faiths live in peace and harmony, the embassy said. The statement further said the embassy is extremely disappointed to see that instead of appreciating the democratic government of Bangladesh for sheltering more than 1.1 million Rohingyas from Myanmar, who were persecuted in their own country for their religion and ethnicity, Senator Grassley has opted for complete subjectivity to criticize the government [of Bangladesh] that actually saved their lives. An op-ed, titled \"Religious freedom under attack - US can promote and protect liberty globally,\" by Chuck Grassley, senator for Iowa, appeared on his official website (https://www.grassley.senate.gov/) on Tuesday. The embassy said it expects that Senator Grassley would correct his narrative and his understanding about Bangladesh based on facts and realities on the ground. A few examples of religious freedom and harmony in Bangladesh were also shared. These are as follows: Bangladesh is a country where festivals of major religious communities (Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists) are public holidays, the president of Bangladesh hosts reception for members of each religious community on the day of these festivals and prime minister of Bangladesh promotes a national slogan \"Religion unto individual, festivals unto all.\" People from all faiths celebrate the festivals together, which is truly reflective of the spirit of secularism and non-communalism, added the embassy. Verses from the holy books of all major faiths are recited at the beginning of all important official programs, it said. The embassy said that Senator Grassley is welcome to visit Bangladesh and see for himself the values of democracy, freedom, openness, inclusiveness, and religious harmony that exists in Bangladesh."

      "text": "Frogs' Legs, Hunt to Table\n1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nLEAD: MIDNIGHT, a canal near Alligator Alley in the preserve adjacent to Everglades National Park in southern Florida. The chairman of the Tribal Council of the Seminoles, James E. Billie, perched high above the hull at the controls of the airboat, touched a switch and a beam of light sprang from the band encircling his wide brow.\nMIDNIGHT, a canal near Alligator Alley in the preserve adjacent to Everglades National Park in southern Florida. The chairman of the Tribal Council of the Seminoles, James E. Billie, perched high above the hull at the controls of the airboat, touched a switch and a beam of light sprang from the band encircling his wide brow. He pointed a visitor into a seat in the prow. An airplane engine and propeller contained in concentric steel circles eight feet in diameter formed an imposing backdrop.\n''Hang on and don't let go,'' he warned. In seconds the boat was skimming across the tar-black channel at 45 miles an hour, past literally hundreds of gold-gleaming alligator eyes. Negotiating narrow sloughs, accelerating over sawgrass hummocks, gliding through shallow water, stopping on a dime: Mr. Billie's reputation as an ace pilot of both watercraft and aircraft was not exaggerated. Nor was his skill as a frog catcher.\nZooming alongside each tiny prey, discernible only by the emerald of its eyes, Mr. Billie plucked it from the canal with a flick of the wrist, unerringly pinioning it with a long four-pronged pole, a gig, the frogger's traditional tool.\nFrog hunting is becoming rare in the Everglades, a vanishing wetland that represents the last bastion of the Florida panther (population less than 50) and other endangered species, along with the Seminole Indians (population 1,700), the Independent Seminole (50 to 75 people) and Miccosukee Indians (300).\n''No one can really make a living catching frogs any more,'' Mr. Billie said. ''This is still the only way to get them, one at a time in the middle of the night. It takes too much time and energy and isn't well paid.'' The primary domestic source of edible frogs is the Everglades, but most of the legs consumed in America are imported.\nBeginning in the 1940's real-estate developers, citrus growers, cattle ranchers and produce farmers encouraged the diking and draining of most of Florida's frog country, according to Foster Crippen, owner of the Frogleg Ranch, the major Florida supplier of frogs' legs. ''Compared to cattlemen - sales, profits, net worth - froggers are nothin','' he said.\n''That's the truth. And compared to real estate, we're double nothin'.''\nFrom November through February, when water levels are up in the Southeast, the Frogleg Ranch ships 500 to 2,000 pounds of legs a day, primarily to restaurants in Florida, though some also go to Louisiana, Illinois, Texas, New York, Michigan and California. Frogs' legs are sold in nine sizes, ranging from a hefty two pairs per pound to a minuscule 25, which, Mr. Crippen said, go to Detroit to be deep-fried, bones and all, for sandwiches. In the off-season he ships 100 to 300 pounds a day.\nIf these numbers sound substantial, consider that in the 1930's there were 23 frog farms in southern Florida.\n''And I guess we'll be the last, since we're the only one left,'' said Mr. Crippen, who has been in the business for close to 25 years.\nDr. Dudley Culley, a professor of fisheries at the School of Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries at Louisiana State University and the author of numerous works on frog farming, said little chance of cultivation exists in the United States, mainly because pesticides have reduced the number of insects, frogs' primary food.\n''Add to that the fact that they are extremely vulnerable to many diseases and that they require live food,'' Dr. Culley said. The situation, however, is not hopeless. Dr. Culley noted: ''Frog people are strange. We get hung up on frogs and can't stop.'' One such dauntless frog person is Bill Seefeldt, owner of Life Cycles Research Company. At his 10-acre ranch in Dade County, Fla., Mr. Seefeldt, a self-taught ''practical geneticist with endless curiosity, not a marketing man,'' raises fish, frogs, turtles, geese, plants, insects and more. Frogs, however, are his true love. ''My first pet in school was a tadpole,'' he explained.\n''Because frogs in captivity present so many breeding problems,'' he continued, ''95 percent of eating frogs are caught in the wild - in Africa, India, Bangladesh, China or the United States.''\nThe Federal Government does not collect any statistics on domestic frog production or consumption. The only figures it collects are on imports. Most of the frog-eating world (West Germany and France are foremost consumers) prefers bullfrogs, but these don't last in the Everglades.\n''They're territorial,'' Mr. Seefeldt explained. ''They just sit and croak in one spot even if it takes a year to find a mate, which makes them perfect edible targets. And they're poorly designed aerodynamically. They have these fat faces. Alligators and snakes nail 'em in a millisecond.'' Through unscientific tastings, Mr. Seefeldt has determined that many Americans love frog meat - it's the idea of the feet they can't stand. So over the last 15 years he has developed a species of meaty, farm-raised albino bullfrogs with small heads and long legs. Mr. Seefeldt plans to have them ready for market by 1990.\nDiners who think of frogs' legs as a specialty of fine French restaurants may be surprised to find that in the Florida national park area they appear in many restaurants that are cozy, down-home, gas-station simple - or just plain ratty. Generally deep-fried, the mild-tasting meat may appear as the ''Everglades Special'' or ''Jumper Plate'' - as at the Coopertown Restaurant, where locals and tourists drop in. More a shack with a lunch counter and tables than a restaurant, the place was built in 1945 at the edge of Highway 41 (the Tamiami Trail), a hot, flat strip where turkey buzzards circle overhead.\nSally Kennon, the owner and cook, receives fresh frogs' legs early each day from her regular froggers. She coats the legs with eggs blended with what she calls her ''secret seasoning mix,'' dips them in bread crumbs, fries them until they turn crunchy, and serves them from 8 A.M. until dark at $6.95 a plate.Nearby, the Miccosukee Village\nRestaurant, an airy coffee shop, features an Everglades Frog Legs Dinner ($10.95) in which the legs are coated in plain flour and fried.\nBy contrast, only a few luxurious restaurants in Miami Beach, Boca Raton and other south Florida cities serve frogs' legs, usually in the classic French style with garlic, or with a few contemporary twists. The Down Under in Fort Lauderdale, for example, for $18 offers a choice of frogs' legs with mushrooms and green peppercorns; with buttery basil sauce atop tomato linguine, or poached, boned, chilled and arrayed on a salad of barley, cucumbers and tomatoes with lemon and cilantro.\nIf the small size of the domestic frog harvest is a problem, importing frogs' legs is an unpredictable business at best, since sources, supplies and prices vary dramatically from season to season. Of the 1,389,734 pounds of fresh, chilled and frozen frogs' legs imported into the United States from January though May this year, 1,261,596 pounds came from Bangladesh. The remainder, in order of volume, came from reshippers in the Netherlands, and from India, Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.On July 7, however, The Journal of\nCommerce reported that ''Bangladesh, which supplied 76 percent of the delicacy consumed in the United States last year, has joined India and China to ban frog leg exports for the next three years.'' The ban was instituted in May because the Bangladesh insect population had exploded after large numbers of frogs were killed for their legs. Insecticides are costly, as well as toxic to the remaining frogs. Moreover, as nations industrialize, few workers are willing to undertake the laborious job of hunting frogs in the dark for little money.\nDr. Culley of Louisiana State University said he had assisted in the recent establishment of a frog farm in Belem, Brazil that raised 700,000 bullfrogs in 1987. But since frogs' legs are popular among Brazilians, ''There isn't much incentive for the Brazilians to send the frogs out of the country,'' Dr. Culley said. He also noted that the market for frogs to be used in research is more profitable than that for frogs' legs.\nAlthough frozen frogs' legs are still being shipped from warehouses in Bangladesh, they are in short supply.\nPrices have risen, but may not go higher, since the demand in this country is not enough to support such an increase. Those who are fond of frogs' legs, it seems, must either stock up, visit Europe, Asia or the Everglades, or prepare for a dry spell. Fried Frogs' Legs (Adapted from the Miccosukee Village Restaurant) Preparation time: 5 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes 1 cup vegetable oil 1 cup self-rising flour 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste 1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper, or to taste 1 cup milk 16 pairs frogs' legs, about 2 ounces each. \n1.Heat the oil in a wide skillet or electric skillet to 375 degrees. \n2.Blend together the flour, salt and red pepper in a shallow bowl. Place the milk in a large bowl. Rinse the frogs' legs in water and dry them. Dip into milk, then into flour to coat rather heavily. Place on wax paper. \n3.Slip eight pairs of frogs' legs into the hot oil. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes longer. \n4.Transfer to a baking sheet covered with paper towels. Set in a very low oven. Dip, coat and fry the remaining legs. \nYield: 4 servings. Frogs' Legs With Mushrooms, White Wine and Green Peppercorns (Adapted from the Down Under) Preparation time: 1 hour soaking, plus 10 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes 8 pairs frogs' legs, about 2 to 3 ounces each 1/2 cup milk 2 tablespoons oil 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 pound mushrooms, cut in slices 1/4-inch thick Salt and pepper to taste 2 tablespoons flour mixed with 1/2 teaspoon coarse kosher salt 1 teaspoon drained green peppercorns, crushed with knife blade Y cup dry white wine 1 tablespoon lemon juice. \n1.Soak the frogs' legs in milk 1 hour or more, refrigerated. \n2.Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in an 11-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat. Add mushrooms and toss over high heat until golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate; add salt and pepper. \n3.Drain and dry the legs thoroughly. Toss four pairs at a time in a paper bag with the flour and salt, until coated well. Tap off the excess. Repeat with the remaining legs. \n4.Add the remaining butter and oil to the pan and melt over moderate heat. Add the frogs' legs (they should fit easily in one layer; if not, divide into two batches). Brown on both sides over moderate heat, 5 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a serving dish in a warm oven. \n5.Pour any fat from the pan. Add the peppercorns, wine and lemon juice to the pan. Bring to a boil, stirring. Boil until a bit syrupy, or reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Add the mushrooms and toss to heat through. Pour over the legs and serve hot. \nYield: 2 servings. FINDING THEM \nFROGS' legs vary widely in size. For most recipes, allow four pairs of legs, 1 1/2 to 2 ounces each, per serving. Because of the size variation, cooking times may have to be adjusted. For deep-frying, the legs need to swim freely in the oil, which means making adjustments there too.\nAlthough supplies of frogs' legs vary, the stores listed here, all in New York City, report that they often have them. If the legs are frozen, as is usually the case, defrost them in the refrigerator for about 48 hours before rinsing, drying and cooking.\nPisacane Midtown Corporation, 940 First Avenue, between 51st and 52d Streets, telephone 212-355-1850, $7 per pound.\nCatalano's Fresh Fish, 1652 Second Avenue, near 85th Street, 212-628-9608, $8.99 per pound.\nFulton Market Retail Store, 11 Fulton Street, between Front and Beekman Streets, 212-608-2920, $6.95 per pound.\nHung Fish Market, 93 Mulberry Street, off Canal Street, 212-608-1022, sells frogs' legs only on special orders at $24 per 5-pound box.\nDe Martino, 821 Ninth Avenue, between 54th and 55th Streets, 212-265-3813, $5.99 per pound.\nBalducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas, between Ninth and 10th Streets, 212-673-2600, $11.99 per pound."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-24 00:00:00      \nRajuk is set to turn land originally earmarked for education and environment preservation into commercial and business plots in its 6,227-acre Purbachal New Town project in the city's outskirts. Since it launched the scheme in 1995, between Kaliganj and Rupganj with the Shitalakkhya to the east and the Balu to the west, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) has so far altered the layout plan five times.   According to documents produced before the High Court to get the fifth layout revision endorsed, Rajuk intends to reduce 269 acres dedicated to 157 educational institutions to 119 acres.   The 150 acres gained from the reduction will be used to create more plots -- residential, commercial, and for more institutional plots that include schools, colleges, universities, hospitals, clinics and clubs. Rajuk insiders said that the existing institutional plots have been split to increase the number of plots and to allot them to more applicants.  \"In this process, some indispensable standard characters and features of an institutional plot have been compromised, capacity was reduced and future higher population density was ignored,\" said an urban planner requesting anonymity. As an instance, it could be seen that instead of institutes having their own playgrounds, as needed, they would now have to share common neighbourhood playgrounds. Rajuk also intends to create 75 more residential plots reducing 49 acres, kept aside for nursery schools, down to 22 acres. The commercial and residential plots are being created to accommodate wealthy, influential, and politically connected people, said sources in Rajuk who wished to be unnamed. Rajuk wants to reduce the space for community centres by five acres and take extra 22 acres from land earmarked as administrative areas. Rajuk is doing this so that it could have an additional 65 acres for commercial plots and 19 acres more for shops, markets, and kitchen markets. As per the proposed fifth revised layout, they have already allotted 110 acres for a 142-storey iconic commercial tower, for which no land was earmarked in the fourth revision. After Rajuk sought endorsement of the fifth revision, the HC, in an order issued in January, observed that the proposed conversion of a huge quantity of land was \"by way of a smart trick\" by \"rearranging\" and \"compromising\" playgrounds of educational institutions.                 Apart from the iconic tower, the HC declined to approve other alterations. Meanwhile, the project cost increased by 135 percent. NOT PLAYING BY THE RULES? Following a public interest litigation in 2013, the HC in March the following year endorsed Rajuk's fourth revision of the plan. It directed Rajuk not to \"efface, subtract, vary or modify the forest, lakes, canals, urban green, parks, playgrounds\", as shown in the fourth revised layout plan, without the court's permission. But there has been widespread allegation that Rajuk in mid-September last year secretly allotted 84 institutional plots taking land from areas earmarked for schools and their playgrounds, violating the 2014 HC judgment. Even though Rajuk usually publishes the list of such plot allotments on its official website, in this case it did not make the list public even after six months. When asked, Project Director Ujwal Mallick said he did not know anything about altering the project layout plans or creation of new plots. He directed the correspondent towards Sheikh Shahinul Islam, Rajuk director for estate and land. Asked over the phone about the allotment of 84 plots, Shahinul on March 4 asked this correspondent to meet him face-to-face. When the correspondent met him that very day, he said, \"I cannot talk about this issue, the Rajuk chairman can. I just wanted to be acquainted to you.\" When The Daily Star correspondent spoke to Rajuk Chairman Md Abdur Rahman on March 10, he said, \"I can't say why the layout had to be revised five times. \"According to the government's education curriculum, we have to reduce the number of nursery schools.\" About the rationale for reducing educational plots and playgrounds and increasing commercial land, the chairman said, \"I need to know in details to respond.\" He said the fourth revised layout plan had 263 institutional plots, of which they had allotted 197, including the latest 84, with the remaining yet to be allotted. Asked why they did not make public the list of allotment of 84 institutional plots, he said he had just heard from this correspondent that it was not published. When asked for the list, he said, \"I have to think about it.\" Later in the day, the chairman said the list had been uploaded on Rajuk's official website. This correspondent, however, could not find it even yesterday and he informed the chairman of the matter. Abdur Rahman had earlier told The Daily Star that Rajuk would not implement the fifth revision of the layout but yesterday he said Rajuk would appeal to the HC in a day or two to have the revision endorsed. The Rajuk chairman said the Rajuk chief architect, who went into retirement around a year ago, had agreed to all the revisions and creation of new plots. Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela), said Rajuk had argued before the court that they had allotted all available plots and the court should endorse the fourth revised layout plan. She said if they had adhered to the fourth revised plan in allotting the 84 controversial plots, then why do they want a fifth amendment? Rizwana also wondered why the list of allotment was not made public. To understand the extent of environmental damage caused in the process of executing the scheme, one must note that Rajuk had to pay more compensation for trees and forests than what it had to pay for land acquisition, said Rizwana. Bela in 2015 filed an appeal opposing the 2014 HC judgment, which endorsed the fourth revision of the layout. Bela argued that implementation of the fourth revision would imply felling of 11 lakh trees. The Appellate Division in a February 2017 order observed that \"Rajuk had been implementing Purbachal scheme by felling trees and filling up canals and this sort of work should not be allowed to continue\".  The court directed Rajuk to obtain environmental clearance to implement the scheme. The court also observed that rampant felling of trees and indiscriminate filling up of various water bodies would certainly threaten the ecosystem and biodiversity of the project areas. Khondaker M Ansar Hossain, an urban planner who worked as a technical expert on Dhaka city's Detailed Area Plan, said the entire area where Purbachal was being developed was originally comprised of extensive flood flow zones, rural homesteads, arable land, and forests. Dhaka's master plan forbids execution of this scheme because only rural homesteads could be there, he said. Still, the Purbachal scheme went ahead showing it as \"overlay\", meaning an entity already existing, but actually execution of the scheme took place after the Detailed Area Plan was made. Rajuk launched the scheme branding it as a model, self-contained, smart and largest planned township in the country."

      "text": "1,100 Held as Bangladesh Bans Protest in Capital\n1987-11-10T05:00:00.000Z\nBangladesh outlawed public demonstrations in the capital today and said more than 1,100 people had been arrested for political activities. The arrests were made to thwart a huge anti-Government protest scheduled for Tuesday.\nThousands of riot police officers and paramilitary troops also spread through the city. They broke up one demonstration at Dhaka University, where scuffling led to a minor leg injury for a prominent opposition leader, Khaleda Zia Rahman. She is the widow of President Ziaur Rahman, who wasassassinated in 1981.\nIn addition, Dhaka University was closed, while opposition leaders said that almost all bus, rail and even ferryboat service into the capital had been halted to stop protesters from taking part in what they have termed a siege to force the resignation of President H. M. Ershad. 'Prejudicial Activities' Cited\nOpposition leaders put the number of those arrested at more than 5,000, but Government officials asserted tonight that it was 1,146, including five members of Parliament elected last year. The Home Minister, Mohammed Abdul Matin, said that those arrested were people who the police felt were ''likely to do the prejudicial activities'' on Tuesday.\nThere was no indication how long they would be held, but some officials said they would probably be released once the current round of street protests subsides.\nThe action today marked the culmination of growing protests since last summer against Mr. Ershad, a former Army chief of staff who seized power in a 1982 military coup. Mr. Ershad was elected President last year, but there were widespread accusations of fraud in the voting. The protest activity reached a peak in July but was interrupted when the country was hit by severe floods. More than a thousand people died in the floods, and although Mr. Ershad had lifted martial law, the Army was in charge of relief efforts. Relief Effort Is Faulted\nThe opposition asserts that the Government was slow in its response to the flood, and politicians say the opposition hopes to use this issue to galvanize its protest. But Western diplomats said that members of international aid organizations had been generally impressed with the distribution of food, medicine and other assistance.\nPolitical experts also note that, in a rare display of unity, virtually all the opposition parties, from Communists to Moslem fundamentalists, are united behind the current protest. Most significant, Mrs. Zia has reached an agreement, albeit only temporary, to support the protest with her archrival, Sheik Hasina Wajed, who is the daugher of Bangladesh's founding President, Sheik Mujibur Rahman, who was himself assassinated in 1975. Unrest Since Independence\nBangladesh, one of the world's poorest and most densely populated countries, has been rocked by unrest since it broke from Pakistan and became an independent nation in 1971. Since then, besides the two assassinations, there have been three military coups and many more coup attempts.\nBut in the last few years, Mr. Ershad has brought a measure of stability and managed to preside over a time of some growth in the economy and in foreign investment. Nevertheless, he is today beset by rising charges of corruption, and many diplomats and politicians say he has grown increasingly unpopular, especially in the capital.\nPolitical experts said today they doubted the opposition could force the removal of Mr. Ershad, since it appeared that the Government crackdown had succeeded in putting the anti-government forces on the defensive.\nFor example, although opposition leaders had earlier said they hoped two million people would join the protest, today they predicted the number would be in the tens of thousands. A few preliminary demonstrations have been small and scattered."

As part of the demonstration, the Uber riders also staged a sit-in procession in the afternoon. The agitating riders alleged that the ride-sharing company suddenly decided to trim its base fare from Tk 30 to Tk 25 and per kilometer fare from Tk 12 to Tk 10. During the demonstration, which continued for around two hours from 11am in front of the Uber office, the aggrieved riders chanted slogans against the fare-cut and asked the authorities concerned to withdraw the decision. Md Russel, an Uber rider, told the Dhaka Tribune that the Uber authorities suddenly reduced the base fare by Tk 5 and kilometre fare by Tk 2. \"When we approached the local office about the reduction, they said that they have nothing to do as it was decided centrally,\" said the Uber rider. Threatening to go on tougher movement if the decision is not repelled, the riders said they would boycott the ride-sharing platform, if necessary.   The Uber riders announced to stage demonstrations in the Agrabad area on Wednesday.      At present, around 15,000 Uber riders are operating the port city."

As part of routine road maintenance work of Roads and Highways Department (RHD) the 21 km road is repaired every year. But locals blamed low quality materials used in the repair work for the road's present condition.   Hundreds of people in Kalmakanda upazila use the road to reach Netrakona and Mymensingh, but the dilapidated condition of the road makes their journey extremely painful. Especially critical patients are the worst sufferers due to the bad condition of the road. AKM Hadisuzzaman Hadi, chairman of Borokhapon Union Parishad (UP), said the carpeting of many parts of the road wore off, resulting in several potholes. Despite the condition, people of the area are using the road as they have no alternative to reach Netrakona town, he said. In emergency cases, people of Kalmakanda use Durgapur-Jaria road as an alternative way to go to Mymensingh and due to this, they have to spend more time which made their journey very painful, said the chairman. Suruj Ali Fakir, former chairman of Roypur UP, said as the road lies in a low-lying area, it gets flooded by the onrush of hill waters from across the border. Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Zakir Hossain said the road needs immediate repair to ease people's sufferings and he has already informed the authorities concerned about the matter. Netrakona RHD Executive Engineer Md Didarul Alam said different parts of the road were washed away by flood in 2017. \"We need Tk 21 lakh for maintenance of the road every year but we do not get the required money from the department,\" said the engineer."

      "text": "IN THE NATION; Reality at the Summit\n1989-07-14T05:00:00.000Z\nThe earth's capacity to support a rapidly expanding population is declining ominously. So the $2.25 billion Japan is offering the third world for environmental purposes is too little and dangerously near too late.\nNevertheless, Japan's proposal might point the Paris economic summit meeting in the right direction -toward environmental and population dangers that threaten humanity's well-being more certainly than nuclear war.\nThe rest of the more than $40 billion Japan offers in grants and loans to aid economic development, for example, will be largely wasted if current population trends continue. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt made the point succinctly to Alan Riding of The New York Times:\n''We [ Egyptians ] increase by about one million and a half every year. It threatens to choke all our efforts in all fields and quashes all hope of growth, production and development.''\nEgypt's plight is an old but still shocking story in the third world. Mr. Riding detailed it: a 2.7 percent annual population growth rate, a declining death rate, 53 million people now dependent on the 4 percent of Egyptian land that's arable.\nIf Mr. Mubarak's projection is correct, that will be something like 70 million people by the end of this century (only 11 years from now); and the amount of Egyptian land available to produce food will have declined further as an expanding populace absorbs it for dwellings and businesses.\nEgypt's problem, except for its restricted strip of productive land along the Nile, is by no means the world's worst. Over all, the global population - which doubled from 2.5 to 5 billion between 1950 and 1987 - is expected to expand by another billion mouths to be fed by the year 2000.\nIt took more than a century for world population to double from 1.25 billion to 2.5 billion in 1950. So the extraordinary ''momentum of population growth'' achieved in recent decades ''ensures that human numbers cannot start to decline as a result of reduced fertility in less than half a century'' from now. That's the conclusion of ''Global Change and Carrying Capacity,'' a paper by Paul R. Ehrlich and associates of the Stanford University Institute for Population and Resource Studies.\nThe combination of continued population growth and the threatened ''global warming'' - an average worldwide temperature rise of 3 to 4 degrees Centigrade - is viewed in the institute study as drastically increasing the possibility of inadeqate food supplies in coming decades. A decrease in water availability for major grain-growing areas, limiting harvests, is one obvious consequence of changes in climate that are projected to occur more swiftly than ever in recorded history.\nShifting climate belts will require adjustments in irrigation and drainage systems, at a possible cost of $200 billion worldwide. Planting drought-resistant grains will result in reduced yields, in some cases less than half that of the usual yield of corn. Northward migration of favorable temperature/rainfall belts will shift grain production to areas of Canada and the Soviet Union where harvests will be constrained by thin and infertile soils.\nAlready, the world's arable land is declining each year by an area the size of Colorado - forcing those who once tilled it to move into urban slums or to use up other marginal or forested land. This process accelerates with population growth; and deforestation caused by growing numbers of people who cut down trees for fuel or building supplies, or to clear land for farming, in turn causes erosion, drought and higher temperatures.\nThe institute report quotes authorities who believe ''recent catastrophic flooding in Bangladesh can be attributed in part to massive deforestation in the Himalayas, a phenomenon closely tied to population growth.''\nThe current loss of food-producing areas will increase with global warming because of the consequent sea-level rise expected to reach 1.4 to 2.2 meters by the end of the next century. This will flood agricultural land and wetlands that support fisheries (much of the Florida Everglades will be lost), salinize water aquifers, and make large areas vulnerable to storm damage.\nThe food problems resulting from global warming are ''acute,'' the institute paper warns, ''since leaders in the rich nations have largely failed to realize the magnitude of the changes necessary if the warming is to be sufficiently slowed.''\nThose leaders are meeting in Paris. What else do they have to talk about that's half as threatening or immediate?"

The explosion occurred in the ground floor of a four-storied building, where the hotel was situated, around 2:30am on Sunday. Among the injured, 13 were taken to the burn unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) for treatment and the remaining were provided first-aid at Tairunnessa Memorial Medical College and Hospital, Gazipur Fire Service and Civil Defence Deputy Assistant Director Abdullah Al Mamun told Dhaka Tribune. Being informed of the blast, three units of Tongi Fire Service arrived at the scene. However, before their arrival, locals rescued the injured and took them to the hospital. Mamun said the explosion destroyed parts of the Banglar Radhuni Hotel and its adjoining Tripti Hotel, injuring at least 17 people at the restaurants. The nearby IFIC Bank suffered the most damage from the blast. Gazipur Deputy Commissioner SM Tarikul Islam told reporters that a five-member probe committee, including members from fire service, district police and administration, was formed to investigate the cause of the blast and to assess the damages caused. Officials also confirmed that the injured are mostly staff and a few customers of the restaurants. However, it was unclear what triggered the explosion, Deputy Assistant Director Abdullah Al Mamun added."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-18 00:00:00      \n'All the dairy farmers in the district will turn paupers if this situation continues' Hundreds of dairy farmers in Satkhira are counting huge losses as they are forced to dump over 50,000 litres milk every day for lack of demand at every level amid the virtual lockdown in the country after the coronavirus breakout. As the dairy farmers have no alternative source of income, particularly after this pandemic, farm owners in the district are even failing to arrange feed for their cattle. President of Tala Milk Production Samity Dibas Chandra Ghosh said around 1,000 dairy farms in the district, including 400 at Jiala Nalta village and 50 farms in Athari village in Tala upazila, produce over 50,000 litres of milk every day. \"All the dairy farmers in the district will turn paupers if this situation continues...the milk dumping must be stopped as soon as possible for their survival,\" he said. Local dairy farm owners said Milk Vita used to collect 8,000 litres milk while Akij Group 600 litres from them and they used to supply the rest of the milk to different sweet-making factories in Satkhira and Khulna. As soon as the pandemic broke out, all the sweetmeat shops and factories were either shut or cut production, forcing the dairy farm owners to sell milk at Tk10 per litres only, they added. Amid the deteriorating scenario, dairy farmers have sought government help just to survive.  Tala Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Iqbal Hossain said they have already brought it to the notice of the higher authorities concerned. Asked about the dire state of the dairy sector in the district, Deputy Commissioner SM Mostafa Kamal said they have decided to purchase milk through Milk Vita from the farm owners with the fund allotted by the Prime Minister for children's food. He also informed that he personally urged the Chairman of Milk Vita to collect milk from the district for producing food for babies and children. Meanwhile, the district administration has decided to keep the sweetmeat shops in the district open by maintaining social distancing, the DC said hoping that it will reduce the loss of the dairy farmers. Fisheries and Livestock Minister SM Rezaul Karim has recently assured that the government would provide all kinds of support to continue the production of fish, meat, milk and eggs during the coronavirus pandemic. He came up with the assurance in a video message prepared by the Ministry's Livestock and Dairy Development Project to create awareness among people. The minister urged all to keep milk, egg, fish and meat in their menu as that help boost the immunity of people."

Due to the cold wave that has been sweeping across Bangladesh for over a week, there has been a rise in pneumonia and cold-induced diarrhoea infection in the hill district,  particularly in the rural areas.  Confirming the death toll, Dr Rajendra Tripura, paediatric specialist at Khagrachhari Sadar Hospital, said the hospital had received many patients whose health had deteriorated because of primary treatment being neglected.  Newborns and children are the worst sufferers of cold-related diseases - pneumonia and diarrhoea - in the district, hospital sources said. Most of these children are aged between 6 and 18 months.  Children with severe cases of pneumonia have been getting admitted to the hospital. Many of them are in critical condition.  The hospital staff are overwhelmed with the growing number of patients coming in, sources have said.  Dr Nayanmoy Tripura, resident doctor at Khagrachhari Sadar Hospital, said at least 1,200 people had been treated for pneumonia and diarrhoea in the hospital since the advent of winter.  Medical professionals have advised local citizens, especially guardians of children, not to panic and instead arrange proper medical care in time.  Moulvibazar tea workers suffer in bitter cold A bitterly cold weather has gripped the seven upazilas of Moulvibazar, making life miserable for tea workers, especially the elderly and children. Due to dense fog, the sun remains invisible for most of the day in Sreemangal and Kamalganj.  \"The bitter cold leaves us shivering even inside the house,\" said Koloti Ghatuar, an elderly woman working at Kurma tea garden, beside the Dhalai River. The temperature was recorded at 11 degrees Celsius in Sreemangal on Tuesday, said Anisur Rahman, assistant meteorologist at the local met office. Dr Zakir Hosain, resident medical officer at Kulaura Upazila Health Complex, said the number of patients suffering from cold-related diseases had increased in the last few days.  Workers of Harincherra tea garden went to the local union parishad office for warm clothes, but did not get any help, said Swapan Nayek, a Sreemangal resident. The impoverished people of the tea garden areas are the worst sufferers as they can hardly afford any warm clothes, according to Rajghat Union Parishad Chairman Bijoy Benarjee. Around 400,000 workers of 92 tea gardens in the district are suffering, yet they have not received any help from the tea garden owners, complained Makhon Lal Karmakar, president of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union.  But Bangladesh Cha Sangsad Vice-Chairman Shafwan Chowdhury said tea garden owners had provided support to tea workers this winter, though on a limited scale. District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Ashraf Ali said the authorities had distributed Tk10 lakh and 43,200 blankets among cold-stricken people in the district, and allotted Tk2 lakh to help the poor buy winter clothes for children."

Acres of low-lying areas of several villages, fish enclosures, and streets became waterlogged as the flood embankments were destroyed by the storm on Wednesday night, said Sharankhola UNO Sarder Mostafa Shahin.  More than 500 fish enclosures were submerged, locals said, and they fear an untimely flood through the damaged embankments due to the high tidal waves.

Bangladesh's Mushfiqur Rahim and Tamim Iqbal, two of those who were witness to the incident, took to twitter to express their mental state. Other legends, like Virat Kohli, Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Akhtar joined the condemnation of such a heinous attack while breathing a sigh of relief at the safety of the Bangladesh team. Bangladesh batsman Tamim Iqbal was distraught as he was one of the players who were on their way to the Masjid AL Noor -- one of the mosques where the shooting took place. He wrote in his official twitter handle @TamimOfficial28: \"Entire team got saved from active shooters!!! Frightening experience and please keep us in your prayers.\" Wicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim wrote in his twitter handle @mushfiqur15: \"Alhamdulillah Allah saved us today while shooting in Christchurch in the mosque...we r extremely lucky...never want to see this things happen again....pray for us.\" Bangladesh team's performance analyst Srinivas Chandrasekaran described his experience @chinu1501: \"Just escaped active shooters!!!

His official twitter account @Sah75official said: \"I have nothing to say about the active shooting in New Zealand that took place all I want to say is I'm grateful to almighty Allah for saving my brothers my teammates! Alhamdulillah.\" Pakistani legend Shahid Afridi spoke to Tamim over phone after the incident, enquiring about the team's safety. The popular all-rounder later posted this tweet @SAfridiOfficial: \"Horrifying tragedy #Christchurch. I found NZ one of the safest, most peaceful places, people are friendly. Spoke to Tamim big relief Bangladesh squad/staff is safe. World must together! stop hatred! Terrorism has no religion! Prayers for bereaved families.

International Cricket Council (ICC) praised the decision to cancel the Test. ICC CEO David Richardson was quoted in a press release: \"Our thoughts and sincere condolences go out to the families and friends of those affected by this horrendous incident in Christchurch. Both teams, staff and match officials are safe and the ICC fully supports the decision to cancel the Test match.\""

According to international law, Nepal is entitled to one transit point. India has kept open four transit points on the India-Nepal border. No consignments are held up or awaiting clearance.\nYou write that Representative Durbin was ''disturbed'' after visiting the region and has asked Congress to urge India to reopen the border. We understand that Mr. Durbin visited Nepal, Bangladesh and India in January-February, almost two months before the treaties lapsed. Your report is to that extent not correct. The India-Nepal border is not closed. Only the transit trade crossings have been decreased in number.\nIt is highly unfair on your part to attribute the current trade and transit dispute between India and Nepal to Nepal's relations with third countries. When bilateral treaties lapse, they are renegotiated bilaterally. You may like to note that India has unilaterally offered to Nepal essential commodities for purchase - such as sugar, baby food, medicines, coal, etc. - which demonstrates a degree of magnanimity on the part of India, not the characteristics of a ''bully.'' Total availability of such products in Nepal will depend upon the volume and value for which contracts are signed by Nepal and the Nepalese parties, and not merely upon the number of transit points.

      "text": "Another Face Of Argentina\n1987-11-08T05:00:00.000Z\nARGENTINA is a lot more than Buenos Aires, its cosmopolitan capital. Its million square miles stretch from the Tropic of Capricorn almost to the Antarctic, and from the Atlantic deep into the Andes. The two-hour air journey from Buenos Aires to Salta, where the mountains meet the tropics, is a voyage into a different geography, climate and culture.\nSalta is mountainous, dry and distinctly Latin American, with highland scenery and colonial architecture similar to that of Bolivia and Peru. But there are advantages to being in Argentina, including easier transportation and the absence of guerrilla war. Internal army discontent aside, Argentina is, at long last, enjoying civil peace, and Salta is where many Argentines go to enjoy it.\nThe resemblance to Peru and Bolivia has a solid historical basis. The Spaniards who colonized Argentina came from two directions - the mountains and the sea.\nBuenos Aires, the great port and focal point of modern Argentine history, had to fight for its dominance against the colonial towns of the interior. These began as trading satellites of the mineral-rich colonies to the west. Lima, not Buenos Aires, was the region's administrative capital until the late 18th century.\nThe city of Salta, founded in 1582, is the capital of a sprawling province that borders Chile, Bolivia and Paraguay. Just east of the high, stark wall of the Andean precordillera, it is the first major town on the Argentine side. Salta nestles like a jewel among the mountains. Even with a population close to 300,000, it remains largely unspoiled. Church steeples and low-rise buildings provide an ideal foil for nature's own monumental scale.\nBuenos Aires nourishes the illusion that Argentines are Europe's lost tribe, accidentally attached to an Indo-Hispanic continent. Salta, with its colonial churches and plazas, belies that myth.\nThe Bolivian presence is tangible, carried by the immigrants who have streamed across the frontier in pursuit of higher wages. They have brought with them such aspects of Indian culture as the music of the altiplano and the addictive habit of chewing raw coca leaves. Aymara is the second language of the shoeshine boys in the town center.\nArgentine Saltenos have their own traditional music, known as zamba. Accompanied by guitar and the accordion-like bandoleon, it sounds zippier and less doleful than the tangos of Buenos Aires. It bears a distant kinship to the country and western melodies of the United States, which makes sense when you note the giant cactus plants, ranches and tobacco farms that dot the region.\nSalta's independent-mindedness carries even to banknotes. Use a large bill and your change may contain ''bonos,'' technically short-term bonds for the cancellation of provincial debt. They are really Salta's own money, denominated in the Argentine national currency. This isn't supposed to happen in a federal republic, especially one under the eye of the International Monetary Fund. But it is winked at because it suits everyone's convenience.\nThe city of Salta is laid out on a grid on flat land nearly 4,000 feet above sea level. Its attractions include fine examples of religious, civic and residential architecture dating back to the colonial epoch. The provincial tourist office, at Buenos Aires 93, in the town center, has helpful material and advice for planning city walking tours and more ambitious excursions into the countryside.\nNear the center of town are an impressive pair of religious structures: the soaring Church of San Francisco, with its dramatic 150-foot tiered and columned redwood steeple, one of the tallest in South America, and the quietly impressive San Bernardo Convent, its white walls setting off a carved wooden portal that dates to the 18th century. Both are on Calle Caseros, a main street that runs along the central July 9 Plaza.\nNearby are four colonial-era houses, three built in the 18th century as homes for, respectively, the Hernandez, Arias Rengel and Uriburu families, and another built in the early 19th for the Leguizamon family. The Uriburu house is also on Calle Caseros, the other three are on nearby Calle Florida. All four are open to the public, but check the tourist office for visiting hours. Saltenos observe the custom of the extended midday lunch and siesta break. Some establishments close as early as noon, many stay closed until 4 P.M. and later, before reopening for evening hours.\nThe Uriburu and Arias Rengel houses are both national historic monuments, and both offer museums. The Arias Rengel House is the site of the Provincial Fine Arts Museum, while the Uriburu Museum focuses on the history of this leading Salta family and its most famous member, Gen. Jose Uriburu, the man who ushered in Argentina's modern era of military presidents with a 1930 coup. The Leguizamon house has an anthropological museum.\nIn the same area of town, on Calle Caseros facing July 9 Plaza, is the reconstructed cabildo, the town hall, originally built in 1582. It, too, houses a small museum, this one dedicated to the colonial era. Its second floor overlooks the town plaza, the center of Salta's civic life.\nIf you're lucky, as I was, you can watch one of democratic Argentina's many street marches go by. In Salta, at least, these are generally good humored and colorful, with ritual drums and banners. The one I saw featured students from an assortment of political parties demanding higher pay for their teachers. Civil servants are among the chief victims of Government austerity, the most visible face of Argentina's foreign debt crisis.\nON the other side of the plaza, opposite the cabildo, stands the provincial government house.\nGuards in front wear the ceremonial red and black uniforms of Argentina's 19th-century war for independence from Spain.A monument to the local hero of that war, Gen. Martin Miguel de Guemes, stands at the base of San Bernardo hill.\nA 10-minute drive from the center of town to the summit takes you to a spectacular overlook from which you can see the entire city of Salta, and the mountain rim beyond. The road is a hair-raising series of blind switchbacks. An alternative, for those with some stamina, is the pedestrian trail, marked with the stations of the cross.\nSalta has become a major center for Andean handicrafts and it is worth a visit to the Mercado de Artesania, or Artesanal Market, open weekdays 8 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. and Saturday 8 A.M. to 1 P.M. The market, in a large 18th-century house at San Martin 2555, offers a wide selection of Andean craft products, including paintings and weavings based on local scenes and traditional Indian designs, colored with the distinctive hues of the local desert landscape.\nThere are also wood and stone carvings, baskets made from palm leaves, Indian shirts, purses, belts and other leather goods, carpets, masks of wood and feathers, and a variety of the decorated containers used for drinking mate, the typical Argentine tea brewed from holly leaves. Prices range from just a few dollars for mate cups to several hundred dollars for the larger paintings and weavings. The market's prices are reasonable and its atmosphere appealingly noncommercial.\nAnother good place to shop for craft items is Tiwanaku, which has mobiles of stone and wood and a good selection of Indian oil paintings copied from the primitive Bolivian school that merge Spanish Christian and earlier Indian religious themes.\nThe middle two hours of the long siesta break are for lunch. Ample restaurant meals are available from about 1 to 3 P.M. Supper usually begins after 9 P.M., and often goes on well past midnight. Foreign notions of proper mealtimes will, of course, be accommodated, but don't be surprised to find only limited menu items available between 3 and 7.\nTHE centerpiece of Argentine cuisine is beef, which is everywhere fresh, rich, tender and remarkably cheap. The list of cuts is almost endless, including many sections unfamiliar to more prosaic North American beef eaters. The mixed grill, or parrillada, includes samples of them all. Particularly tasty are such standard steak cuts known as chorizos, costillas and minutos. Generally, the beef course is accompanied by a salad of lettuce and tomato, or perhaps remolachas, beet greens, and washed down with wine and then coffee. Pasta is a widely available alternative.\nSalta is noted for its roasted empanadas, eaten as an appetizer, and its locally produced wine and beer. Argentine wine is available in the United States, but the stronger, and, to my mind, better tasting reds, are kept for local consumption. Also try the unusual, almost floral, white wine from nearby Cafayate. The Argentine West is home to a good number of Syrian immigrants, and Arab-style cooking is also available. Italian cuisine can be enjoyed in an attractive old-worldish setting at Italiano (Buenos Aires 95).\nThe spring months of September through November, and the fall, March through early June, are ideal times to visit Salta. Local festival dates are Sept. 24, marking the decisive local battle of the independence war, Mardi Gras, celebrated with floats and dancers, and June 16-17, a folkloric celebration. Many hotels are closed during the Christmas period, and advance booking is recommended for late July.\nArgentine hotels tend to be bargains, compared with the main tourist areas of Mexico or the Caribbean. At the Hotel Salta on the central plaza, traditional four-star comfort can be had for less than $50 a night for a double room or two-bedroom suite. The hotel has its own swimming pool for guests and incredible views of the San Francisco Church tower. The Victoria Plaza, also on July 9 Plaza, costs about the same. Decent accommodations can be had for as little as $10 to $15 a night.\nCars can be rented for about $30 a day, plus mileage, from Avis, or local agencies. There are facilities at the Salta airport and in town (Avis at Alvarado 537, Renta Car-Lopez Fleming at General Guemes 92 and Salta-Renta Car at Caseros 225) Driving in Argentina is not for the timid. The right of way generally goes to the driver who blinks last. The alternatives in urban areas are the cheap and abundant taxis and hired driver services. For a few dollars you can be driven anywhere within the fairly compact city limits.\nEven Americans partial to private cars might appreciate the security of an experienced local driver on the rugged, narrow mountain roads with blind hairpin turns. Local gas stations offer only alconafta, a mixture of gasoline and ethanol with a disturbing tendency to evaporate on mountain roads.\nAt 60,000 square miles, the surrounding province is larger than Bangladesh, but it has less than 750,000 people. It offers a wide range of climates and terrains, from the hot dry Chaco to the permanently snow-capped Andes, and plenty of wide-open spaces. Its subtropical latitude shields it from extreme winter cold, while the mountains surrounding the city moderate the summer heat, especially at night. Rain is infrequent.\nWhile the most interesting side trips from Salta are in the direction of the Andes, a different experience can be had by heading 30 miles east to the town of Guemes. Here you can visit an operating sugar mill that dates to 1760, and a culture that barely seems to belong to the 20th century. Outside the gates surrounding the San Isidro works and its big, old-style plantation house is a company village with modest houses for administrative workers. It is shaded by an ancient cypress tree, and along its streets you might see a mule-driven cart. Drive farther out along the back road and you reach the cluster of extremely primitive shacks that house many of the mill's Bolivian manual workers.\nAt the works you can see huge machines reducing sugar cane to a sweet syrup and then drying it to powder for bagging. The sweet smell of sugary steam hangs in the air. In the laboratory, workers will push cane samples through a smaller version and offer you a taste of the juice. Outside, a reservoir holds gallons of syrup destined for industrial use. Admission must be arranged in advance. The provincial tourist office can guide you through the procedure.\nLess than 10 miles northwest of Salta is the resort village of San Lorenzo, in the Andean foothills, where affluent Argentines have established vacation homes. Summer daytime temperatures in San Lorenzo are often 10 or more degrees cooler than in Salta. A public park with a small waterfall, religious shrine and restaurant allow those with limited time to sample the upland atmosphere.\nA more ambitious but intensely rewarding destination is Cachi, 50 miles southwest of the city as the condor flies, more than 100 by road and at least a four-hour drive each way. In Quechua, Cachi means salt.\nAfter about a half hour's stretch in flat terrain on modern highway, the road turns to hard packed gravel as it passes through a stretch of lush, tropical vegetation and then starts ascending the Quebrada de Escoipe. Picture-book mountain walls rise on either side, steep and treeless, looking almost blue in the funneled valley light. The region's quebradas, or valleys, are quite wide, but their streams are most of the time narrow trickles. After a rain burst, they can swell to many times normal width.\nNEXT comes the breathtaking climb up the Cuesta del Obispo, Bishop's Ridge. Doubling back and forth as it ascends, the road eventually climbs to about 12,000 feet. The terrain is stark. The mountainsides are mostly a dry baked brown. Cattle, sheep and llama graze for what little vegetation they can find on the lower and middle slopes. Eagles and condors soar above the peaks.\nPast the summit, you reach an altiplano, or high plain, absolutely flat and marked with cactus. A road sign announces the start of the Recta Tin Tin, a 10-mile absolute straightaway along the River Tin Tin. In this zone, bridges aren't bothered with, and the road simply fords the shallow streams. After a heavy rain, vehicles must wait out the high water, which can take hours.\nBeyond the Recta Tin Tin, you approach the Valley of the Calchaqui, and the snow-capped Nevado de Cachi, peaking at over 22,000 feet, become visible on the far side.\nThe village of Cachi is tiny, but a good place to rest from the journey's rigors. The Argentine Automobile Club's Hosteria Cachi offers accommodations for about $15 a night with a good restaurant open to day travelers, with the usual range of beef, pasta, salad dishes and wine, all for well under $10 a person. Cachi's restored colonial church, with a brilliant white exterior set against mountain blue skies and the snowy peaks of the nevado, and a simple wooden interior, is a national historic monument. The museum of local archeology has a collection of native artifacts of the Andean region with clear explanatory maps."

A two-member Indian delegation accompanied by Rejaul Karim, executive engineer of Hydrology of Pabna, and twi other Bangladeshi experts started monitoring flow of water at Hardinge Bridge point, about 2500 feet upstream from the Padma river at Kushthia's Veramara point. The Indian delegation members are Nashid Iqbal and Rahul PR, deputy director and sub-divisional engineer of Indian Central Water Commission (CWC). \"Under the Ganges water sharing treaty, the experts of the two countries monitor the flow of water in Ganges and Padma from January 1 to May 31 every year.\" said engineer Md Rejaul Karim. At the same time, a four-member Bangladesh delegation including Md Mujibur Rahman, executive engineer of Joint Rivers Commission (JRC); and AKM Anisur Rahman, executive engineer of Water Development Board; also started monitoring water level at the Farrakkah point in India. The flow of water in the mighty river Padma is much better than that of previous years, all because of the sudden rise of water level in September and October last year, according to the Hydrology Department, a wing of Ministry of Water Resources. \"Padma is flowing above 1 lakh to 1.4 lakh cusec at the Hardinge bridge point at this moment this year although the water level was 80 to 90 thousands cusec last year.\" Md Rejaul Karim said. This is the highest ever water level in Padma during dry season, Rejaul said adding that the water level increased in September and October last year due to the sudden flood."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-26 00:00:00      \nNone of the governments in Bangladesh have managed to compile a complete, verified list of Pakistan's collaborators yet Nearly five decades on after Bangladesh gained independence, there is still no specific data on exactly how many Bangladeshis collaborated with the Pakistani occupation forces and committed crimes against humanity during the 1971 Liberation War. During the nine-month war - which began with the Declaration of Independence by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on March 25 and ended with the liberation of Bangladesh on December 16 in 1971 - these collaborators, collectively referred to as \"razakars,\" helped the Pakistanis kill nearly three million people and brutally rape, torture and kill over 200,000 girls and women.  There were several organizations who were the Pakistani occupation forces' partners in crime - Peace Committee, al Badr and al Shams being among the prominent ones.  In the five decades that followed, none of the governments in the country succeeded in preparing a complete, verified list of the razakars - something that the Liberation War researchers, human rights advocates and people involved with the war crimes trial see as a failure.  Shortly after the war, Bangabandhu enacted the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 to try the razakars who assisted the Pakistani army in the killing of Bangladeshis.  Until November 30, 1973, the government arrested 37,471 collaborators under the 1972 order, but a general amnesty was declared for them in 1973. The amnesty, however, was not applicable for those who committed criminal offences like murder, rape and arson.  Later in 1975, the order was repealed and about 11,000 people, who were in custody then, were freed, officials at the Ministry of Liberation Wars Affairs said. Asked, Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Huq said an initiative had been taken to make the list in the 90s, but whatever work had been done went missing after the formation of the cabinet following the eighth general elections in 2001.  Led by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia, the cabinet of the eighth parliament included Jamaat-e-Islami leaders Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujaheed - both with strong allegations of having been active partners of the Pakistani occupational forces.  \"That's when the list disappeared,\" the minister claimed when speaking to the Dhaka Tribune.  Both Nizami and Mujaheed had been convicted during the war crimes trial and sentenced to death penalty.  Jamaat-e-Islami, the Islamist political party that has been banned from taking part in elections in the country, is a known associate of the Pakistani occupational forces in 1971. The minister said the government was currently working on a plan to list all the razakars once the list of freedom fighters is complete. 'Preparing such a list requires political will' Preparing the list of razakar, based on crimes committed nearly five decades ago, requires strong political will and cooperation from the Pakistani government, a top official of the International Crimes Tribunal said. Abdul Hannan Khan, coordinator of the tribunal, said the government has a list of 195 Pakistani prisoners of war (POWs) who reportedly masterminded the barbaric war crimes committed during in 1971. \"But in order to prepare a full list of Pakistan's collaborators, the government needs to take a strong political decision, since identification of those people will require cooperation support from the Pakistani government,\" he added. Also Read- What ICT has achieved in 9 years Bangladesh signed a tripartite pact with India and Pakistan in 1974, following a reconciliation talk between India and Pakistan in 1972. The pact allowed the Pakistani war criminals and many senior commanders to return to their country from Indian jails. The repatriation was facilitated after Islamabad issued a statement in April 1973 assuring Bangladesh of putting the soldiers on trial for their actions during the war. \"Also, the report by Hamoodur Rahman Commission, constituted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1971, inquired on the issue and also recommended that identified Pakistani soldiers be put on trial for their atrocities in the former East Pakistan. Nothing of that sort has happened as yet,\" Hannan told the Dhaka Tribune. If the Pakistani government does not cooperate, the trial of war criminals or their listing will be difficult, he added.  The complexities of the job Prof Mizanur Rahman, former chairman of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), said the government should have put more focus on preparing the list of razakars instead of preparing the list of freedom fighters. \"It is nothing but an utter failure from our part. It was the biggest mistake not take any initiatives in the last 48 years to identify those who committed such violence against our people in 1971. If the initiative had been taken right after the war, preparing the list would have been very easy,\" he added.  \"The list is a must-have, but I doubt it would be possible to prepare it properly now.\" Speaking on the issue, Liberation War Museum trustee Sarwar Ali urged the government to be cautious when preparing the list so there are no legal issues, and the list must reflect historical facts.  \"It is indeed a shame that it took us this long to do this; it is too late. Still, the government can prepare the list based on the gazettes issued in 1971, but there are legal issues too,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. Sarwar pointed out that when someone was made a collaborator of the Pakistani occupation forces - a member of razakars or Peace Committee - a gazette notification was issued against them in 1971.  \"The government must also verify the information to confirm that the people on the gazette lists were indeed the perpetrators,\" he said. Being cautious in preparing the list is of utmost importance, because wrongful accusation may lead to a legal battle, Sarwar further added.   \"The list will have to be concrete, accurate and evidence-based to avoid any complexities,\" he added."

Police seized equipments used for production of fake Indian currency worth Tk1 crore from Jatrabari's Matuail area around 6pm Wednesday, said Abdul Baten, DB's Additional Commissioner,  at a press briefing on Thursday. \"Acting on a tip-off, a team of DB [North division] conducted a drive and busted a money counterfeiting factory,\" he said. \"Three people were also arrested, and we recovered fake Indian Rupees worth Tk26 lakh and other counterfeiting equipments from there.\" The three are Liakat Hossain alias Zakir, the ringleader, Shanta Akter and Momtaz Begum.   Baten said Liakat has connections with a similar ring based in India and traders in Chapainawabganj.  \"Liakat and his gang were planning to use the fake currency to purchase cattle ahead of the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha,\" the DMP additional commissioner said.   With Eid just a few days away, a certain syndicate is planning to release the counterfeit banknotes in shopping malls and cattle markets, Baten added. In another drive in Jatrabari area, police arrested six people- Bojlu Hossain, Afsar Hossain Babu, Nurul Afsar, Md Harun, Al-Amin and Monju Mia- for possessing arms and drugs. They had 3 arms, 10 rounds of bullets, one microbus and 2,100 pieces of yaba in their possession. Two separate teams of DB's East and West division also conducted raids in Fakirapool and Sabujbagh areas respectively, on Wednesday evening. Four people with counterfeit money worth Tk90 lakh were arrested during those drives, Abdul Baten said. The arrestees are Lal Mia, Shahidul Islam, Abida Sultana and Al-Amin. A team of DB West division arrested seven people - Belayet, Dukhu Saha, Rasel, Masud Mollah, Sohan, Zahid and Akash - who were allegedly preparing to carry out a robbery. They were arrested in a drive in Rahim Bepari Ghat under Mohammadpur police station, on Wednesday night. Another team of DB's East division conducted a drive in Modhubagh area under Hatirjheel police station and arrested Nazimuddin Bhuiyan with 10kg of marijuana, the DMP Additional Commissioner said."

      "text": "Feed the Hungry\n1988-09-03T05:00:00.000Z\nLEAD: Dazzling advances in research and ever-increasing harvests in many developing countries have not been able to protect the world's poor from malnutrition. But a simple rethinking of the ways governments give food assistance may achieve what high tech has not.\nDazzling advances in research and ever-increasing harvests in many developing countries have not been able to protect the world's poor from malnutrition. But a simple rethinking of the ways governments give food assistance may achieve what high tech has not.\nSuch rethinking is now under way in some of the neediest and most debt-distressed countries. The best of their new food programs show that it is possible to reduce malnutrition substantially, quickly and affordably - without fostering dependence on welfare. The key is to target food program to those in need. Obvious? Yes, but too many programs have squandered benefits on those who do not require special attention.\nUntil recently, Brazil's annual $1 billion wheat subsidy was available to the rich and poor alike. In a number of African countries, subsidies go to foods like meat and butter, which are out of the reach of the poor even with the subsidy - and the poor continue to go hungry.\nAn income test would seem the most sensible approach to deciding who gets benefits, but it is often unworkable. Even in the United States, where income reporting is systematized, the food stamp program has been jeopardized by charges of abuse. In the developing world, where income is less documented and often takes the form of food a family grows for itself, determining eligibility by income is next to impossible.\nSome countries have found creative, alternative ways to reach the neediest. They target programs by place, type of food, age and signs of faltering growth in children, or even by season. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, several countries are beginning to concentrate food resources in scarce months, before the harvest, when malnutrition is most severe.\nThailand and Brazil now focus on regions where malnutrition is concentrated, in the northeast of both countries. Several Brazilian states have gone further. They target the favelas, the very poor neighborhoods, by subsidizing basic foods for customers of small stores. Because better-off Brazilians prefer not to journey into favelas, even for lower prices, the benefits go to those who need them. In Colombia, poverty is scattered throughout the country. So the Government ranked each county according to poverty criteria such as infant mortality and access to health care. Food coupons were distributed to the needy in the 30 percent of counties ranking lowest in these categories.\nSome countries target by subsidizing foods consumed primarily by the poor. In Bangladesh, rice is the preferred grain for those with money; thus, a subsidy on sorghum, which is nutritionally splendid, benefited only those too poor to buy rice. Morocco, which is restructuring its subsidies to emphasize foods eaten by the poor, expects to give the poor greater nutritional benefits for one-fifth the former cost. This year, Mexico established a similar but even larger program than Morocco's, dismantling many of its generalized subsidies.\nTamil Nadu, a state in India, targets a food and nutrition education program in the poorest areas for those at greatest risk. Nutrition workers in 9,000 villages weigh children monthly and provide daily feedings for 90 days to those whose growth is faltering. At the same time, they teach mothers of underweight children how to improve nutrition at home within their means. High-risk pregnant and breast-feeding women also receive food.\nThe benefit of the Tamil Nadu project has been dramatic and enduring. Serious malnutrition has declined by about 50 percent. Two years after children complete the program they are, on average, a significant four pounds heavier than children who did not participate. Sri Lanka is now developing a similar program.\nWhat makes all of these targeted programs so attractive is that they are cost-effective. Food stamps and other broad subsidies often eat up 10 to 20 percent of national budgets. But the new programs get better results at projected costs of only 1 to 2 percent of national budgets, and overall costs are much lower than in conventional approaches. Because these programs provide food only when or where it is most needed, they are less likely to foster a welfare mentality.\nNone of this is to suggest that alleviating the underlying causes of poverty should not remain the most important goal. Education, jobs and access to land are all sorely needed. But the poorest cannot wait. A direct attack on malnutrition is needed as well, and governments willing to make that effort now have effective and affordable measures to make it happen."

      "text": "Nepal's Economy Is Gasping as India, a Huge Neighbor, Squeezes It Hard\n1989-04-11T05:00:00.000Z\nA dispute with India is forcing Nepal, one of the world's poorest and least accessible countries, to fight for its economic survival, a fight that is also testing its political stability.\nNew Delhi cut most of the landlocked kingdom's vital trade links to the outside world more than two weeks ago, and Nepal was shaken by student demonstrations on April 3 and 4. The protests became as anti-Government as they were anti-Indian. Universities in the Katmandu area were closed amid conflicting reports of casualties as the police suppressed the riots.\nLines at gas stations are long, straining tempers. The streets of Katmandu, the capital, are nearly devoid of cars, and travel around Nepal by air or bus is becoming more difficult. Forests are being stripped for cooking fuel.\nIn an interview Sunday, Nepal's Foreign Minister, Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, said Katmandu wanted to end its special relationship with India, which had become one of economic dependence.\n''It is in our interest to let interdependence grow,'' he said of ties with India. ''It is in our interest to see that our dependence on one country does not grow.'' Border Crossings Closed\nNepal, wedged between China and India, the world's two most populous nations, has only one reliable outlet to the sea, overland through the Indian port of Calcutta, more than 700 miles away.\nOn March 23, after a dispute over how to renegotiate lapsed trade and transit treaties, New Delhi suddenly closed 19 of 21 border crossings with this Himalayan nation, severing links not only to the port but also to northern Indian cities.\nThe Indians want a single pact. The Nepalese want two, as they have had since 1978, to separate their important transit rights from trade and commercial ties to India. The two accords were a concession made by a previous Government in New Delhi under Prime Minister Moraji Desai.\nForeign Minister Upadhyaya said Nepal had in the last few days proposed a new trade treaty that would include no special concessions but only most-favored-nation status, putting economic relations with New Delhi on a more equal footing. Indian officials have not responded.\nAt the end of March, two more agreements expired, covering Nepal's imports of petroleum products and coal through India. Almost immediately, there was a sharp drop in supplies of kerosene for cooking and gasoline for the buses and trucks that link remote villages to sources of food, medicine and other necessities. Trees Cut for Fuel\nRationing of petroleum products has been introduced. Prices of other commodities like sugar, salt and processed foods, many imported from India, have risen.\nEven protected trees have been cut to meet fuel shortages. Trucks arrive daily, bringing precious logs to be burned in cooking fires.\nChirin S. Thapa, a principal adviser to King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev, called the damage to forests ''an unfortunate part of this emergency.'' He said the emergency measures could endanger the survival of Nepal's 18 million people.\nDeforestation in Nepal, apart from eroding local hillsides, is contributing to flooding in India and Bangladesh as swollen Himalayan rivers rush down to the plains.\nInterviews with Nepalese and Indian officials here and in New Delhi, Nepalese businessmen and journalists, and Western diplomats in Katmandu reveal a complex interaction of causes and perceptions that led to what the Nepalese say was a completely unexpected blockade by India. Links With China a Factor\nIt is almost universally believed in Katmandu that the trade dispute was only a pretext for New Delhi to vent its displeasure with Nepal for an accumulation of grievances. Growing Nepalese-Chinese cooperation, culminating in Katmandu's purchase in August 1988 of Chinese antiaircraft guns, is a major factor.\nThe presence of Chinese contractors working on World Bank or Government aid projects in Nepal, especially near the border with India, has led to protests, Nepalese officials say.\nMany Chinese consumer goods are on sale in Nepalese bazaars. Some, like small appliances and crockery, have displaced Indian products, although Nepalese officials say the trade gap with India continues to widen.\nIn addition, the fast-developing Nepalese tourist industry - a vital hard-currency earner - has in recent years ceased to be an appendage of Indian tourism. With direct air links to Europe, Southeast Asia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma and Hong Kong, Nepal is bypassing Indian travel agents, airports and airlines.\nPersonal relations between King Birendra and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi are reported to be frosty. The 43-year-old King, who inherited the throne from King Mahendra in 1972, saw India annex the neighboring kingdom of Sikkim in 1974, and later, in Nepal's view, reduce the King of Bhutan to an Indian vassal. A Martial Tradition\nDiplomats say that the royal family, which dominates a party-less Government, is sensitive to the fate of Sikkim and Bhutan and concerned about Katmandu's independence. Nepal is the oldest nation in South Asia, with its own architecture, language and distinctive forms of Hinduism and Buddhism.\n''They are proud of their martial tradition,'' a diplomat said. ''Beneath this placid, gentle exterior, there is a determination there.''\nIndian officials, who acknowledge their annoyance with Katmandu's Chinese arms purchases, say they are also perplexed by what they see as a new and inexplicably uncompromising attitude in Nepal, which has benefited from nearly 40 years of Indian aid and special trade concessions and an open- door policy for millions of Nepalese job seekers.\nIndians say Nepal, apart from resisting a combined trade and transit treaty, refuses to reverse decisions that New Delhi regards as violations of a 1950 treaty of friendship between the two capitals that has been the base of their relations ever since. These violations include the levying of tariffs on Indian goods and the introduction of work permits for Indian nationals in Nepal. Nepalese in India are not required to have them.\nA new trade treaty, initialed by Nepal and India last November, was rejected by New Delhi when the Nepalese would not withdraw tariffs, an Indian official said. Government Is Criticized\nIf the economic crisis in Nepal is prolonged, the King and his Government will have to rely on the willingness of the Nepalese to stand behind their decision to defy New Delhi, and to make adjustments to lives that are already borderline for many.\nMost Nepalese interviewed said they were strongly opposed to the large Indian presence in Nepal and to any attempts by New Delhi to dictate this country's policies.\nBut they were also critical of the Government, which they said has failed to develop the country or allow people effective democratic rights. Nepalese are limited to voting in party- less elections for local councils. Open criticism of the monarchy and the Government is rarely tolerated."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-29 00:00:00      \nThe deal has been signed by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar The United States signed a deal with Taliban insurgents on Saturday that could pave the way toward a full withdrawal of foreign soldiers from Afghanistan and represent a step toward ending the 18-year-war in the nation. But while the agreement creates a path for the United States to gradually pull out of its longest war, many expect the talks to come between the Afghan sides may be much more complicated. The deal was signed in the Qatari capital Doha by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on hand to witness the ceremony. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper called the accord a good step but just the beginning. \"Achieving lasting peace in Afghanistan will require patience and compromise among all parties,\" said Esper, who met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul where they announced a joint declaration in parallel to the US-Taliban accord. The United States said it is committed to reducing the number of its troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 - from the current 13,000 - within 135 days of signing the deal, and working with its allies to proportionally reduce the number of coalition forces in Afghanistan over that period, if the Taliban adhere to their commitments. A full withdrawal of all US and coalition forces would occur within 14 months of the deal getting signed, if the Taliban hold up their end of the deal, the joint statement said. \"We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home,\" said US President Donald Trump in a White House statement. The accord represents a chance to make good on a longstanding promise to get troops out, as he seeks re-election in November. But security experts have also called it a foreign policy gamble that would give the Taliban international legitimacy. Ghani said he hoped the Doha deal paves the way towards lasting peace, telling a news conference in Kabul: \"The nation is looking forward to a full ceasefire.\"  The Afghan government said it stood ready to negotiate and conclude a ceasefire with the Taliban, and it affirmed its support for the phased withdrawal of US and coalition forces subject to the Taliban's fulfilment of its commitments. It also said that it remained committed to preventing militant groups from using its soil to threaten the security of the United States, its allies and other countries. Separately, Nato pledged to adjust the coalition troop levels in the first phase too, bringing down Nato's numbers to about 12,000 from roughly 16,000 troops at present. \"We went in together in 2001, we are going to adjust (troop levels) together and when the time is right, we are going to leave together, but we are only going to leave when conditions are right,\" Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who was in Kabul on Saturday, told reporters. Today is a monumental day for Afghanistan. \".. it is about making peace & crafting a common brighter future.\" We stand with #Afghanistan. #AfghanPeaceProcess https://t.co/eoP0xftZaa Hope for an end to bloodshed Hours before the deal, the Taliban ordered all its fighters in Afghanistan \"to refrain from any kind of attack for the happiness of the nation.\" \"The biggest thing is that we hope the US remain committed to their promises during the negotiation and peace deal,\" said Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline Islamist group. For millions of Afghans, the deal represents some hope for an end to years of bloodshed. \"Peace is extremely simple and my country deserves it. Today is the day when maybe we will see a positive change,\" said Javed Hassan, 38, a school teacher living on the outskirts of Afghan capital, Kabul. Hassan's children were killed in a bomb blast carried out by the Taliban in 2018. Since then, he has been writing letters to world leaders urging them to end the Afghan war."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-15 00:00:00      \nFacebook yesterday grappled with a widespread outage, forcing millions of people to taste life without the world's largest social media platform. It was probably the last thing Facebook needed as it stumbles from problem to problem, including outrage over its use of customers' private data. The outage began Wednesday afternoon and triggered a flood of gripes on downdetector.com, which tracks trouble accessing online pages, and on rival Twitter. A Downdetector map late Wednesday showed Facebook service troubles persisting in parts of Australia, Asia, Europe, South America and North America. As of early yesterday the problem remained in parts of Europe and Asia, although moaning from America and else where kept coming. \"You guys should look in the mirror at yourselves and hear how you sound,\" a person with the handle Johanna wrote on Downdetector around 0745 GMT. Another whose handle is Palmina D'Allesandro mused that time without Mark Zuckerberg's baby might have been good for making the real, human kind. \"Up and running here.....for now.....But I predict a baby boom in 9 months, Remember that day FB went down and people were forced to notice each other?\", this person wrote. Some media outlets branded the outage as the biggest in Facebook's history. The outage, of unknown origin, also affected Facebook-owned Instagram, as well as Messenger, although Instagram later said it was back up. While the outage continued, The New York Times reported that US prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into the social network's practice of sharing users' data with companies without letting them know. A grand jury in New York has subpoenaed information from at least two major smartphone makers about such arrangements with Facebook, according to the Times."

His father, renowned artist Rasidun Nabi (1914-1995), was a police officer. \"My father used to paint under the light of lanterns every night, after returning from office. He was an honest man,\" said an emotional Rafiqun Nabi at the opening ceremony of the group art exhibition Parampara, currently underway at Gallery Chitrak. Prominent artist Mustafa Monwar inaugurated the exhibition as the chief guest. The exhibition features exquisite artworks of Rasidun Nabi, and his three sons -- celebrated artist Rafiqun Nabi, eminent photographer Tauhidun Nabi, and famous artist Rezaun Nabi along with his daughter-in-law, artist Sohana Shahreen. \"My father was close to many pioneering artists of Bangladesh, including Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin. In 1954, when I was in the fourth grade, he took me to the All Pakistan National Art Exhibition held at Burdhawan House (Now Bangla Academy), as a way of inspiring me to take up art,\" shared Rafiqun Nabi. \"During that time, a heavy flood inundated Dhaka and some foreign aid agencies distributed food, along with story and rhyme books and watercolour bars. My father coloured many paintings during that time.\" Rasidun Nabi's compositions range from beautiful landscapes to portraits, boats, rivers, humans, birds, woods and animals. He painted with pencil, ink, watercolour and mixed-media, depicting images of boats, village sceneries, unidentified gypsies, palm trees, horses and women. He also created clay and cork sheet sculptures. Two sculptures with marvelous paintings of Rasidun Nabi are on display at the gallery.  \"The artists of today boast of merit. Art is not done with talent - It is created from the heart. I believe that nature is the biggest teacher, when it comes to art. Rasidun Nabi was inspired by nature,\" said Mostafa Monwar. \"That's why he was able to teach his children, who are carrying his artistic legacy forward.\"  \"Rasidun Nabi painted magnanimously themed paintings with dedication. The paintings and photographs that are now hung on the walls of the gallery are not just works of art - they showcase a family's legacy,\" said Hashem Khan, the guest of honour at the event.  Professor Bulban Osman, who presided over the opening ceremony of Parampara, expressed his gratitude to the Nabi family. \"Rasidun Nabi saw my father, litterateur Shawkat Osman and my name in the list of the then Pakistani forces,\" he said. \"He shared this information with his wife. As a responsible police officer, he was in a dilemma of professional integrity and patriotism. But he prioritised patriotism. That's why we survived on that day.\" Parampara, opening from 10 am to 8 pm daily, will conclude on February 29."

However, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared Chilmari as a river port during her official visit to Kurigram on September 7, 2016 Although three years have elapsed since the formal inauguration of Chilmari River Port in Kurigram, it is yet to see any activities, causing frustration to local people. Sources said a Shipping Protocol Treaty was signed between the governments of India and Bangladesh in 1972 to transport goods through rivers. During the British period, one could travel through rivers from Kolkata to Guwahati as far as Dhubri in Assam. As the river route has not been developed for years of mismanagement, this river port remained inoperative. However, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared Chilmari as a river port during her official visit to Kurigram on September 7, 2016. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) set up a pontoon at Ramna Shallowghat, Chilmari on September 23, 2017, which was inaugurated by then Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan. Besides, a project was taken to develop the river port. However, the Zilla Parishad does not want to hand over the responsibility of managing the ghats of this river port. The port was given out on lease without informing the BIWTA, resulting in a conflict between the two parties. When the conflict intensified and the matter went to the court, then Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan visited the river port in June, 2018 and assured all concerned of solving the problem. But neither the problem was solved or the river port became operational, alleged locals. According to sources at the Shipping Ministry, once Chilmari was a traditional business hub. The area was recognised as 'Chilmari River Port' from the early days when big ships carrying thousands of maunds of jute, paddy, rice and other goods started moving along this river port. During the British period, big warehouses of jute, mustard, paddy, peanuts and maize were set up at Chilmari around the river port. Renowned jute companies in the country came to Chilmari and established their offices to procure jute. Besides, businessmen and traders of various areas came and stayed at Chilmari day after day to buy goods. The commercial activities based on Chilmari came to a halt due to river erosion and navigability crisis. The present government has taken up the project to improve navigability by dredging rivers. This river port is the only route to establish regional connectivity among India, Bhutan and Nepal from the Payra Sea Port. If the river port can be developed, the entire Kurigram region as well as the national economy will see a good growth. \"We can't see any ray of hope as the river port is not being operational. So, we demand this river port be made operational as soon as possible,\" said Shahidul."

Beijing has invited Prime Minister Hasina to pay an official visit from July 1-5, a senior official in Dhaka told UNB, saying that both sides are finalizing things for the important visit. The Chinese government also invited the Prime Minister to attend the annual meeting of the \"New Champions\" which is known as \"Summer Davos\" to be held in Dalian, July 1-3. It will be Sheikh Hasina's first bilateral visit to Beijing following her party's victory in the last parliamentary election. She will have meetings with President Xi, and Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and discuss ways to strengthen cooperation in broader areas. A good number of bilateral documents are likely to be signed during the visit. Prime Minister Hasina is expected to have an exclusive meeting, on July 2, with the founder and Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum (WEF) Prof Klaus Schwab in Dalian. She is also expected to be a panelist at a session on Cooperation in the Pacific Rim at the WEF Dalian. Beijing has already placed five specific suggestions for deepening Bangladesh-China strategic partnership of cooperation with an emphasis on strengthening 'strategic mutual trust'. \"First, we need to deepen strategic mutual trust, and then we need to deepen economic integration,\" Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Zhang Zuo said at Cosmos Dialogue recently.  Other suggestions put forward by him were to deepen interaction, have stronger cooperation on security, cultural exchange, and people's connectivity. He said that China wants to join hands with Bangladesh to become good partners with equality, and mutual trust. Summer Davos, themed 'Leadership 4.0: Succeeding in a New Era of Globalization', is bringing together leaders from every sector, and every part of the world to discuss how to cooperate on the challenges ahead. Globalization 4.0 represents fundamental changes in the global economy that are reshaping companies, communities, and countries at an unprecedented scale. These changes are driven by environmental challenges, regional competition, economic disparities, and technological disruption. They, in turn, require different forms of leadership, and collaboration adapted to this new era of globalization. Platform strategies, and systems leadership are key business concepts behind the sweeping technological changes propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Leadership 4.0 requires an understanding of how new champions, that are gaining economic influence, are disrupting. and transforming current industry models. WEF engages leaders who have the vision, and values to shape the future in this new context. The Annual Meeting of the New Champions is designed as the foremost global summit on innovation, and entrepreneurship with more than 1,500 participants, 100 working sessions, and community activities, along with the opportunity to engage in several new forum initiatives."

At least six people were killed - including a 17-year old high school student - after two nights of rioting in the capital as police clashed with protesters opposed to the re-election of President Joko Widodo. The violence has been fanned by claims from Widodo's rival Prabowo Subianto, a retired general, that the April 17 poll was a fraud. Indonesia's election commission on Tuesday confirmed Widodo had beaten Subianto, who has until Friday to challenge the results at the Constitutional Court. The 67-year-old has appealed for calm and said he would pursue legal channels, as he did, unsuccessfully, against Widodo in the 2014 election. Election officials and analysts discounted Subianto's claims of rampant cheating in the world's third-biggest democracy, after India and the United States. The government has partly blocked access to social media - including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram - in a bid to clamp down on fake news and hoaxes linked to the violence. At least six people are dead and hundreds injured as Indonesia continues to grapple with post-election riots. https://t.co/o6L14Mm4QT On Wednesday evening, the area around the election supervisory agency's office erupted in fresh skirmishes with thousands of protesters chanting and waving Indonesian flags. Some hurled stones, fireworks and molotov cocktails at riot police who lined up behind a razor wire barricade near the election supervisory agency building, where a police post was torched. Police pushed back the main group of rioters after firing tear gas and rubber bullets at the demonstrators.  An Australian Broadcasting Corporation news crew said it was attacked without warning by a mob. 'Provocateurs' Indonesia's capital been gripped by bigger demonstrations in the past, but the level of violence in this week's clashes has not been seen in years. Among the half-dozen people killed was a 17-year-old high school student and a 19-year-old, according to local media. Authorities said the victims died from gunshots or blunt force trauma, but denied that they fired live rounds on the crowds. It remained unclear who was responsible for their deaths. By Thursday morning, Jakarta's streets were relatively quiet as the police and military kept a close watch on buildings in the downtown core, including the election supervisory agency building - the centre of much of the violence - as well as parliament, embassies and the presidential palace amid fears of more unrest. Nearly 60,000 security personnel were deployed Thursday, nearly double the previous number, after Widodo vowed that he \"won't tolerate\" more riots. Authorities have blamed the violence on \"provocateurs\" that they claimed had come from outside Jakarta to stir up trouble. \"We've detained more than 300 suspects and are now interrogating them,\" said national police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo. Elsewhere, smaller election protests were held in Sumatra's Medan city and in Pontianak on Borneo island, where over 500 demonstrators armed with stones and firecrackers blocked roads, damaged vehicles and set two police posts alight, local police said."

Then in 1990, it became Dhaka City Corporation (DCC). But the core purpose -- to provide better city services to the inhabitants of Dhaka -- could hardly be served. The government in 2011 split the DCC into two -- north and south -- for enhancing the powers and spheres of city corporations and improving civic amenities. Despite all these efforts, quality services remain elusive, as city dwellers continue to suffer from perennial problems such as traffic jam and waterlogging. Latest on the list is the outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases, dengue and chikungunya. In fact, Dhaka has been one of the 10 worst liveable cities in the Economist Intelligence Unit's index for several years now. But what factors stand in the way of the city authorities' success? Is it overpopulation? Resource constraints? Or is it something else?   If we look at Kolkata, it has improved leaps and bounds in terms of delivering civic services, since the Kolkata Municipality Corporation started its journey under Calcutta Municipal Corporation Act, 1984.  At the time, Kolkata (or Calcutta, as it was known back then) happened to be a city where garbage was dumped anywhere on the streets. Load shedding and power outages were frequent, traffic condition was horrendous and its air used to reek of garbage, according to those who lived and visited the city in the 1980s. But now, one would be hard-pressed to find garbage on the roads -- that remain illuminated with adequate street lights after the evening. Most streets are free of potholes, and today's Kolkata is no longer the city of traffic jams it used to be. So what makes the West Bengal capital different from Dhaka? Experts point out that the city corporations in Dhaka have little to do when it comes to governance, and the confusion over jurisdictions of utility service providers are a major obstacle to their success. The city is in fact managed by about four dozen government agencies -- aside from the mayoral offices -- which were set up under different acts and now belong to various ministries. The city corporations have no control over Dhaka Metropolitan Police, Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority (Wasa), Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) and the authorities that supply power and gas. City dwellers often suffer because of the failure of the agencies to deliver in line with their expectations. Also, a lack of coordination among them leaves the city's development and maintenance in a mess. But both urban local government bodies -- DSCC and DNCC -- are powerless to do anything towards that end. Mayors have in the past expressed frustration over inadequate jurisdiction to better serve city dwellers. For instance, the city corporation authorities cannot make a master plan or take any drastic measures to address the waterlogging problem, because at least seven other agencies, including Wasa, are tasked with maintaining the drainage. Yet, whenever the city goes under water, it is the mayors who take the heat of public criticism. \"It's a faulty governance system for which the city people are suffering,\" said Tofail Ahmed, a local government expert. He observed that there are a number of service-providing organisations, but none of them takes responsibility for failure to serve people. Apart from the lack of coordination, the mayor holds all the executive powers in the existing system, and councillors do not have any specific functions and jurisdiction, he added. On the other hand, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has emerged as a truly autonomous body that is directly responsible to the electorate. It performs both obligatory and discretionary functions. The obligatory functions include providing civic services like water supply, sewerage and drainage, solid waste management, town planning and land use control, and construction and maintenance of streets. The discretionary functions include establishment of primary schools, setting up theatres and cinemas for public entertainment, and hospitals, dispensaries and clinics for healthcare. To provide adequate services for its people, Kolkata adapted the model of cabinet form of city government styled \"mayor-in-council\", in which the mayor is the head of the city government. A councillor who commands the support of the majority of councillors is elected mayor. The mayor appoints and leads a council, called mayor-in-council. Each member holds portfolios of various functional departments and is responsible to the corporation for their functions. \"Except some activities, the corporation has the sole authority to undertake any project to serve its citizens,\" Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, former mayor of KMC, told The Daily Star. \"KMC is a fully independent and autonomous body. It is not dependent on others. That's why the corporation is serving its citizens well.\" The mayor and councillors are accountable in different tiers, which ensure better services, said Bikash -- who was the mayor of KMC from 2005 to 2010. Subrata Mookherjee, another former mayor of KMC, said development activities in his city has gained huge pace soon after it became a municipal corporation. Subrata also said they follow the parliamentary form, which gives life to the activities of the corporation. \"No organisation except a few exceptions can do anything in the municipal corporation area,\" he said. He also said if any other organisation wants to do any work in the corporation area, that organisation has to coordinate with the corporation. Experts back home suggest the introduction of a metropolitan government for Dhaka to overcome the present crisis. The idea of such a government -- to bring major civic service providers under one authority -- was first floated by Mohammad Hanif, Dhaka's first elected mayor, in 1994. Sadek Hossain Khoka, a senior BNP leader who was mayor of the undivided Dhaka City Corporation from 2002 to 2011, also supported the idea of a metropolitan government. The metropolitan government would be headed by the mayor and all essential government services and development organisations relating to the city, such as DMP and Wasa, will be under its jurisdiction. The metropolitan government would also be entrusted with functions relating to telephone, fire-fighting services, education, health, land, environment, social welfare, women and children affairs, family planning, flood control, transportation, etc. But Hanif did not get a positive response from his own party, Awami League, which led the government between 1996 and 2001. Similarly, Khoka did not get any feedback on it from his party which was in office from 2001 to 2006. Noted architect and town planner Mubasshar Hussein said the idea of metropolitan is not being implemented due to bureaucratic tangles. \"In Dhaka, a mayor can change the bulb of a lamppost, but cannot take any decision about the post,\" he said, as an example. When the Bangladesh Railway authorities have a separate police unit, why doesn't the city corporation have any police of its own, he asked. Similar geos for traffic situation, he said, adding that the city mayors will not be able to reduce traffic jam until they get their own police or until traffic police come under the mayor's jurisdiction.

Meanwhile, Tangail Qawmi Ulama Parishad on Thursday held a press conference, and demanded death sentence for Shariyat Bayati over his anti-Islamic remarks. They urged the government to pass a blasphemy law that ensures death penalty to Shariyat and other anti-Islamists. They have asked singers, actors, and directors not to endorse anti-Islamic content. Bayati Shariyat Sarker, a folk singer, was arrested on Saturday over his alleged anti-Islamic remarks at a program, and sent to jail on Tuesday after a three day remand. Cultural activists from all over the country, including Dhaka, Manikganj, Rajbari, Rajshahi districts are holding processions, human chains and demonstrations asking for Bayati's prompt release."

State Minister for Water Resources Zahid Faruk, attending as chief guest, said the Delta Plan will improvise Bangladesh's GDP and make it two digits, impacting economical-social development, said a press release. The discussion topics covered a wide range of water-related areas such as flood control, flood forecasting, irrigation and drainage, river morphology, salinity and sediment transport, coastal hydraulics, port, coast, and estuary management, environmental impact assessment, bridge hydraulics, and related infrastructure. According to Prof M Monowar Hossain, executive director of IWM, their mathematical model has played a significant role in solving various complex water problems in the country and abroad. \"IWM can play a significant role in implementing the Delta plan 2100 by using these methods,\" he suggested. Many government institutions including the Water Development Board, LGED, etc partners with IWM to verify the feasibility of many projects, he added. Within the coming 100 years, Bangladesh needs to fight against challenges such as temperature rising, heavy rainfall, flood, disintegration of river, drought, rising sea level caused by climate change. To combat these challenges; a long-term Delta Plan-2100 in Water Management and Flood Control is prepared for implementation by using limited resources all together in area-based planning will develop the economic state of Bangladesh."

The Standing Committee on Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, at a meeting held at the parliament on Satruday, came up with the decision as the DNCC has been using the landfill for dumping waste without any environmental clearance. Appearing from the meeting, Committee Chairman Saber Hossain Chowdhury, said the law is equal for all and there are provisions for fines if a person or an organisation pollutes the environment.  \"The dumping ground used by DNCC is illegal. The environment department earlier issued letters to the organization, but they did not respond. Also Read - A landfill in flood flow zone The ministry has assured that action will be taken against the DNCC, in line with the recommendations made by the standing committee, he added. According to the meeting minutes, three separate letters had been issued to shut the dumping station, but the DNCC has not paid heed to the letters. Dhaka Tribune on August 29 ran a report on \"A landfill in flood flow zone\" that said that Aminbazar sanitary landfill, the lone landfill for all the DNCC waste has turned into an artificial floating island in the flood flow zone near the Turag River, severely damaging the ecosystem. About 2,000 tons of waste is dumped on a daily basis from different parts of north Dhaka to the landfill that does not have an environmental clearance certificate from the Department of Environment (DoE). An August 5 inter-ministerial meeting at the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change claimed that  DNCC did not follow the directives prescribed in the Environment Conservation Rules, 1997, in the first place while building the landfill, failing to ensure a sound environment, it says. The dump yard has become over-loaded from all sides and falls on the path of a flood flow zone near a canal of the Turag River. The landfill built-in 2007 on 52 acres of land was expanded in 2017 as the garbage over the years exceeded the capacity, but the sanitary landfill has turned into an open dump due to the haphazard disposal of waste. The Environment Conservation Rules 1997 made it mandatory to have an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and maintain sound environmental conditions in all steps of building and operation of landfills. However, the DNCC neither conducted the EIA nor obtained any environmental clearance - a clear violation of the rules."

      "text": "Environment Will Expire if We Don't Act Now\n1988-10-19T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nYou are performing an important service to the public and to the nation's leaders by highlighting global environmental issues and the commitments we need to make. There are four points I feel should be added to your excellent editorial ''The Next Generation of Poison: An Issue for the No-Issue Campaign'' (Oct. 9):\n* (1) The list of planetary ills is far more extensive than those covered in the editorial. Tropical coral reefs are in serious decline around the world; fish are showing increased levels of cancer-like tumors, and many commercial fish populations are seriously depleted; large-scale kills of marine mammals like whales, dolphins and seals are on the rise; genetic diversity of both animals and plants is threatened because of mass extinctions of species; toxic chemical contamination is now ubiquitous, ranging from remote polar ice packs to the bottom of the oceans. Like many of the concerns raised in your article, pollution is strongly suspected, though not always proved to be at the root of these ills.\n* (2) Your editorial makes no mention of population. I am not of the camp that feels population growth to be at the root of all our environmental ills. Rather, I think the types and patterns of consumption are at least as significant as the numbers of consumers. Nevertheless, population growth and the ensuing demand for materials, energy and waste-disposal capacity cannot be disregarded as a key environmental policy issue.\n* (3) Much attention has been given of late to the possibility of safe, economic and environmentally benign nuclear power generation. Whether such technologies will ever exist is an open question; clearly the current generation of nuclear reactors does not meet these criteria, nor will they at any time in the near future. There is so much that needs to be done to develop shorter-term options and tremendous potential - conservation, improving some conventional technologies and bringing to market viable alternative technologies like solar power - that it would be a serious misdirection of resources to commit wholeheartedly to nuclear power.\n* (4) Your editorial closes by acknowledging a need for America to ''endure immediate costs for a long-term benefit.'' Even though this has the force of conventional wisdom, I don't believe it to be the case. The benefits of increasing technological efficiency, spurring innovation and opening new markets can far offset any associated costs, even in a very short-term time frame. Consider the economic impact of energy conservation since the mid-70's, or the public health impact of phasing lead out of gasoline; both have produced significant benefits without any serious economic sacrifice. Many more such opportunities await us, and as you state - and as this summer's drought and flooding in Bangladesh warned us - the economic and human costs of not taking action can be disastrous. DAVID SAROKIN Washington, Oct. 10, 1988 The writer, an environmental scientist, is the author of ''Cutting Chemical Wastes.''"

The monster weather system made landfall at the holy city of Puri in the morning, with winds gusting at up to 200km per hour. In recent days authorities in Odisha state, where 10,000 people perished in a 1999 cyclone, evacuated more than a million people as they worried about a possible 5ft storm surge sweeping far inland. One man died of a heart attack in one of several thousand shelters set up, while another was killed by a falling tree on Friday, authorities said. Media reports put the death toll at up to six, but officials could not confirm this. Authorities in Bangladesh, where Fani was headed, said that 14 villages were inundated as flood dams broke due to a tidal surge.  Disaster management spokesman Mohammad Jahir told AFP that 400,000 people from Bangladeshi coastal villages have been taken to shelters. Hundreds of thousands more people in India's West Bengal state have also been given orders to flee. Local airports have been shut, while train lines and roads were closed. \"It just went dark and then suddenly we could barely see five metres in front of us,\" said one resident in Puri. \"There were the roadside food carts, store signs all flying by in the air,\" the man told AFP from a hotel where he took shelter. \"The wind is deafening.\" Another witness said he saw a small car being blown along a street by the winds and then turned over. After pounding Puri and Odisha state capital Bhubaneswar and heading north-eastwards, losing strength as it goes, authorities were battling to remove fallen trees from roads and to restore phone and internet services. On Saturday Fani was expected in West Bangal's capital Kolkata, a city home to 4.5 million people. \"We are monitoring the situation 24x7 and doing all it takes. Be alert, take care and stay safe for the next two days,\" West Bengal's chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted. The winds were felt as far away as Mount Everest, with tents blown away at Camp 2 at 21,000ft and Nepali authorities cautioning helicopters against flying. Meanwhile a baby was born near Bhubaneswar just as the cyclone passed through. \"We are calling her Lady Fani as she was born when the hospital was hit,\" a spokesperson for the hospital told the Press Trust of India. Cyclone Fani makes landfall in eastern India: Met Office https://t.co/XGL0Ldd19a 'Total destruction' Meteorologists have warned of the \"total destruction\" of thatched houses, the uprooting of power and communication poles, the \"flooding of escape routes\" and damage to crops in some areas. Some 3,000 shelters in schools and government buildings were set up to accommodate more than a million people in Odisha, with families including women and babies huddled on the floor. Ports have been closed but the Indian Navy has sent six warships to the region while India's biggest oil and gas producer ONGC evacuated almost 500 workers from offshore rigs. Measures were also being taken to protect the 850-year-old Jagannath temple in Puri, a Hindu holy town normally thronging with pilgrims. AFP correspondents in the resort said it was a near ghost town with trees already torn down and water levels rising even before Fani's awesome arrival. Electricity and water supplies were already cut for much of the city of 200,000 people. Metal shutters covered store fronts and sand blew up the streets from the nearby beach. Only a few police vehicles and tractors trying to pull trees or push aside collapsed walls could be seen. Media reports said hundreds of trees were uprooted at the nearby Chilika Lake just south of Puri in the first violent winds. \"We will just stay for the day until the cyclone has passed. We are not scared but we feel safer here,\" said Krishna Chandra Sahu, 43, sheltering with seven members of his family in a hotel. "

Three were from Char Jabbar, two each from Purba Char Bata and Mohammadpur, and one from Char Jubilee. The police have said the rape cases in the area are almost always filed from these four chars. On August 17, a 14-year-old was gang-raped reportedly by six men on her way to visit her ailing sister in Mohammadpur's Char Alauddin. On August 4, a widowed mother of one was gang-raped allegedly by three men in Mohammadpur over land disputes. On August 2, a man filed a case against another man of raping his wife. The case was later settled out of court. On March 31, a mother of six was reportedly gang-raped and her husband assaulted in Char Jabbar after the upazila elections. According to the case docket, they were attacked by one political faction because they had voted for another. The medical report confirmed that there were \"signs of forcible sexual intercourse\" consistent with rape. Among the 12 accused, eight were named. Several were teenagers as young as 15 years old, aiding their father or uncles with the rape. On March 1, a woman was raped allegedly by a man in her home. Locals detained the rapist, but released him after influential UP members intervened. The woman committed suicide the next day. Also Read- Rape in Subarnachar: Where looms the spectre of sexual violence On January 31, a 13-year-old was gang-raped reportedly by two men when they offered to give her a lift home. On January 1, a couple were attacked in their home after the general elections. The husband was tied up and the wife was gang-raped by 10-15 people. A brief examination of Subarnachar The residents are all settlers, originating from Chittagong's Sandwip, or Bhola, or Lakshmipur's Kabirhat, Hatia or Ramgati. Difficulties in their daily lives, distance from civic facilities, and remote location of the region have fostered a culture of intolerance among the groups for one another. Very few residents are educated. Fishing and farming are the only means of living in the char. But to maintain their living, a majority of the men work in brick kilns in neighbouring districts for eight months every year. Many girls are subject to child marriage as soon as they reach puberty.  In the past, the char was plagued, like many other chars, by bandits. But regular police action and increased coast guard activities have all but rooted out the violent groups who could be used to seize the land. Located at the southeastern edge of Noakhali, the 576 sq-km upazila has 289,000 residents, according to the 2011 national census. With only 500 people per square kilometres, less than half the national average population density of 1,237, the desolate and remote features of the land is only stressed.

Flood Forecast and Warning Centre (FFWC) of the BWDB issued a forecast notice in this regard on its official website today, reports our Sylhet correspondent. Talking to our correspondent, Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, executive engineer of FFWC in Dhaka, said \"India's Meteorological Department forecasted 150-250 millimetre of rain in Meghalaya and Barak valley of India, and 100-120 millimetre at Tripura valley of India. The rainfall might occur from April 17 to 20. Moreover, it will rain in the north-eastern part of Bangladesh.\" \"Following the forecast of rainfall, we are predicting that the water of all major rivers of the Meghna Basin will rise promptly and small rivers might flow over the danger level. That's why we are forecasting a possible flash flood in the region,\" he said. Taking the forecast in consideration, Sunamganj Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Abdul Ahad today circulated a notice to harvest Boro paddy as soon as possible before the flash flood hits the haor region. In the notice, the DC ordered all the Project Implementation Committees (PIC) to strictly monitor the conditions of dykes, constructed under Kajer Binimoye Taka (KaBiTa) to protect the Boro harvest of the haor. This year, 633.36 kilometres of rehabilitation work of the levees at 36 haors was completed under 746 projects in the district spending around Tk 132 crore.

He made the call at the 11th convocation of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) in Dhaka. Abdul Hamid said a large number of engineers, technologists, architects, and planners from Bangladesh travel to developed countries for higher education every year and many of them migrate. \"As a result, the country is deprived of their talents and services,\" he said, noting that there were congenial work atmosphere and ample professional fields in Bangladesh. He reminded the graduates that their institution is renowned at home and abroad. \"Remember, the university is not just a single entity. The students are its life and the honourable teachers are its soul. So, the students, who were honoured and recognized shouldn't forget the contributions of this university,\" said the president. He urged the graduates not to forget the role of the university and said he firmly believes that they will make a meaningful contribution to the development of this university and the country. The president reminded everyone that Bangladesh is making rapid progress and that it is now a member of the elite club of satellite owners. \"We want to become a developed country by 2041. To achieve this, the government is implementing mega projects like Padma Bridge, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, Rampal, and Matarbari power plant, Payra Deep Sea Port, Dhaka Metro Rail, Elevated Express Highway, and Padma Railway link project,\" he said.  \"The role of engineers in implementing, managing, and maintaining these mega projects is very important. I believe the skilled engineers of Buet will play an important role,\" Hamid said. The president said the government has adopted 'Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100' to tackle climate change induced disaster risks as part of a long-term plan. \"In this master plan, long-term strategies have been fixed for flood, river erosion, river management, water supply and waste management, urban water management and drainage. Engineers will play an important role in implementing these projects in national interest,\" he said. Terming the graduates as the most skilled human resources, the chancellor said the convocation not only recognizes them formally but also bestows responsibility on them.  \"You have to be always ready to carry out that duty. Never forget your motherland ... the general people, to whom you are indebted. Now it's your turn to pay back the country and the nation,\" President Hamid said. Stating that the fresh graduates are a standard for young generation, he said freshers will follow their ideal and get the inspiration to move forward. \"The birth anniversary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 2020 and the golden jubilee of our great independence will be celebrated in 2021. I hope you will make that celebration more colourful, bright, and successful with your invigorating enthusiasm,\" he said. Education Minister Dr Dipu Moni, Buet Vice-Chancellor Saiful Islam, and former finance minister ABA Muhith spoke at the program. A total of 5,284 graduates from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2018, registered for the convocation. Five students received gold medals from the president for outstanding academic performances."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-01-18 00:00:00      \nPeople of three villages in Ishwarganj upazila have been suffering for nearly two years since the approach roads on both sides of an important bridge, constructed about three years ago, were washed away within a year of its construction. Local people said the bridge, which connects four upazilas--Mymensingh Sadar, Trishal, Gouripur and Ishwarganj--is located in remote Moricharchar area along the Old Brahmaputra river under Uchakhila union of the upazila. In 2016, Local Government Engineering Department built the bridge spending Tk 16 lakh to ease communication between Khodaboxpur, Bhabokhali and Bhola Algi villages and the upazila headquarters after a portion of Moricharchar area was devoured by the Brahmaputra river. However, the approach roads on both sides of the bridge were washed away by the flood the following year. Uchakhila Union Parishad (UP) Chairman Shafiqul Islam said although villagers in cooperation with the local UP rebuilt the approach roads by filling earth and dumping sand bags, within a short time the temporary approach roads were eroded again. Villagers later erected a bamboo-made platform connecting the bridge, which also broke down shortly after, the UP chairman said. College student Emdadul Haque said the bridge is the only means for them to cross Moricharchar area and reach the upazila headquarters. Though the area is famous for vegetable farming round the year, it is very difficult for thousands of farmers to carry their produce to local markets using the bridge, he added. The bridge was built to mitigate the sufferings of the village people, but it is no longer usable for them, farmer Motiur Rahman of Moricharchar area said.  Echoing the same, a number of farmers like Nazrul Islam, Monjurul Haque, Azizul Islam and Abdul Halim of the area said they are often deprived of fair prices for their produce due to lack of direct communication to Ishwarganj upazila headquarters and Mymensingh town. There are some five educational institutions, including a primary and a high school, on either sides of the bridge, ward member Golam Mustafa said, adding that around 400 students have to cross the bridge daily. Ishwarganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Umme Rumana said she was informed of the matter recently, adding that necessary steps will be taken soon to mitigate the trouble."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-02 00:00:00      \nThe Rohingya crisis, water-sharing of 54 common rivers and the National Register of Citizens of India will feature prominently in talks during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's four-day visit to Delhi starting tomorrow. The PM will be visiting the country at the invitation of her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi. Hasina is also scheduled to attend the India Economic Summit of the World Economic Forum (WEF) as the chief guest on Friday and meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi the next day. This will be the second meeting of the premiers of the two neighbouring countries following their first meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York on September 27 after their re-election.   \"Though our prime minister will be attending the summit, her meeting with the Indian prime minister is very important as there are a number of issues regarding the India-Bangladesh relations,\" said a foreign ministry official. The issues that will be discussed by the two include sharing of water of 54 common rivers; use of waterways; maritime cooperation; the Rohingya crisis and National Register of Citizens (NRC), he told The Daily Star. Apart from a number of agreements that are to be made during the visit, the two PMs will also jointly inaugurate three bilateral projects via a video conference.  The PM's visit to India comes after her visit to China in July and Japan in May, when the Rohingya crisis was one of the most important issues of the discussions, apart from trade. ROHINGYA CRISIS Two years after more than 743,000 Rohingyas fled a military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state and took shelter in Bangladesh and despite two repatriation attempts, Rohingyas have refused to return to Myanmar without the guarantee of citizenship and safety. India, China and Japan have worked to find a bilateral solution to the Rohingya crisis, but are yet to create pressure on Myanmar to solve the crisis. \"Bangladesh is facing a formidable challenge regarding the Rohingyas. As a powerful neighbour, Bangladesh wants India's active role to help address the crisis,\" said the foreign ministry official, requesting anonymity. WATER SHARING AND WATERWAYS Water resources ministry officials said Bangladesh would raise the issue of Teesta water-sharing agreement and sharing of waters of other common rivers. A framework for water-sharing of eight rivers may be signed. The rivers include the Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Feni, Gumti, Dharla, Dudhkumar and Teesta.  Besides, the two sides will also discuss enhancing cooperation in flood forecasting and basin-wide river management, they said. The Teesta water-sharing agreement could not be signed between India and Bangladesh during former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Bangladesh in 2011 due to objections from West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Though the two countries have 54 common rivers, there is only one water- sharing treaty on the Ganges. \"As a lower riparian country, Bangladesh should hammer on the water issue on a regular basis. We are talking about river basin management, but there is no progress on it for years though there were similar talks years ago,\" said eminent water expert Dr Ainun Nishat.  A water resources ministry official said siltation was occurring in southern Bangladesh due to inadequate flow of water from the upstream during the lean season. Joint dredging of rivers by Bangladesh and India can be considered on a pilot basis under the river basin management.  India wants to bring Bangladesh into its coastal radar chain network, reports The Hindu newspaper of India.  A standard of operating procedures on the use of Mongla and Chattogram ports for transporting Indian goods through Bangladesh is also likely to be signed during the PM's visit, shipping ministry officials said.   NRC  Assam's NRC, which excluded 1.9 million people in its final list, has been considered both by Bangladesh and India as an \"internal matter of India\". During a meeting between Hasina and Modi in New York last Friday, Modi said there was nothing to worry about it. Indian Home Minister and BJP President Amit Shah, however, repeatedly said \"illegal Bangalees\" would be deported. Asked, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen recently said, \"The issue will be raised as there are concerns among some people.\" Experts say Bangladesh must seek clarification from India on the issue because the country has already been burdened with Rohingya refugees. INDIAN LINE OF CREDIT  Foreign ministry officials said Dhaka wants speedy disbursement of Indian Lines of Credit (LoC) as projects under the three LoCs, worth around $7.5 billion, have been facing delays mainly due to technical and bureaucratic reasons. In the last eight years, Bangladesh has managed to use $523 million of the first LoC worth $862 million, despite various steps to expedite utilisation of the funds. Bangladesh has so far used $14 million of the $2-billion second LoC.  India is yet to disburse any money from the $4.5-billion third LoC, officials said. Foreign Minister Momen recently said he asked the officials concerned to take the stock of projects and find ways to speed them up. India's Exim Bank, a state body to manage public loans, which opened its representative office in Dhaka in 2017, may now open a permanent office in the capital to process the total Indian LoC amounting to $7.5 billion, finance ministry officials said. The issue will be discussed during the PM's visit, Momen told The Daily Star.  According to the BSS, Hasina will have a joint meeting with three leaders from the Indian Chamber of Commerce and exchange views with them on Friday.  Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will call on the Bangladesh PM on Saturday morning. After a meeting between the two premiers on Saturday, Hasina will join a lunch to be hosted by the Indian PM in her honour. Hasina will then call on the Indian President Ram Nath Kovind. Besides, Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat is likely to call on Hasina on Friday while the Bangladesh premier is likely to meet Indian Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Sunday.  Hasina will also join a reception and a dinner to be hosted by the Bangladesh High Commission in India on October 3 on its premises in her honour. Foreign envoys along with ambassadors currently accredited to Bangladesh and other dignitaries will join the reception and dinner."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-18 00:00:00      \nErshad's political genius was unquestionable This is not an homage to late President Ershad, nor an appraisal of him, but a paean to his political genius that kept Bangladesh enchanted for the last four decades. His politics was of a kind that distilled the best of Kautilya in personal dealings and Machiavelli in politics. His politics, which was a potpourri of wheeling and dealing, bargaining, brinkmanship, and dumbfounding somersaults, kept all entertained. But above all, these essential Ershadian qualities also were reasons for his survival, politically that is, until the last day of his life. He survived his nine years as president, and years of political high-rolling thereafter, despite charges of criminal conduct including political killing, and imprisonment due to his unparalleled swashbuckling as a politician. No stigma would stick to him because he wore a Teflon suit all along.   I knew late General HM Ershad a little more than most other Bangladeshis, because of my job with the government as a deputy commissioner in the mid-70s. Not because my job required to work with him -- he was second to the strongman at that time, General Ziaur Rahman. But Ershad did not interject himself in the life of a civilian administrator such as me because the role he was given by General Zia. As chief of general staff in the early period of martial law in Bangladesh (1975-77), General Ershad was also made chairman of National Security Cell -- an agency that was entrusted with the task of prosecuting people under martial law (among other tasks).  My interaction with General Ershad that time was as head of the district coordination committee of martial law cases in Noakhali, which included the local police chief, an army representative with the rank of a major, and myself as deputy commissioner. Our job was to review cases filed under martial law and recommend those for prosecution to the National Security Cell. In my years of heading this district body, I never had to meet Ershad, nor had I any conversation with him.  I only received memos and letters signed by him in his capacity as NSC chief. In fact, I did not even know how Ershad looked. We knew of him, but never knew him. I never received even a phone call from him.  My first person-to-person contact with him was for a completely unexpected reason, over phone in Chittagong. The reason was installation of flood lights in Chittagong stadium, a fancy project that time that General Zia had asked me to undertake. The project was a pet issue with General Zia, who had this obsession with keeping people busy at night with sports, after lighting up Dhaka stadium at a huge cost. (Rumour had it at that time that flood lighting of Dhaka Stadium was spearheaded by General Ershad, who was also head of the National Sports Authority). When President Zia had asked me (as deputy commissioner I was the president of District Sports Association) that I initiate a project to similarly install flood lights in Chittagong Stadium, I initially demurred by saying that the cost would be prohibitive, and unlike Dhaka there were very few sporting clubs in Chittagong which could draw spectators for nightly sports. But General Zia was adamant. The project was drawn mainly to please President Zia with little hope of it ever getting funded because Chittagong Sports Association was a financially indigent entity. There was also no way I could ask for government funds for such a luxury project which the engineers estimated would cost around Tk5 crore (1979-80).   I did not move with the project anywhere when I received a phone call from General Ershad. I first thought the call was related to his visits to Chittagong Hill Tracts. But I was surprised. After his usual polite greetings, he broke into the subject. \"I understand you are going to install flood lights in Chittagong stadium.\"  Before I could proceed with my query as to how he came to know about this, Ershad said that he knew of a very well-qualified engineering company which had installed flood lights in Dhaka stadium, and he would be pleased if I could consider the firm for the Chittagong project.  He also added that the firm people would like to meet with me. My surprise knew no bounds. Here I was with what I considered to be a dead-on arrival project with nary the sign of a taka, Ershad was asking me to award the project to his nominee!   After I recovered myself from the shock, I replied to Ershad that I was glad he was showing some interest in the project because I could then rely on him to lobby the president for some funds. It was now Ershad's turn to be surprised. \"What, you have no funds and you are going with the project?\" he asked. I replied politely that we had not invited tenders for the project for that reason. To my astonishment, Ershad did not pursue the subject anymore. He ended his conversation then and there. But my surprise did not end there. Immediately after the phone conversation had ended, my assistant told me that a party from Dhaka was waiting outside to see me with a message from General Ershad. I immediately knew which party it could be, but what surprised me was the timing. Was the party waiting on queue?  The party consisted of three people. Two were contractors who had installed the floodlighting in Dhaka. Third was a banker who was rumoured to be a go-between. I received the party politely, but again had to shock them with the news of no funds. They left disappointed. General Ershad never took up the subject with me again. But the actual floodlighting of Chittagong Stadium did happen, much after Zia's death when Ershad became president. He knew when to stop, and when to start again.  My second person-to-person interaction with Ershad was a couple of years later, in May 1981, three weeks before Zia's assassination. The occasion was the so-called annual air-sea battle among the three branches of armed forces. Even though the event was strictly military, President Zia had chosen to invite a gaggle of his cabinet members including then Prime Minister Shah Azizur Rahman to the event causing a housing nightmare for the administration.  The local administration had to find lodging for about a dozen ministers and the prime minister in short notice in whatever rest houses and motels that were available since the prime accommodations including the Circuit House were taken over by the army for the president, chief of staff, and other military top brasses. It was the morning after I had my second person to person conversation with General Ershad when I went to the Circuit House to escort the president to the airport (as protocol required). While I was waiting in the lounge for the president, General Ershad presented himself there and took me aside. He told me that he had heard that the PM was rather upset by the lodging arrangement as though it was a surprise to him.  I was not sure if Ershad was mocking or really serious. \"Yes of course,\" I replied adding that the PM expected to be accommodated in the Circuit House. I wanted to further add the fact of Shah Aziz not being invited to the dinner hosted by Ershad last night, but I did not. Ershad was unruffled. He smiled and said in his suave manner: \"Please handle it, DC sahib. I know you can do it.\" He said in a way that the problem was mine and not his.  It was a district administration issue. He left immediately thereafter with his army colleagues, giving me another \"you can do it\" wink. He treated the subject like it had never happened.  I did not have to do anything to placate Shah Aziz because I knew that Shah Aziz knew the administration had nothing to do with the affront meted out to him and his colleagues. The only person he could complain to was the president himself, and Shah Aziz knew that it would be to no avail. Ershad also knew well that President Zia valued his relationship with the top brasses of the armed forces more than his kitchen cabinet.  General Ershad had perfected the art of concealing his true feelings on a topic or a person to a degree that his interlocutor could never guess his mind. He could be very angry, yet never show it. He could be totally equivocating and yet appear to be honest or even naive. That is why he could survive politically for years. Ziauddin Choudhury has worked in the higher civil service of Bangladesh early in his career, and later for the World Bank in the US."

      "text": "Life in Bangladesh Delta: On the Edge of Disaster\n1987-06-21T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen the tide comes in, life pauses on the little silt islands that dot the great river delta of Bangladesh, and for miles around it seems that herds of cattle are standing up to their knees in the Bay of Bengal.\nAs the ocean rises, pushing a wall of water as high as a man up the riverways ahead of it, the people who make their precarious lives here between the land and the sea retreat, pulling their boats into sheltered creeks.\nBut when the annual cyclones roar in, in spring and early summer, there is no retreat. Each year, hundreds and sometimes thousands or tens of thousands of people are swept away.\nIn the floods of 1985, 10,000 to 20,000 people died. The ''great cyclone'' of 1970 killed a half million to a million.\nIn the endless harsh struggle for land in one of the world's most densely populated nations, the survivors return within days, ''rebuilding their houses,'' as one Bangladeshi put it, ''over the graves of their children.''\nOn thousands of alluvial islands, known as ''chars,'' the pressure of the world's expanding population is played out in starkest terms as crowding drives millions of people deeper into more perilous portions of the delta, where they battle for survival against nature and one another.\nIn the competition to cultivate these shifting, inhospitable spits of land, hundreds die each year as they battle each other with knives and clubs for homesteads. A Case Study In Too Many People\nOne hundred million people live in Bangladesh, an area about the size of Wisconsin, and one-fifth of that area is water, as two great river systems, the Ganges and Brahmaputra, converge to form the largest delta in the world.\nIf trends continue, the nation's population is expected to reach 160 million by the end of the century, increasing problems already at a crisis level. Experts on the problems of worldwide population growth are studying Bangladesh as an example of what might lie in the future for many nations.\nIt is agreed throughout the country, and among the char dwellers themselves, that life in the shadow of disaster has bred a race of tough, fierce men and women.\n''Their very existence on those shores depends on their being ferocious,'' said Salahuddin Ahmed, whose family migrated to the capital city, Dhaka, from an island area. ''They are closer to nature than we are, and in nature there is no sentimentality.''\nEach year, the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, joining in the middle of Bangladesh to form the broad Meghna River, flush what the World Bank has estimated at 2.4 billion tons of silt through the country from as far away as the melting snows of the Himalayas.\nAs deforestation has brought increased erosion in the Himalayas, the volume of silt flowing through Bangladesh has also risen. Beginning in summer, as the current eases, silt forms uncounted thousands of chars along the rivers and around the ocean's edges. Shifting Landscape: Maps Can't Keep Up\nMost of Bangladesh is geologically recent, a gigantic, shifting char formed over the millennia. Rivers slice through the soft land, changing their courses constantly, and little islands appear, disappear and sometimes reappear over the years.\nErosion can eat away as much as a mile of riverbank in a year, and sometimes entire towns are imperiled.\nThe city of Sirajganj is today fighting off the encroachment of the Brahmaputra River, known in Bangladesh as the Jamuna. The city has already lost its main marketplace, its railroad station and several schools. Yet some maps do not even show it to be on the river's edge.\n''There is no such thing as an up-to-date map of Bangladesh,'' a Western relief-agency worker said. ''The rivers and chars are moving about all the time.''\nThe nation's difficulties have increased since the opening in 1974 of a Ganges River diversion system just across the border in India.\nNow, less water flows from India into Bangladesh during times of drought, and more is released during flood season. A reduced current has raised silt deposits and caused flooding upriver.\nThe shifting landscape of Bangladesh increases the hardships of an impoverished population.\nAt least 30 percent of the people of Bangladesh - or 30 million people -cannot find paid work or are underemployed, mostly as agricultural laborers. Some 50 percent are considered landless by the Government. And 60 percent are underfed by the minimum standards of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Where Statistics Don't Tell the Story\nAccording to Government projections, this predominantly agricultural nation could become self-sufficient in food grains by the end of the decade. But experts here, both within and outside Government, dismiss this as a largely meaningless statistic.\nOne reason is the huge difficulties in food distribution in a country fragmented by shifting, often flooded rivers.\nA. R. S. Doha, a former foreign minister who left the Government of President H. M. Ershad three years ago, said: ''Almost every day we see Ershad flying about the country in his helicopter. There's not half a dozen helicopters in Bangladesh. He's the one man who can move about the country.''\nThe other reason that self-sufficiency could be viewed as a mere statistic is the poverty that makes it impossible for most Bangladeshis to afford enough food.\nIn a recent study of life on the chars, Atiur Rahman of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies described a common practice of ''calculated starvation,'' in which poor people cut down on meals and substitute a rice fluid for solid food.\nHe said rural women fare the worst, sometimes working for the equivalent of 3 cents a day and eating just one meal of rice in a week. Law of New Land: Survival of the Toughest\nPoverty is harshest for people whose homes are swept away by floods or erosion and who suddenly find themselves with no source of food.\nThus, the struggle for each new spit of land, as it surfaces above the brown waters of the rivers, becomes a fight for survival.\nBy law, each new char belongs to the Government, to be apportioned among the landless families on official waiting lists. But the law is a distant presence in much of Bangladesh.\nLong before the slow bureaucracy can apportion the islands, local warlords have seized them in land battles known as ''char dhakhal.''\nMeanwhile, legal battles can last decades or even generations. Landowners sometimes pay tax on water to insure rights to a char that slipped below the river but might resurface.\nThe first step in claiming a disputed char is to set cattle to graze on its sparse vegetation and compact the loose silt, said Badsha Mia, an assistant to the commissioner of Munchiganj district, which administers Char Kishoreganj.\nBushes and trees are planted to hold the land against the pressures of currents. After about two years, if the char has held against the river, farmers can begin to plant rice, vegetables and jute.\nIt is when the first harvest is ready that the fiercest fights for possession can take place, said M. Mokammel Haque, the Government's Secretary of Land Administration.\nMeanwhile, erosion continues, and even as the char grows, its edges are being washed away, and the farmers, with their new fields, retreat.\nThe silt washes from char to char without a permanent resting place, like the char dwellers themselves.\nAbdul Motalib, 25 years old, is one of these drifting island men, born on a long-gone char upriver and now fighting against the erosion of his rice field at the edge of Char Kishoreganj.\n''It is the natural process,'' he said. ''If this char washes away, we will look for another one. That is our destiny. We are poor men, and we have no choice.'' An Established Area: No Schools, No History\nHere on Char Kishoreganj, in the Dhaleswari River only 30 miles south of Dhaka, there are no schools, no doctors, no policemen, no trade, no government and no history.\nYet among chars, it is relatively well developed, with portions dating back 30 or 40 years. Although the interior is flat and sparsely populated, small groups of people are busy with fish or crops at its crumbling edges.\nSmall punts ferry towering loads of hay, and men pull fishing boats, like Volga boatmen, by long cables fastened to the masts. Women in their saris soap themselves, and then fill aluminum urns with muddy water to take back to their homes.\nIn the broad river beyond, ancient cargo boats with tattered brick-red sails drift by in the rain, with rows of sailors on their decks sheltering under large black umbrellas.\nMr. Motalib said he and other settlers had fought for their right to cultivate Char Kishoreganj. Residents said that 12 years ago, when the Government brought a group of legal settlers to their fields, the squatters fought back, killing seven people. Most-Feared Adversary: The Sudden Storms\nThe weather remains the most feared adversary of the island dwellers.\nEarlier that morning, a sunny sky had suddenly turned black. Lightning sliced down from fast-moving clouds, and the brown water became choppy as fat pre-monsoon raindrops splattered down. Farmers hurried for cover, and boats raced for shore. An hour later, all was peaceful again; the storm had not grown to full force.\nOn a sandy spit not far upriver lies the mass grave of 200 people who drowned last year when a sudden squall caused one of the country's frequent ferry disasters.\nBut for all their hardships, the char dwellers are the envy of Bangladeshis that possess even less.\nShahida Begum has lived in a burlap-and-cardboard hovel on a muddy street in Dhaka for 10 years, since a typhoon swept away her home on a char in the southern district of Noakhali.\n''After the storm, we returned to our land, but it had been seized by strongmen in a char dhakhal,'' she said.\nToday, Mrs. Shahida, a widow at the age of 30, supports a family of 11 on about 70 cents a day by chipping bricks for gravel on a construction site.\nAbdul Barik Howladar, a neighbor from Noakhali who is now Mrs. Begum's neighbor on the streets of Dhaka, said, ''Please tell the Government to let us have a char so that we will have some place to live.''"

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-18 00:00:00      \nInclement weather. Lack of buyers. Shortage of workers. And impending flashfloods. These very real developments, coupled with a belief that prices of their harvest are set to fall, have Boro farmers in Sylhet's haor region looking down the barrel. The government-declared stimulus package and assurances of buying up a huge amount of paddy and rice, which are meant to help, also ring hollow to many farmers. They are yet to see the benefit of the injection and are also worried about the strictness in maintaining the maximum humidity paddy is allowed to have. Benu Chandra Sarkar, a marginal farmer of Sukhair village of Dharmapasha upazila in Sunamganj, said, \"The weather is not favourable for harvesting paddy as the sky remains cloudy all day and it's raining periodically. If such weather continues, we will not be able to dry the paddy properly to sell to the government.\" There are also concerns that only a lucky few would be able to sell to the government. The government has decided to buy 54,278 tonnes from Sylhet division, but this is 2.10 percent of the production. Additionally, the paddy's maximum humidity has been set at 14 percent. While previously this was relaxed for haor farmers, it is not the case this time around. \"I do not want to sell paddy to the government as is not possible to maintain the humidity in this current weather,\" said Rahim Uddin, a farmer of Moulvibazar's Kulaura upazila. Meanwhile, in the haor region, paddy collectors (middleman), who used to work for large businesses, visited farmlands and made contracts with farmers before harvest. They even paid some money beforehand, which was used to hire workers and when drying the paddy. But this year, no such middlemen can be seen, farmers said. Sadek Miah, a paddy buyer of the area, said, \"This year large businesses are not interested to pay before and we are not sure what to do.\" Somor Biswas, a farmer of Kulaura upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"More buyers would mean increased prices. But this year the price will collapse, I think.\" The department of agriculture extension (DAE) in Sylhet division has estimated 25,83,115 tonnes of cultivation this year as Boro harvest begun last week. But, till Friday, only 5 percent of the Boro had been harvested, according to the Sylhet DAE. Early rainfall and the possible flash flood forecasted by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board recently added to the farmers' fears. All this comes amidst a shortage of workers due to the ongoing shutdown over the coronavirus pandemic. Mohammad Monsur, a farmer from Barlekha upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"I used to bring in workers from different areas but it's become impossible to bring them due to the nationwide shutdown\". \"I even contacted local workers, but they are already demanding more than Tk 500 per day, which was previously Tk 300-400 taka. If the cost increases, it would be hard to make profit by selling paddy,\" he said. To solve this, the government earlier declared a subsidy of 50 percent when buying harvesters and reapers, making the process more capital- than labour-intensive. Moreover, as per the instruction from the Ministry of Agriculture, the farmers can also get instalment facilities in buying them. But marginal farmers and even the well-off ones are balking at the still costly machines, especially given the sudden financial crisis everyone is finding themselves in. Joglul Haider, upazila agriculture officer of Kulaura upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"A combine harvester costs around taka 28 lakhs. Even if the government provide 50 percent subsidy, no farmers have enough money to buy it in this upazila\". Debol Sarkar, upazila agriculture officer of Barlekha upazila in Mouvibazar, also said, no farmer of the upazila shows interest to buy any harvester Talking about Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's announcement of Tk 5,000 crore stimulus package for farmers, Shabbir Miah, a farmer from Kulaura upazila in Moulvibazar, said, \"We saw that on TV, but we are not getting anything...\" Amid the gloom, however, some are still holding out for a ray of hope. Abdul Jalil, a farmer from Chhatak upazila in Sunamganj, said, \"I see good harvest this year, hope for good weather in coming days and a good price during this crisis.\" Srinibash Debnath, additional director of the department of agriculture extension in Sylhet, said, \"This year, the harvest seems very good. We are up for a very good yield.\" He also said many initiatives are being undertaken to support farmers and those will become visible in the coming days."

Indian Prime Minister Modi was scheduled to visit Bangladesh on March 17 to attend the birth centenary celebrations, but postponed it due to the coronavirus outbreak. Following the detection of coronavirus cases for the first time in Bangladesh, the year-long programs chalked out to celebrate the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during the \"Mujib Borsho\" have been rescheduled in consideration of public health. The grand inaugural ceremony of the birth centenary celebrations scheduled for March 17 at the National Parade Ground has been put on hold due to the prevailing situation across the world caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The ceremony will be held later. In the video message, the Indian prime minister will also announce some advancement in bilateral relations between Bangladesh and India, sources at the Indian External Affairs Ministry have confirmed. In the video message, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also showcase Bangabandhu's life, they added.  Indian Foreign Secretary Vardhan Shringla at the Hyderabad House in Delhi on Wednesday, March 11, 2020 | Courtesy Bangladesh to get defence supply from India soon  For the first time in the country's history, the Bangladesh Armed Forces will get the first installment of defence supplies from India soon, according to a top level source at the Indian External Affairs Ministry.  As part of the first phase of the defence pact, the Indian prime minister will officially announce the handing over of some sports utility vehicles (Tata Hexa) to the Bangladesh Army. The $500million pact was signed between the two neighbours when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina paid a four-day visit to Delhi in July 2018.  Traditionally India supplies defence equipment to Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and of late to Afghanistan. India has also extended $600million defence related Line of Credit (LoC) to Vietnam and another LoC to Mauritius in the past.  Defence diplomacy is emerging as a key element in India's foreign policy, with Delhi eyeing a supply of defence equipment to friendly countries in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, according to experts. Indian to give 150 ambulances As a token of friendship, India will provide 150 ambulances to Bangladesh, 100 for the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujib and 50 others representing the 50 years of relationship between India and Bangladesh, Shringla said. On the donation of ambulances, Shringla said they were a gift from Modi who would make the formal announcement. He said these were not ordinary ambulances but had systems in place so that victims facing trauma could access a nearby ambulance by calling a designated number immediately."

On the real-time rankings, Dhaka showed an average AQI score of 136 at 10:06am on Wednesday, according to AirVisual, which monitors global air quality. Dhaka's air quality was classified as \"unhealthy for sensitive groups.\" Residential areas like Gulshan and Bashundhara showed AQI scores of 143 and 155 respectively. Pakistan's Lahore, India's Mumbai, and Nepal's Kathmandu occupied the first, second, and third spots in the list of cities with the worst air quality with AQI scores of 228, 177, and 174 respectively. A numerical value between 101 and 150 indicates that sensitive groups may begin to experience health effects.  A value between 151 and 200 indicates that everyone may begin to experience health effects. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.  Air quality between 201 and 300 is classified as \"very unhealthy.\" If the score is between 301 and 500, then it is classified as \"hazardous.\" The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants -- Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh has been struggling with air pollution for a long time. Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Brick kilns, vehicles run on fuel containing higher levels of sulphur, as well as construction work, have all been identified as major sources of air pollution. Air quality further declines during the dry months -- from October to April -- but improves during the monsoon."

With a wind speed of up to 245kmph, Amphan was located 940km off the coast at 9:00pm yesterday. It was formed in the Bay of Bengal on Saturday. Weathermen fear that if it does not weaken before hitting the coast, it could be as devastating as Cyclone Sidr. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the cyclone may come as a double blow to disadvantaged people in the coastal regions. Many of them are reluctant to go to cyclone shelters as they are worried about protecting whatever little resources they have left. \"Along with the existing 4,071 permanent shelters, we have already prepared another 1,278, where around 51 lakh people could be accommodated. But with the coronavirus situation in mind, we will ensure maintaining social distance among the people,\" Dr Md Enamur Rahman, state minister for disaster management and relief, told The Daily Star yesterday. If somebody does not want to go to cyclone shelters, law enforcers will have to force them to leave vulnerable areas, he said. These shelters are located in 19 coastal districts under Khulna, Barishal and Chattogram divisions. The ministry has allocated 3,100 metric tons of rice, Tk 50 lakh in cash, Tk 31 lakh for children's food, Tk 28 lakh for fodders for livestock to support the people on the coastal belt during their stay at the shelters. \"From our experience after Cyclone Bulbul and Foni, we can say it takes seven to eight hours to evacuate 20 lakh people from their homes and take them to the shelters,\" the state minister said. Law enforcement agencies will help people living on chars and in island areas and bring them to the mainland today. Volunteers were using loudspeakers and urging people to move to the shelters, reports our correspondents from Khulna and Barishal divisions. Already more than two thousand people have moved to cyclone shelters in Satkhira's Gabura. Zohora Khatun, 60, a survivor of Sidr, which killed over four thousand people in Bangladesh, moved to Chadnimukh MM High School yesterday afternoon. \"We have moved here after hearing the announcement about the cyclone on loudspeaker,\" she said over telephone yesterday evening. Many, however, don't want to leave their houses, leaving behind their livestock and poultry, while others complained that the shelters were in bad condition. Imtiaz Uddin, a fisherman of Dakkhin Bedkashi village in Koyra upazila, told The Daily Star that they were the most vulnerable and affected people in any cyclone due to poor embankment. \"If I leave home and go to a shelter, where will my two cows and 10 ducks go? The cyclone shelter is two and a half kilometers away from my home,\" said Imtiaz, a survivor of Sidr and Aila, two severe cyclones that hit the Bangladesh coast in 2007 and 2008. \"My wife and mother will go to the shelter tomorrow [today] if this cyclone is that bad or if any instructions come from the administration,\" he said. Uttam Mondal, of Sutorkhali village in Dacope upazila, told The Daily Star that people of the village usually do not go to shelters due to their poor environment. \"Almost all shelters are dilapidated and most of the windows and gates are damaged. Very few locals go to shelters,\" said Uttam, adding that there is no privacy for women there either. \"If any major crisis comes, I will go to the shelter with my father,\" he said. Over 50,000 people in Patuakhali's coastal area are fearing a sudden surge due to the storm and that some area like Charipara, Kuakata, Lotachapli and Dulsar under Kolapara upazila may be submerged. Around a 500-kilometer-long embankment built to protect those areas has been damaged and its repair work is still going on. \"The flood protection dam has been damaged in our area. We fear that water will come rushing through this breach of the dam. And our whole village may go under water,\" said Abdur Rahim of Charipara village. Several hundred people on that remote island of Dhalchar have already been evacuated. \"In the district, there are 21 risky remote islands, on which around three lakh people are living. Most of them don't want to go to the cyclone shelters. But we will try to bring in as many as possible [to the shelters],\" said Mohammed Masud Alam Siddique, deputy commissioner of Bhola. GETTING CLOSER Amphan, a Thai word meaning ambition or strength, was located 940km southwest from Payra, 955km southwest from Mongla, 990km away from Cox's Bazar and 1,045km from Chattogram at 9:00pm yesterday. \"If it does not weaken before making the landfall, it could be worse than Cyclone Sidr,\" said Samarendra Karmakar, a retired director of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Currently, the wind speed is between 225km to 245km. In its special bulletin, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department said the cyclone may intensify further and may cross Bangladesh coast between Khulna and Chattogram early tomorrow, which could, however, be delayed to tomorrow evening. The sea will remain very high near the eye of the cyclone, the bulletin said. The met office asked the Chattogram and Cox's Bazar port authorities to hoist signal number six, while Mongla and Payra port authorities were asked to hoist signal number seven, which means those ports will experience a severe storm. The coastal districts of Satkhira, Khulna, Bagerhat, Jhalakathi, Pirojpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhola, Barishal, Laxmipur, Chandpur, Noakhali, Feni, Chattogram and their shore islands and chars will suffer the worst of the storm, while low-lying areas of those districts could be inundated. All fishing boats have been asked to take immediate shelter until further notice. (Our correspondents from Khulna, Barishal, Bhola, Patuakhali, Bagerhat, Pirjojpur and Noakhali contributed to the report.)"

      "text": "THE WORLD; India Tries to Quit Sri Lanka's Despair\n1989-09-17T05:00:00.000Z\nAS Sri Lanka and India edge toward an agreement that will send 40,000 Indian peacekeeping troops home, people on both sides of the straits that separate the two countries are counting the political costs of New Delhi's ill-fated foray into a foreign war. The conflict the Indians came to end is not over. On the contrary, the seeds of even more bitter battles have been sown.\nAt first glance, the two years that have passed since Indian forces arrived to disarm Tamil rebels seem to have brought worse disaster to Sri Lanka. The presence of Indian troops, the historical enemy of Sri Lanka's Sinhalese majority, rekindled a revolt by a Sinhalese nationalist group, the leftist People's Liberation Front.\nBy conservative estimates, 5,000 people have died since July 1987, when the guerrilla terror that had once been confined to the island's Tamil north erupted with even greater ferocity in the Sinhala south. An anti-Indian tirade soon became a full-fledged anti-Government campaign, first against President J. R. Jayewardene, who signed the agreement with India allowing the troops in, and then against his successor, Ranasinghe Premadasa, despite the current leader's consistent opposition to the Indian Army presence.\nThe violence led to more violence. The Sinhalese-dominated military trained its guns on other Sinhalese. Mysterious death squads formed. Thousands of people in Buddhist towns have been massacred, victims of the People's Liberation Front, the police and armed forces and, increasingly, the death squads, some of which are believed to be linked to politicians in the ruling United National Party.\nThe Sri Lankan north and east, now merged in a single Tamil-dominated province, is also not at peace. The province is likely to disintegrate if a promised referendum is held there because areas dominated by Sinhalese or Muslims, who consider themselves an ethnic group, will probably opt out. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the toughest guerrilla group, still roam in areas that have become virtual zones of Indian Army occupation. Other Tamil groups armed by the Indian peacekeeping forces to counter the Tigers' influence are certain to be the targets of Tiger vengeance when the Indians leave. Many Indians and Sri Lankans expect bitter fighting among rival Tamil armies, which have long tried to annihilate one another.\nIndia's costs have been high. India has lost at least 1,000 soldiers in Sri Lanka, where troops say they do not understand the purpose of the war, or why they are so despised by the Tamil population they thought they had come to save.\nThe reputation of India's army, one of the world's largest and most disciplined fighting forces, has been tarnished by a well-documented human rights reports accusing Indian troops of torture and the killings of dozens of civilian Tamils, particularly in the Jaffna Peninsula, the center of Sri Lankan Tamil culture. Broken Consensus\nAs the Indian venture in Sri Lanka ''blew up in our faces,'' in the words of a former Indian diplomat, a debate began in India on the country's regional policy. Rajni Kothari, a political scientist and leader of the Indian human rights lobby, said last week in New Delhi that the treatment of smaller nations in South Asia - not only Sri Lanka but also Nepal, with which India has a trade dispute, and Bangladesh, where joint discussions on ways to prevent floods have largely stalled - by the Government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has broken a remarkable four decades of Indian consensus on foreign affairs.\nIndia's determination to withdraw from Sri Lanka on its own terms and not in July of this year as President Premadasa had demanded also attracted international criticism, even from Moscow, New Delhi's traditional friend in world forums. Soviet officials told Indian reporters accompanying Prime Minister Gandhi to Moscow in July that India could not count on Soviet backing if Sri Lanka decided to take its case to the United Nations.\nSumit Chakravartty, a journalist writing in the left-of-center Indian journal Mainstream, said that one Soviet official told him that Moscow was ''opposed to the Balkanization of Sri Lanka,'' a response to suggestions in pro-Government Indian newspapers that Sri Lanka be partitioned into Tamil and Sinhalese areas as Cyprus was between Greek and Turkish zones.\nThere had been speculation in South Asia since Mikhail S. Gorbachev's last visit to New Delhi a year ago that India had been relegated to a lesser category as the Soviet Union paid more attention to its own economy and to improving relations with the West. Few would have predicted that India's Sri Lankan imbroglio, and not some larger international issue, would make that shift public."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-12 00:00:00      \nSustainable development can be viewed as an integrated agenda and fundamental principle that endeavours to provide solutions to economic, social and environmental challenges. The 2030 Agenda emphasises the need for an inclusive and localised approach to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It states that governments and public institutions will also work closely on implementation with regional and local authorities, sub-regional institutions, international institutions, academia, philanthropic organisations, volunteer groups and others. There is growing awareness, recognition and acknowledgement by the international development community and national governments that the local sphere of government is in the best position to facilitate the mobilisation of local development stakeholders, notably the NGO and private sectors, local communities, and national and international organisations, for attaining inclusive sustainable development within their respective localities. Hence, participatory grassroots local government is indispensable for delivering SDGs particularly in poor and marginalised areas. Local government not only ensures improving access to basic services but provides an effective platform to the poor, peasants, workers and women to participate in decision making and development process undertaken for them. Strengthening local government in rural Bangladesh is perhaps the only viable solution by which government can translate policies into inclusive development and prosperity. Achieving SDGs requires contextualise development priorities and programming while local government is the best fit for implementing policies and programmes for improved service delivery that can address poverty, reduce inequality, climate vulnerability, promote gender equity. Engagement and participation of peasants, workers and women in local government is very important for achieving SDGs in rural areas of Bangladesh and for this purpose the higher polity should compromise their powers and resources by giving more space and representation to marginalised segments of the remote area. Bangladesh has been broadly acclaimed as one of the innovators of MDGs usage. Endeavor of Bangladesh government toward the \"localisation\" of global agendas is progressively expanding to the grassroots level. It is a testimony of the strength of our collective endeavour. This article has examined closely the relationship between SDGs and local government in rural Bangladesh as well as identified the challenges Union Parishad faces to contribute achieving sustainable development goals. SDG 1 This goal takes a multi-dimensional view of poverty and therefore requires multiple, coordinated responses. Local government (LG) can identify people living in poverty on the ground, and target resources and services to help them escape it. LG can play a role in shaping local economic development strategies to create jobs and raise incomes, and by building the resilience of our communities to shocks and disasters. People living in rural Bangladesh are more or less affected by contingencies like unemployment, employment injury, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age, death of the principal bread earner of the family and natural disasters. Such problems are very complex and it is difficult to cope with these. Social security is indispensable to cope with any mishap that may fall upon them at any time in rural Bangladesh. Natural disasters like flood, cyclone, and famine cause many lives and lead to poverty, unemployment, disease etc. Agricultural sector is not sufficient to generate full time employment opportunities for the people in rural Bangladesh. Moreover, disease, disabilities and vulnerabilities of the children, women, and aged population have been major causes of concern in rural Bangladesh. The role of local government is an important element to resolve the existing problems in rural Bangladesh. Union Parishad (UP), the lowest tire of local government, has a few programmes like food for work, old-age allowance, vulnerable group development and so on. All of these programmes generate opportunity for the poor, disabled and vulnerable sections to manage their minimum living requirements. UP also assists old people, widows, divorced women and disabled freedom fighters by providing fixed benefits. SDG 2 Local government manages natural resources in rural areas, particularly land and water and underpins food security for the surrounding territory. LG can support agricultural production and local economic growth by strengthening transport infrastructure and markets to promote local food chains. Rural local government can manage collective resources and reform land tenure in ways that protect the rights of the poorer groups, including secondary right holders. In order to overcome rural developmental challenges, food security is indispensable to cope with any mishap that may befall at any time in rural Bangladesh. The role of social safety net, a dominant component of food security, towards helping communities in any geophysical context of vulnerability is becoming increasingly important. To enhance allocation to maintain a healthy social safety net, efforts must be made significantly. To ensure food security for the rural people in Bangladesh UP is one of the most important units of the central government. SDG 5 This goal is about ending violence and discrimination against women and girls and making sure they have equal opportunities in all areas of life. LG can act as a model for gender equality and the empowerment of women through non-discriminatory service provision to citizens and fair employment practices. LG is on the frontline of identifying and tackling violence and harmful practices against women. LG can facilitate them in terms of empowering women, both as a goal in its own right, and because local politics is often the first step to regional and national office. For achieving meaningful development, women empowerment or participation in governing process through gender sensitive policies are prerequisite in any developing country such as Bangladesh. This particular issue has been recognised in the context of policy reforms in both governmental and local government domains. By responding to local needs, LG plays an influential role in grassroots level development. To ensure women's equal access and increased participation in political power structures, the Local Government (Union Parishad) Second Amendment Act 1997 of Bangladesh can be seen as a great milestone. It gave the structural framework for women's participation in political decision-making. It has also provided an opportunity to bring women to the centre of local development and to develop new grassroots level leadership. But the number of women in elective positions of chairperson and member in the Union Parishad was abysmally low even after three seats were reserved for women candidates, because women elected from reserved seats do not get institutional support and are often not included in mainstream activities, and their responsibilities are sometimes not stated clearly. Even those who are elected as chairperson or general member are often ignored during decision-making only because they are women. On the one hand, Shalish is an ancestral informal dispute resolution mechanism where rural people have easy access to justice regardless of wealth, gender, caste, and religion. Unfortunately, Shalish is also known for unfair decisions based on local power structures and backward norms, as well as draconian enforcement. To bridge the gap between informal and formal dispute resolution, Bangladesh redesigned Shalish through the 2006 Village Courts Act. The village courts aimed to combine the best of Shalish on the one hand (accessibility and effectiveness), and of the formal judicial system on the other (procedural justice). The 2006 act provided for the establishment of a village court in every UP. Informal dispute resolution through village courts has great potential, but marginal and poor sections of rural society in Bangladesh continues to suffer from lack of access to informal justice. Women in particular are struggling to get their voices heard. Access to informal dispute resolution remains one of the core needs of the poor, who cannot afford to gain access to the formal courts. SDG 6 Ensuring access to clean water and sanitation is usually the responsibility of local governments, and relies on effective local governance, natural resource management, and urban planning. LG has a role to play in improving water quality through environmental protection measures and sustainable solid waste management. The rural poor have been more marginalised than the urban poor in getting access to health facilities. Health security for rural people is undermined by the lack of physicians, employees and nurses, misdiagnosis, negligence towards patients, irresponsibility, absenteeism and a lack of professional ethics. Furthermore, although the bulk of the population of Bangladesh lives in rural areas, most doctors are based in cities and towns. Doctors are deterred from serving in the villages due to the absence of proper capacity development, accommodation, quality education, transportation facilities, and the lack of career prospects. UP also struggles to push for improvements due to the scarcity of resources and dynamic leadership. SDG 13 Local and regional governments, especially in cities, are often on the frontline of dealing with the effects of climate change. It is vital that our capacities to deal with climate related hazards and natural disasters are strengthened so that we can protect our communities, particularly the most vulnerable. Local leaders have a history of leading from the bottom up in combatting climate change and of raising awareness at local level. The government of Bangladesh has taken a number of significant steps during the last decades for building up institutional arrangements from national to the union levels for effective and systematic disaster management. For better coordination across level, the Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD) act as a guidebook. Union Disaster Management Committee (UDMC) has been given mandate to act as the rural disaster management entity and it is supposed to play an important role in disaster preparedness, mitigation, emergency response and post disaster rehabilitation. UDMC must ensure that local people are kept informed and capable of taking practical measures for the reduction of risk at household and community level. They will also need to hold hazard, vulnerability and risk analysis at Union level and prepare risk reduction action plan. Unfortunately, local people particularly of vulnerable groups have very limited access to UDMC's meeting deliberations and decisions. This largely signifies that the local vulnerable group members have very limited information about the role, mandates and functioning of the disaster management committee in the ground level. Persons who manage and lead UDMC are not expert in disaster management but the SOD gave them authority to coordinate and manage disaster management efforts. Political leadership at local level is not involved to lead disaster management and therefore, people's interest and sense of accountability are not reflected. SDG 16 This goal calls on local government to become more effective and accountable to our citizens. This requires us to tackle corruption and increase public access to information. For decades, local governments have led the way in experimenting with new forms of participatory decision-making, such as participatory budgeting and planning. This goal calls on us to expand these efforts and become even more responsive to our communities, making sure no group is excluded. UP, the lowest tier of LG, plays a crucial role in strengthening democracy and sustainable development of the rural communities. It is the only institution to ensure good governance, development planning, implementation, transparency, and accountability for rural areas in Bangladesh. The latest Local Government (UP) Act 2009 has created an opportunity to ensure greater participation of the people in the process of development planning and implementation. According to the UP Act, 2009, there is a provision of 13 Standing Committee (SC) in the UP to support the Parishad in ensuring transparency, accountability, and people's participation in planning and implementing for ensuring better governance and service. The committees, comprising elected representatives from the Parishad, civil society members, socially respected persons and women representatives of that locality, are entitled to assist the UP for ensuring better services and resolving different problems. SC helps drive decision and provide an important means of oversight on the function of governing bodies. The reasons behind the sluggish performance of SC may be attributed to a number of factors such as lack of initiatives of UP members, lack of pressure from the common people, lack of political pressure, lack of skills required for planning and implementing development programmes at the local level, no specific terms of references of SC, unwillingness on the part of UP Chairman to delegate authority and even non-existence of SC or existence only on paper. Regrettably, the issue of committees has not been perceived well by different actors who are engaged in the process of functioning of the committees. Ignorance and reluctance appear as impediments for the effectiveness of the committee and low participation of the members in the committee meeting signposts that fruitful discussions are not held in the committee meetings. IN QUEST OF A STRONG LOCAL GOVERNMENT Acknowledging the vital role of local government in the achievement of the SDGs will enable us to mobilise local stakeholders and to create new partnerships, based on a common understanding of our shared humanity. We must remember that, a critical challenge encountered in the early implementation of the MDGs as opposed to the SDGs was the initial lack of grassroots consultation and support and, most importantly, community ownership. Local government must have the means and the capacity to improve administration, anticipate demands, plan and implement solutions. To upscale efforts, we need greater cooperation and national and international coordination mechanisms, as well as enough resources to make this happen. Peer review among local governments has proven to be a very effective way of achieving strengthened local governments. We will need to ensure that citizens are involved in the decisions that affect their future. \"Effective, accountable and transparent institutions\" and \"responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels\" require a clear institutional framework, reinforced management and planning capacities, participatory mechanisms and regular financial negotiations between all levels of government and local communities to define priorities and plan of action. The national government, international institutions, the academic world and our development partners need to foster new partnerships with local political leaders and civil society to facilitate effective decision-making. We must strive to foster dialogue with all stakeholders through the Local 2030 initiative, and to mobilise a multi-level coalition around localisation, which can accelerate our efforts, while setting enabling national frameworks that empower local actors to develop and lead their own strategies aligned with the SDGs. Empowering local government has become imperative for putting rural Bangladesh on the track of inclusive development and prosperity. A strong local government with adequate resources and authority is a must for localisation of SDGs and improved governance at grassroots level.

Carrying placards demanding stoppage of the illegal tree felling and hill razing, students formed the human chain in front of the Shahid Minar. Later, they brought out a rally and paraded around the campus. Protesting students said Chittagong University is known for its panoramic beauty surrounded by hills and forests. But some unethical businessmen are cutting down trees and razing hills for transportation. \"From now, students will intercept the vehicles laden with felled trees,\" said Ritu Roy of Institute of Forestry and Environmental Science. The students gave an ultimatum of a month to the university authority and if their demands are not met within, they will increase their movement to save the campus, they said. The students also submitted a memorandum with a seven-point demand to the Proctor of the university demanding punishment for the responsible people who are behind this crime. Meanwhile, a two-member team from Department of Environment (DoE) visited the campus and found evidence of felling trees. Based on the evidence, the DoE served a show-cause notice to the Estate Department and Security Department of the university, timber traders Md Hanif and Md Bazlu. According to a media report, more 7,000 trees have been felled in the last four years on the campus. "

Nur-un-Nabi Sarker, project implementation officer of Sundarganj, said the recent floods caused an estimated loss of Tk 41 crore 47 lakh 13 thousand 550 in the upazila. It includes Tk 33 crore 59 lakh 78 thousand 550 in rural infrastructures like roads, bridges, culverts and cluster villages, Tk 4 crore 83 lakh in agriculture, Tk 1.80 crore in roads, bridges and culverts under Local Government Engineering Department, Tk 50 lakh of secondary education department, Tk 18 lakh of primary education department, Tk 43 lakh of fisheries department, and Tk 13.35 lakh of livestock department. \"I took shelter on the embankment after the flood washed away my two huts used for dwelling. The water has receded but I am still staying here as I can't rebuild my home due to hardship,\" said Afsar Ali, a farm labourer in Belka of Sundarganj. \"My three bighas of land got covered with a thick layer of sand as surging water inundated the area after breaches in the embankment. Normally it would take at least two years for the land to regain fertility,\" said Solaiman, a small farmer of Belka. Many of the croplands in char areas are still under knee-deep water and so, Aman farming there still remains uncertain, said Faridul of the same area. Farmer Rafiqul Islam of Kapasia union said they are worried about the next Aman cultivation as the three-week-long floods damaged seedbeds in large areas. Road communications are still in disarray as floods damaged roads, culverts and bridges at different places. \"Without special allocation from the government, it would be difficult to renovate damaged roads and culverts in the area. Besides, many of the flood-affected people need financial help for rebuilding their damaged houses and removing sand from croplands,\" said Nafiul Islam Jimy, chairman of Haripur union parishad. Md Solaiman Ali, upazila nirbahi officer of Sundarganj, said a list with estimated damage in flood affected areas have been sent to respective ministries, urging for immediate allocation to start rehabilitation work as early as possible."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-21 00:00:00      \nLong despised by German fans as the face of big-money football, billionaire Dietmar Hopp is now being held up by some as a national hero in the coronavirus crisis. Three weeks ago, the 79-year-old owner of the Hoffenheim club was the subject of nationwide protests in Germany's stadiums, with fans calling him a \"son of a b***h\" and holding up pictures of his face in crosshairs. This week, Hopp raised hopes of a vaccine for the COVID-19 disease, suggesting a company he owns could develop one as soon as the autumn. Ranked by Forbes as the eighth richest person in Germany, Hopp made his fortune with SAP, a software company he co-founded in 1972. Decades later, he used his wealth to propel Hoffenheim, based near Sinsheim in southwestern Germany, from amateur league anonymity to the top-flight Bundesliga and a place among Europe's elite in the Champions League. That made him a hate figure for football fans across the country. For Germany's \"ultras\", Hopp is a symbol for how wealthy investors hold too much power in football. They see him as a threat to the culture and traditions of the German game, and more specifically to the 50+1 rule, which underpins the considerable influence of supporters in the way German clubs are run. Hopp has also riled fans by taking legal action over insulting chants sung about him by away supporters. A decision by the German Football Association to ban Borussia Dortmund fans from Hoffenheim for two years prompted a flood of protests last month, with fans across the country accusing football authorities of pandering to Hopp's personal wishes. Supporters of clubs such as Bayern Munich, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Union Berlin held up banners insulting Hopp and the DFB, leading in some cases to games being suspended. Three weeks on, the Bundesliga has been suspended due to the coronavirus crisis, but Hopp remains firmly in the headlines. He is now being heralded as a hero in some quarters, after it emerged that one of his companies, biotech firm CureVac, is working on a vaccine for COVID-19. CureVac's research was at the centre of a diplomatic row last weekend. According to a report in Welt newspaper on Sunday, US President Donald Trump offered the company up to a billion dollars to secure exclusive rights to the vaccine research for the United States. CureVac denied the report, while Hopp said such a deal \"would not be an option\". \"It's obvious for me that it can't be the case that a German company develops a vaccine which is then used exclusively in the US.\" The firm response earned him praise but football fans remain largely unmoved by Hopp's comments on the vaccine, which he says should be for \"people across the world\". \"It's very nice that a successful businessman is recognising his social responsibility and acting accordingly, but that has nothing to do with his involvement in football,\" said Sig Zelt, a spokesman for the organisation \"Pro-Fans\", on Wednesday."

The Bangladeshi culinary tapestry, which stemmed from the coalescence of distinctive cultures adapted throughout the establishment and influence of different colonies in India, is famous for its distinctive taste, be it pungent, savoury or sweet. Given the enclosures, with abundant crops and fish, Bengalis adapted a unique spice called Choi Jhal (Piper Chaba), which enabled them to complement their curries with hot, vinegary and aromatic taste, all at once. Choi Jhal, an exquisite spice Choi Jhal, is one of the most popular and unique spices in the south-western region of Bangladesh. The chopped stems, roots and skin of the plant are used while cooking food, especially meat and fish. The choi plants are used predominantly in Khulna, Bagerhat, Jessore, and Satkhira. Choi is a creeper which grows around larger trees. Leaves and stems of the Choi look like betel leaves. Betel and Choi are two species of the same family, Piperaceae. It is a relatively expensive spice in Bangladesh, and the roots are usually more expensive than the stems because of their stronger aroma. How it is used in curries Choi Jhal is mainly used as a taste enhancer. It makes the food hotter and spicier. In Bangladesh the use of Choi Jhal is unique, because the twigs, stems or roots of it, not the fruit, are used as spice.  Curries of beef, mutton and fish can be prepared with Choi Jhal but it is not much popular with vegetables. Commonly a little amount of the dried up Choi Jhal twigs, stems or roots are thrown into the boiling curries, ten to fifteen minutes before the cooking process ends. The softened roots enrich the aroma and flavour of the curry. Though it highly prescribed to use it with garlic and fenugreek, it is suggested by some esteemed cooks not to use it with ginger. Economic prospect of Choi Jhal in Khulna Over the course of time, Choi Jhal became almost extinct from other areas but farmers of the south-western region, Khulna, the third largest city of Bangladesh are cultivating the exquisite spice and earning much with their implicit imports and exports. Nabadip Mollik, a farmer from Dumuria, made it possible to easily commercialise the spice with its original qualities intact, by producing ground Choi Jhal. He said: \"The spice is exquisite and costly but the raw products lose its qualities. With our ground spices it is far easier to use.\" Additional Deputy Director, Md Nazrul Islam at Khulna Agricultural Extension Office(KAEO) said demand for the spice is increasing exponentially. \"Not only curry but pickles made of Choi Jhal is delicious as well,\" he said. Choi Jhal has been treating different kinds of diseases and it has a number of herbal uses, specially the antimicrobial and antioxidant active ingredients, the results of this kind of compounds exhibited good to excellent applications, said KAEO Deputy Director Pankaj Kanti Majumdar."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-25 00:00:00      \nThe White House and Senate leaders of both parties announced agreement early Wednesday on unprecedented emergency legislation to rush sweeping aid to businesses, workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus pandemic. The urgently needed pandemic response measure is the largest economic rescue measure in history and is intended as a weeks- or months-long patch for an economy spiraling into recession and a nation facing a potentially ghastly toll. Top White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway shortly after midnight, capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. It still needs to be finalized in detailed legislative language. \"Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,\" Ueland said. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidised loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well. \"After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,\" said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, a key negotiator. \"It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help Americans workers, families, small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.\" At the White House on Tuesday, even as the public-health crisis deepened, President Donald Trump expressed eagerness to nudge many people back to work in coming weeks and held out a prospect, based more on hope than science, that the country could be returning to normal in less than a month. \"We have to go back to work, much sooner than people thought,\" Trump told a Fox News town hall. He said he'd like to have the country \"opened up and just raring to go\" by Easter, April 12. But in a White House briefing later, Trump said that \"our decision will be based on hard facts and data.\" Medical professionals say social distancing needs to be stepped up, not relaxed, to slow the spread of infections. At the White House briefing, the public-health authorities said it was particularly important for people in the hard-hit New York City metropolitan area to quarantine themselves for 14 days, and for those who have recently left the city to do the same. Dr Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, said pointedly at the briefing, \"No one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City.\" On Capitol Hill, five days of arduous talks produced the bill, creating tensions among Congress' top leaders, who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option, which permitted both sides to mark big wins. Even before the deal was reached, news of the likely but elusive agreement had sent the stock market rocketing on Tuesday. The emerging rescue package would be larger than the 2008 bank bailout and 2009 recovery act combined. The unprecedented economic rescue package would give direct a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public. A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at the insistence of Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, while Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the lead federal disaster agency. Democrats said the package would help replace the salary of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. \"It ensures that all workers are protected whether they work for businesses small, medium or large, along with self-employed and workers in the gig economy,\" Schumer said. Republicans won inclusion of an \"employee retention\" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies who retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. Democrats pointed to gains for hospitals, additional oversight of the huge industry stabilization fund, and money for cash-strapped states. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well, growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion, which dwarfs earlier disasters -- including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined. To provide transparency, the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars, much as was done during the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program bank rescue, officials said. Trump in recent days has sounded a note of frustration about the unprecedented modern-day effort to halt the virus' march by essentially shutting down public activities in ways that now threaten the US economy. Even though Trump's administration recommended Americans curtail activities for 15 days, starting just over a week ago, the president said he may soon allow parts of the economy, in regions so far less badly hit by the virus, to begin reopening. He continued on that theme Tuesday as he weighed a relaxation of social distancing guidelines after the 15-day period is up. His suggestion that the pandemic could ease and allow a return to normalcy in a mere few weeks is not supported by public health officials or many others in government. On Tuesday, top defense and military leaders warned department personnel that the virus problems could extend for eight to 10 weeks, or longer. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said during a Defense Department town hall meeting that the crisis could even extend into July. Trump has balked at using his authority under the recently invoked Defense Protection Act to compel the private sector to manufacture needed medical supplies like masks and ventilators, even as he encourages them to spur production. \"We are a country not based on nationalizing our business,\" said Trump, who has repeatedly railed against socialism overseas and among Democrats. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover."

India not pushing anyone into Bangladesh Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen also said India is not pushing anybody into Bangladesh but some people are coming with the help of middlemen with an impression that one can have free food here, UNB adds. He said the government will send them back if anybody other than Bangladesh citizens enters the country through the Bangladesh-India border without following the due process. The Foreign Minister said Bangladesh requested India to give the list if there is any Bangladeshi living in India illegally. \"Let's know it (Bangladesh seeks info from India),\" he told reporters at the Foreign Affairs Ministry adding that there is a standard procedure to follow in that case. Dr Momen highlighted Bangladesh's socio-economic development while joblessness in India in some cases. He said those who are Bangladesh citizens have the right to come back to Bangladesh but others will be sent back. Responding to a question on National Register of Citizenship (NRC), he said India termed it their internal matter and assured Bangladesh that it will in no way affect Bangladesh. \"The Bangladesh-India relations are normal. The relations won't be affected...the relations are very sweet,\" said the Foreign Minister explaining reasons behind the cancellation of his New Delhi visit. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs here said the scheduled visit of Dr Momen was cancelled due to his 'busy schedule' at home ahead of Martyred Intellectuals Day and Victory Day, said a senior official on Thursday. India also termed its relations with Bangladesh \"very strong\" and brushed aside speculations over the last-minute cancellation of Dr Momen's New Delhi visit. \"We've been informed by Bangladesh side that the change in the programme was due to domestic issues related to commemoration of Bangladesh Victory Day on December 16,\" official spokesperson at the Indian Ministry of External Affairs Raveesh Kumar told reporters at a briefing in New Delhi on Thursday. He termed speculations linking the cancellation of the visit to the Indian Parliament's adoption of the Citizenship Amendment Bill \"unwarranted.\" The MEA spokesperson ruled out the speculation, saying: \"There have been unwarranted speculations...\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-31 00:00:00      \nA new research shows coastal flooding will hit nearly 42 million people in Bangladesh by 2050, meaning that the situation is likely to be worse than what was feared earlier. The number of victims could reach 57 million by the end of this century, according to the study conducted by US-based non-profit research group Climate Central and published in British scientific journal Nature on Tuesday. A previous projection by the group had said the flooding would affect around 5 million Bangladeshis living in coastal areas by the mid-century. Some other studies, however, said the number could be 20 to 30 million. The new study says researchers have developed a more accurate way of estimating the effects of sea level rise over large areas, and found that nearly 300m people across the world will be vulnerable by 2050 to flooding made worse by climate change. Globally, more than three times more people are at risk from rising sea levels than previously believed, the researchers suggest. \"When we use our new elevation data, we find far more people living in vulnerable areas than we previously understood,\" the study's co-author Ben Strauss, CEO and chief scientist of Climate Central, told AFP. Eminent Bangladeshi climate expert Saleemul Haq agreed with the study findings. He, however, said, \"It needs further research at the national level to know exactly what will happen in Bangladesh.\" 'ASIA TO BE HIT HARDEST' The new study, which contains findings from individual assessments of 135 countries across multiple climate scenarios and years, says deadly storm surges, cyclones and rising sea would hit Asia the hardest. More than two thirds of the vulnerable populations live in some countries of Asia, including Bangladesh, China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand, says the study, titled \"New Elevation Data Triple Estimates of Global Vulnerability to Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Flooding\". A map created using a form of artificial intelligence, known as neural networks, shows that by 2050 some coastal cities from South and South East Asia will be under water during high tide. Millions of people living in the cities of those countries, including Dhaka, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taizhou, Surabaya, Mumbai, Ho Chi Minh City and Osaka -- would find themselves in flood zones, the report mentions. \"These assessments show the potential of climate change to reshape cities, economies, coastlines, and entire global regions within our lifetimes,\" said Dr Scott Kulp, a senior scientist at Climate Central and lead author of the study. Dr Benjamin Strauss said, \"For most of the global coasts we didn't know the height of the ground beneath our feet.\" The researchers used a model called CoastalDEM digital elevation modelling, a new digital elevation model developed by Climate Central, for the study. Earlier, researchers had used Nasa's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) which gave an estimation of population at risk due to sea level rise three times lower than the current one. Although the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) in its sixth report published last month projected that sea level would go up by a metre by the end of the century, the new report says the height will rise by at least two metres. Contacted, Dr Atik Rahman, executive director of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS), one of the lead authors of IPCC, said the panel projected the sea level rise based on old published papers. \"So the IPCC did not project the sea level rise correctly. Actually the sea level is rising more rapidly as Arctic, Antarctic and mountain glaciers are melting faster than we thought,\" he said. \"So the impact of climate change is going to be harder than we thought.\" Meanwhile, some experts differ from the study findings relating to Bangladesh. Dr Ainun Nishat, professor emeritus, Brac University, said most of the coastal areas in the country have embankments which are four to five metres high and the government has taken initiatives to increase the height to 6.5 metres. \"So the areas, as projected in the new study, are not going to be inundated,\" he said. The expert believed areas 100 kilometres away from the coastal zones in districts like Pirojpur and Shariatpur would be badly affected as there are no embankments there. \"But for us, the main challenge would be the increasing salinity in the river water due to the rising sea level and tackling natural disasters with what we have,\" he added."

      "text": "High Cost of Deteriorating Environment Is Charted\n1989-02-12T05:00:00.000Z\nThe world can expect widespread economic decline and social disruption in the 1990's unless national leaders make a serious commitment to reverse the deterioration of the earth's environmental systems, a Washington-based research group said today.\nThe group, the Worldwatch Institute, said the major natural catastrophes of 1988 - further depletion of the ozone layer, the North American drought and the disastrous flooding in Bangladesh - provided a worrisome glimpse of a future in which environmental changes go unchecked. ''Unless the threats of climate change, ozone depletion, soil erosion, deforestation, and population growth are brought under control soon, economic decline may be inevitable,'' said Lester R. Brown, president of the institute and director of the study.\nThe report, ''State of the World 1989,'' recommends strategies for nations to reverse the most threatening trends. It focuses on four key areas: climate protection, reforestation, food production, and reducing population growth in the third world.\n''Time is not on our side,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We have years, not decades, to turn the situation around, and even then there is no guarantee that we will be able to reverse the trends that are undermining the human prospect, but if we do, it will be during the 90's. Beyond that it will be too late.''\nThe report recommended that national energy policies be directed to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels, the principal cause of the so-called greenhouse effect, or global warming. The burning of coal and other fuels such as oil and natural gas releases carbon dioxide that traps heat in the lower atmosphere, allowing temperatures to rise.\nMoreover, the large-scale clearing of tropical forests adds carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, hastening the greenhouse effect. ''If energy policymaking continues to be the domain of short-term thinking and narrow political considerations, there can be little hope,'' Mr. Brown said. The report suggested establishing international efficiency standards for automobiles, lighting systems, and electrical appliances. The report said that the world's 400 million cars currently average 20 miles per gallon of gasoline, emitting 547 million tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year. ''Setting a fuel standard for new cars of 50 miles per gallon by the year 2000 would be an important step toward climate stability,'' the report said.\nThe destruction of forests in many countries has caused several disasters, the report said. The dependency of millions on firewood for fuel has increased rainfall runoff and triggered widespread flooding in Bangladesh, India, the Sudan, Thailand and elsewhere. It has also speeded the extinction of plant and animal species.\nAs forests are cleared and burned, carbon is released into the atmosphere, speeding up the warming.\nThe report also found that the world's food production had dropped 14 percent per capita since 1984, and is now at the level of 1970. It named the North American drought, soil erosion, encroachment of desert in Africa, and scarce land and water as the main reasons for the slower growth.\nCopies of the report may be obtained from Worldwatch Institute, 1776 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036. The price is $18.95 for the hard-cover edition and $9.95 for the soft-cover."

      "text": "Scientists Revive a Lost Secret of Farming\n1988-11-22T05:00:00.000Z\nFOR centuries, beginning around 3,000 years ago, there flourished on the high plains of the Peruvian Andes around Lake Titicaca a simple but ingenious form of agriculture that enabled ancient peoples to reap bumper crops in the face of flood, drought and the killing frost of those 12,000-foot altitudes.\nNow archeologists have unlocked the secrets of those pre-Colombian fields - and found to their amazement that the techniques can outperform modern agricultural technologies under circumstances found throughout much of the Third World today.\nIn a striking example of what is known as experimental archeology, the modern scientists have restored an art that died out and was mostly lost even before the coming of the Spanish Conquistadors in the 16th century. All that survived were eroding traces of raised, rectangular platforms of earth alternating with canals in a corduroy pattern across acre after acre of flat expanse. Modern-day Peruvian Indians called the platforms ''waru waru'' and considered them to be signs left behind by a revered ''first race'' who ruled the area before the Incas came.\nIn a dramatic resurrection, modern-day Peruvians using ancient implements have reconstructed the raised-platform fields according to specifications derived from the archeological digs.\nThe prehistoric technology has proved so productive, so hardy and so inexpensive in its modern application that it is being held out as a possible alternative for wide stretches of the Third World where scarce resources and harsh local conditions have frustrated the advance of the high-tech Green Revolution.\nFields constructed and planted according to what has been termed ''raised-field agriculture'' require no chemical fertilizer or modern machinery. They cost almost nothing, except human labor. They are farmed with variants of ancient implements rather than expensive tractors and plows. They have outyielded conventional, capital-intensive fields as producers of potatoes, one of the region's main crops both in pre-Colombian days and now. When conventional fields die in a drought or flood, these mostly survive.\n''It's fantastic,'' says Dr. William Denevan, an archeologist at the University of Wisconsin who was one of the first to discover the remains of the prehistoric platforms 20 years ago. ''Here's a whole system, abandoned before any Europeans came, now being restored by the local community.'' Today's Green Revolution, based on heavy use of fertilizer and machinery, has not been able to penetrate everywhere or to all population groups, notes David Bathrick, the director of the United States Agency for International Development's office of agriculture.\nMr. Bathrick headed his agency's agricultural mission in Peru during the early years of the raised-field experiment and has visited the fields. They could, he said, become part of what he called a ''second Green Revolution,'' aimed at less hospitable areas of the Third World, where flood, cold, heat, and drought routinely pose special difficulties, and where modern agricultural technology has not moved beyond the more favorable plains and river basins. They might be especially useful, say those who have restored them, in areas subject to frequent flooding, such as in Bangladesh or the Ganges plain in India.\nSince the first discoveries of the platforms in the 1960's, millions of them have been found across Latin America, leading some archeologists to believe that they undergirded the pre-Colombian economy. At least one previous attempt to revive them has been made in Mexico, using modern machinery and methods and lacking the precise, critical specifications yielded by archeological studies.\nBut it fell to Dr. Clark Erickson, an archeologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Museum of Archaeology/Anthropology, to find out how the raised fields worked in practice, how they were farmed, what made them so successful and therefore so widespread.\nDr. Erickson, who was at the University of Illinois when he and the interdisciplinary team he headed did the work, has described it in detail in two reports scheduled for publication next month and next spring. The work began in 1981 and is continuing.\nHe did not set out to devise any practical, modern-day application, he said in an interview. Going beyond the usual and familiar excavation techniques that are the mainstay of archeology, he undertook an exercise in experimental archeology, a branch of the science in which investigators try to recreate ancient conditions and put to use ancient artifacts as a way of answering scientific questions. In this particular exercise, near the Peruvian community of Huatta on a northwestern bay of Lake Titicaca, Dr. Erickson sought to use the findings of his excavations to re-create, in real life, not only the fields but the way in which the ancients had organized and cultivated them.\nWhen that had been done and the results were in, he said, ''we realized it was such a fantastic system that maybe it could be re-introduced to the region as a replacement for some of the capital-intensive systems'' of farming that depend on machinery, fertilizer and lots of money.\nEroded remains of the pre-Colombian raised-field platforms and canals of various sizes cover more than 200,000 acres of the low-lying plains around Lake Titicaca. The raised platforms of earth that were central to the technology generally range from 13 to 33 feet wide, 33 to 330 feet long, and about three feet high. It is on these earthen platforms that crops were planted. Between them are canals of like size and depth. The platforms were constructed of earth, including topsoil, that was removed to make the canals.\nBy analyzing soil and ancient pollen from the platforms and canals, Dr. Erickson's team learned that the sediment in the prehistoric canals was much richer in plant nutrients than the soil of the plain that surrounded them. The investigators also found pollen grains of potato and quinoa, a high-protein grain that grows in the United States as a weed called lamb's quarters but has been domesticated as a major food crop in South America since ancient times.\nUsing radio-carbon dating and other techniques, the team found, to its surprise, that the system of raised fields and canals dated to about 1000 B.C., making it not a brief, late phenomenon, as had been previously suspected, but apparently one of the earliest and most stable forms of intensive agriculture. Successive layers indicated that the fields had been re-built several times from about 1000 B.C. to about 1,400 A.D.\nOver the centuries since, the platforms were eroded and the canals filled in to such an extent that their original dimensions were hidden. The archeological excavations stripped away that veil, revealing the original canal depth and ridge spacing, and these dimensions were used in the experimental phase of the project. Reconstruction of some of the fields began in 1981. Cultivation has continued since, and Dr. Erickson estimated that up to 200 acres are now being cultivated.\nTraditional Andean tools, including a prehistoric plow operated by foot, were used to dig the new canals. Teams of three people were found to be the most efficient work unit. Two used footplows to cut blocks of sod from the old canals between the ridges, while the third tossed the sod blocks onto the field surface. This produced a layer of rich topsoil on the raised platform. Typically, 10 to 50 such groups from the same locality would work a given field.\nDuring the first five years of experimentation, potato yields averaged 10 metric tons per hectare compared with 1 to 4 metric tons on surrounding conventional fields. This was so, Dr. Erickson reported, even though the conventional fields used fertilizers and the experimental fields did not. What the experimenters did use was the green algae that collected in the bottom of the canal, rich in nitrogen, that was shoveled onto the platforms during the dry season. Archeological evidence suggests that the ancients did the same thing.\nThe added nutrients meant that it was not necessary for the fields to periodically lie fallow. t Water in the canals enabled the experimental crops, including particularly large stands of grain, to survive a severe 1983 drought that caused widespread crop loss elsewhere in the area. The fields' elevation enabled them to survive the worst lake flood in years, in 1986, while crops in other fields all around were inundated. And by retaining solar radiation, the canal water warmed the raised fields and the air above them, limiting the danger of frost.\nThe larger the complex of raised fields and canals, Dr. Erickson said, ''the better for the microclimate effect.'' In the experiment, communal land-holding groups of Quechua Indians, ranging in size from 30 to 150 families, banded together to create and cultivate the fields. Smaller extended family groups can also do it, said the archeologist.\nBecause of this, and because the method is inexpensive and simple in its very sophistication, raised fields ''may be an economical and ecologically sound alternative to agricultural development based on expensive imported technology,'' Dr. Erickson has written in an article for publication in ''Expedition,'' the University Museum's journal.\nWhy did the technology die out originally? Does it make sense to put it back into operation without knowing the reason?\nSeismic activity, massive floods or droughts, climatic changes: All, Dr. Erickson said, have been advanced as explanations but not proved. Dr. Erickson believes that the field system expanded to support population centers that grew up in pre-Inca antiquity. When power and influence shifted to other areas and empires rose and fell, he suggests, fields were withdrawn from production and abandoned and the art was forgotten."

      "text": "ARMY SEEN AS KEY FOR BANGLADESH\n1987-11-15T05:00:00.000Z\nImmediately before this week's anti-Government riots, President H. M. Ershad dropped in on some of his constituents. Among the stops was the Ninth Division headquarters of the Bangladesh Army, where he announced financing for a new mosque.\nThe President told the soldiers on that visit that if God willed it, he would return to offer prayers when the mosque was built.\nTo many politicians, General Ershad was implicitly appealing for support at a time of rising unrest over his regime. Now after a week of sputtering and inconclusive protests, the army is still widely seen as holding the key to the country's future.\nProtesters resumed their drive to oust the President today, staging a half-day strike and setting off a few explosions in Dhaka and other cities. The police fired in the air to disperse rock-throwing protesters in the capital, but in general the agitation appeared to be subsiding. Army Ousted Other Leaders\nAs a result, many analysts now doubt that General Ershad's political opposition can topple him. Instead, they are focusing on whether senior army officers have become dissatisfied enough with the President's handling of the situation to oust him, as they have many times with past leaders.\nThe opposition's strategy has therefore evolved into the hope that the army might step in and appoint a caretaker government that would call for elections. Others say that this is naive and that the army would be more likely to replace him with another general.\nFor now there is little sign that the army is unhappy, but opposition politicians love to spread rumors. One said he felt General Ershad and his associates seemed unnerved with the onset of the unrest this week and wondered if the army had warned him that failure to control the violence could be his undoing.\n''It all depends on the north,'' a Government official said, using a popular euphemism for the capital's main army cantonment.\nIn a country rocked by riots, assassinations, coups and coup attempts since its birth in 1971, the army has always played a decisive role. Analysts say that because the army ''liberated'' Bangladesh from Pakistan, officers view themselves as deserving to play a part in its development. Seized Power in 1982\nGeneral Ershad, a former army Chief of Staff, seized power in 1982. Like one of his predecessors, President Ziaur Rahman, who also took power in a coup, General Ershad has tried to build up his own political organization to extend his control.\nUnlike Mr. Ziaur, however, the general has not tried to freeze the army out. Mr. Ziaur was subjected to 20 coup attempts before he was assassinated in 1981. But there have been no reports of coup attempts against President Ershad, who has ruled Bangladesh longer than any predecessor.\nThis summer, the President assigned the army the task of delivering relief to flood victims. An aide said he wanted to assure efficiency and honesty, and many diplomats uncomfortable with the army's role acknowledged that it had performed well.\nBut politicians and officials said the President had also doled out patronage, perquisites and - according to many diplomats and others - kickbacks and varying fruits of corruption to the army and Government officials. Becoming Mysteriously Rich\nGeneral Ershad denies the charges, and none have been proven. But critics say many officials and retired generals have become mysteriously rich in recent years.\n''Every new general that comes into power forms a new party,'' an official said. ''Ershad's party is one where the only purpose in life for its members is to continue as a minister. He didn't invent this system. He simply refined it.''\nThe President has often defended the army's prominence, asserting it is a fact of life Bangladesh must accept. This week he acknowledged that army officers were ''agitated'' and ''unhappy'' because of the rioting, but he dismissed rumors that the army was dissatisfied enough to intervene.\n''I'm not God or a prophet,'' he told reporters Friday. ''But I have commanded this army. I know these men. I can say from experience that the army will not interfere as long as I am President.'' Unpopularity Is Insufficient\nGeneral Ershad is generally described as a leader of no great popularity. But perhaps because his rule has not been particularly repressive and because the opposition is identified with the authoritarian rule of the past, any unpopularity appears to be insufficient to spark an insurrection.\n''Ershad may not be a great charismatic leader, but people do not want to risk their lives to throw him out,'' an aide to the President said.\nIndeed, many supporters say he has succeeded by giving the army the minimum necessary role for him to survive and still return Bangladesh to a civilian government.\nThe current round of protests started, in fact, when the President was perceived to have tipped the balance. In summer he pushed through a bill in Parliament giving army officers a nonvoting membership on local district councils. After a clamor of protests, he sent the bill back for reconsideration.\nThe protests continued, however, culminating in the rioting this week and demonstrating that the issue remains highly sensitive."

      "text": "Excerpts From the News Conference Given by Bush in Paris\n1989-07-17T05:00:00.000Z\nFollowing are excerpts from President Bush's news conference in Paris yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times: OPENING STATEMENT\nWell, we've just concluded two and a half days of intensive and productive meetings with the summit counterparts on economic and political issues.\nAnd let me take this opportunity first of all to thank President Mitterrand for his most gracious hospitality.\nThe summit, in my view, was a clear success. We met in a time of sustained economic growth and agreed that the prospects are good for the continued expansion without inflation of that growth. It was against this backdrop that we conducted a wide-ranging discussion on critical global issues, from East-West relations to the growing environmental challenge that we face.\nWe came to Paris at a truly remarkable moment. The winds of change are bringing hope to people all around the world. And who would have thought just a few short years ago that we would be witness to a freely elected Senate in Poland or political pluralism in Hungary.\nI was really touched by what I saw and heard in those two countries - people determined to keep their dreams alive, people determined to see a Europe whole and free. Backing Hungarians and Poles\nAnd that's why America brought to this summit our determination to support the reform movement in Hungary and Poland. People yearning for freedom and democracy deserve our support. And it's because of the community of values shared by these summit countries that we were able to agree to meet soon to discuss concerted action that'll help Poland and Hungary.\nDemocracy and economic growth go hand in hand, whether in Eastern Europe, the Summit Seven, or the developing world. And, therefore, much of our discussion here in Paris centered on economics. We reaffirmed our international economic cooperation and our whole policy coordination process.\nOur strength and debt strategy was firmly supported. We reaffirmed our determination to maintain and improve the multilateral trading system, calling for the completion of the Uruguay Round by the end of 1990 and extending the GATT to new areas, including agriculture.\nThis summit marked a watershed on the environment. And we agreed that decisive action is urgently needed to preserve the Earth. We committed to work together as well as with the developing world to meet our responsibility of global stewardship. 1990 Meeting in U.S.\nThe measures we've agreed to in Paris are timely and they lay the groundwork for further specific steps when we meet again next year in the United States.\nAnd, finally, I was especially pleased to find that my colleagues share our sense of urgency and sense of the importance of the worldwide fight against drugs. Among other steps, we agreed to establish a financial action task force to find new ways to track and prevent the laundering of drug money.\nI look forward to meeting my summit colleagues in the United States next year as we continue working on these and other priority issues, build on the progress that we made -genuine progress that I think was made here in Paris.\nAnd I might say that I was very pleased that this meeting coincided with the bicentennial here. It was a very moving experience for all of us. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Gorbachev's Offer Now I will be glad to take any questions. Helen.\nQ. Mr. President, . . . Mr. Gorbachev wants to play a part in the world economic discussions. Would he be welcome at the next economic summit table?\nA. Well, I think that's a little premature. But it was very interesting, I found, that a leader of the Soviet Union would address a letter to the French President as head of this year's summit. We talked about that letter a great deal. There's an awful lot that has to transpire in the Soviet Union, it seems to me, before anything of that nature would be considered.\nWe're talking about free market economies here. And, but - I found fascinating the very fact of the letter. But there was no -there certainly - I don't think any indication that the next - that he will be attending the next summit. He'll get a very courteous and very thoughtful reply from Mr. Mitterrand. Role of Small Nations\nQ. How about the . . . countries - Bangladesh - would they ever be welcome?\nA. Well, this is an economic summit of countries whose economies were drawn together by the free economies of the West. And so I don't think there's a question at this point of expanding the summit. There is concern about the economies in the world that aren't doing so well.\nNow Bangladesh is a country that does need aid and, indeed, the communique addressed itself to trying to help Bangladesh. Yeah. Wait a minute, excuse me, Terry, and then go.\nQ. Mr. President, you've consulted with the NATO allies on military matters in Brussels, and then you've had an economic summit here in Paris. What's left before you sit down with Mr. Gorbachev for a superpower summit?\nA. A little more time, I think.\nQ. Don't you have anything to discuss with him now that you've got all this groundwork laid?\nA. Oh sure. Let me explain to those who aren't familiar with the policy that Secretary Baker had met a couple of times with Mr. Shevardnadze. There will be another such meeting of that nature. And at an appropriate time, I will have a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev. But I don't think anything at the summit influences a bilateral - that bilateral meeting. Criticism on Environment\nQ. Mr. President, the summit calls for decisive action on the environment, but various environmental groups are saying that you did not take decisive action. Could you respond to that?\nA. Well, I did see some one or two groups. They didn't think I took decisive action when I sent up - or took proper action when I sent a very far-reaching clean air proposal up to the Congress. And so some have been critical.\nMany have been supportive on the broad -the very fact - I'll tell you where we got a lot of support is the very fact that the communique addressed itself with some specificity to various environmental goals. The whole concept of cooperation on research technology and transfer to the L.D.C.'s; the prevention of pollution; the idea of setting up monitoring stations so we can better predict and thus avoid environmental disaster.\nThere were - there was a lot of common ground - in fact, I would say that on that and perhaps anti-narcotic, there was most fervor. And so I think many environmental groups see the very fact that this matter was on the front burner as being very positive. And the summit did take - make strong enough statements to commit all of our members and hopefully others around the world to sound environmental practice. Poland and Hungary\nQ. Mr. President, you promised in Poland and Hungary that you would seek concerted action on the part of the countries meeting here to help those countries. Now there seems to have been a pledge that there would be concerted consideration of actions - no dollar figure attached and no specified action promised - and a meeting apparently planned. Do you feel you got what you wanted, sir?\nA. I think so. And you'll notice, Brit, that in both Poland and Hungary I stopped well short of setting dollar figures or challenging others to meet dollar figures. But on this one let there be no doubt there was unanimity that we should address ourselves to the problems of Poland and Hungary, and so I was not disappointed. I didn't go in there with a specific package of - with dollar figures on it. And I think an early meeting to do just that is good.\nIt called for food aid to Poland; that's specific. It doesn't have a figure on it, but - no, I think we got what we sought. And there was no rancor on that question, and no division on the question. But there was unanimity that we have to move on it. Yeah, Owen. Reaction to Gorbachev\nQ. . . .What is an appropriate response from the West to such an extraordinary request by Mr. Gorbachev to become part of the economy of the Western democracies?\nA. We would welcome any movement by the Soviet Union towards market-oriented or Western economies. There's no question about that. And there's nothing begrudging about our saying - in replying to Helen's comment - in my replying to Helen's that I don't expect Mr. Gorbachev to sit as a member of the - at next year's summit. But the discussion was - it started off by, What do you think he means by this? And a lot of discussion - we'll get the experts to analyze it. And all of that took place. And people concluded that it was just one more manifestation of the changing world we're living in. And that, I think, was the main message. And then where we go from here, his -some of that has been addressed in the communique, because we talked in there about help for the third world. And some of his letter, as you know, was on that very subject. So it was - when it came in, Mr. Mitterrand read it off to the group there and then said, Well, what will we do? And my suggestion was - which he had intended to adopt anyway - that he, as the man to whom the letter was addressed, would reply to it.\nSo that's the way it was. And the fact that it's happening, taking place. The President of the United States can go to Eastern Europe and witness the very kind of change we're talking about.\nI'll tell you - I want to get to the reply to Carl's question here - but the most, almost the most dramatic for me was when Mr. Nemeth, the Prime Minister of Hungary, handed me that piece of barbed wire, tearing down the Iron Curtain between Hungary and Austria. Now who would have thought that possible? And this letter, just one more manifestation of the exciting times we're in, of change. They're moving toward our open system, our free system, our system of free election. And that's the way I would look at the letter in that context. Carl. A Summit in Texas?\nQ. Mr. President, in connection with next year's summit, there's been some talk among some of your people about possibly having it in your own state of Texas, possibly in San Antonio. And I wondered whether you'd like to see that?\nA. Well, I'd have to run that by The Dallas Morning News and see how they felt about it. But that's a distinct possibility. However, it's too early; no decision has been made. The fact that Jim Baker's from Houston and I'm from Houston and Bob Mosbacher's from Texas should have nothing to do with where the next summit's going to be. And there has been no decision.\nQ. That wouldn't mean some discrimination against Dallas because of your roots?\nA. No, none whatsoever. Get that down: The fall elections are up in 199 - ummm. Charles. Style of the Summit\nQ. Let me follow on the question about the summit. These things have gotten a lot bigger than they were originally planned to be. Hundreds of your people, thousands of us. It's your first summit, but you've got to host the next one. Have you given any thought to how you want to do it in terms of style?\nA. No. But I'll tell you the part - and I'm the new boy, the new kid in school - but the part I found most interesting was the unstructured part, the part where you sit with these other leaders, tell them what you think, listen carefully to what they think. And that happened sometimes in the corridors or sometimes before a structured seminar, sometimes at a meal. And I would like to think that the more emphasis we placed on that kind of interaction, the better it would be.\nBut there was no discussion by the Soviet - the summit interlocutors on how to restructure it. Indeed, it went smoothly. And that - I will again say that Mr. Mitterrand handled the formal part very well. But for me, I'd like to see more just plain unstructured interaction between the leaders where you don't just have to talk on the agenda items. Yeah, yeah, John. Money for Space\nQ. It'll be 20 years ago next Thursday that man first landed on the Moon. . . . your Administration . . . to announce on Thursday we're going to go back to the Moon, possibly even to Mars. Can you and Dick Darman find that kind of money in the budget?\nA. Well, you put your finger, John, on some of the real problems - the major problem -on setting major goals for space, space exploration. And whether we will be ready by next week and - or later this week to make any momentous announcements, I'm not sure. I have not made a decision on what we will say on that historic day.\nQ. Wouldn't it be cheaper if you went in with the Soviets on it, though?\nA. Well, that has been suggested. But -and some, as you know, some discussions have gone on, not, I don't think, recently between us and the Soviets on this. But certainly the concept of international is not offensive to me. But we'll have to wait and see, because no decision - we're going to go right across and work our way back down here. Weakening of Economy\nQ. Mr. President, Friday's economic indicators showed some weakening of the U.S. economy. Apparently some of your summit partners expressed some concern about that. What assurance did you give them - and can you give us - that we're not headed for a recession?\nA. Well, you know, ironically, none did express to me their concern about the U.S. economy stalling out. We really didn't get into that discussion. I must say that from time to time it is a matter of concern to me, and thus I've tried to think through with our Secretary of the Treasury and others the concept of how the interest rate structure should be. But I've had no indication from home, nor have we picked up any here, that they felt that the U.S. economy was going to move towards a recession. And that's the thing, of course, that you'd want to guard against.\nOur growth has not been as robust as the growth in some other countries, but it -we're still moving. And when you have a several trillion dollar gross national product, you take a small percentage of growth and it makes for enormous dollar figures in growth. The Soviet Economy\nQ. Mr. President, how much change would the Soviet Union have to make before they could earn an invitation to next year's economic summit? And if you can't answer that specifically, at least could you give us some sense of scale?\nA. Well, one, as you know, I have welcomed the reforms that are taking place in the Soviet Union. But I don't - this concept of the Soviets coming to a G Seven summit has never been, to my knowledge, thought much about until this letter appeared, so there's no standards for entrance into the G Seven.\nThe Soviet economy needs a lot of work. And I say that not to be critical, but certainly that's an objective judgment. The economy is in bad, bad shape. Far worse shape than the, oh, Western economies. And so I think what we ought to do is to encourage the kinds of economic changes in Eastern Europe and, to the degree the Soviet would not consider that an intervention into their internal affairs, in the Soviet Union. And that - those should be the next steps. Welcome the - welcome the interest that was shown by this letter. This wasn't an application for admission to the G Seven; it was saying let's do something in a common way about solving problems around the world. Europe's Future\nQ. Mr. President, you've talked about a whole and united Europe, and Mr. Gorbachev has talked about a common European home. Are they the same concepts, or what is the difference? Is there a difference between the role of the U.S. in those two statements?\nA. Europe whole and free is our concept. His common European home is fine so long as, as I've said earlier, you can move from room to room. And that means a - coming along further on human rights; that means much more openness. It means support them when you see the move toward perestroika and glasnost.\nBut it means an evolution in the Soviet Union. And it means an evolution in Eastern Europe. And we've begun to see it. A Europe whole and free does not visualize a Europe where you still have barbed wire separating some people. Or you still have human rights abuses in one or two of the countries that are egregious.\nAnd so it is whole and free, and the common home theme is a good one. I mean that's a very good theme, and we should encourage it. But we want to see these countries continue to move towards what works, and what works is freedom, democracy, market economy, things of that nature.\nQ. Mr. President, in the meeting of the G Seven, is there room or does - did you sense that the countries want U.S. leadership or they want the U.S. to be a coequal partner?\nA. You mean with the Soviets?\nQ. Yes.\nA. No, I sense that they - that those colleagues feel that we have disproportionate responsibility. I think there's a keen interest in how I will work with the Soviets. There's no question about that. I felt that very clearly. Serious Change in East\nQ. Mr. President, going back to the other day in Poland, an elderly man said that when people talk to you folks about change, just remember that the Communists still have the bayonet. So my question to you is, do you believe that countries like Poland and Hungary are really going to have serious and permanent change, or is there a line that their leaders and that Moscow just won't go past?\nA. Well, no, I think that you've already seen serious change. I think you see the political situation in Hungary, for example, is absolutely amazing compared to the way we used to view Hungary. And if the Soviet Union, instead of taking their troops out of Hungary had tried to tighten down, I don't expect we'd see the kind of change in Hungary that we're seeing today.\nAnd so I'd say that we're a long way from what Gorbachev has spelled out as a common European home, but it's moving. So let's encourage the progress.\nQ. Mr. President,. . . there is a course that's going to lead to a permanent change or again the question is are the Soviets going to step in and pull the rug out from under it some day.\nA. Well, I would quote Mr. Gorbachev's words back to him on that when he told me in New York and what Jim Baker has heard from Shevardnadze and what everybody who interacts with the Soviets here. And that is that perestroika is for real; that you cannot set the clock back; it is going to go forward. And so I would see that as what guides now. However, I have said as long as there are enormous imbalances in conventional forces and in certain categories of strategic forces, the West should keep its eyes wide open. And indeed there was some reference to that in this communique. There was unanimity on the part of the NATO allies that we ought to be cautious and that we - and so to answer your question, it's not done - it's not a done deal. On the Cold War\nQ. As you put all of this together, what you said about Poland and Hungary and Gorbachev asking to join the world economy, as a matter of policy do you see the cold war as over, and do you think the West has won?\nA. I don't like to use, quote, cold war, unquote. That, that, that - there's a connotation, has a connotation of worse days in terms of East-West relationship. I think things have moved forward so that the connotation that those two words conjure up are - is entirely different now. And yet I don't want to stand here and seem euphoric that everything is hunky-dory between the East and the West on arms or on differences in economy or on how we look at regional problems. We have some big differences still.\nBut let's encourage the change, and then I can answer your question in a few more -maybe a few more years more definitively. Yes.\nQ. Mr. President, the summit seven leaders are celebrating a gathering that was so successful it went for two and a half days instead of three. Could you not find another half-day's worth of problems to discuss and maybe resolve, sir?\nA. We were kind of running out of gas. I'll tell, it's been a vigorous experience in physical fitness for me, and I try to stay in pretty good shape. But this one, when you couple the summit with the bicentennial and then tack on Poland and Hungary, I wasn't about to argue that we needed more time and - nor was anyone else. I think the fact that this rather complex agenda was completed in harmony is the fact that ought to really carry the spotlight, not the fact that we finished in advance. There's going to be plenty of opportunities to discuss a lot more problems that exist around the world. The Stealth Bomber\nQ. Mr. President, the Stealth bomber had a couple of setbacks this week. And Senator Nunn, as I understand it, indicated that he's not going to pay for a plane that just taxis. Do you have faith in this project or are you alarmed by the recent developments?\nA. Well, it's Senator Nunn and 250 million other Americans that pick up the bill for it. But if he's not going to pay for it, I mean, it's a, it's a decision that the Congress is going to have take collectively. If Senator decides it isn't a good idea, it's going to be a whale of a fight. But I think that legitimate questions have been raised about this - the bomber. And Secretary Cheney has addressed them very forcefully, giving the Administration's position.\nQ. Mr. President, you're giving away money to Poland and Hungary, and you're talking about spending more money on the environment and there are a lot of needs at home, and now you're in a new budget cycle. Is this the time - and you promised today to reduce the deficit, the U.S. budget deficit - is this the time to announce that it's necessary to raise taxes in the United States?\nA. No.\nQ. How are you going deal with that?\nA. Well, we've already got a proposal up on the Hill and look at it very carefully. And our director of the O.M.B. has done a very good job in sorting out priorities. He's worked -and our Cabinet has given him full cooperation. And the proposals that I have made can be and are included in our budget thinking, not just for this year but beyond. But you put your finger on something that does trouble me. When I come to countries like Poland and Hungary, I wish we did have more, more funds with which to help others, encourage private investment and public-private partnerships and privitization. I wish we had much more to do there or speedily apply to environmental concerns or anti-narcotics cooperation.\nSo I don't want to sound like we have it all made at all. We've had to sort through priorities in a very complicated way. But to answer your question, you have to go up to the question that was earlier asked about the economy itself. And I do not want to risk screeching growth, modest though it may be, to a halt by raising revenues in the way that some have suggested. Democracy and Economy\nQ. All through Eastern Europe you talked about two themes constantly. One, encouraging democracy and . . . market economy and, two, that you weren't there to try to raise tensions with the Soviet Union or challenge them in any way. But my question is, if what you want is carried out . . . democracy and market economy - aren't you really talking about the dissolution of the Soviet empire. And is that what you mean when you call for a Europe that's whole and free?\nA. The Soviet empire, if you mean the imposition of a Marxist system or socialism, in their definition, system on others, yes, I'd like to see Europe whole and free. And - but with the Soviet moving towards market - and they're not there - towards more freedom, towards more openness, they themselves have recognized that their system doesn't work. So you don't run the risks or have the same tensions that we might have had 10 years ago talking about the very same themes I talked about in Poland and Hungary. . . . And this is the last one. I've got to do it for the Houston guy.\nQ. Thank you. Is Mr. Mitterrand free to reply to the Gorbachev letter himself or will it be circulated or would you like to see the letter? How would you like to that to go -\nA. No. I think that he should reply to it himself. He has a good relationship with Mr. Gorbachev. Gorbachev was here; they've had some follow-up, I believe. And the letter was addressed to him, albeit as president of the summit.\nQ. Mr. President, did you, in this summit, achieve all your goals. Do you have the feeling of being the winner No. 1 of the summit?\nA. Well, I pointed out before we came over here that something of this nature ought not to be judged in terms of winners and losers.\nI am very satisfied that the summit achieved its goals. Every other summit leader tells me that it was the best summit they have attended. We're together as how we approach the East. We're together as how we approach the environmental question. I didn't take a question on third world debt, but there's a strong endorsement for the Brady plan. And there was dissension on that approach. So it came together, very, very well.\nMr. Brady - and I shouldn't say this; I know this is going to get me in real trouble -but if the Brady plan looks like it's going to be successful, we may call it the Bush plan. Thank you all very, very much."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-14 00:00:00      \nLocal farmers are worried about their yield as adverse weather conditions are threatening their crops   Farmers of Moulvibazar's Hakaluki, Kauadighi, and Hail haors, along with other haors, have started harvesting their Boro paddies--ahead of schedule--due to adverse weather conditions and heavy rain. Whenever thy sky turns black with thick clouds, the hearts of the local farmers fill with fear, and panic strikes among them, as they worry about whether they will be able to collect this year's harvest without losing some to unfavorable weather conditions. According to the Moulvibazar Agriculture Extension Department, farmers cultivated Boro paddy on 130,031 acres of land against the target 131,252 acres, in the whole district.  Expressing great worry, local farmers Selim Ahmad, Laikujjaman, and Kamruzzaman have already started harvesting as they fear that heavy rain and adverse weather conditions, will cause them extensive loses despite a bumper Boro yield in the area.  It has been observed that due to the heavy rain in the area, water levels of the local rivers and canals have risen to alarming heights. Hailstorms are also responsible for causing immense damage to the Boro yield of the district. Anfar Ali, Abdul Khaliq, Majnu Miah--all Boro paddy farmers from the Bhukshimoil union--told the reporter that they are fearing a flood this year, which could take away all of their yield and leave them empty-handed. \"We have started harvesting. Despite the pesticide attacks on our crops, we expected a good yield, but bad weather has forced us to worry a great deal about the harvest and profit.  \"We are very concerned\"  Commenting on the situation, Haor Bachao, Krishak Bachao, Krishi Bachao Sangram Parishad President Siraj Uddin Ahmed Badshah said: \"People of the haor region have been neglected for a very long time. The government has not implemented their promises to develop the haor areas.  He added: \"The government needs to come forward to save all the haors and rivers of the district, as well as the people living here, from the verge of destruction. Only then--along with natural resources here--the haor will live, agriculture will live, and the local farmers will be able to live.\" Kulaura Agriculture Officer Jagalul Haider said, \"The crop is good. Boro paddy harvesting began in a different way in the haor. Rice is rotten in many places. It will take another week for Boro. There is nothing to worry about. There will be some rain during Chaitra and Boishakh.\" Addressing the issue Moulvibazar Agriculture Extension Department Deputy Director Mohammad Shahjahan told Dhaka Tribune: \"The amount of rainfall in area till now has caused no damage to Boro paddy cultivation in the district. \"Farmers in Hakaluka have already started harvesting their crops. I hope the farmers will be able to collect their harvest without any interruption.  Responding to a question about farmers harvesting their crops ahead of schedule due to the fear of rain and adverse weather conditions, he said: \"Why would the farmers harvest partially-ripened paddy? No-one does that.   \"According to the correct scientific methods, farmers should harvest their cultivation when 80% of their whole yield is ripe, but our farmers wait even longer.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-08 00:00:00      \nAt the end of the Cold War, political scientist Francis Fukuyama wrote a celebrated essay called \"The End of History?\" Communism's collapse, he argued, would clear the last obstacle separating the entire world from its destiny of liberal democracy and market economies. Many people agreed. Today, as we face a retreat from the rules-based, liberal global order, with autocratic rulers and demagogues leading countries that contain well over half the world's population, Fukuyama's idea seems quaint and naive. But it reinforced the neoliberal economic doctrine that has prevailed for the last 40 years. The credibility of neoliberalism's faith in unfettered markets as the surest road to shared prosperity is on life-support these days. And well it should be. The simultaneous waning of confidence in neoliberalism and in democracy is no coincidence or mere correlation. Neoliberalism has undermined democracy for 40 years. The form of globalisation prescribed by neoliberalism left individuals and entire societies unable to control an important part of their own destiny, as Dani Rodrik of Harvard University has explained so clearly, and as I argue in my recent books \"Globalisation and Its Discontents Revisited\" and \"People, Power, and Profits\". The effects of capital-market liberalisation were particularly odious: If a leading presidential candidate in an emerging market lost favour with Wall Street, the banks would pull their money out of the country. Voters then faced a stark choice: Give in to Wall Street or face a severe financial crisis. It was as if Wall Street had more political power than the country's citizens. Even in rich countries, ordinary citizens were told, \"You can't pursue the policies you want\"--whether adequate social protection, decent wages, progressive taxation, or a well-regulated financial system--\"because the country will lose competitiveness, jobs will disappear, and you will suffer.\" In rich and poor countries alike, elites promised that neoliberal policies would lead to faster economic growth, and that the benefits would trickle down so that everyone, including the poorest, would be better off. To get there, though, workers would have to accept lower wages, and all citizens would have to accept cutbacks in important government programmes. The elites claimed that their promises were based on scientific economic models and \"evidence-based research\". Well, after 40 years, the numbers are in: growth has slowed, and the fruits of that growth went overwhelmingly to a very few at the top. As wages stagnated and the stock market soared, income and wealth flowed up, rather than trickling down. How can wage restraint--to attain or maintain competitiveness--and reduced government programmes possibly add up to higher standards of living? Ordinary citizens felt like they had been sold a bill of goods. They were right to feel conned. We are now experiencing the political consequences of this grand deception: distrust of the elites, of the economic \"science\" on which neoliberalism was based, and of the money-corrupted political system that made it all possible. The reality is that, despite its name, the era of neoliberalism was far from liberal. It imposed an intellectual orthodoxy whose guardians were utterly intolerant of dissent. Economists with heterodox views were treated as heretics to be shunned, or at best shunted off to a few isolated institutions. Neoliberalism bore little resemblance to the \"open society\" that Karl Popper had advocated. As George Soros has emphasised, Popper recognised that our society is a complex, ever-evolving system in which the more we learn, the more our knowledge changes the behaviour of the system. Nowhere was this intolerance greater than in macroeconomics, where the prevailing models ruled out the possibility of a crisis like the one we experienced in 2008. When the impossible happened, it was treated as if it were a 500-year flood--a freak occurrence that no model could have predicted. Even today, advocates of these theories refuse to accept that their belief in self-regulating markets and their dismissal of externalities as either non-existent or unimportant led to the deregulation that was pivotal in fuelling the crisis. The theory continues to survive, with Ptolemaic attempts to make it fit the facts, which attests to the reality that bad ideas, once established, often have a slow death. If the 2008 financial crisis failed to make us realise that unfettered markets don't work, the climate crisis certainly should: neoliberalism will literally bring an end to our civilisation. But it is also clear that demagogues who would have us turn our back on science and tolerance will only make matters worse. The only way forward, the only way to save our planet and our civilisation, is a rebirth of history. We must revitalise the Enlightenment and recommit to honouring its values of freedom, respect for knowledge, and democracy.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-17 00:00:00      \nThe government has increased the allocation for the Delta Plan 2100 to 0.86 percent of the gross domestic product this fiscal year, which was 0.58 percent in the previous year. It has also selected some 80 projects to be implemented on a priority basis, for which about $37 billion or 2.5 percent of the GDP will be spent by 2030. Bangladesh's GDP stood at Tk 2,536,177 crore in 2018-19. The allocation was raised following an assessment of the plan taken in September 2018 with the view to ensuring food and water security and fight disasters. Under the plan, coastal, varendra (barind), drought- and flood-prone areas along with haor, Chittagong Hill Tracts, riverine and urban areas will get priority. The planning ministry organised a discussion on the Delta Plan yesterday at the NEC auditorium in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, where an integrated assessment of the plan was presented. The $4.02 billion Integrated Jamuna-Padma Rivers Stabilisation and Land Reclamation project is one of the major ones taken under the plan, said Shamsul Alam, a member of the General Economics Division, adding that the World Bank has already showed interest in providing $2 billion for the project. Another $5.28 billion project titled 'Construction of Padma Barrage and Ancillary Works' has been added to the list. The project will be implemented after Bangladesh sits and discusses with the country where the river originates from, Alam said, adding that the GDP will grow at 1.5 percent every year if the plan is implemented.  If not implemented, the government will fail to reach its target to bring down the poverty level to zero by 2027, he said. The Delta Plan is an umbrella plan, so it is not necessary that all projects in it would be implemented, said Planning Minister MA Mannan. \"We can add or deduct new projects under the plan also,\" he said, adding that the government will take projects under its annual development programme on the basis of the Delta Plan. The Delta Plan should be monitored continuously by the local experts and changes should be brought if necessary, said Jamilur Reza Choudhury, vice-chancellor of the University of Asia Pacific. Foreign experts would be hired if the local ones cannot do the job, he said. He showed an example of the Padma Multipurpose Bridge where local engineers are responsible for overall management. The planning minister seconded Reza's call to give the monitoring job to local experts. Climate change may cut production of paddy and wheat by 17 percent and 61 percent respectively, according to planning ministry's estimates. About 70 percent of the land in 16 districts, where the poverty rates are rather high, are the most vulnerable to natural disasters, it added."

She made the comment while attending an International Women's Day program arranged by European Union at a city hotel in Dhaka on Sunday, reports BSS. Teerink said not only in Bangladesh but in many countries of the world, women are facing different types of social and economic challenges. \"There are so many taboos in The Netherlands. Only 34% women are actually financially independent there. If a married woman does any job, she has to face different types of criticism, including not spending time with their children and sending their kids to daycare centres\", she said. The ambassador said Bangladesh is doing well in the field of women empowerment. As women still face a lot of challenges here, these should be addressed, besides making the people aware about gender equality, she added. At the function speakers said gender equality is a core principle of the European Union, though it is still not a reality. While sharing the views, they said in business, politics and society, to reach full potential the use of talent and diversity is a must. They said women face too many hurdles and barriers on their way and added in Europe and beyond, women continue to be targets of gender-based violence, stereotypes and hate speech. Even if Europe is a good address for women, one in three women in the EU are subject to physical and sexual violence, they said. The speakers said even though more women graduate from universities, they earn on average 16% less than men do. Only 8% of CEO's of the EU's largest companies are women, they mentioned. The function was told that this is not what EU stands for. Everyone, regardless of his or her gender, should be able to live free from violence and pursue his or her chosen path in life. A change is needed and the moment is now. Everyone needs to remember: progress towards equality between women and men is neither inevitable nor irreversible, speakers at the program said. The EU adopted the EU's Gender Equality Strategy, setting out concrete actions for the next five years, including on pay transparency. The strategy is also the EU's contribution to the \"Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action\" - the first universal commitment and action plan to advance on equality between women and men. The EU will continue to support, promote and protect women's rights and women empowerment, while tackling gender-based violence, including in fragile, conflict and emergency situations."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-08 00:00:00      \nThe government is very serious about recovering rivers from illegal occupation The government has taken a massive plan to recover canals, wetlands and small rivers across the country and re-excavate those to increase their navigability and water reservation capacity, groundwater recharge and thus preserve the biodiversity. These activities will be done under a project titled \"Re-excavation of small rivers, canals and wetlands inside 64 districts project (1st Phase),\" reports UNB. According to an official document, some 4,086.622km of 88 small rivers, 352 canals and eight wetlands will be re-excavated under 561 packages in 375 upazilas and two city corporations. The amount of excavated soil will be 15.15 crore cubic metres, 62.32 square metres of turfing while that of plantable tress 13.41 lakh. The objective of implementing this project is to ensure removing water-logging from 5.20 hectares of areas and securing those from flood and climate-change onslaught, boosting food production of 3.50 lakh metric tonnes through irrigation in 1.30 lakh hectares of land, fish farming in 15,000 hectares, preservation of bio-diversity in 25,000 hectares, flood control in 3.65 lakh hectares, improving roads and communication in 4100 kilometres and easing river communications through 1,800 kilometres of waterways. Meanwhile, the government started removing illegal structures from the banks of small rivers, canals and wetlands on December 12 last year. So far, it has removed 5,574 illegal structures and recovered 593.12 acres of land from illegal occupants. \"If the project is implemented, it will be possible to maintain the normal flow in small rivers and canals besides saving water reservoirs,\" the document states. It further mentions that the formulation of another project titled, \"Re-excavation of small rivers, canals and wetlands inside 64 districts project (2nd Phase),\" is underway. Under this project, the government will re-excavate five rivers, canals and wetlands in each upazila. Through this project, it will be possible to re-excavate 13,885.363km of rivers, canals, and wetlands, according to the document. A senior official at the Water Resources Ministry said the government is very serious about recovering rivers from illegal occupation. As the government is emphasizing the plying of passengers and transportation of goods through waterways, there is no way to increase the navigability of the rivers -- small or big -- across the country. \"The government has already taken various projects to improve passengers and goods' transportation through the waterways within the country,\" he said. He also mentioned by the \"Re-excavation of small rivers, canals and wetlands inside 64 districts project (1st Phase and 2nd Phase),\" will be very much helpful in preserving water during monsoon for the dry season. \"With this, we will also be able to recharge the groundwater which is very much essential for preserving the biodiversity for the future generation,\" the official added. Bangladesh is a riverine country with waterways crisscrossing much of its landscape.  According to experts, re-excavation is very important as business and internal movement of people are largely dependent on waterways, particularly during monsoon. "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-03 00:00:00      \nThe 57-member bloc says all international legal instruments will be used to hold perpetrators accountable The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has called upon the ad hoc ministerial committee, led by Gambia, to take immediate measures to launch a case of Myanmar's human rights violations against the Rohingyas at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on its behalf. It also affirmed its support for the committee on human rights violations against the Rohingyas in Myanmar, using all international legal instruments to hold accountable the perpetrators of the crimes, according to the final communique issued after the 14th Islamic Summit Conference held in Mecca, Saudi Arabia last Friday, reports UNB. Bangladesh is currently hosting more than 1.1 million Rohingyas in Cox's Bazar -- a vast population which is putting immense economic, environmental and diplomatic pressure on Bangladesh. The OIC's call came after Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the conference sought OIC's help in providing justice to the Rohingyas and ensuring their safe repatriation to Myanmar. Some 750,000 Rohingyas had fled brutal military atrocities in Myanmar's Rakhine state since August 25, 2017. Before them, over 300,000 others fled to Bangladesh after several waves of violence. The conference insisted on the importance of conducting international, independent and transparent investigations into the human rights violations in Myanmar -- including sexual violence and aggression against children -- and to hold accountable all those responsible for these brutal acts in order to give justice to the victims. The 57-member bloc also called for ensuring free and unrestricted access to humanitarian assistance by affected persons and communities. They also reiterated deep appreciation for the people of Bangladesh and the Hasina administration for opening their borders and giving shelter to the forcibly displaced Rohingyas, consistently supporting them with the country's scarce resources. The conference called on the member states to come up generously to share the increasing burden of Bangladesh. Myanmar urged to take steps The Myanmar military has been accused of torching Rohingya villages, killing Rohingyas and even raping Rohingya women -- allegations that rights groups say are tantamount to genocide. Even after signing of deals with Bangladesh and UN agencies on repatriation, the Rohingyas say the conditions in Rakhine are not safe enough for them return and there is no guarantee of citizenship and security. Meanwhile, violence in Rakhine is escalating due to fights between the security forces and the Arakan Army in the recent months and further complicating the situation. The OIC summit welcomed various mechanisms established at international level to improve the situation in Rakhine State, and reiterated its support to regional mechanisms -- particularly Asean -- in conducting the necessary needs assessment to identify areas of cooperation in order to create conducive conditions for the Rohingyas' safe, voluntary, and dignified return. The conference also condemned the inhumane situation in which the Rohingya Muslim community lives, and called for urgent action to end acts of violence and all brutal practices targeting this minority. It also urged giving them their rights without any discrimination or racial profiling. It emphasised that the Myanmar government is fully responsible for the protection of its citizens and underscored the need to stop the use of military power in Rakhine immediately. The conference urged Myanmar to take practical, time-bound and concrete steps to restore the citizenship of Rohingya IDPs and forcibly displaced Rohingya Muslims who were deprived of their nationality, with all associated rights, especially the right to full citizenship. It also urged the country to allow and facilitate the return in safety, security and dignity of all Rohingyas internally and externally displaced, including those forced into taking shelter in Bangladesh. It reaffirmed its commitment to the implementation of the resolutions of OIC summits and ministerial conferences."

She said this while replying to a tabled question from treasury bench lawmaker M Abdul Latif (Chattogram-11). \"Bangladesh will be a peaceful, prosperous and developed country by 2041 implementing the vision 2041, which can be compared to the developed world. The governance system of Bangladesh will be decentralised by this time,\" PM said in a scripted answer.

Mentioning that the economy of Bangladesh stands on strong position overall, the premier said the investment is increasing gradually and the balance of payment of Bangladesh remain in good position due to high growth in export and remittance. Inflation remains under control while the budget deficit remains limited within 5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), she further said. In this context, it can be expected that the economic growth will accelerate further in the days to come, she said. \"Bangladesh will turn into a developed nation with $ 16,000 per capita income and the poverty will be a matter of distant past in this Sonar Bangla (Golden Bangla) in 2041,\" Sheikh Hasina said.

Ferdous Wahid, assistant engineer (civil) of the Bangladesh Economic Zones Development Project (Phase 1), told the Dhaka Tribune that they have already achieved 50% progress in site development under the first phase. \"Construction is going on at full throttle, and we are hopeful of completing the project within the stipulated time,\" the official said. He said: \"We expect the economic zone to start its complete operation by 2030.\"  Mahbubul Alam, president of the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI), said Bangladesh's economy would get a boost after the completion of the zone. He said: \"A suitable site has been chosen for establishing the zone. The prime goal of setting up an economic zone is to create employment opportunities by accelerating industrial development.\" \"I think the economic zone will definitely attract the investors from home and abroad. With the completion of the economic zone, Chittagong will turn out to be a leading regional business hub, and we will be able to explore the full potential of our demographic dividend. Besides, it will present us with huge employment opportunities,\" the CCCI President said. BEZA has been working to set up 100 economic zones in all potential regions--including backward and underdeveloped regions--by 2030, and to create 10 million new jobs and fetch additional annual exports of $40 billion, BEZA officials said. It has already identified 74 locations across Bangladesh for the setting up of economic zones. On February 28, 2016, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina laid the foundation stones of 10 economic zones, including Mirsarai Economic Zone in Chittagong."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-20 00:00:00      \nAlready downgraded to Category 4, Cyclone Amphan could weaken further by the time it makes landfall close to the western Sundarbans, experts said yesterday. They, however, expressed concern that it might still wreak serious havoc on Bangladesh as a storm surge, depending on the tide. Md Shah Alam, former director of Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), said the wind speed of the cyclone would certainly be less at landfall than at the sea. He said the storm surge would depend on when the cyclone makes landfall -- during high tide or low tide. Another point of concern was that the cyclone still continued to cover a large swathe of the funnel-like Bay, pushing waters northwards, which would only worsen the storm surge around the time it hits, Shah Alam added. Quamrul Hasan, the BMD forecast officer on duty, said the main feature of this cyclone is its speed, sea surface temperature and radius. Experts said Amphan is only the second super cyclone formed over the Bay of Bengal after the 1999 Oddissa cyclone. This is the first super cyclone over the Bay in this century. The Joint Typhoon Warning Centre said sustained wind speed of Amphan would be just below 160 km per hour at landfall, which would further weaken the cyclone to Category 3. Earlier yesterday, the cyclone was rated Category 5. According to Indian Meteorological Department, 46 severe cyclonic storms were registered in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea from 1965 to 2017. In terms of fatalities, Bangladesh was hit by seven of the worst cyclones recorded in history, with the Bhola Cyclone killing between 3 to 5 lakh people in 1970. The cyclone had brought a a 20-feet storm surge. \"The most serious threat posed by Amphan is its potentially catastrophic storm surge. Even if Amphan's top winds weaken, the storm surge threat will remain dire,\" said Weather Underground, a commercial weather forecast organisation. Prof Mahbuba Nasreen, director of Dhaka University Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies, said cyclone Amphan is different because of its nature. \"It is stronger than Sidr and Ayla. People are terrified of the novel coronavirus pandemic and this cyclone would be a double blow to them,\" she said. Mohan Kumar Das, a fellow at the Institute of Water and Flood Management of BUET, said the surface temperature is very high and sustained wind speed remains high too. \"Cyclone Amphan had turned to Category 5 from Category 1 within just 18 hours,\" he said about the uniqueness of the cyclone.

However, with advice from agriculture officers, farmers found a solution in the floating seedbed technology. This year the Brahmaputra river rose 150 centimetres above danger mark, the highest in two decades, and inundated croplands including aman seedbeds. According to district agriculture extension office, aman seedlings on 2,881 hectares of land in Gaibandha went under five to seven feet of standing water, damaging all prospect of transplanting the seeds in the next phase of aman cultivation. Instead of waiting for the water to subside for preparing regular seedbeds on land, the agriculture department advised farmers to prepare floating aman seedbeds on the floodwater. This way the saplings will be ready for transplantation in time within the aman cultivation season and also not get damaged if another flood occurs.  While visiting the flood ravaged unions of Sundarganj upazila, farmers were seen sowing aman seeds on floating beds made from heaped up water hyacinths and mud. \"I have prepared two floating beds as suggested by our upazila agriculture officer and sowed seed of BRRI- 51 aman variety. The seedlings can later be transplanted to cover four and half bighas of land,\" said Raju Mia, a farmer of Ramjibon union in Sundarganj upazila. BRRI- 51 aman, a flood tolerant variety suitable for flood prone areas, specially char lands along river basins, survives for two weeks under water, said SM Sarower Hossain, sub-assistant agriculture officer of Ramjibon union. Another farmer Rafiqul Islam of Bochagari village in Kapasia union, said \"My aman seedbed on five decimals of land, which could have been transplanted on five bighas of land, got damaged in the recent flood. The land would remain fallow if I do not arrange aman seedlings in time\". When asked why Rafiqul did not prepare floating seedbeds, he said, \"I don't know how to do so but I will talk to the agriculture department and try to start it soon.\" Syed Reza-e-Mahmud, Upazila Agriculture Officer (UAO) of Sundarganj said at least 32 floating seedbeds have already been prepared in different areas of Sundarganj Upazila, some people have leased water bodies to prepare floating seedbeds to sell saplings commercially. Deputy Director S M Ferdous of the Agriculture Extension Directorate, Gaibandha, said, \"As per instruction of the agriculture ministry, we have selected 56 farmers of seven upazilas of the district, trained them, and gave each of them an incentive grant of Taka 1165 to prepare floating seedbeds.\" This will encourage other farmers to follow suit, he hoped."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-02 00:00:00      \nTeesta deal remains uncertain; Indian foreign secretary says NRC, CAA will have no impact on Bangladesh; Modi's Dhaka visit would fully exemplify India's strong sentiment of goodwill  Visiting Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla has said within 2020, New Delhi expects to finalize deals with Bangladesh regarding water sharing of seven common rivers, except the Teesta River. He said both the countries need to expedite harmonization the data of water flow of the rivers so that water sharing can be finalized as early as possible. Shringla made the statement while addressing a seminar on Bangladesh-India relations as the keynote speaker at a Dhaka hotel on Monday, reports BSS. Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) and Indian High Commission in Dhaka jointly organized the seminar titled \"Bangladesh and India: A Promising Future.\" The Indian foreign secretary, however, appeared to be uncertain about the deal on Teesta River saying an agreement on water sharing of this particular stream could only be finalized on the basis of consensus of all the stakeholders, an apparent reference to India's West Bengal state. Prime Minister's International Affairs Adviser Dr Gowher Rizvi attended the program as the chief guest. Shringla, who previously served as Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka, however, said the Indian side was working on concluding the process of the agreement as early as possible. \"We know this is an emotive issue on both side of the border but there is no diminution of the commitment of our government,\" he told the seminar. In August last, Bangladesh and Indian agreed on preparing a framework on interim water-sharing agreements on seven rivers -- Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla, Feni and Dudhkumar. Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Riva Ganguly Das and BIISS Chairman Fazlul Karim also spoke at the program, among others. The Indian foreign secretary said India and Bangladesh recognize there is ample room for progress on each of the rivers that both the neighbours share while serious dialogue has resumed between the officials responsible for water sharing matter since August 2019. \"Let me assure our friends here that we remain committed to finding the best possible solutions to sharing scarcities and hardships fairly during the dry season,\" he said. He said good arrangements to share waters of the 54 transboundary rivers in fair and environmentally sustainable manner lies in broader national interests of the two nations. India sees no NRC, CAA impact The visiting Indian secretary said the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will have no impact on Bangladesh, reports UNB. \"These are purely internal to India,\" Shringla said. \"Let me clearly state here what our leadership has repeatedly confirmed at the highest level to the government of Bangladesh: this is a process that is entirely internal to India. Therefore, there'll be no implications for the government and the people of Bangladesh. You've our assurance on that count,\" he explained. Modi's visit India's top foreign ministry bureaucrat said Narendra Modi's Dhaka visit later this month would fully exemplify \"India's strong sentiment of goodwill, trust and respect for Bangladesh\". Indian Prime Minister Modi has been specially invited to participate in the inaugural ceremony of Mujib Year later this month. \"We are looking forward to this visit ... because Bangabandhu is just so iconic - as a globally-recognized statesman and iconic symbol of liberation for Bangladesh and for our subcontinent,\" he said. In India, he said: \"There is a special resonance to his name. He is as revered and as remembered in India, as he is here in Bangladesh.\" Rohingya issue The Indian foreign secretary said there is also often interest and sometimes \"uninformed speculation\" about their position on the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine State of Myanmar, and its impact upon Bangladesh. \"Let me clearly say that India is deeply appreciative of the spirit of humanism that motivated Bangladesh to offer shelter to nearly one million displaced people. And we fully recognize and sympathize with the enormous burden that you're facing. \"As the only country that's an actual neighbour of both Bangladesh and Myanmar, we're committed to offering the fullest support for any mutually-acceptable solution that'll enable the earliest possible return of displaced persons to their homes in Rakhine State and to a life of dignity,\" he said adding that this should be done in a manner that is \"safe, secure and sustainable\". Border killing Responding a question why border killings still took place after both border guards agreed to use non-lethal weapons the Indian foreign secretary attributed the incidents to cross-border criminal activities.  He claimed that the casualty figures of Indians was equal to that of Bangladeshis but acknowledged that the border killing issue was consistently coming up in Bangladesh-India relationship. \"It is the responsibility of border forces on both sides to ensure that the border is respected and the place is kept safe stopping criminal activities,\" Shringla said adding that \"every death on the border was something that was a problematic issue. Shringla suggested improving security, creating zero criminal activities, more cooperation, more joint patrolling and common border management plan, and bringing deaths zero level along the frontier. Trade issues Shringla said they are also working more closely to simplify and expand trade as easier and simpler trading systems offer them scope to generate wealth and create jobs on both sides. He said there is enormous untapped potential for businesses to establish footholds in each other's market. \"And we, as governments, must make extra efforts facilitate our businesspersons and entrepreneurs doing business in each other's country.\" Shringla arrived in Dhaka on a two-day visit on Monday morning and upon arrival at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, he was received by his Bangladesh counterpart Masud Bin Momen."

      "text": "BOOK NOTES\n1989-01-04T05:00:00.000Z\nStalin With Warts\nA book published in 1987 by the Johns Hopkins University Press is scheduled to become the first book on Stalin by a Western historian to be published in the Soviet Union. Moreover, the Soviets have promised to allow the author to read and approve the translation before its publication this year.\nThe book is ''Stalin in October: The Man Who Missed the Revolution,'' by Robert M. Slusser, a professor of history emeritus at Michigan State University. It describes Stalin's return from Siberian exile to Petrograd in March 1917 and his editorship of the party publication Pravda during the months leading up to the Bolshevik Revolution the following November. Professor Slusser writes that on the night of the revolution, Stalin stayed in the offices of Pravda rather than taking to the streets to join in the storming of the Winter Palace. Later, of course, Stalin had the history of the revolution rewritten in favor of a more laudatory version of his activities.\nJ. G. Goellner, director of the Johns Hopkins University Press, said Progress Publishers, the Soviet publishing house, was reluctant to buy Mr. Slusser's biography in 1987, because it did not think it could get clearance for the project. But after the policies of Mikhail S. Gorbachev encouraged more openness, Aleksandr Avelichev, the head of the publishing house, sent Johns Hopkins an offer. That contract was eventually signed in Boston.\nDuring the Frankfurt Book Fair last October, Mr. Avelichev asked to renegotiate the contract to increase the print run to as many as 200,000 copies. Mr. Goellner said that when he expressed surprise at so large an order, Mr. Avelichev replied: ''I don't think you understand what a big event this is going to be. We have nothing on Stalin in this country except what Stalin wanted written. This will open the door through which our own historians can now walk.'' Titles That Scan\nAlex Shoumatoff has written eight books of nonfiction, ranging from his search for his Russian roots to accounts of his travels in many lands. His most recent book, ''African Madness'' (Knopf), consists of four articles, revised from their original appearances in The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, on Madagascar, Dian Fossey, AIDS in Africa and the trial of Jean-Bedel Bokassa, the former ruler of the Central African Republic.\nWhile writing, Mr. Shoumatoff uses working titles that are often vastly different from the published titles, although he stayed with ''African Madness'' for this book.\n''It came to me as a sound more than as a meaning, although I thought there was enough meaning for a good title,'' Mr. Shoumatoff said. ''But from its cadence, you know it's probably by the same guy who wrote 'Russian Blood,' 'Florida Ramble' and 'The Rivers Amazon,' '' three of his previous books.\nThe working title for ''Russian Blood,'' Mr. Shoumatoff said, was -what else? - ''Rootski.'' For ''Westchester: Portrait of a County,'' he used ''Beyond the Bronx.'' And his book on the Amazon, published by Sierra Club Books, was ''The Big Amazon.'' When his editor suggested ''The Rivers Amazon,'' Mr. Shoumatoff was dubious. He said, ''I thought, sure, by the man who brought you 'The Brothers Karamazov.' ''\nYet even the most carefully considered titles are not always as distinctive as authors might like. Shortly after publication in 1986 of his book ''In Southern Light,'' based on his travels in Zaire and along the Amazon, Mr. Shoumatoff asked at a store in Manhattan whether it carried the book. The clerk said yes, and directed him to ''Southern Light,'' a fictional interpretation of the story of Genesis by J. R. Salamanca. When Mr. Shoumatoff tried again, he was directed to the travel section. ''I thought, that's more like it,'' he said, ''until I saw 'South Light,' by Michael Parfit, a book about the Antarctic.''\n''One of these days,'' Mr. Shoumatoff said, ''I'm going to invite those other two authors for a drink at the Algonquin and propose that we publish all three books in one bound edition.'' Profits to the Poor\nDominique Lapierre's book ''The City of Joy'' (Doubleday) is about the impoverished people of Calcutta, India, to whom the author promised 50 percent of the royalties. Since its publication three years ago, the book has sold about five million copies worldwide and Mr. Lapierre said it had earned the poor about $1 million - along with much more from the donations that accompanied many of the 70,000 letters from readers.\nThat money, Mr. Lapierre says, has been used to finance a number of projects in whole or in part: a home, schools and a training center for 150 children of lepers; three rehabilitation centers for lepers; three homes for 125 physically and mentally handicapped children from the slums; a medical dispensary in Bhangar, an area south of Calcutta in which as many as 700 patients are treated each day; a mobile medical dispensary in a remote area of the Ganges delta, and a home and school for 75 orphan children from an area near Bangladesh.\nMr. Lapierre and his wife, who also donated solar energy water pumps to 10 drought-afflicted villages in India, were recently made honorary citizens of Calcutta."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-29 00:00:00      \nThe standard narrative of the Southeast Asia plastic crisis has a puzzling blind spot. The typical story goes that consumers and governments shoulder all the blame--consumers for using and then tossing out too much plastic, and governments for not instituting adequate waste management systems. But that narrative obviously doesn't tell the whole story. One example of this narrative: A 2015 McKinsey report that deals specifically with plastic contamination of the world's oceans points out that \"more than half of the plastic leaking into the ocean comes from just five countries: China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.\" A reader who picks up the report and thumbs through the section that poses the question \"What are the origins of ocean plastic debris?\" could be forgiven for thinking that this all of this plastic pollution is immaculately conceived in these countries. Disposable plastic is billed as a world-changing innovation and the large multinational companies that produce, market, and sell goods packaged in plastic are completely left out of the equation.  Reports like these often take for granted that these plastic products must exist and that companies bear no responsibility for their products once they've released them into global marketplaces. The lack of any accountability for corporations in studies like these is baffling. Companies flood the market with cheap plastic and give consumers no viable option but to purchase these products that are designed to be used and then immediately discarded. Many of these products, like the plastic-and-aluminum-laminated sachets that carry everything from tomato sauce to shampoo are actually impossible to recycle or reuse. Particularly in the wake of China's refusal to accept plastic waste and the winding down of the country's massive recycling operation, much of the plastic these companies produce is destined to become pollution from the very point of its creation. But an innovative type of study released last week in the Philippines wants to get away from this narrative trend. Instead, the report audits plastic waste and then goes on to actually name the corporations that are responsible for the bulk of the identifiably branded plastic waste. The Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, which produced the report with the help of tools developed by the NGO Mother Earth Foundation hopes its findings stand as a wake-up call that \"single-use, disposable plastic--not the way it is managed--is the problem.\" This report, which compiled data from 21 waste assessments carried out in six cities and seven municipalities across the Philippines, found that nearly 55 percent of the residual waste--meaning plastic that cannot be recycled--can be identified as coming from recognizable brands. The top three offending companies--Nestle, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble--created one-third of the branded non-recyclable waste.  While this report focused exclusively on the Philippines, other Southeast Asian countries would do well to carry out this type of audit, and the subsequent naming of brands that drive plastic consumption. When countries, organizations, and consumers better understand the true origin of many of these plastic products, they can be better equipped to take action. Although the task of forcing corporations to reclaim responsibility for the single-use plastic waste they generate will take a globally coordinated effort unlike any that has ever existed before.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-12 00:00:00      \nIt is alarming given the fact that only 15 percent of the ilish caught in the previous year had eggs in them, officials said After a 22-day fishing embargo, about 90 percent of the ilish available in Khulna and Chandpur markets are full of eggs, triggering fears of poor production in the next season and prompting calls for extending the fishing ban, reports news agency UNB. It is alarming given the fact that only 15 percent of the ilish caught in the previous year had eggs in them, officials said. Eighty-five percent of ilish caught in Khulna this time contain eggs, said Bangladesh Fisheries Development Corporation Manager of Khulna region Md Jahidul Islam. He said the wholesale markets at Boro Rail Station fish jetty in Chandpur, and those along the shore, are packed with ilish with eggs since 90 percent of the catch is pregnant ilish.  The government had imposed a 22-day ban from October 9 to October 30 on catching, selling, storing, and transporting ilish during its peak breeding period. But the mother ilish could not complete releasing the eggs.  Consequently, shoals of mother ilish full of eggs have been caught by fishermen after the ban was lifted. The lack of rainfall delayed the cycle. \"Ilish breeding is related to rainfall,\" said Professor Abdul Wahab, who is leading the ECOFISHBD Project of WorldFish. Bangladesh's southern region did not receive much rain this monsoon. It recorded only 143mm of rainfall in June and 235mm in July. Last year, it was 220mm in June and 367mm in July. Prof Wahab said he was surprised that most of the fish contained eggs. Fish traders in Chandpur said the production will fall if the breeding is not protected. They feared the national fish will face extinction if mother ilish continues to be caught at this rate.  They say the fishing ban during the breeding season should have been extended by 10-12 days.  Chandpur Fisheries Officer Md Asadul Baki claimed the drive to protect mother ilish was successful. \"That is why the fishermen have been able to catch a huge quantity of ilish,\" he said, claiming that 80 percent  of the ilish have released eggs.  Dr Anisur Rahman of the Fisheries Research Institute said they need a few more days to determine the percentage of mother ilish that have released eggs.  In Khulna, ilish weighing 1 kg was selling at Tk 800. The same size of fish is selling at Tk 700 in Chandpur. But the huge supply of the fish is hardly making people happy.  \"Ilish with eggs don't taste good,\" one of the buyers said."

      "text": "BANGLADESH GETS PLEDGE OF MILLIONS FOR FLOOD RELIEF\n1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z\nDonor nations have pledged millions of dollars in aid to Bangladesh, where the worst flooding in 70 years has left much of the country under water and as many as 28 million people homeless or stranded.\nAfter an urgent international appeal for aid by the President of Bangladesh, Lieut. Gen. H.M. Ershad, the United States has initially pledged nearly $3.6 million in food, transportation and other emergency aid, the State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said today.\n''We continue to be in touch with Bangladesh authorities to see what other assistance we might be able to provide,'' he said. Japan Pledges $13 Million\nJapan, which has now surpassed the United States as the world's largest foreign aid donor, has pledged $13 million in food and money for the lease of two helicopters and medical equipment. A Japanese medical team has already arrived in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Embassy in Washington said.\nThe flooding, brought on by brutal monsoon rains that began in June, has brought even more misery to one of the world's poorest countries and, with 110 million people in a land the size of Wisconsin, one of its most densely populated.\nThe most common estimate of the amount of land still under water is 75 percent, the figure used by the State Department and the Bangladesh Embassy here. CARE, which is represented in 80 percent of the country's 65 districts, said 75 to 90 percent of the county was under water. A Village in Trouble\nOne flooded village is Nichkasia, south of the capital, Dhaka, where no relief had been distributed by today and more than 8,000 people were forced to take shelter on a river embankment. A helicopter trip to the area showed water stretching as far as the eye could see, interrupted by treetops and tin roofs, some packed with victims of the flooding. [ Page A8. ] So far, relief officials have been unable to get to most flooded areas, and communications between the capital and outlying regions are spotty at best. The devastation will take weeks to assess. Most relief officials agree that only as the water levels decline will the problems in aiding a homeless population exposed to waterborne disease become evident.\n''Bangladesh is one vast swamp and what you're confronted with is rebuilding a country,'' said Thomas Drahman, the Asia regional manager for CARE. ''I hate to sound hyperbolic, but this could be one of the largest natural disasters of the century.'' Casualty Figures Uncertain\nThere is no reliable estimate of what it will cost to feed, house and provide medical care to the population and rebuild roads, buildings and bridges, but $4.5 billion was the total estimate of damage for the flood last year, which was not nearly as severe.\nInformation is so unreliable that it has been impossible to estimate casualty figures. The official death count of more than 400, from drowning, house collapse and snake bites, is widely regarded as far too low.\nBecause so little is known about the condition of the country, some donors like the United States have been reluctant to pour in large amounts of money and aid until they can consult with relief officials on the most crucial needs.\nAccording to the Agency for International Development, Australia has pledged $241,000, Pakistan $568,000, Britain $927,000 and various United Nations agencies $115,000.\nCanada has pledged about $4 million for food aid and Denmark $275,000, according to the Bangladesh Embassy, which added that India and Saudi Arabia have each lent four helicopters and Kuwait has offered to send four jumbo jets filled with relief materials once the Dhaka airport fully reopens.\nWhy Japan has made such a generous initial pledge was unclear and embassy officials in Washington could not confirm the $13 million figure. But in recent months, Japan has emerged as a champion of the developing nations of Asia, by such actions as initiating its own plan for debtor nations at the Toronto summit meeting and sending money as well as personnel to United Nations peacekeeping operations in Iran and Afghanistan. Immediate Needs Listed\n''Our immediate requirement is ready-to-eat high-protein dry food because people have no cooking oil, kerosene or firewood and cannot cook,'' said Tajul Islam, press attache at the Bangladesh Embassy. ''We also urgently need water purification tablets, medicine for the prevention of diarrhea and anti-snake venom.''\nAfter that, officials in Bangladesh estimate, the country will need three million extra tons of food grains to make up for the lost harvests until January.\nAlthough no deaths by starvation have been reported, private relief agency officials fear that a sizable percentage of the country's 110 million people will suffer malnutrition and even starvation because of the flood, as well as life-threatening waterborne diseases such as cholera.\nFinally, the country will need construction materials for an unparalleled reconstruction effort, including homes, buildings, roads and bridges. Even Worse Conditions Feared\n''It's a major disaster,'' said Rene Bafalis, a spokeswoman for A.I.D.'s Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance, which is coordinating United States Government aid efforts. ''We expect it to get worse before it gets better.''\nOverall flood conditions in the country showed some signs of improvement today, Mr. Redman said, as water levels in two major northern river basins and in Dhaka showed declines. But he said that a number of tributaries feeding into major basins have risen in the last 24 hours, ''indicating that the situation could change rapidly.''\nIn addition, ''fuel and essential goods may become increasingly scarce,'' Mr. Redman said.\nThe nearly $3.6 million pledged in aid by the United States includes 10,000 tons of food valued at $2.5 million, more than 2,000 tons of corn and wheat seed valued at up to $1 million, $50,000 to CARE, $40,000 to Save the Children for food and water purification tablets and $25,000 to be used at the discretion of the United States Ambassador, Willard A. De Pree.\nA.I.D. is also preparing to send disaster management experts to Dhaka to advise on further ways the United States can help the relief effort."

He was addressing a winter clothes distribution programme at Five Star ground at Saidpur upazila in the district. About the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the Dhaka city polls, Quader said they will accept any decision of the Election Commission in this regard as \"we have no fear\". The AL general secretary said elections using EVMs is a modern system. But as election date is approaching, BNP raises questions over EVM and neutrality of poll, he added. Quader said BNP does not do pro-people politics rather it performs politics for the looters or millionaires. \"BNP has public support neither in election nor in movement,\" he said. The minister said the government led by Bangabandhu's daughter Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is a government for the poor people. The government always stands beside people in their well and woes, he added. The AL general secretary said BNP does not stand beside people, who suffer in cold or flood rather they make complaints staying in Dhaka. Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi, State Minister for Relief and Disaster Management Dr Md Enamur Rahman, AL Joint General Secretary AFM Bahauddin Nasim, Rabeya Alim, MP, District unit AL president Dewan Kamal Ahmed and General Secretary Mamtajul Haque, addressed the function, among others. AL Organizing Secretary BM Mozammel Haque presided over the function. According to party sources, around 50,000 blankets will be distributed in Rangpur division under the auspices of AL. The AL general secretary handed over the blankets among the district unit leaders for distribution while he also distributed 3,000 blankets among cold-hit people on the occasion."

Maulana Zubair Hassan, the imam of Kakrail Mosque in the capital and leader of a faction of Tabligh Jamaat, will administer the Munajat seeking blessings and well-being for mankind. Thousands of devotees from home and abroad will take part in the prayer. Tabligh Jamaat, a coalition of Muslim devotees, has been organising the event on the bank of Turag river, near Tongi upazila of Gazipur, every year since 1967. The first phase of the Ijtema is mainly allocated for the followers of Maulana Zubair.  The second phase will be held from January 17 to 19. This phase is allocated for the followers of Indian preacher Maulana Saad Kandhalvi. FIVE MORE DIED IN IJTEMA Meanwhile, five more devotees died at the Ijtema venue yesterday, mostly due to heart attack and old-age complications. With them, a total of nine people died so far since Friday. The dead are Ali Azgar, 70, from Barisal; Md Yusuf, 45, from Narayanganj; Md Shahjahan, 60, from Brahmanbaria; Tamij Uddin, 65, from Cumilla; and Abdur Razzak, 50, from Rajshahi.

Some located their relatives' bodies in hospitals, which have reported 42 deaths till Friday, the Times of India (TOI) reports. Shami Ahmed, like most people TOI spoke to at the morgue in the past few days, hesitated to reveal full names of the deceased. \"My nephew Babbu said he would take his auto and not ply in the locality to avoid the violence.\" Two hours later, they had learned Babbu had been found in a pool of blood, and taken to hospital, where upon reaching he died, Shami said.  A distressed woman was yet to locate her missing husband. \"Dilshad is nowhere to be found,\" a frantic Farha said. \"He left home Tuesday morning and there has been no contact with him since. We have five children. I am at my wit's end.\" Most families have already checked hospitals, the emergency block and the morgue, assuming they would find their relatives, but to no avail. Authorities say situation calmer The situation in northeast Delhi after days of clashes over the controversial citizenship law is relatively peaceful on Saturday, sources told NDTV. The ban on large gatherings, however, is still on in neighbourhoods where mobs clashed.  The Indian Home Ministry has said the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has cleared most of the debris from public places. The authorities said traffic is normal at most northeast Delhi areas and people have started going to work. A few shop-owners have pulled up their shutters amid the scorched urban landscape scarred by petrol bombs and damaged by bricks. The worst affected areas, however, have fallen silent as most of the residents have left. The authorities said these areas will take some time to return to normal. People should \"not believe in rumours and fall prey to evil designs of miscreants and groups interested in precipitating communal tension,\" the Indian Home Ministry said. What happened Indian police said on Friday they had detained 512 people and were keeping a heavy presence in northeast New Delhi, days after the worst bout of sectarian violence in the capital in decades, reports Reuters. At least 42 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim violence this week, police said, amid mounting international criticism that authorities failed to protect minority Muslims."

But her family still awaits implementation of the verdict against the accused in her murder case. On April 6 last, the 18-year-old was set on fire in broad daylight on the roof of the madrasa by people loyal to principal Sirajuddaula, when she refused to withdraw a sexual harassment case her family filed against Sirajuddaula.  After battling for life for four days, she succumbed to her critical burn injuries at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital on April 10, which sparked nationwide outrage and public demand for swift justice against the perpetrators.  On October 24, following a trial all 16 accused were proven guilty, and a Feni court awarded them death sentence under Section 4(1)/30 of the Woman and Children Repression Prevention Act 2000. However, Nusrat's family till this day remain under police protection as they continue to receive threats from Sirajuddaula's cohorts and followers. \"I cannot sleep, thinking of the pain Nusrat had gone through when she was burnt alive,\" said Nusrat's mother, Shirin Akhter. \"We were happy with the verdict and we know the whole country is with us, still I don't understand why the sentence is not being carried out yet?\" she asks with agony. Nusrat's brother Mahmudul Hasan said they constantly receive threats and also have been targeted in social media by the wellwishers of the convicts ever since the murder took place. He said: \"My sister gave her life to fight for her honour and it seems like it has no end.\" The Public Prosecutor of the court Adv Hafez Ahmed said the prompt prosecution of the case could not have been possible without Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's direct involvement and her assurance of providing proper justice to the girl. \"We are satisfied with the verdict. But the ongoing trial should soon be addressed and justice should be given to the family as they are waiting for long,\" the lawyer added. The convicts are prime accused SM Sirajuddaula, who orchestrated Nusrat's murder, Nur Uddin, Shahdat Hossain Shamim, Maksud Alam, Saifur Rahman Md Zobayer, Sakhawat Hossain Jabed, Abdul Kader, Absar Uddin, Kamrun Nahar Moni, Umme Sultana Popy, Abdur Rahim Sharif, Eftekhar Uddin Rana, Imran Hossain Mamun, Mohammad Shamim, Ruhul Amin, and Mohiuddin Shakil."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-14 00:00:00      \nMany hospitals have been turning away patients for fear of Covid-19, with tragic consequences It was shocking to read, a few days ago, that a doctor was not able to manage to get her father, a senior government official with kidney complications, admitted in hospital unless he had been tested for Covid-19 and had a certificate.  According to the reports which I read, she tried to get him admitted to as many as a dozen hospitals, government and private. Without the appropriate ICU treatment, he died. It would appear that these hospitals, collectively, caused the patient's death.  If the country was not in the middle of a pandemic, I would have suggested that this sort of case -- many others similar to this have been reported in the media -- should be investigated by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council as it is empowered by a 1980 act of parliament to \"look after public interest by maintaining proper medical and dental standards.\"  In any case, some way should be found to reprimand the various hospital authorities concerned and the individual doctors who were responsible for hastening the unfortunate death of this man. In addition, it has been reported that dialysis patients who go to hospitals once or twice a week for dialysis are being turned away if they do not have a certificate to say that they are not infected by coronavirus.  Doctors in Bangladesh, on qualification, sign up to a Bangladesh version of the 1948 World Medical Association's \"Declaration of Geneva.\" This is a modern version of what is known as the Hippocratic Oath, which is the promise that doctors make to keep to the principles of the medical profession.  This appalling attitude of doctors reminds me of the many government doctors who refuse to be posted in rural areas at the beginning of their careers. They fail to see that rural experience could broaden their education, including widening their knowledge of medicinal herbs and plants. On another medically related matter, it is good to learn that finally the low cost rapid test kits for coronavirus, developed by Gonoshasthaya Kendra (GK), have been handed over to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) for performance trial. It is understood that progress has only been possible by intervention at the highest level.   There are many in the medical and pharmaceutical fields who have not forgiven Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury, the founder of GK, for his role in the formulation of the National Drug Policy in 1982 which then banned the importation of over 1,700 locally and internationally produced drugs which were either dangerous, or combinations of similar or incompatible ingredients, or because they could be produced by local companies instead of being imported.  A list of essential drugs, in their generic forms, was drawn up for use in all systems of the health care system. This action was met with howls of protest from the transnational drug companies, who feared a serious loss of profits if more countries followed Bangladesh's example. Later on in 1994, the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade liberalized international trade and therefore made such \"restraints on trade\" illegal, thus favouring the interests of large transnational companies. They then became free to flood the Bangladesh market with non-essential pharmaceutical products. A contributory factor to the demise of the drugs policy in Bangladesh was the failure of the Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA) to support it. Many doctors opposed the legislation from the outset, seeing it as a threat to their professional freedom; those who owned a pharmacy had a financial interest in prescribing lavishly. Fast forward to 2020, Covid-19 and the promotion of Remdesivir for treatment of coronavirus. Not yet approved, as far as I am aware, anywhere in the world, clinical trials are reported to have shown that on acutely ill patients, recovery time of 15 days has come down to 11 days. Many companies, including in Bangladesh, are surging ahead to produce the drug, but at what cost?  Figures per treatment have been reported to vary between $390 and $4,500.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-08 00:00:00      \nWithout a collective effort, we cannot fight climate change The global temperature has been increasing since the pre-industrial era. This year, a widespread increase in temperatures continues to affect several parts of the world.  India witnessed its highest temperature in the northern part of the country. Some parts of the country experienced temperatures exceeding 45 degrees Celsius. On June 10, the highest temperature soared to 48C, which was highest temperature recorded in June.  On June 8, Kuwait recorded the highest temperature in the world, reaching 52.2C in the shadows and 63C under direct sunlight.  In early May, parts of Bangladesh experienced searing heat. The highest temperature recorded was 39.5C in Rajshahi. According to a World Bank report, \"South Asia's Hotspots: The Impact of Temperature and Precipitation Changes on Living standard,\" the average temperature of South Asia has increased and will continue to increase, with negative impacts on agriculture, health, and productivity.  The report said that the average temperature of Bangladesh is projected to increase by 1C to 1.5C by 2050. Chittagong has been selected as the most vulnerable to changes in average temperature and precipitation followed by Barisal and Dhaka divisions. One of the major impacts of rising temperature is rapid glacier retreat across countries.  Approximately, there are 150,000 glaciers in the world, excluding large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, which occupy about 200,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.  Over the last 40 years, the glaciers that have been lost or melted are equivalent to a layer of ice 70 feet thick.  The Tuyuksu glacier, 30km (or 18 miles) south of Kazakhstan's largest city Almaty, is melting at an unprecedented rate.  Millions of people rely on the melted waters of the Tuyuksu glacier. In the past 60 years, glaciers equivalent to more than half a mile have been lost.  Between 1986 and 2014, the glaciers of Bolivia have shrunk by 43%, according to new research. Researchers studied the satellite images produced by NASA of the Bolivia Cordillera Oriental and found out that the glaciers had decreased from 530sq-km to 300sq-km. In the long run, more than two million people will be in a dire situation in the dry season. The Himalayan region has lost 13% of its glaciers contributing to a loss of 443 billion tons of glacial ice over the past 40 years.  Himalayan glaciers are a vital source of water for eight countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, and India and capture 10% of the world's freshwater and support irrigation, energy, and the livelihoods of 750 million people living downstream.  Hence, further melting of the Himalayan glaciers will wreak havoc on bio-diversity and economic growth, and lead to food and water shortages of billions of people.  Climate vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh have primarily relied on devising climate adaptation approaches and strategies.  It is imperative for the developing countries to devise climate adaptation approaches in conjunction with mitigation measures to effectively address climate change.  The NGOs of different developing countries should also come forward in this regard. For example, by the end of the year 2019, BRAC's Climate Change Program (CCP) is planting around 200,000 trees in 65,000 households with the intention of sequestering carbon dioxide and enhancing livelihood options in three selected environmentally critical areas that include cyclone, flood, and drought-prone areas of Bangladesh. Also, different mitigation efforts through application of renewable energy technology will be undertaken in conjunction with climate adaptation approaches.  Developing countries such as Bangladesh contribute insignificant greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However, collective efforts may help to minimize the problem to some extent.  Tahmina Hadi is Deputy Manager, Knowledge Management, Climate Change Program (CCP), BRAC."

The populous Indian state of West Bengal took the brunt of Cyclone Amphan, which barrelled out of the Bay of Bengal with gusting winds of up to 185 km per hour (115 mph) and a storm surge of around five metres. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said at least 10 people had died in the state, and two districts been completely battered by one of the strongest storms to hit the region in several years. \"Area after area has been devastated. Communications are disrupted,\" Banerjee said, adding that although 500,000 people had been evacuated, state authorities had not entirely anticipated the ferocity of the storm. With rains continuing, she said the hardest hits areas were not immediately accessible. Federal authorities said they could only make a proper assessment of the destruction on Thursday morning. \"We are facing greater damage and devastation than the Covid-19,\" Banerjee said, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has so far killed 250 people in the state. In West Bengal's capital city, Kolkata, strong winds upturned cars and felled trees and electricity poles. Parts of the city were plunged into darkness. An official in the adjoining Hooghly district said thousands of mud homes were damaged by raging winds. In neighbouring Bangladesh, at least four people were killed, officials said, with power supplies cut off in some districts. Authorities there had shifted around 2.4 million people to more than 15,000 storm shelters this week. Bangladeshi officials also said they had moved hundreds of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, living on a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, to shelter. But officials said they feared that standing crops could be damaged and large tracts of fertile land in the densely-populated country washed away.  \"Fortunately, the harvesting of the rice crop has almost been completed. Still it could leave a trail of destruction,\" said Mizanur Rahman Khan, a senior official in the Bangladesh agriculture ministry. Cyclones frequently batter parts of eastern India and Bangladesh between April and December, often forcing the evacuations of tens of thousands and causing widespread damage. Surge and high tide Surging waters broke through embankments surrounding an island in Bangladesh's Noakhali district, destroying more than 500 homes, local official Rezaul Karim said. \"We could avoid casualties as people were moved to cyclone centres earlier,\" Karim said. Embankments were also breached in West Bengal's Sundarban delta, where weather authorities had said the surge whipped up by the cyclone could inundate up to 15 km inland. The ecologically-fragile region straddling the Indian-Bangladesh border is best known for thick mangrove forests that are a critical tiger habitat, and is home to around 4 million people in India. On the Sundarbans' Ghoramara island, resident Sanjib Sagar said several embankments surrounding settlements had been damaged, and some flooding had started. \"A lot of houses have been damaged,\" he told Reuters by phone. Anamitra Anurag Danda, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation think-tank who has extensively studied the Sundarbans, said that embankments across the area may have been breached. \"The cyclone surge coincided with the new moon high tides. It is devastation in the coastal belt,\" he said."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-05 00:00:00      \nInternational Classic Composite Ltd (ICCL) has been facing troubles to invest Tk 250 crore, as the Dhaka's development authority is not allowing the Bangladesh-Netherlands joint venture knitwear company to use its own land for factory expansion. The company has an export-oriented factory occupying half of the area of its 12-bigha land at Naojur in Gazipur.  It has been trying to set up another knitwear factory using the rest of the land.  In 2015, the company sought approval from the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk) to use the land for industrial purposes. The city's development authority said the proposed land is an arable land under its Detailed Area Plan (DAP). As per Rajuk's recommendation, the company then submitted an application to change the status of the land from farmland to an industrial one, said MA Muttaleeb (Khokan), managing director of ICCL. \"But the Rajuk has been delaying to give approval. Now our Dutch investor is threatening to withdraw the investment from Bangladesh due to the delay in implementation of the project.\" On November 27 this year, the commerce ministry came up to rescue the company and sent a letter to Rajuk with a request to allow ICCL to use the land. The Daily Star obtained a copy of the letter. \"This is my own land and I want to expand my operations. Rajuk should assist me, but it has not been doing it,\" said Khokan who has been exporting knitwear items worth more than $35 million a year employing nearly 5,000 workers. He also said if the proposed factory is set up, another some 5,000 workers could be employed and the export value will also increase. \"I have a lot of work orders from the international buyers, so I want to expand my operations,\" said Khokan who has been catering work orders for European brands Zara, Next and Bestseller. Earlier, the factory owners in Gazipur areas used to collect permissions to establish factory from local municipalities or Gazipur City Corporation.  After the Rana Plaza building collapse in April 2013, it has been made mandatory to seek Rajuk's approval for new factories in an effort to avoid such industrial disasters. Since then, the garment factory owners, especially in Gazipur, Ashulia, Savar and Tongi areas, have been complaining that they are facing troubles in obtaining permissions from Rajuk to setup new units. \"Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association received no written complaint in this regard so far, but verbally some owners have discussed about the issue. Thus, no meeting with Rajuk was held in this regard,\" said Rubana Huq, president of BGMEA. \"Our suggestion is the revised DAP must be approved as soon as possible to avoid confusion.\" On the other hand, Sultan Ahmed, chairman of Rajuk, said if any factory owner submits the documents following the revised strategies of land use, mapping and design, they will get it easily.  \"We will take action if there is such specific complaint with the Rajuk,\" Ahmed told The Daily Star by phone. But, nobody needs to go through the backdoor or paying bribes to any official of the Rajuk, he said adding, \"Anybody can come to the me if he wants. I will solve his problem. I will suggest please come to me I can solve the problems.\" Of the total number of garment and textile factories in Bangladesh, nearly 60 percent are located at Gazipur, Ashulia, Maona, Bhaluka, Savar, Tongi and Mirpur areas.  The factory owners chose the high land of these areas when almost all units had gone under water due to massive flood in 1988.  So, these areas have turned into metropolis as the owners built factories and houses for millions of workers."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-01 00:00:00      \nIf it were before 1983, people would be seen fishing at the exact same spot where children now play football, on Teesta's sandy floor lying arid and barren. The river is no longer blessed with water, except for a few months of the year.  Out of the 115km course of the river flowing inside Bangladesh, more than 100km (from Teesta Barrage to the river's confluence in Kurigram) has completely dried up this dry season. There are small pools of water here and there, and the rest is mere chars. Habibur Rahman, 58, a farmer of Char Hokunda in Lalmonirhat sadar upazila, said, \"Thousands of people living by the Teesta are entirely dependent on its water. Our suffering has known no bounds after the river dried up. \"Due to lack of water, we have to set up water pumps on the river bed to irrigate farms and grow crops like potato, ground nut, jute, maize and vegetables,\" he said. Since the beginning of the dry season (March to May), there has been little water in the downstream of Teesta Barrage built in Dowani area of Lalmonirhat's Hatibandha upazila. \"We are getting 1,500-2,000 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of water at the Teesta barrage point for the last two months, which is the highest in 12 years. But it is barely enough,\" said Abdullah Al-Mamun, executive engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) in Nilphamari. He said the lowest flow was recorded there last year, at 165 cusecs. \"As all of 44 gates of the barrage are kept closed for supplying irrigation water, the downstream isn't getting any water at all, causing it to dry up completely,\" Mamun said. The water flow at the barrage point is inadequate even for the upstream of the barrage. \"We need at least 3,500 cusecs in the barrage area during this period,\" he said. WDB Sub-divisional Engineer in Lalmonirhat Bazle Karim said the Teesta has turned into a desert. \"Mile after mile you would see only chars throughout the downstream. \"There is water here and there, which hardly goes knee-deep. It would be of no use for irrigation,\" he said. \"Because of the unavailability of water, only 30 percent of the char lands used for farming get irrigation, that too through water pumps. The remaining 70 percent, with around 15,000 hectares of land, remains barren.\" Agriculture and fishing have been seriously hurt due to lack of water. Sudhir Cahndra Das, 62, of Daspara area in Lalmonirhat sadar upazila, said once people used to fish, irrigate and bathe in Teesta railway bridge area, 76km downstream of the barrage. \"Now we can't make a living by fishing in the river for 7-8 months of the year.\" The river gets fairly enough water only for a few months from July to October. The rest of the year, it is dry. Things changed after 1983 when India built Gajoldoba barrage in the Teesta, 70km upstream of Bangladesh's own in Dowani area. Before that, the average flow used to be 4,000-4,500 cusecs throughout the river, from Nilphamari border to its meeting with the Brahmaputra in Kurigram. As the Teesta barrage in Dowani, the country's second largest irrigation project, holds up the dry season flow for irrigation, all 102km of the downstream gets no water at all. As a result, only 13km of the upstream has water, albeit not enough, for irrigation. Bidhubhushon Roy, deputy director of Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Lalmonirhat, said agriculture is badly affected in the river basin. \"The majority of the char land and floodplains remains barren due to a shortage of underground water.\" Engineer Karim said as there is no water in the Teesta, the underground aquifers cannot replenish and do not have enough reserve. \"The farmers have to go down 40-80 meters to reach water. If the river had water, the underground water table would be only 5-6 meters away.\" With no water in the river and underground aquifers going further down, the farmers have to pay additional cost for irrigation, making farming expensive. DAE official Bidhubhushon Roy said, \"Farmers need to pay Tk 2,000 to water one bigha of land using the water pump, whereas it would take only Tk 250 if the river had water.\" Shafiqul Islam, president of Nodi Bachao Andolon in Lalmonirhat, said, \"Thousands of people, including boatmen and fishermen, depend on the river for livelihoods. They are left without a living for seven to eight months of the year.\" WDB official Karim said there is no way the Teesta would get water in the dry season if there is no water sharing deal with India."

Mexico, with its $100 billion of debt to foreign creditors, has become the symbol of the strategy of the rich, defined primarily by the Bush Administration, to help such countries reduce their debts and strengthen their economies. Bangladesh is a symbol of the poorest of the poor, a country that needs money from the rich to tame the rivers that overflow and wipe out whole villages, as they did in September. Bush Continues Policy\nEarly in this decade, conservative leaders - President Reagan, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany - confined these issues to the private deliberations of the multinational lending agencies in Washington that they control, primarily the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and to subsidiary agencies of the United Nations. And it is there that the Bush Administration would leave them.\nAsked about the call here Thursday by several of the poorer nations for a conference of the rich and the poor, the President's chief of staff, John H. Sununu, said today, ''The tendency would be not to move in that direction at this time.'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said, ''You don't get solutions to problems by bunching up areas and calling them North and South.''\nMost of the other industrial nations view the issue as the Americans do.\nA previous French President, the conservative Charles de Gaulle, would rattle his allies the same way, exerting influence that exceeded the relative position of France in world affairs. The resemblance of Mr. Mitterrand, however Socialist his orientation, to his predecessor was striking today as he greeted his guests and reviewed the parades. He stood ramrod straight, his eyes cast some miles ahead, barely bending in greeting, smiling while brooding.\nBy inviting leaders of the developing world here, he has forced attention on the American debt plan, Treasury Secretary Brady's approach to helping the countries reduce their debts. Since it was announced four months ago, not a single agreement had been reached between banks and debtors, inviting questions here of its utility and proposals from the poorer nations for a conference of debtors and creditors. Pressure on Mexican Banks\nFor that reason, the Bush team here has been exerting great pressure on Mexico's banks to get a deal sewn up. At the same time, Mr. Brady on Thursday and then the President today met privately with the President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari.\nWhen Mr. Salinas emerged from his discussion with Mr. Bush, he was asked how close he was to an agreement. He held up a hand, with his thumb and index finger an inch apart.\nConcerned that Mr. Brady might not win a symbolic debt accord here, officials have begun emphasizing the importance of the content of the agreement over artificial deadlines. Reminded that the Administration has said it wanted a Mexican accord quickly, Mr. Sununu said today, ''Well, the only distinction I would make is that 'quickly' could mean by Sunday or 'quickly' could mean sometime next week, or sometime next month.'' He was the first official to pedal as far back as a month.\nBut the Administration has left little doubt that it will go to some lengths to get the agreement by Sunday, when the conference ends. On Thursday, officials reported, and Mr. Brady and Mr. Sununu today confirmed, that they were preparing a temporary ''bridge'' loan of $1 billion to $2 billion for Mexico once an agreement is reached with the banks. 'Mexico Is the Key'\n''Mexico is the key to deblock the Brady initiative,'' a senior official of the European Community said here. He said that without a creedible agreement, some Western nations would encourage Mr. Mitterrand to reintroduce a plan of his own that in deference to the Americans he has kept off the summit agenda. It requires new contributions for debt relief to the I.M.F., which adds up to a call on taxpayer funds of the developed countries.\nOf greater personal interest to Mr. Mitterrand, however, is Bangladesh. He proposes that the summit nations join in spending around $6 billion for dikes to contain the country's flood-prone rivers.\nAmerican and West German officials here said that however noble the proposal, it was not only expensive but probably environmentally foolhardy. In building up dikes along river banks, France would alter the alluvial plains that sustain agriculture in Bangladesh.\nThese officials said that for the present at least they expected to be able to reduce the proposal to something more modest. Rather than commit to spending any money, they said, the summit nations would ask that the World Bank prepare a technical study, an approach they have often used in the past to placate French presidents."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-13 00:00:00      \nIn Bogra, flower sellers are concerned as flower sales have fallen compared to previous years In a unique turn of events, Bangladesh will celebrate the Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun, the first day of Bangla calendar month Falgun, on the same day -- today -- this year. The exceptional situation, however, is not the bearer of good news for the country's flower merchants, who make huge profits every year on both of these days that generally falls on consecutive days in February. Pohela Falgun used to fall on February 13. But after the Bangla Academy adjusted the Bangla calendar last year, the day will be celebrated on February 14 from this year on, alongside Valentine's Day. With one day of the celebrations gone, the local flower markets in different districts -- from which florists also sell flowers to the traders in capital Dhaka -- have already reported a slump in retail flower sales.  Also, the absence of buyers -- who are mostly students -- because of the ongoing SSC and equivalent examinations will play a role in this, fear the businesses. In Bogra, flower sellers are concerned as flower sales have fallen compared to previous years. Bogra Flower Merchant Association General Secretary Laxman Das Amit said: \"We have received a smaller amount of flowers from the wholesalers as the prices are high.\" \"Also, as both Pohela Falgun and Valentine's Day will be observed on the same day, we are expecting a fall in our business, otherwise these occasions are generally the most profitable days for us every year, now we have only one day for both,\" he told our district correspondent Nazmul Huda Nasim. In Meherpur, flower demand and price have both gone up; however, florists are expecting a one-third drop in their sales target, reports our correspondent Ashraful Islam. Local trader Tutul said: \"This year, the Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun have fallen on the same day, which is also Friday. So, a dip in sales is very likely.\" In Sirajganj, flower sellers are already experiencing a loss in business. Usually, they sell around 70,000 flowers during the Pohela Falgun-Valentine's Day celebrations every year, but there is doubt whether they would sell even one-fourth of that today. Local merchants said they would surely face a slump because most of the schools and coaching centres are also closed due to the SSC exams, reports our district correspondent Aminul Islam Khan Rana. In Comilla, florists have also reported a slump in sales, and a hike in prices, despite a rise in demand. Apart from citing the same reasons, they said the prices have gone up as they could not import flowers due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, reports our correspondent Masud Alam. Still, there is hope Meanwhile, in Chuadanga, florists expect to sell flowers worth of Tk30 lakh between today and the International Mother Language Day, which would be observed on February 21, reports our correspondent Mehedi Hasan. Local flower merchant Akul Hossain said roses, tuberose, marigold, gerbera daisy and gladiola flowers are trending and are on high demand in the market. \"We hope to make a good profit during Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun. \"Hopefully, the sale will also be high on February 21.\" Demand for flowers along with the cost has also gone up in Nilphamari ahead of Pahela Falgun and Valentine's Day. Local florist Ajgar Ali said he sold flowers worth Tk1.25 lakh since February 1 and expects his sale to go up today, reports our district correspondent Md Taieyb Ali Sarker."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-05 00:00:00      \nBahamians struggle in Dorian's devastating wake  Stunned residents of the Bahamas surveyed the wreckage of their homes and officials struggled to assess the number killed by Hurricane Dorian, as the storm bore down on the South Carolina coast, threatening record flooding on Thursday. The United Nations said 70,000 people in the Bahamas needed immediate humanitarian relief after the most damaging storm ever to hit the island nation. Aerial video of the worst-hit Abaco Islands in the northern Bahamas showed widespread devastation, with the harbor, shops, workplaces, a hospital and airport landing strips damaged or decimated, frustrating rescue efforts. One of the most powerful Caribbean storms on record, Dorian was rated a Category 5 hurricane when it killed at least 20 people in the Bahamas. Authorities expect that number to rise, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a news briefing, as retreating floodwaters revealed the scope of destruction. \"My island of Abaco, everything is gone. No banks, no stores, no nothing,\" said Marsh Harbour resident, Ramond A King as he surveyed the wreckage of his home, which had its roof ripped off and debris scattered throughout. \"Everything is gone, just bodies.\" With telephones down in many areas, residents posted lists of missing loved ones on social media. One Facebook post by media outlet Our News Bahamas had 2,500 comments, mainly listing lost family members. Dorian killed one person in Puerto Rico before hovering over the Bahamas for two days with torrential rains and fierce winds that whipped up 12- to 18-foot (3.7- to 5.5-metre) storm surges. Possible record surge South Carolina was preparing for a record storm surge, potentially reaching a height of eight feet (two metres) at the popular vacation destination of Myrtle Beach, the US National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. The storm was located about 115km south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, at 8am EST (1200 GMT) on Thursday and was headed north-northeast at about 13kph, the NHC said. It was packing 185kph winds. About a foot (30cm) of rain will drop on flood-prone Charleston and many parts of the coasts of the Carolinas on Thursday and Friday, said Bob Oravec, a forecaster with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. \"It's pretty substantial,\" he said early on Thursday. \"It's already raining heavy in Charleston and up and down the coast.\" More than 185,000 homes and businesses were without power along the South Carolina and Georgia coastal areas, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. The streets of downtown Charleston were all but deserted early Thursday as driving rain and strong winds lashed the city. On South Battery Street, a block away from the water, Brys Stephens and his family worked hard to keep the water away from a large gray home with white verandas along the front, the type of home that has made Charleston famous and is a major tourist draw. He was working to reattach metal flood gates to a sturdy high wall fronting the property. \"The gates worked pretty well so far and we've managed to keep water away from the house,\" Stephens said. \"But we've got another storm surge coming later on, so we'll see then if it holds.\" The NHC's storm surge warning covered parts of the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina stretching from the Savannah River and extending to southern Virginia. More than 2.2 million people in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina have been ordered to evacuate, although Florida has avoided a direct hit. Relief efforts An international relief effort was underway for the Bahamas, with a British Royal Navy vessel providing assistance and Jamaica sending a 150-member military contingent to help secure Abaco and Grand Bahama, officials said. Volunteers also ferried supplies to the islands in a flotilla of small boats. \"Let us give of our best in this moment of historic tragedy,\" Minnis said. He also encouraged international tourists to visit the Bahamas, which relies heavily on its hospitality industry. As many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. Norwegian energy company Equinor said it had discovered a spill on the ground outside tanks at its damaged storage terminal in the Bahamas, but was unclear on volumes and had not seen any oil at sea. The State Department said it did not believe any U.S. citizens who were in the Bahamas during the storm were killed. President Donald Trump said the United States was sending supplies, including materials originally intended for any Dorian victims in Florida."

According to the fishermen and traders, Ilish fishes have started coming in from the coastal areas in Hatia, Swandeep, Barisal, Bhola, and Charfashion at the beginning of this month. Jishan, who went to Chandpur from Comilla to buy the fish said, \"We thought that we'd get it at less price, but it's really expensive.\" Dhaka resident Tuhin reiterated that he expected the fish to be cheaper, and added, \"Since it's really expensive, I bought only five kilograms, each kilo for Tk 1,200.\" A worker at the fishing warehouse, Mofiz Uddin said, \"The good quality fish are expensive. Plus prices are always steep.\" Also Read- Ilish production up by nearly 160% in 15 yrs  \"Fishes coming in from Swandeep, and Hatia are comparatively cheaper,\" said Abul Hossain, the warehouse manager. Although, Ilish production has been less in the rivers in Chandpur, the prices of the ones that weigh one kilogram are selling for Tk 1,400 each. According to warehouse workers, Ilish weighing 200-500 grams are selling for Tk 18,000-20,000 per maund. The ones weighing 700-800 grams are selling for Tk 32,000 per maund, and the 1 kg to 1200 grams Ilish costs Tk 45,000-50,000 per maund, and up to Tk 1,200 per kilograms. The prices of per kilo of 1.5 kg Ilish is Tk 2,000. \"Local Ilish from Chandpur isn't really much available. The ones that are available are quite expensive. Even yesterday I sold a two kilogram fish at the rate of Tk 130,000 per maund,\" said warehouse merchant Matin Patwary. He recommended taking time before buying the fish as saltwater Ilish are a bit reddish, while famous Chandpur Ilish, known as 'Rupali Ilish [silver Ilish], is silver-ish in colour. District fisheries officer Asadul Baqi said that in a few days Ilish supplies will increase, and the prices are likely to go down then."

The garden of Jannat, with the waters of Salsabil and Tasneem; the Biblical garden of Eden, and the mythical Elysian fields are all havens of peace, with channels of flowing water, limpid ponds and fountains and surrounded by shrubs and trees, redolent of the fragrance of damask roses and jasmine, orange and lemon, pomegranate and cherry. We all hope to be in such a place one day, a place where we can sink into luxurious languor, freed of our worldly cares, lulled by the perfume of blossoms, the shushing of trees, and the soft plash of water. Meanwhile, in this world, many of us try to recreate, in our own small way, little oasis of beauty for ourselves, sometimes on our rooftops, and if we are lucky, in our own compounds. For the rest of us, there are the neighbourhood parks that are tended with great care, and get better every day.  One afternoon, entirely by chance, I came across a small beautiful park in DOHS. It was quiet and almost empty, except for a few gentlemen. There were numerous trees, and a wide walkway around a lovely central pond, with benches along the water's edge. It looked so idyllic that I immediately sank onto one of the benches with a sigh, grateful to be able to gaze at the tranquil surface of the water. It was so restful and the breeze so fresh, that a feeling of utter calm washed over me. I closed my eyes, completely immersed in the moment. I had a great urge to sit there till evening, look out over the water, and wait for the sunset, and the stars to come out. Water is mesmeric, whether it be in a simple bowl, a beautiful lake, or a sea. Gazing at water soothes the soul, and calms the most restless mind. The sight and sound of it can bring instant serenity for the few moments we allow ourselves to forget our daily cares, put the world aside, and just breathe. For me, in those silent minutes of water gazing, different images flow through my mind. A sense of tranquillity washes over me. Sometimes, memories flood in, of the carefree joy we used to feel as children, a joy sometimes forgotten, but still present in the deepest recesses of our hearts. My heart cools as other visions emerge, of the comfort of a loving family and kind words, all the more vivid, vibrant and beautiful, because time has burnished them with the golden gloss of memory. Sitting near the jacaranda and pink cassia in the park, listening to the cry of the koel, and the cheerful chirping of sparrows, and watching all the other \"kar-o-bar\" of nature were moments of pure perfection. Lost in my thoughts amidst the lovely surroundings, I returned to the present with surprise, and realised that I had things to do and places to be. Refreshed and revived, I walked with reluctant steps to the exit, cheered by the thought that I could visit again whenever I wished.    "

The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) accepted the new proposal during a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the NEC conference room in the capital's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar yesterday. The project, which was initially estimated to cost Tk 128.81 crore, received the green light on March 22 in 2016 with construction expected to last from July 2015 to June 2018. The third revision was made to accommodate changes in layout, incorporate new components, lengthen the project's duration and re-estimate the civil work costs. The first revision saw costs increase by 2.27 per cent to Tk 131.74 crore and the second revision maintained the estimated expenditure while the project's duration was extended by a year. As of June 2019, the BSCIC spent Tk 87.23 crore, or 66.21 per cent of the cost. Some of the major activities to be undertaken for the project are the acquisition of 50 acres land, construction of a two-storey building, a pump house and pump driver quarter, entry gate and boundary wall, and setting up of a deep tube-well and water pipeline. The project is expected to create 5,000 jobs. The meeting also approved the expansion and modernisation of the Amin Bazar landfill at a cost of Tk 786.26 crore. The Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) will implement the project, for which development will begin in July 2020 and end in June 2023. Under the accepted scheme, the DNCC will set up new landfill sites, incineration plants and infrastructural facilities on 80 acres of land for the resource recovery and disposal of medical waste. The DNCC will also develop an environment-friendly and hygienic way to collect, transport and dump waste materials. At the resource recovery facilities, wastes will be recycled to produce biogas and organic fertilisers. The ECNEC also approved five more projects: emergency water supply; widening and strengthening of the Sheikhpara (Jhenaidah)-Shoilakupa-Langalbandh (Shreepur)-Wapda district highways; protecting the right bank of the Jamuna river from Munshiganj to Khanpura and Kazirhat to Rajdardia of Bera upazila of Pabna; protecting the left and right banks of the Dharala river, including flood control in Kurigram sadar, Rajarhat and Fulbari upazila; and protecting the Padma river from erosion in Charbagdanga and Shajahanpur in Chapainawabganj district."

While talking to reporters, Tabith said: \"Use of technology has increased everywhere. I want to make Dhaka an 'intelligent city' which is a new trend around the world.  \"I want to use modern technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), to make DNCC a smart city.\"  Mentioning BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's present situation, he said: \"Please assist me, support me and stand beside me. I want your empathy. I promise you, I will never betray you. I promise that my thoughts and plans will be modern and for the future, not something backdated.\"  Responding to a question on whether he would, if elected, be able to implement his pledges while representing BNP, Tabith said that he would, as he would have the support of the city dwellers on his side. Tabith said that he would also focus on tackling the mosquito menace, curbing air pollution and working on better traffic management, among other things. In his manifesto, he also highlighted the importance of improving the public transport and the waste management system of DNCC, adding that he will reset the running holding taxes by mass hearing.  Tabith also said that, if elected, he will initially have \"rent controllers \"in all the wards of DNCC, so that the house rent rates are fixed through coordination between the house owners and the tenants; every two years a \"rent commission\" will fix the highest and lowest house rent rates in DNCC.  Tabith, in his manifesto, also promised to build at least ten public toilets in every ward of DNCC.  He said that, if elected, he will build three toilets at every main bus stop in Dhaka North for all, including physically challenged people. \"If I get elected as mayor, I will firstly take 60 days work plan for DNCC,\" he added.

RAB said the animals were being used to extort foreign tourists and locals. Shaheen , 25 and Helal 22, were using the elephants to extort money from people. They were each sentenced to two years of imprisonment. Confirming the matter, RAB Executive Magistrate Sarwar Alam said: \"The elephants have been handed over to the Bangladesh National Zoo at Mirpur.\" RAB said Shaheen and Helal were using the animals to block the road in front of Karwan Bazar Hotel Super Star. The duo directed the elephants to put the trunks inside vehicles of foreign tourists in an attempt to scare them into handing over money. \"They were intimidating all the passengers. Passengers of other vehicles in the area were told to keep the money ready for collection beforehand\" the RAB executive magistrate said. At one point the foreign tourists called the police. Sarwar Alam said he and RAB-2 Superintendent of Police Muhammad Mohiuddin Faruqi instructed the elephant riders to leave the road.  However, they refused to cooperate. The elephant riders entered Karwan Bazar on the backs of the elephants; they damaged four private cars. The RAB followed them, instructing them to stop, but they would not heed the warnings and kept proceeding. They were finally detained from the Hatirjheel-Modhubagh area. \"After interrogating them we found out they have been roaming different parts of the capital for a long time extorting money from people,\" Sarwar Alam said."

      "text": "THE WORLD; A Guide to Some of the Scariest Things on Earth\n1988-12-25T05:00:00.000Z\nHere is a sampling of what environmentalists considered some of the worst problems in 1988. Canada\n1. Relations between the United States and Canada came under increasing strain this year because of acid rain. Scientists say that sulfur dioxide from industries in the United States continues to kill aquatic life in hundreds of lakes in the Adirondack Mountains and in other parts of the Northeast and Canada. United States\n2. Four decades of nuclear weapon production has polluted the air, soil and water at 16 plants and research laboratories in the United States. The contaminants include uranium, plutonium, cesium, strontium, PCB's, chromium, arsenic, mercury and solvents used in making nuclear weapons. Carcinogens leaking into an underground water reservoir from the Rocky Flats Plant north of Denver was ranked as the worst problem. Mexico City\n3. Air pollution is so bad in the Mexico City area, where 20 million people live, that all schools will be closed next month so that children can stay indoors and reduce their exposure. Winter temperature inversions trap ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, lead, mercury and other pollutants, most of them generated by the city's three million cars, trucks and buses. The result is a rise in respiratory problems, fatigue, nausea and headaches. Brazil\n4. Fires used to clear land for agriculture and ranching in the Amazon destroyed 30,000 square miles of virgin forest last year, an area the size of Maine. The burning is so extensive that it may account for one-tenth of the global man-made production of carbon dioxide, one of the gases believed to cause the greenhouse effect. Millions of tons of methane and nitrogen oxides generated each year by the fires may help erode the earth's protective ozone shield. Adriatic Sea\n5. This summer the Adriatic, like many other parts of the world, suffered an outbreak of algae. Fed by phosphates and other pollutants, the algae starved the water of oxygen, killing fish in a 1,000-mile stretch along the Italian coast. Bangladesh\n6. Tree cutting, overgrazing and agricultural erosion in the Himalayan watershed make Bangladesh's monsoons increasingly disastrous. In August mountain runoff helped swell the Ganges River, flooding the country and killing 1,200 people. Africa\n7. Drought and erosion from farming, grazing and wood gathering are helping the Sahara to advance as much as 3 1/2 miles a year into the sub-Saharan region of northwestern Africa. Erosion is also bad in the Ethiopian highlands, the headwaters of the Blue Nile, where a burgeoning population is stripping the hillsides bare. Environmentalists say that the destruction of the watershed considerably worsened a flood last summer in the Sudan that left at least 1.5. million people homeless. Antarctic Ozone Hole\n8. Last December the Antarctic ozone hole that appears each winter may have reached Australia, where scientists reported a 10 percent thinning of the earth's protective shield. Problems are also believed to occur as far north as Santiago and Buenos Aires. Ozone in the upper atmosphere filters out ultraviolet light, which causes skin cancer and might depress the immune system. It can also kill phytoplankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the aquatic food chain. Eastern Europe\n9. Unregulated industry has turned parts of Eastern Europe into an ecological wasteland. Acid rain is killing trees in Poland, East Germany and Czechoslovakia. Pollution is blamed for cancer and mental retardation. Philippines\n10. As much as 95 percent of the coral reefs in the Philippines have been damaged by cyanide, which fishermen dump in the water to scare fish to the surface. As in other rapidly developing areas of Southeast Asia, logging and slash-and-burn agriculture consumes tens of thousands of acres of trees each year on the island of Palawan, the nation's last frontier. China\n11. It is not known whether the droughts in China and the United States were related to the greenhouse effect, but environmentalists say this summer could be a preview of hotter times to come. China already suffers water shortages and pollution from farming and industry. Aral Sea\n12. Diverting water to irrigate cotton has caused the Aral Sea to shrink 40 percent since 1960, leaving behind a vast desert waste. Twenty of the 24 native fish species are gone and dust and salt storms are killing crops. Chernobyl\n13. More than two and a half years after an explosion at a nuclear power plant killed 31 people and forced the evacuation of 135,000, Soviet officials and scientists are debating what to do with the ghost town of Chernobyl: demolish it or decontaminate it and allow its 10,000 inhabitants to return. Hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens are being monitored for long-term health effects like leukemia."

      "text": "Bangladesh Needs Commitment, Not Better Image\n1988-12-07T05:00:00.000Z\nTo the Editor:\nI am writing in response to ''Bangladeshi - and Proud,'' the Nov. 17 Op-Ed article by Fakhruddin Ahmed.\nAs a fellow Bangladeshi, I share his emotion and pride in our Bengali heritage. I also agree with him that ''it is not easy being a Bangladeshi.'' Unfortunately, Mr. Ahmed's ''difficulty'' seems to rise mainly from his perception of the image of Bangladesh abroad, rather than the daily hardships faced by the millions living in poverty in Bangladesh. My pride in my country stems from the struggle of these millions and their love of life, which manifests itself in spite of all the rigors.\nThese are the same people who earned the freedom of Bangladesh from Pakistan through a war of liberation which took the lives of over one million. We Bangladeshis consider this to be a war fought against an occupying power and therefore do not refer to it as a ''civil war,'' as Mr. Ahmed has chosen to do. One should not forget that without this struggle there would be no Bangladesh and hence no cause for national pride.\nBangladesh, situated on the vertex of the Bay of Bengal, bears the wrath of nature in the form of floods and cyclones. True, it is a land of great rivers and great poets and it has a ''fine cuisine,'' but the majority of its population of 110 million has to be content wth meals of salted sticky rice known as pantha bhat. The reason for this large population ''jammed into an area the size of Wisconsin'' is hardly that ''neighboring Indians settled in droves . . . [ and ] stayed put'' in Bengal when it was a part of undivided India. Rather, it is to be found in the poverty and inadequate education that hinders the effective implementation of a population-control program. Population is growing at a rate of 2.4 percent a year and the World Bank projects it to reach 141 million by the year 2000 -an increase of 31 million in 12 years.\nRecent floods in Bangladesh have caused the world to take notice of the difficulties facing our country. The annual floods are directly related to the deforestation of the upstream regions in India and Nepal and the gradual accumulation of silt on the riverbeds in Bangladesh. The need for an effective flood-control program is obvious. But the ability to execute such a program demands sincere commitment.\nSince its independence in 1971, Bangladesh has witnessed many political upheavals, bloody coups, the demise of a secular democratic process and the emergence of the army as the main power broker. The present Government consists of instant politicians from the army and wealthy business communities who lack the technical expertise as well as a basic understanding of people's need.\nIt has also been incapable of challenging neighboring countries, especially India, to shoulder their part of the flood control problem. All these factors combine to make serious commitment difficult. Without grass-roots effort on our part, flood control will be ever elusive. At the same time this effort has to be complemented with international monetary and technical assistance and policy advice on the governmental level.\nMr. Ahmed may fear this request for international assistance to be yet another example of behaving ''as though the world owes us a living.'' I would think that the concern about the lives of 110 million people should surely supersede the concerns about our image. Besides, ths gradual degradation of the global environment is forcing us to realize that the problem of Bangladesh is related to the long-term ecological balance and survival of life, human or otherwise, on this planet. Therefore the problem concerns all humanity.\nBangladesh has borne its share of suffering. The solution is not to wait for a ''few flood-free years'' or for ''our genius'' to make us rebound. The solution lies in our understanding of problems and acceptance of responsibilities. Naturally we take pride in our heritage, but our ''poetry, songs and cuisine'' cannot justify compla-cency. DIPEN BHATTACHARYA Durham, N.H., Nov. 21, 1988"

The equipment, including a helicopter and a rover craft, will add a new dimension in terms of disaster management, he said.  The minister said there is no alternative to drill to reduce losses and risks of disaster. It can play an important role to create awareness among the public.  Last year, the number of causalities was limited at Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital just because of drill before the fire incident, he said.    He said they have decided to tour risky hospitals, markets and buildings across Bangladesh so that people can be aware of disasters like fire and earthquake. Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief Md Shah Kamal, Director of Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital Brig Gen Morshed Rashid, Prof Uttam Kumar Paul, among others, were present on the occasion."

We have therefore made the assessment that Covid-19 can be characterised as a pandemic,\" he told a news conference. The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, halting industry, bringing flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of sporting events and concerts. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, its \"highest level of alarm,\" on January 30 when there were fewer than 100 cases of Covid-19 outside China and eight cases of human-to-human transmission of the disease.  BREAKING \"We have therefore made the assessment that #COVID19 can be characterized as a pandemic\"-@DrTedros #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/JqdsM2051A Now there are more than 121,000 cases in 121 countries and territories, while over 4,400 people have died, with the numbers expected to climb. China remains the hardest-hit overall with more than 80,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths. The WHO no longer has a category for declaring a pandemic, except for influenza. WHO officials have signalled for weeks that they may use the word \"pandemic\" as a descriptive term, but stressed that it does not carry legal significance. The novel coronavirus is not the flu. Under its previous system, the Geneva-based agency declared the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak a pandemic. It turned out to be mild, leading to some criticism after pharmaceutical companies rushed development of vaccines and drugs."

Monsoon flooding in Myanmar forces thousands from their homeshttps://t.co/fLOP3ewyGM pic.twitter.com/PTK5EnfZ4I Heavy downpours hit the tropical Southeast Asian country during the May-October rainy season, often triggering flooding. The northern state of Kachin was the worst affected, with 14,000 people forced from their homes near the banks of the Ayeyarwady river. Media published photographs showing submerged houses, vehicles and roads in Myitkyina, the state's capital. Flooding also forced 3,000 people in the western Rakhine state to relocate, the disaster management department said. They included some of the thousands displaced by fighting between the military and the Arakan Army insurgent group since late last year, according to Tun Aung Kyaw, secretary of the Arakan National Party, who visited a camp for several hundred displaced people near the ancient city of Mrauk-U. \"The whole camp is flooded and people are desperately in need of immediate shelter and food,\" he told Reuters by telephone. Myanmar has restricted access to the conflict zone for most international aid agencies. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a Facebook post it was helping the government respond to the flooding, while the Myanmar Red Cross, aid groups and private donors were also aiding the victims. \"We are working closely with authorities and stand ready to support the government's response,\" Knut Ostby, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator, said on Twitter."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-11 00:00:00      \nIn Ankara, talks between Turkey and Russian ended without agreement on stopping clashes in which 13 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Syria in one week Government forces seized control of a highway in northwest Syria for the first time since 2012 on Tuesday as they pressed their campaign to eradicate the last rebel strongholds in Idlib province and the Aleppo countryside, a war monitor said. In Ankara, talks between Turkey and Russian ended without agreement on stopping clashes in which 13 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Syria in one week. Relief agencies meanwhile said an exodus of hundreds of thousands of civilians from the afflicted areas was the largest such movement in nine years of war and a new humanitarian crisis was unfolding. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government forces had seized the entire length of the M5 highway after driving rebels from their last foothold on the road. The M5 runs from Aleppo in the north to the capital Damascus then on to southern Deraa. They took control of the highway after capturing a western suburb of Aleppo from insurgents. The latest advances by President Bashar al-Assad's Russian and Iranian-backed troops came after 13 Turkish soldiers were killed in the Idlib region in the past week, prompting some of the most serious confrontations between Ankara and Damascus of the war. Ankara deployed thousands of soldiers to stem the Syrian offensive. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels downed a helicopter believed to belong to the Syrian government in the town of Nairab, Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber reported on Tuesday. Since the new push began, government forces have recaptured more than 600 square km of territory and in recent days have taken control of dozens of towns and villages. Last week they recaptured the crossroads town of Saraqeb, on the M5. Turkey has several military personnel stationed there to prevent further Syrian advances after eight of its soldiers were killed by Syrian shelling. A Russian delegation arrived in Ankara on Saturday days after the attack to hold talks aimed at stopping clashes. On their final day of talks, a second Syrian attack on Turkish troops in the Taftanaz area killed five more troops. Ankara has said that it retaliated to both attacks, destroying several Syrian targets. It said would drive back Assad's forces unless they withdraw by the end of the month. It also told the Russian team that attacks against Turkish posts must stop immediately. The Russians left Turkey after talks ended on Monday, a Turkish diplomatic source said, with no apparent agreement. The Kremlin said on Tuesday all attacks on Russian and Syrian forces in Idlib had to stop.  Air raids Rescue teams in the region said Russian and Syrian war planes bombed several towns in Idlib, with most air raids on towns in western Aleppo, including a residential area in the city of Daraat Izza. At least 13 civilians were killed overnight in the air strikes, they said. The rapid advances by Assad's forces in Idlib have driven nearly 700,000 people from their homes towards the closed-off Turkish border in the past 10 weeks. Most of those displaced are women and children. \"This is, from our initial analysis, the largest number of people in a single period since the Syrian crisis began almost nine years ago,\" Jens Laerke, spokesman for the United Nations' OCHA humanitarian agency, told reporters in Geneva. \"So it's the fastest growing displacement we have ever seen in the country. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Andrej Mahecic said the harsh winter weather was making their suffering worse and shelter was hard to find. \"Even finding a place in an unfinished building is becoming nearly impossible,\" he said, adding that mosques were full. Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot absorb any more. It said it will halt new migrant waves from Idlib and its military will remain there. One Turkish politician urged President Tayyip Erdogan to go further. \"There will be no peace in Turkey until Assad is brought down from his throne. Turkey must start plans to enter Damascus now, and annihilate the cruel ones,\" said Devlet Bahceli, chairman of Erdogan's nationalist partner party. Witnesses and rebels said on Tuesday a new column of Turkish reinforcements, including tanks, rocket launchers and armoured vehicles, crossed the border into Idlib overnight. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels have also begun an new offensive against the government forces near army-controlled Saraqeb and Nairab to push troops away from Idlib city, where more than one million people live. The battle for Idlib is a crucial stage of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of combatants and civilians, made millions refugees in their own country or overseas, and fractured the wider Middle East since it broke out amid the Arab Spring in 2011. Forces arrayed against Assad, Syria's ruler for nearly 20 years, have failed to dislodge him but he now presides over a devastated country. Moscow's military intervention in 2015 helped swing the war decisively in Assad's favour. Despite being on opposing sides, Turkey and Russia collaborate for a political solution to the conflict."

      "text": "Death Toll in India After Heavy Floods Is Reported at 1,000\n1988-10-03T05:00:00.000Z\nThe death toll from floods that have submerged many areas in India's northwest was nearing 1,000 today, according to reports from the region. Hundreds of thousands of residents in four states have been evacuated to higher ground.\nMost severely affected in more than a week of flooding has been Punjab State, where many acres of farmland have been inundated. A state government spokesman in Chandigarh said Saturday that at least 400 people had died in the state in nearly 9,000 affected villages and towns.\nLocal news organizations put the number of deaths in Punjab at about 600, with some areas still cut off and unable to report casualties. The districts of Ferozepore, Jullundur and Amritsar were among those hardest hit. Food Stocks Are Gone\nTens of thousands of farm animals have perished. Food stocks have been destroyed, prompting the Government to begin dropping relief supplies by air. [ A boat evacuating people from floodwaters in Pakistan's Punjab Province capsized and 35 people aboard were feared drowned, Reuters reported. It quoted the state-run Radio Pakistan as saying seven bodies had been recovered after the incident near Faisalabad. ] The states of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir have reported hundreds more casualties as rivers swollen by record monsoon rains have poured into the fertile plains and valleys of the northwest. In Rajasthan, officials said they were on the alert for rising water in rivers and canals that pass through Punjab. Flooding Near the Capital\nThe Jumna River, which runs along the eastern edge of the capital, has also overflowed, disrupting the lives of many poor Indians who erect makeshift homes on its wide banks. But apart from the flooding of some city roads, the functioning of the capital has not been badly affected.\nToday, flood waters were reported to be receding in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. But the rivers are still high in Punjab, a politically sensitive state where four years of violence has already damaged the economy.\nThis weekend, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi named a Cabinet committee to open talks with the legal political opposition in the state, which Mr. Gandhi visited on Sept. 21. The talks, announced before the floods, are intended to consider solutions for the state's political and economic deterioration.\nViolence, which has claimed at least 2,000 lives this year, began with a call for a separate homeland by Sikh militants, followed by an armed response by New Delhi. Terrorism is now no longer confined to the Sikh dispute, but has spread into general lawlessness, Punjabis say. Robberies and attacks occur daily.\nDeforestation in the Himalayas and their foothills is easing the rush of water into India's northern states, experts say. The barren, eroded hills along the mountainous roof of India and nearby Nepal are also thought to have contributed to recent heavy flooding in northeastern India and in Bangladesh, where several large river systems enter the Bay of Bengal. Cooperation With Bangladesh\nBangladesh has been seeking international support in studying the river systems and making recommendations for joint projects to control the waters. Bangladesh's President, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, visited India on Thursday to raise his concerns with Prime Minister Gandhi.\nThe Indians told General Ershad that New Delhi wanted to keep the discussions confined to an Indian-Bangladesh commission, and not involve other nations at this point. India, where politicians are sensitive to what they see as infringements on national sovereignty, has long resisted the ''internationalization'' of the rivers issue.\nIndia has proposed building a canal across Bangladeshi territory to link the Brahmaputra and Ganges systems to drain water from the former into the latter.\nIn Bangladesh, where the idea of an ''Indian'' canal has never been popular, a sense of desperation is growing, spurred by this year's devastating floods. The floods submerged nearly three-quarters of the country and left millions homeless.\nGeneral Ershad plans to go ahead with his plans to visit Nepal, Bhutan and China to discuss possible projects for managing the Himalayan rivers.\nHe is scheduled to go to Katmandu on Monday, less than a week after Indian officials made it clear that they did not want to involve Nepal in talks."

      "text": "U.N. Food Agency Sees a Crucial Year Ahead\n1988-12-20T05:00:00.000Z\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization issued a gloomy year-end assessment today in which it said the world stood at ''a crucial turning point between food security and supply shortages.''\nFor the first time since World War II, global cereal production has declined for two consecutive years, forcing countries to draw deeply from reserves, an agency study said.\nAs a result, it said, world cereal stocks are at their lowest levels since the early 1970's and, more significantly, are below the threshold set by the organization as the minimum requirement for food security.\nThe report said cereal output next year would have to grow by 225 millions tons, or 13 percent, to meet daily needs and rebuild reserves. There has never been a one-year increase of that magnitude, it added.\n''While the world is not facing an immediate food crisis, there are reasons for concern in 1989,'' said Edouard Saouma, the agency's director general. ''The outcome of next year's harvest will be crucial.''\nDespite its bleak tone, the study pointed out some bright spots. For example, cereal production rose by 3 percent in developing countries this year, thanks to good African harvests, including famine-stricken countries like Ethiopia and the Sudan. But the agency said production continued to lag behind population growth in most third-world countries, and it was overwhelmed by climatic disasters in many regions.\nThe severe drought this year in North America cut grain production there by one-third, the report said. There were also floods in Bangladesh, hurricanes in Central America and locust plagues in Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean that were described by Mr. Saouma as ''the most extensive in recorded history.''\nThus far, crop losses to the locusts have been limited, he said. ''But swarms have the potential to cause enormous damage,'' he added. ''We expect the plague to continue for at least another two to three years.''\nThe organization estimated that total production of wheat, rice and coarse grains this year would total a bit more than 1.73 billion tons, a decline of nearly 4 percent from 1987, which itself was a poor harvest year.\nReserves were expected to total 275 million tons for 1988, a drop of 120 tons, or 30 percent, from last year, the sharpest decline on record. According to the F.A.O., the present stocks are equivalent to 16 percent of expected global cereal consumption next year, and it considers 17 percent as the minimum level ''necessary for the maintenance of world food security.''\nOn another matter, Mr. Saouma, whose fiscal management has been severely criticized in the past, called 1988 the agency's ''worst financial year in its 43-year history.'' The problem was the failure of member nations to meet their obligatory payments, he said, and he called the United States the biggest offender, accounting for $78 million of the total of $111 million owed by 80 countries."

      "text": "TALKING TWO MOTHER TONGUES\n1989-06-04T05:00:00.000Z\nLEAD: MEATLESS DAYS By Sara Suleri. 186 pp. Illinois: The University of Chicago Press. $17.95.\nMEATLESS DAYS By Sara Suleri. 186 pp. Illinois: The University of Chicago Press. $17.95. \nIn Pakistan, a common dinner-party conversation finds the guests fantasizing the deconstruction of the state. Ethnic tensions will send the province of Punjab back to India. The southernmost province, Sind, will become the independent Sindhudesh. The Pathans will join their tribesmen in Afghanistan to form Pukhtoonistan, and Pakistani and Iranian Baluchis will create Baluchistan. What's in a name? Pakistan, which in Urdu means ''land of the pure,'' is impure and troubled, a nation divided.\n''Meatless Days,'' Sara Suleri's first book, is a parallel exercise in postcolonial partition. Ms. Suleri's territory, though, is the self. In nine autobiographical tales that move easily back and forth among Pakistan, Britain and the United States, Ms. Suleri examines the names that describe her: Pakistani, sister, teacher (of English, at Yale), narrator with two mother tongues, Easterner in passage to the West. In the process she forays lightly into Pakistani history, and deeply into the history of her family and friends.\nAt the intersection of the two is the author's father, Z. A. Suleri, a prominent political journalist who lobbied hard for Pakistan's formation. His single-minded focus on the drafting of his country's history alienated him from successive Pakistani regimes (which jailed him) and successive children (who left him). The author's mother, Surraya, nee Mair Jones, was a Welsh teacher of English who chose to live with her husband in Pakistan but was never able to apprehend the country's customs; a ''guest in her own name,'' she bore four children and became an observer of almost saintly abstraction. ''Honestly,'' she probably would have murmured, had she seen her students beating up the driver of the motorcycle cab that struck and killed her.\nThe Suleri women at home in Pakistan, however, make this book sing. Grandmother Dadi's spine is bent, but her will is not. Scuttling about the house ''in the posture of a shrimp,'' she lectures her granddaughters on the evils of the opposite sex ('' 'For men,' said Dadi, shaking the name off her fingertips like some unwanted water, 'live as though they were unsuckled things' ''), and delivers denunciations of Satan while lying atop the dining room table. Ms. Suleri's beautiful sister Ifat sees two men brush their car against the author on a Lahore street - enraged, Ifat forces their car off the road with her own, then rams them repeatedly to the encouraging cheers of onlookers.\nHer half sister Nuz has a softer charm: reasoning correctly that ''no one will ever tow or touch anything that looks so forlorn,'' she parks her car by ''gaping'' it, pulling up anywhere she likes and opening trunk, hood and all four doors. Buying chicken for dinner, Nuz has the birds in her net bag before she remembers her housewifely duties: '' 'Are they fresh?' she squawked, clutching at them, 'Can you promise me they're fresh?' The chicken-monger looked at her with some perplexity. 'But Begum Sahib,' he said gently, 'they're alive.' ''\nBut maybe no good to eat. In ''Meatless Days,'' bad experiences with food often remind the Suleris to expect unpleasant surprises. Milk in the ''land of the pure'' turns out to be ''accidentally diluted'' with kerosene instead of water, and one week there's a dead crow in the drinking water. A bowlful of spicy tamarind sauce ends up on the author's lap rather than in her mouth, scorching ''passageways that as a rule I am only theoretically aware of owning.'' Dreaming that her dead mother is a vanload of frozen meat that must be fitted piece by piece into a coffin, Ms. Suleri steals a knuckle and hides it under her tongue. War with India sunders Bangladesh from Pakistan, Dadi is burned nearly to death in the kitchen, Ifat is killed by a hit-and-run driver and Ms. Suleri herself, working in the United States, finds that her boyfriend will share her bed but is too nervous to have a meal alone with her at home. Something is rotten in the state of nourishment.\nReaders looking for pat exoticism should look elsewhere. Like the novelist Anita Desai, whose mother was also European, Ms. Suleri is at home with cultural and linguistic differences, and well able to steer clear of subcontinental cliches. ''Meatless Days,'' like Ihab Hassan's earlier ''Out of Egypt,'' subjects Eastern autobiography to critical method, talking of discourse and context, calling attention to grammar and tense, taking one step back for analysis with every two it takes toward description. At its least compelling, Ms. Suleri's prose doubles back on itself until it collapses in a heap of cerebral metaphors: ''I try to lay the subject down and change its clothes, but before I know it, it has sprinted off evilly in the direction of ocular evidence.''\nMore often the writing is beautifully constructed and yet a little cold; Sara Suleri expertly paces out the boundaries of her subject without giving the reader the pleasure of getting inside. ''Remember,'' she tells one of her brothers, ''that I've lived many years as an otherness machine.'' It would be nice to see that sentence in the simple past tense. GOOD FOR HYGIENE, BAD FOR CONSERVATION \n The country was made in 1947, and shortly thereafter the government decided that two days out of each week would be designated as meatless days, in order to conserve the national supply of goats and cattle. Every Tuesday and Wednesday the butchers' shops would stay firmly closed, without a single carcass dangling from the huge metal hooks that lined the canopies under which the butchers squatted, selling meat, and without the open drains at the side of their narrow street ever running with a trace of blood. On days of normal trade, blood would briskly flow, carrying with it flotillas of chicken feathers, and little bits of sinew and entrail, or a bladder full and yellow that a butcher had just bounced deftly into the drain. On meatless days that world emptied into a skeletal remain: the hot sun came to scorch away all the odors and liquids of slaughter and shriveled on the chopping blocks the last curlicues of anything organic, making them look both vacant and precise.\nAs a principle of hygiene I suppose it was a good idea although it really had very little to do with conservation: the people who could afford to buy meat, after all, were those who could afford refrigeration. From ''Meatless Days.''"

Agency Produces Order\n1988-10-23T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen hurricane Gilbert struck Jamaica last month, knocking out communications on the island, amateur radio operators were organized to carry information on the extent of damage. In Bangladesh, when the country was hit last month by the worst floods in memory, there were large stocks of food on hand to face the immediate crisis. Before the rains came to Sudan last August, causing widespread destruction, plans had been prepared for coping with floods.\nWhen natural disasters strike and even before, countries turn to the office of the United Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator for help. The organization, which is based in Geneva, has mobilized aid for typhoons, earthquakes, tropical storms, floods, volcanic eruptions, drought and famine around the world.\n''We're monitoring every disaster -not to deliver relief but information,'' said Philippe Boulle, director of the organization's New York office. The organization also coordinates aid from the international community, other United Nations agencies and humanitarian groups active in disaster work.\nThough the number and scope of emergency situations calling for international attention have increased in recent years, Mr. Boulle stressed that loss of life is ''much lower than a decade ago because of prevention.''\nThis week the General Assembly recalled its resolution designating the 1990's the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction and voted by consensus in favor of emergency assistance for Jamaica and the Sudan and aid for disaster prevention programs for Bangladesh.\nThe Disaster Relief Coordinator, along with other agencies in the United Nations system, was asked to assist the Government of Bangladesh in preparing a feasibility plan for a permanent solution to the recurring problem of floods and droughts.\nSet up in 1971, the agency was designed to coordinate and strengthen relief efforts for major disasters. It tried to tackle too much, from building bridges to helping dislocated people in Africa and was blamed for not dealing adequately with long-term emergencies like the situation in Ethiopia.\nIn the last three years, the agency's focus has shifted to sudden emergencies, information and guidance, according to Mr. Boulle.\nIn 1986-87, the agency responded to 110 disasters, including cyclones and floods in Bangladesh, an earthquake in El Salvador, drought in Ethiopia, armed conflict and floods in Lebanon, and a typhoon in Vietnam.\nOver the last two years, however, the agency has focussed increasingly on disaster preparedness and prevention, with an increasing number of requests from developing countries to strengthen their national and regional emergency services. Dwindling Emergency Fund\nMore than 30 disaster mitigation projects have been developed, such as the Seismic Risk Reduction Project in the Balkans, the Pan-Caribbean Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Project in Antigua, the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center in Bangkok and a similar center for South Pacific being set up in Fiji.\nDisasters are generally defined as emergencies with at least 10 reported killed or property damage in excess of $1 million. But Mr. Boulle, who comes from the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, stressed that the agency was concerned not just with the dimensions of a disaster, but above all ''the dimensions of the internal need.''\nEmphasizing his agency's dependence on others, Mr. Boulle cited Italy, Canada, the Netherlands, Britain and Australia as among the most generous donors. He said the United States, Japan, Soviet Union and Belgium ''could do more.''\n''What we're really lacking is an adequate emergency fund,'' the he said, adding the agency had given ''the ridiculous sum of $30,000'' to help Bangladesh during the floods. He noted that current budget restraints had reduced the fund for emergency cash grants from $360,000 to $180,00 a year, and the agency had been able to respond positively to only half of the 32 requests in 1986-87."

Other Bangladeshi officials said they feared the death toll would be in the thousands. Hundreds of thousands of people were reportedly left homeless and millions of tons of crops were said to have been destroyed. Winds to 120 Miles Per Hour\nThe cyclone struck Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, as it was continuing its recovery from the worst flooding in its history; the flooding in August and September covered three-fourths of the country and caused damages now estimated at more than $1 billion.\nThe storm, with winds of 60 to 120 miles per hour, whipped 10-foot-high tidal waves as it swept across the Bay of Bengal and through the southern and southeastern districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Byrguna, Barisal, Patuakhali, Bhola, Chittagong and the town of Cox's Bazar. Electrical power and communications in those areas were cut off.\nAt least 275 fishermen were reported missing, and officials said they expected many more deaths as reports come in from the hundreds of tiny islands in the Bay of Bengal.\nA relief ministry official said that about 80 percent of the crops and mud and thatch homes in the two hardest-hit districts, Khulna and Satkhira, had been destroyed. Warnings Were Broadcast\nBut he said that human casualties had been minimized by an efficient early warning system that helped people evacuate vulnerable areas. This official predicted the final death toll would be no more than ''a few thousand.''\nGiven the record of previous cyclones in Bangladesh - the most recent in 1985, which killed an estimated 10,000 people - that prediction seemed to a remarkably low figure. More than 300,000 people died in 1970 in the worst cyclone in Bangladesh's history."

Gen. H. M. Ershad, reached individual agreements with India and other neighboring countries for cooperation. But he has thus far failed to win sufficient support for a regional response to the flooding.\n''What we want is a regional water authority, including the five concerned countries, to regulate and harness water resources for the benefit of all,'' Mr. Choudhury said in an interview before his address. This would mean no diversion of water, construction of dams or other such projects, without common consent, he said. Looking to Dutch and Germans\nHe said such a regional agency would need international support both in technology and financing because of the magnitude of the problem. Specifically, it would look for technological help from the Netherlands and West Germany, ''which have cooperated successfully in taming the Rhine,'' he said.\nBangladesh and India have been at odds for some time over the control of the waters of the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and other common rivers. Bangladesh accuses India of permitting rampant deforestation that has resulted in flooding, and building dams that divert badly needed water from Bangladesh in the dry season. Specifically, these officials are concerned over an Indian proposal to build a canal across Bangladesh to drain water from the Brahmaputra to the Ganges system.\nThe Bangladeshi official said his Government has tried to generate enthusiasm for regional cooperation. Ershad and Gandhi Meet\nHe noted that General Ershad and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India agreed late last month to set up a joint task force to study the flood management and water flow of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers. Subsequently, the President visited Nepal, and it was agreed to set up a joint study team on the problem. He will also visit Bhutan this week and later China to take up the same issue.\nReferring to the recent catastrophic flood, Mr. Choudhury said 1,250,000 houses were destroyed, leaving about eight million people homeless. More than 2,000 deaths have been attributed to the flooding.\nThe Foreign Minister said the country's ''highest priority needs'' are now wheat and construction materials.\nEmphasizing the need for a permanent solution to the problem, he said, ''The primary imperative will be in harnessing regional cooperation among all our concerned neighbors with a view to arriving at coherent and well-coordinated policies and plans to our mutual benefit.''"

The World Health Organization has reported 8,778 deaths and 209,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The virus is thought to have initially passed from animals to humans at a \"wet market\" selling produce, seafood and live animals in Wuhan, China in December but this is not yet confirmed. Researchers in China have suggested that pangolins, mammals known as 'scaly ant-eaters', are the probable animal source of COVID-19, according to scientific journal Nature. China has since issued a ban on consumption and farming of wild animals, and wildlife markets. However, environmentalists warn of a broader issue: Humanity's voracious destruction of diverse ecosystems which brings us in closer contact with wildlife than ever before. David Quammen, author of 2012 bestseller, Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, became interested in infectious diseases while researching Ebola and has been warning about the risk of pandemics ever since. He told The Independent: \"Our highly diverse ecosystems are filled with many species of wild animals, plants, fungi and bacteria. All of that biological diversity contains unique viruses. \"When we tear down tropical forests to build villages, timber and mining camps, kill or capture wild animals for food, we expose ourselves to those viruses. \"It's like if you demolish an old barn then dust flies. When you demolish a tropical forest, viruses fly. Those moments of destruction represent opportunity for unfamiliar viruses to get into humans and take hold.\" Dr Samuel Myers, principle research scientist at Harvard's Department of Environmental Health and director of the Planetary Health Alliance, told The Independent: \"Human incursions into wildlife habitat bring people into closer proximity with wildlife populations. \"What we know is that other animals are an enormous reservoir of pathogens, many of which we haven't yet been exposed to.\" Vector-borne diseases - those from living organisms that can transmit infectious pathogens between humans, or from animals to humans - account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases and cause more than 700,000 deaths each year, according to WHO. They have increased over time. Around 30 new infectious diseases emerged during the 1950s, according to a study in journal Nature. By the 1980s, that number more than tripled.  We have previously seen the spread of other zoonotic diseases like HIV, Ebola, SARS, MERS and Zika. Dr Myers said: \"The HIV epidemic and Ebola were thought to have emerged from bushmeat hunting. MERS and SARS came out of live animal 'wet markets'.  \"At the live markets in Wuhan, for example, there was an extraordinary number of exotic species alive in cages, all in proximity to each other and to humans in a way that you would never find in the natural world.\" He added: \"It's a combination of the size of the human ecological footprint and globalization. Once a pathogen has made that jump from animals to humans, it has the capacity to spread around the globe very quickly with air travel.\" Regulation and education on the dangers of consuming wildlife plays a part in mitigating the risk. Quammen said: \"There are people all over the world desperate for protein who eat wild animals. It's not something I want to demonize as a Chinese vice. \"There are so many of us hungry for resources that as we reduce the wild down to these tiny remnants, we offer ourselves as a target of opportunity for viruses.\" Dr Sala said: \"When it comes to populations that depend on the exploitation of nature for their day-to-day living, alternatives have to be provided. \"Governments have a key role in setting policies that protect the nature world and regulate or ban wildlife trade. Companies can help. The world already produces enough food for 10 billion people, only we waste a third of it.\" Fighting climate change plays a key role as rising temperatures create more amenable conditions for diseases to spread. Dr Myers said: \"We're aware that malaria is being found in higher latitudes, and higher altitudes, like in the Kenyan Highlands where we never used to see temperatures as warm.\" The decimation of the natural world extends far beyond infectious disease outbreaks, Dr Myers points out. \"We're seeing impacts on the quality and quantity of food we produce; exposure to noncommunicable diseases like heart disease, cancer and respiratory disease along with mental health impacts, population displacement and conflict,\" he said. With biodiversity loss and a growing global population - expected to rise by 2 billion to 9.7 billion by 2050 - seeking food sources, the question of the next pandemic is not if but when, experts warn. \"If we get [COVID-19] under control, then we can be glad that human ingenuity and will managed to control this one. But after we celebrate for five minutes, we should start thinking about the next one,\" David Quammen said. Sweeping change is needed including making the crucial link between human health and conservation of the planet. Dr Sala said: \"They are not disconnected. There is no sustainable human health without a healthy ecosystem. These infectious diseases we have experienced over the last 20 years are best proof of that. \"Keeping the wild places intact, banning the hunting and traffic of wildlife species, many of which are endangered, would not only be practical but beneficial in terms of human health and economics. \"For governments and policy-makers, it is going to be very clear that investment in protecting our natural world is the most cost-effective one they can make.\" "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-19 00:00:00      \nAlternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), a simple technology, can help cut irrigation cost, stop rapid depletion of groundwater table and halve methane emissions  It takes 3,000 litres of water to produce one kilogram of rice. Dry season high yielding rice farming is heavily dependent on irrigation.  And there is a growing concern about irrigated rice fields emitting too much methane, second in importance after carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, responsible for global warming. Adoption of a simple technology called Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), can cut irrigation water use by a third, and halve the methane emissions from rice fields, experts told Dhaka Tribune.  In the practice of AWD, farmers do not maintain flooded rice fields all the time. Rather they are advised to use water more judiciously in an alternate wetting and drying pattern that helps them cut the cost of irrigation, save precious groundwater, where the water table has been falling at an alarming rate. This ultimately results in less emission of methane, harmful for the ozone layer of the earth's stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. It's a pity though, that for the past decade or so, AWD has been widely accepted as a water-saving, climate smart farming technology, but has not been adopted. Recently, an IRRI-led (International Rice Research Institute) initiative, the Northwest Focal Area Network, (otherwise known as FAN), demonstrated AWD to thousands of Bangladeshi farmers.    Success has come in the wake of the demonstration, and many rice growers have started appreciating the value of AWD. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) has also recently conferred the 'Innovation in Behavioral Change' award to the FAN project for its effort in reducing methane emissions in rice production.   Bangladesh and five other countries - Canada, Ghana, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States - joined forces with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in founding CCAC in 2012. The CCAC aims to catalyze rapid reductions in climate pollutants to protect human health, agriculture, and the environment.  Dr SM Mofijul Islam, a Senior Scientific Officer of the Soil Science Division of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI), has been working on rice field methane emissions for the past seven years.  \"In my study I found some 250 to 350 kilograms of methane being released from each hectare of rice field in a growing season. Our research shows if AWD is practiced, it not only saves water and cuts irrigation costs, but also more importantly, it potentially halves the emission of methane from rice fields,\" Dr Islam told the Dhaka Tribune. IRRI Consultant Dr. Ahmed Salahuddin, who has been spearheading the cause of promoting AWD in Bangladesh, told this correspondent that over the past three years they've demonstrated AWD in over 3,000 hectares of rice lands in the Greater Rangpur-Dinajpur, Rajshahi, and Naogaon regions. \"We found that farmers practicing AWD needed 35 percent less water, thereby cutting their rice production cost by 20 percent. This also helped up to 50 percent reduction in methane emissions. Furthermore, fields where AWD was practiced, were less prone to pest infestations and diseases, and overall output was higher by 10 percent,\" said Dr Salahuddin. IRRI, FAN, and the Gobeshona Network of International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) of Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), are now jointly spearheading the adoption of climate-smart technologies for agriculture in Bangladesh in a project called \"Mitigation Options to Reduce Methane Emissions in Paddy Rice.\"  In Bangladesh, dry season Boro rice is the biggest contributor to the country's yearly rice output in three rice growing seasons - Aus, Aman, and Boro. And other than Aus, the monsoon rice,    Boro is fully irrigated, and Aman is partly irrigated.  Farmers in Bangladesh use over 1.4 million shallow tube wells (STWs) to draw irrigation water from underground, and due to over-mining of groundwater, the water table has been falling over 0.6 metre a year, exposing the country to an ecological disaster.   According to BRRI-run Bangladesh Rice Knowledge Bank, \"The savings of irrigation water will have impact on the environment because of reduced withdrawal of ground water and a reduction in burning diesel. This may also reduce arsenic contamination in rice grains and straw.\" What is AWD?  Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) is a water-saving technology that farmers can apply to reduce their irrigation water use in rice fields without any yield penalty. In AWD, irrigation water is applied a few days after a well irrigated field dries out. Hence, the field is alternately flooded and non-flooded. The number of days of non-flooded soil between irrigations can vary from 1 day to more than 10 days, depending on a number of factors such as soil type, weather, and crop growth stage. How to implement AWD?  A practical way to implement AWD safely (without yield loss) is to monitor the depth of ponded, standing water in the field, using a perforated 'field water tube' (pani pipe). After irrigation, the water depth will gradually decrease. When the water level  drops to about 15 cm below the surface of the soil, irrigation should be applied to re-flood the field to a ponded water depth of about 5 cm. From a week before flowering to one week after flowering, the field should be kept flooded, topping up to a depth of 5 cm as needed. After flowering, during grain filling and ripening, the water level can be allowed to drop again to 15 cm below the soil surface before re-irrigation. AWD can be started one or two weeks after transplanting.   The Field Water Tube (pani pipe) The field water tube can be made of 30-cm long plastic pipe or bamboo, and should have a diameter of 10- 15 cm so that the water table is easily visible, and it is easy to fit one's hand inside the tube to remove soil. The tube has to be perforated with many holes on all sides, so that water can flow readily in and out of the tube. It has to be hammered into the soil so that 15 cm protrudes above the soil surface. The tube should be placed in a readily accessible part of the field close to a bund, so it is easy to monitor the depth of the ponded water. The location should be representative of the average water depth in the field (i.e. it should not be in a high spot or a low spot). Why is Curbing Methane Emissions So Important? With global temperatures rising due to climate change, the emission of methane - that traps about 25 times more of the sun's heat than carbon dioxide -plays a significant role in global warming. Wetland rice fields have recently been identified as a major source of atmospheric methane. Flooding a rice field cuts off the oxygen supply from the atmosphere to the soil, resulting in anaerobic fermentation of organic soil matter. Methane is a major end product of anaerobic fermentation. It is released from submerged soil to the atmosphere by diffusion and ebullition, and through the roots and stems of rice plants. Global estimates of emission rates from wetland rice fields range from 20 to 100 Tg/yr (teragrams per year), which corresponds to as much as 29 percent of total annual anthropogenic methane emissions."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-09 00:00:00      \nEid holidaymakers faced long delay on their way home yesterday due to disruption of ferry services, long tailbacks on highways and late departure of some trains. Heavy rain throughout the day added to their woes. People heading for south-western districts such as Khulna, Jessore and Barisal were among the worst victims, as they had to wait for hours, first at bus terminals and then at ferry terminals. Ferry services were disrupted because of strong current in the Padma river. Those bound for north-eastern regions were stuck for hours in tailbacks on Dhaka-Bogura, Dhaka-Rajshahi and Dhaka-Mymensingh highways. And as on the previous day, most intercity trains heading for north-western districts ran one to three hours behind schedule. \"The overall situation is very bad,\" said Osman Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation. Although the three-day public holiday for Eid will begin Sunday, a large number of government and non-government employees left Dhaka yesterday. Many of them took leave for Wednesday (August 14), the only working day next week, to make their vacation longer. FERRY TERMINALS  Ferry services at Shimulia-Kathalbari saw a huge pressure of vehicles yesterday as water vessel operation resumed after 17 hours of suspension due to rough wave and strong current in the Padma. More than 300 vehicles were waiting at Shimulia at 7:00pm, said Abdul Alim, manager (commerce) of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) at Shimulia terminal. Only four ferries were in operation in the morning due to bad weather. The authorities were able to operate all the 16 ferries only after 12:00noon, when weather became normal. Ferries are taking 20 minutes more than in normal time to cross the river due to strong current, said Alim. Rafiqul Islam, a private service holder, said his bus of Tungipara Express was supposed to start from Gulistan at 12:00noon but started at 2:30pm, because of huge jam at Shimulia-Kathalbari. The disruption at Shimulia-Kathalbari eventually affected the ferry services at Paturia-Dauladia terminals. At 3:00pm, some 300 light vehicles, 100 buses and 400 trucks were waiting at Paturia end, although the situation improved a little in the evening, said Azamal Hossain, deputy general manager of BIWTC at Aricha office. He said they were operating 17 ferries and that three more would join their fleet soon. Several bus operators at Gabtoli terminal said they were facing problems to maintain schedule as buses were taking more time to return to Dhaka because of the gridlock at ferry terminals. Rifat Hossain, a private university student, said, \"I came to the terminal at 9:00am defying rain, but my bus has not arrived yet [at 11:00am]. I don't know how much longer I will have to wait.\" JAM ON HIGHWAYS People heading for northern districts faced traffic jam after crossing the Bangabandhu bridge for hours in the morning due to the sorry state of the road at different points and poor condition of Nolka bridge. Vehicles have to cross the bridge very slowly due to its poor condition, causing traffic jam from Bangabandhu bridge west zone to Nolka point, said Sayed Shahid Alam, officer-in-charge of Bangabandhu bridge west zone police station. Besides, repair work was underway on Dhaka (Hatikumrul)-Bogura and Dhaka (Hatikumrul)-Bonpara highways for the last day before Eid, causing traffic congestion. Vehicles heading for 22 districts of north, west and south have to cross Hatikumrul point, said Akteruzzaman, officer-in-charge of Hatikumrul highway police station. People also faced problem on the 13km stretch from Tongi Bridge to Joydevpur Chowrasta on Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway because of construction work of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). Under this project, the government would construct a 20.5km dedicated bus lane from Dhaka to Gazipur. But in the absence of a proper drainage system, parts of the four-lane highway were submerged after rain, disrupting traffic movement, said Osman Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation. The Gazipur City Corporation Mayor had assured of deploying 500 volunteers to control the situation, but that gave little relief due to rain, he added. CROWD AT KAMALAPUR Commuters travelling on trains to northern and north-western regions continued to suffer as all but one intercity trains were late by one to three hours. According to the Train Tracking Monitoring System, Chilahati-bound Nilsagar Express, Rajshahi-bound Silkcity, Rangpur-bound Rangpur Express, Panchagarh-bound Ekata Express, Rajshahi-bound Dhumketu Express and Silkcity Express and Khulna-bound Sundarban Express were late by about two hours to nearly three and a half hours. Chapainawabganj-bound Banolata Express was 20 minutes late to depart Kamalapur. Operations of trains on other routes were on time. Asked about the delay, Station Manager Aminul Hoque told reporters that holidaymakers usually took a long time to embark and disembark trains, resulting in such delays. Meanwhile, train service through Santaher-Lalmonirhat route that connects Dhaka and northern districts resumed yesterday, 22 days after it was suspended due to flood. WATERWAYS  Pressure of passengers at the country's largest launch terminal at Sadarghat increased in the evening. \"Some 80 launches are being operated during normal time. Around 25 more launches will run tonight [Thursday],\" said Alamgir Kabir, joint director of BIWTA. Usually, 7,080 launches ply 40 routes, mostly to the country's southern region from Dhaka's Sadarghat. Some 130 more will join the fleet to carry 8-10 lakh people, who travel by waterways during Eid vacation, according to transport operators. Meanwhile, the BIWTA said it would not allow motorcycles on any passenger-carrying vessels from Sadarghat terminal during Eid rush.

Moreover, 34,999 houses were damaged completely and 5.47 lakh were damaged partially. Reportedly, relief materials for the affected people were also inadequate, although the government might have made sufficient allotment. These people are still struggling to find a livelihood and rebuild their houses. And as the flood water recedes, river erosion has started taking its toll in many areas, destroying schools and homesteads of people. While the state minister for the ministry of disaster management and relief has termed TIB's allegations as baseless, the fact remains that many of the flood victims have been left with no relief at all. We think the government should move away from its denial mode and conduct investigations into the allegations made by the corruption watchdog. The institutional limitations in the government's planning of relief distribution, rehabilitation programmes, emergency response and overall preparedness for such a disaster should be addressed properly for better management of floods in the future. Also, stringent action should be taken against those, including the public representatives, involved in corruption."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-03 00:00:00      \nShe was addressing the 'national standard' handing over ceremony in Rajshahi Cantonment Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has directed members of Bangladesh Army to keep a constant vigil to face any \"internal and external threats\" for safeguarding Bangladesh's constitution and sovereignty. \"You will have to always remain ready to face any 'internal or external threats' united for protecting the sacred constitution and sovereignty of the motherland,\" she said on Sunday. The prime minister was addressing the \"national standard\" handing over ceremony of the Bangladesh Infantry Regiments (BIR)-7th, 8th, 9th and 10th at Shaheed Col Anis Parade Ground in Rajshahi Cantonment. She handed over the national standard to the commander of the respective regiments. A smartly turned out contingent of Bangladesh Army gave salute to the prime minister through a spectacular parade. Along with Chief of Army Staff Gen Aziz Ahmed and the parade commander, the prime minister reviewed the parade riding on a decorated open jeep. Describing Bangladesh Army as an \"asset\" of the country and a \"symbol\" of the confidence and the trust of the people, the premier also asked its members to be more \"professionally-efficient\" and \"welfare-minded\" with social and religious values. \"Bangladesh Army is our asset and a symbol of confidence and trust of the people. So, you will have to be even more competent, efficient, honest, and welfare-minded being imbued with social and religious values to achieve desired standard of professionalism,\" she said.  Noting that her government always received constant support of the army to serve the people, Sheikh Hasina expressed her firm belief that the army will stand beside the people whenever it will be necessary during the running of the state by the present government. The premier said the members of Bangladesh Army played an important role in upholding democratic trend of the country by performing their responsibilities with utmost sincerity in the 11th general election. \"I extend my thanks to you for it and I also express gratitude to the countrymen for getting a scope of formation of the government for the fourth time and the third consecutive term,\" she said. The premier said her government always wants to run the country as the servants of the people, never rulers. Mentioning that the government is pledge-bound to build a modern and all-round armed forces, Sheikh Hasina said for this, the government has framed the Forces Goal-2030 which is being implemented in phases. As part of it, she said, new infantry divisions, brigades, units and training centres have been established. Besides, three new divisions have been formed in the army, she also said. The prime minister said her government has established para commando brigade for the first time, while MLRS and Missile Regiment have also been added to the army for further strengthening the country's air defence system. Besides, the present government has strengthened operational capability of the army to a great extent through inducting various modern war equipment, helicopters and modern infantry gazettes to keep pace with the developed world, she added. Referring to her government's steps for women empowerment, the prime minister said the government took an epoch making decision to get female officers and soldiers admitted to the army. Sheikh Hasina said in continuation of the initiative, appointing female pilots for the first time in the history of the army initiated a new horizon. The premier recalled that despite economic constraints, Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman took steps for establishing strong armed forces in the country. At the directives of Bangabandhu, she said, Bangladesh Military Academy was founded in Comilla Cantonment in 1972. Sheikh Hasina said Bangabandhu framed the defence policy in 1974 by realizing the necessity of a developed and professional army. The premier said in the light of Bangabandhu's far-reaching defence policy, a process for modernization of the army is underway. Today, Bangladesh Army has been elevated to a dignified position at home and abroad, she said. Sheikh Hasina said to infuse more dynamism into the Infantry Division, her government for the first time realized to establish its second regiment alongside the East Bengal Regiment. \"I approved in principle the formation of Bangladesh Infantry Regiment in 1999 and formally hoisted its flag in April 2001,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh Infantry Regiment is the first regiment established after independence. There are 43 units including two para commando battalions in the regiment, she said. \"The members of the regiment are working with reputation at home and abroad and I hope that they will continue work to uphold this reputation,\" she added. Sheikh Hasina said her government has taken all kinds of steps to build Bangladesh Infantry Regimental Centre as a modern training centre. The work on increasing training and administrative facilities is underway, she said. Besides safeguarding the country's independence and sovereignty, she said, the army has engaged themselves in the nation-building programs. \"Due to your professional efficiency, the important responsibility for supervision work of the Padma Bridge and the construction work of Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Marine Drive, the Hatirjheel Project in Dhaka, and Mohipal Flyover in Feni was given to you,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the army members in different foreign missions are bringing honour and dignity through sacrifice, dutifulness and professionalism which have further brightened Bangladesh's image abroad. She said the flag is a symbol of independence, sovereignty, honour and dignity. \"So it's a responsibility of all soldiers to protect the dignity of the flag,\" she said. The premier said earning ability of getting the national flag by any unit is a matter of rare honour and pride. \"The national flag, a symbol of independence and sovereignty, has been handed over to you and I extend my heartiest congratulations to BIR-7,8, 9 and 10 for achieving this honour and glory,\" she said. \"You will have to always remain prepared to protect the dignity of the flag which you've got as recognition to your work with efficiency, hard exercise and dutifulness,\" she said. Earlier on her arrival at the venue, the prime minister was received by Chief of Army Staff Gen Aziz Ahmed and GOC and Area Commander of the army and the Commandant of the Bangladesh Infantry Regimental Centre. Ministers, advisers to the prime minister, parliament members, the chiefs of navy and air force, former army chiefs, foreign diplomats and high civil and military officials were present on the occasion."

      "text": "India Trade Dispute Brings Austerity to Nepal\n1989-05-25T05:00:00.000Z\nThe Nepalese Government, digging in for a long siege in a trade war with India that is being seen here as a test of Nepalese sovereignty, has introduced austerity measures and started reordering its development plans, officials here say.\nSince India closed all but two border crossings two months ago, ostentatious living has been forbidden in the Hindu kingdom, where most of the 18 million people are poor. Social gatherings, including wedding receptions, are being monitored, officials of the Government of King Birendra said in interviews.\nAt their most optimistic, Nepalese officials and business leaders say they will make the most of a cutoff of Indian consumer goods by encouraging local industries to fill the vacuum. New sources of imports and markets for exports are being sought. But some local business leaders and diplomats say serious problems are developing.\nIndia, through which most of landlocked Nepal's imports and exports pass, closed 19 of the 21 border crossings on March 23, and a week later allowed petroleum products agreements to lapse, depriving Nepal of fuel.\nAt the root of the dispute is Nepal's insistence on two treaties, one for trade and one for transit rights. India wants one, as it had before 1978. As the dispute drags on, diplomats here say, it becomes more apparent that Katmandu wants to review all its relations with New Delhi, embodied in a 1950 treaty now described as ''colonial.''\nTo the surprise of some diplomats, the Nepalese, most of whom cannot afford imported luxuries, appear to have closed ranks behind King Birendra's Government. Officials are reported to have concluded that the dispute with New Delhi will probably not be resolved until after India's elections, expected near the end of this year.\nA good harvest of wheat and mustard seed, from which edible oil is made, has reduced fears of a serious food shortage. Medicines are being flown in from Bangladesh, the Government spokesman, Radhe Shyam Bista, said. Black-market trading is also going on along the India-Nepal border.\nRoyal Nepal Airlines has been able to fly in enough fuel from Dhaka to restore all domestic air links and sustain international routes, Mr. Bista said. But taxis and private cars have been made idle by shortages, causing tourism's biggest problem, and a number of restautants have closed.\nOn the surface, daily life in the Katmandu Valley appears to be continuing without serious interruption, with limited diesel and gasoline supplies arriving from China or Singapore. India is allowing transit of essential goods.\nBut business leaders and diplomats suggest a ''hidden crisis'' is developing as Government and private projects wind down and the poorest day laborers lose jobs. Tourism has also been affected. May and June are traditionally the month when Indian tourists fill hotels vacated by Westerners.\nGovernment departments have been ordered to stop buying furniture, vehicles and land. Foreign visits and official receptions are being curtailed and the use of cars restricted.\nThe behavior of ''dignitaries and distinguished persons'' will be watched to determine whether they are obeying a recently enacted Social Reform Act forbidding lavish entertaining and other unneccessary expense.\nOfficials say a program for greater self-sufficiency in essential goods will be introduced. Large-scale development projects will also be reviewed."

      "text": "WASHINGTON TALK: AIDING DISASTER VICTIMS; Small Agency Helps a Great Power Lighten Human Suffering\n1988-09-13T05:00:00.000Z\nWhen the devastation and human misery are so large - 25 million Bangladeshis homeless from floods covering an area almost three times the size of New Jersey - the generous efforts of even the richest friend may seem minuscule.\nThe way Washington responds to dozens of international disasters each year is nonetheless a highly refined but free-wheeling process that invariably manages to gather resources to make a difference in even the most overwhelming circumstances.\nThe main coordination is supplied by a small band of 21 full-time people who make up the Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance, a part of the Agency for International Development that is housed in a first-floor corner of the State Department.\nIt is there, usually around a gray, horseshoe-shaped battery of desks and telephones in its operations center, that daily life and death decisions are made to deploy the planes that carry all manner of relief to victims almost anywhere in the world. Intensity Is Normal\nDespite Bangladesh's enormous needs, activity these days is said to be only somewhat more intense than usual.\n''We're working 16 disasters right now,'' Julia V. Taft, the harried but unfailingly courteous dynamo who has run the O.F.D.A. since early 1986, said on Thursday as she prepared for the 3 P.M. Bangladesh strategy session. ''We are just busting ourselves.''\nSince Sept. 1, when Bangladesh was officially declared a disaster - a life-threatening situation beyond the ability of the victims' government to handle - five other disasters have been added to the O.F.D.A.'s list. These little publicized tragedies, bringing the total to a record-tying 54 for the office this year, involve floods in the Dominican Republic, insect infestation in Ethiopia, floods in Niger, displaced people in Burundi and floods in India.\nThe job of Mrs. Taft and her staff, which includes some former members of the Peace Corps, is to identify, with the help of A.I.D. missions and American embassies, the need for help and to coordinate the Federal Government's response. This generally also involves liaison with private voluntary organizations like CARE and the Save the Children Fund that have a a permanent presence in stricken countries. 'The Focal Point'\n''They're the focal point,'' said Robert J. McCloskey, a former State Department official and Ambassador who is now Washington representative for Catholic Relief Services, which has contributed $300,000 so far through its Caritas Bangladesh affiliate.\nJoy Carol, director of Save the Children's Asia-Pacific region, said that even when her group acts on its own, perhaps before the Government can mount an airlift, ''we always report immediately'' to the State Department office as to what has been done.\nThe office also keeps track of what other countries and international organizations are doing. Saudi Arabia and India, for example, were listed on a situation report last week as having lent four helicopters each to the Bangladesh relief effort, and Japan was shown as pledging $13 million for food and transportation.\nMrs. Taft seems a master at marshaling the vast Government resources at her disposal. She is a veteran relief worker; in the 1970's she was director of the Interagency Task Force for Indochina Refugees based in the State Department, and has also worked in this field at the Pentagon. In addition to the Defense Department, the office has close ties with the Centers for Disease Control, the Forest Service and its A.I.D. sister unit, the Bureau for Food for Peace. Response on Same Day\nThe Government's first cash donation to this year's victims of monsoon rains and subsequent flooding came the same day that Bangladesh's President, H.M. Ershad, made his international appeal for help. Willard A. DePree, the United States Ambassador in Dhaka, exercising his disaster-assistance authority, released $25,000 for the President's emergency fund. The O.F.D.A. quickly added a $40,000 grant to Save the Children, $50,000 to CARE, $132,000 to World Vision and $1.1 million to two arms of the United Nations. In addition, Food for Peace released 10,000 tons of ''food-for-work'' program wheat from Bangladesh stocks, the grain and transport for it valued at about $2.5 million.\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Taft and her staff had begun planning for the first shipments of goods to Bangladesh, on a giant Air Force C-5A crammed with supplies drawn mainly from a depot at New Windsor, Md., one of the O.F.D.A.'s six stockpiles. The others are in Panama, Guam, Singapore, and Pisa, Italy. There is also a cache of survival kits and communications equipment at headquarters.\nThis cargo plane, loaded at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Washington, left Friday night and arrived, with the aid of midair refuelings, in Bangladesh today after a layover in Japan. The airport in Dhaka was reopened only late last week.\nIn the shipment were 850 rolls, or 2.2 million square feet, of plastic sheeting for shelter; 10,000 collapsible five-gallon water jugs; 26 water storage tanks, each with a 3,000-gallon capacity, and two water purifier systems, each with an operator to run it and to train Bangladeshis in its use. A Three-Week Stay\nA dozen other Americans from various agencies were on the plane, including Jay F. Morris, the Deputy Administrator of A.I.D. All but Mr. Morris are to remain in Bangladesh least three weeks.\n''The marching orders are to do everything we can,'' Mrs. Taft said.\nLater this week, a second plane, a C-141, will leave Panama with more American equipment for Bangladesh, including six large fiberglass boats with 40-horsepower engines, 150 large tents and 10,000 blankets. Some equipment will be picked up en route at a Defense Department depot on Okinawa.\nThe O.F.D.A. flights generally do not carry privately donated goods, which on some occasions, including the 1985 Mexican earthquake, have proven more a hindrance than a help.\n''Some people clean out their closets with lots of junk, and the important stuff doesn't get through,'' said Mrs. Taft.\nAlthough the O.F.D.A. has more financial latitude than most agencies - Congress is a good bet to approve a compelling special request even in the budget-conscious era - it has resources, including borrowings from A.I.D. accounts, other than budgetary appropriations. For example, Mr. Morris and his staff will seek to ''reprogram'' some $84 million built up in Bangladeshi currency under a program by which American food is given to that country for local sale. Tries to Avoid Politics\nThe disaster office, which in the 1987 fiscal year administered $25.7 million in emergency assistance involving 54 situations, spent another $4.1 million for various programs to mitigate hazards, to improve warning systems and otherwise to prepare for disruptions.\nIn 1986, because of the famine in Ethiopia, the office presided over a record-shattering $130 million in aid.\nMrs. Taft, although appointed to her post by the President, is careful to keep her office free from both international politics - the United States need not have diplomatic relations with a country to offer aid -and domestic partisanship. The latter, however, doesn't prevent her on occasion from discussing things with her husband, William Howard Taft 4th, a deputy Secretary of Defense and a prominent member of the Administration.\nThe department, she says, has traditionally paid ''special attention'' to the needs of the disaster office, but she on occasion plays the spouse card as well to obtain transportation and other support. ''I think it may help -a little bit,'' Mrs. Taft said."

The party also said that the dengue situation has turned epidemic in the capital due to the government's failure to take any effective preventive measure and conduct drive against Aedes mosquito. \"The Department of Public Health and the Directorate General of Health Services have no extensive drive and action to prevent it,\" said BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Sunday. Speaking at a press conference at the party's Nayapaltan central office, he said the city corporations are only giving lip services instead of carrying out adequate anti-mosquito drives. \"Many people are dying getting affected with dengue, but no effective step in sight to protect them.\" The senior BNP leader said this government has no sense of responsibility for people as it is only busy pocketing public money. He also said the government is hardly bothered about public welfare and improving public health and checking diseases since it is not elected by people. Rizvi alleged that though the ruling party leaders are used to talk about the country's development, people are going through immense sufferings due to serious tailbacks and sorry state of roads.  He came down hard on the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Chairman Iqbal Mahmood for his comment that corruption committed \"in good faith\" by public servants is not an offence, saying he encouraged the government employees to indulge in corruption. Rizvi also said the ACC chief's remark is a dangerous message of bad governance. The BNP leader said Iqbal Mahmood has no other alternative to defending the corruption by government officials since the ACC officials themselves are involved in corruption. He also alleged that the ACC is busy suppressing opposition in the name of preventing corruption while it has turned a blind eye to the real corrupt plundering public money and making second homes in different countries. Rizvi said the banking sector has been ruined due to government officials' corruption \"in good faith\". About the deteriorating flood situation, he said the ministers and the ruling party MPs are giving lip services from the capital instead of standing beside the victims with necessary relief materials."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-21 00:00:00      \nThe monsoon rains will be here soon and the possibility of an early flood is very likely, said the farmers The boro season has come to an end with acres of golden ripe crops in three districts of the country. Farmers in Sunamganj, Brahmanbaria, and Natore are happy with the high yield but the shortage of farm workers is making the final production uncertain. The monsoon rains will be here soon and the possibility of an early flood is very likely, said the farmers. But the deadly Covid-19 pandemic  is forcing the nation into a lock down and agriculture which needs combined effort with a number of inputs can be most affected, say farmers. Despite the Department of Agricultural Extension providing machines and assistance, the vastly agriculture dependent communities of the country are suffering the most. This can be disastrous for the economy if not handled properly.  Early flood predictions worry farmers in Sunamganj This year farmers were expecting a good yield from the 2,19,300 hectares of haor (Backswamp) lands in Sunamganj. The vast paddy fields took on a golden shade this month and are ready to be harvested and threshed. However, a certain turning point of the event jolted the whole scenario as the recent pandemic has almost brought the whole world to a standstill, including agriculture. The farmers of this district are in great peril as they need seasonal migrant farmworkers from other districts  to help them harvest their crops from other districts. This year, helping hands are scarce because they are not able to access the needed workers due to lockdowns across the country meant to curb the spread of the deadly virus. The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) has predicted the district will experience heavy rains at the end of this month. This might cause  early flooding that can waterlog the entire crop, while farmers need three more weeks to reap their crops, said Judge Miah, a farmer in Sadar upazila's Lalpur village. Ajman Hossain, Jaban Ali, and Shamsur Rahman among other farmers of the area, said thousands of farmworkers used to come to this area in the harvest season but this year they are few and far between. \"It has started to rain already and acres of land are full of ripe paddy. We don't know how we are going to process this huge crop before the rain starts coming down full swing,\" said Shamshur Rahman. Deputy Director of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Md Safar Uddin, said they have provided 126 Combine Harvester Machines and 212 Reaper Machines to assist farmers and facilitate the whole operation with less manpower. Contacted, Md Abdul Ahad, Deputy Commissioner of the district, assured Dhaka Tribune they are strictly maintaining all possible precautions to prevent farmers from being affected by Covid-19, and said: \"We will provide more machines and farm workers if needed. There are 30,000 workers currently assisting the farmers in their fields, and paddy in 18,000 hectares of land is being handled successfully, to the best of my knowledge. Farmworkers scarce, Brahmanbaria farmers using other resources To cope with the scarcity of farmhands, farmers from Brahmanbaria are depending on the unemployed who returned to their village homes before the nationwide lockdown. On a field visit, hundreds of inexperienced hands like garment workers, hotel assistants, chefs, day labourers, fishermen, vendors, and even students, could be seen helping farmers with their harvest. They say this way they can help the farmers and provide for their families with the money they get in return for their work. Md Maharram Bhuiyan, a hawker from Chittagong, who was trying to harvest paddy with a farmer said: \"This field needs tremendous labour which I do not have. But in order to earn my daily meals I have to do it, no matter what.\" According to the DAE's office, around 17,000 farm workers from other districts join the farmers each year. However, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, only 1,500 workers could come this season. Asked about the situation, Brahmanbaria DAE's Deputy Director Md Rabiul Haque Majumdar, said: \"It is a positive endeavour that unemployed youths are joining in to assist the farmers. It serves them both. But if the farmers need more assistance we have to provide additional farm workers from other districts maintaining proper health protocols.\" Brahmanbaria DC, Hayat-Ud-Doula, said around 40 Combine Harvester Machines will be provided to the farmers and all possible steps will be taken to help the farmers.  Natore DAE expects high yield despite scarce manpower Officials from Natore DAE are expecting a good boro yield of around 4 lakh tons, said the district's DAE office. To facilitate the harvest they provided 17 Combine Harvesters and 2 Reaper Machines, confirmed Subrata Kumar, deputy director of the organisation. \"We have a high quality boro paddy yield on 58,000 hectares of land this season. Seasonal migrant farm workers are far less this year but if the farmers ask for it we will certainly arrange hired workers to reap the crops properly,\" he said. He said hundreds of workers are coming from various areas to assist the boro farmers who have asked for 30 more machines to ease the process. UP Chairman Asadujjaman and an Awami League leader of Naldanga upazila, said: \"We have prepared a list of AL activists in every district who will be assisting  farmers in the fields. With the machines and the provided help, we don't think we will face any problems with the crop this season."

      "text": "AT LEAST 700 DEAD IN A MAJOR QUAKE IN THE HIMALAYAS\n1988-08-22T05:00:00.000Z\nA devastating earthquake rumbled across eastern India and Nepal before dawn Sunday, killing more than 700 people.\nThe authorities said that many victims were still buried in the debris of their homes and that the final toll could be much higher. The quake, which registered 6.5 on the Richter scale, according to the Seismological Observatory in New Delhi, struck the region soon after 4 A.M. Sunday and lasted nearly 45 seconds. Aftershocks went on for about an hour, the observatory said.\nReports in Indian newspapers this morning said that more than 450 people had been killed in Bihar state. The Nepalese Home Ministry confirmed 252 deaths there.\nIt was the most severe earthquake in the Himalayan region since one in the Assam region killed more than 1,000 people in 1950. Thousands of Houses Wrecked\nMost of the deaths in Bihar were reported in Darbhanga, Munger and Madhubani districts, where officials said more than 25,000 dwellings were destroyed.\nIndian newspapers reported today that at least 10,000 people had been injured in Bihar. Officials in Nepal said that more than 1,000 were injured and that thousands of houses had collapsed.\nVolunteer relief groups, the Red Cross organizations in both countries, policemen, soldiers and local residents began digging for bodies and taking injured survivors to hospitals.\n''Reports of casualties are pouring in from the affected areas,'' the Government television station in Bihar reported. Obstructed by Landslides\nLandslides disrupted communications, preventing officials from obtaining information about the remote areas, said V. K. Sharma, a deputy secretary in the Bihar state government, by telephone late Sunday. ''The tolls have come in only from urban areas.'' Mr. Sharma spoke from Patna, the capital of Bihar.\nThe monsoon rain, which began in late June, was also hindering rescue operations. More than 50 villages were said to have been flooded after embankments shifted as a result of the earthquake today.\nTremors of varying intensities were felt in a 1,000-mile belt from India's eastern tip in Nagaland, sweeping across Bangladesh to New Delhi in the north and the central city of Jabalpur. Buildings cracked and fell, windowpanes and doors rattled, and tens of thousands of Indians and Nepalese fled into streets and open spaces.\nMost of the victims were asleep when the quake struck. ''My bed rattled, then it began swinging,'' said R. N. Rudram a resident of Patna. ''My dogs began barking and I ran out of the house.''\nThe Chief Minister of Bihar state, Bhajwat Jha Azad, traveled to the quake area and announced immediate relief payments of 5,000 rupees, equivalent to about $400, to the relatives of each person killed.\nMr. Azad ordered members of his cabinet to the devastated areas to supervise relief and rescue operations. The Indian national Government sent doctors, nurses, aid workers and medicine from New Delhi to Bihar. Dry Wells, Broken Roads\nThe massive landslides blocked roads, isolating towns and villages in the Nepalese-Indian border belt, and disrupting communications and rail lines. A news agency report quoted residents of Lahan, in southeastern Nepal, as saying that wells had dried up and the main highway had been riven by six-foot-wide fissures.\nThe devastation was largely confined to Bihar, an impoverished state, and eastern Nepal, including Dharan district, where about 150 deaths were reported.\nAt 6.5, the earthquake was one classified as capable of causing severe damage. Still, it was less powerful than the quake of 1934, which killed 13,000 people in Bihar and Nepal and which measured 8 on the Richter scale - 15 times stronger than the one today.\nIt was the most severe earthquake in the region since the one in Assam in 1950, which raised the level of the Brahmaputra River. Two weeks ago, a strong tremor shook northeastern india and Bangladesh; there were few fatalities then.\nH.N. Srivastava, director of the New Delhi Seismological Observatory, said the epicenter of Sunday's quake was about 40 miles northeast of Darbhanga on the border with Nepal. Royal Birthday Deferred\nIn Nepal on Sunday, officials announced a postponement of the birthday celebrations of the Queen Mother because of the disaster.\nPrime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India announced plans to visit Bihar today to survey the damage.\nDr. Srivastava, the seismologist, said the tremors were caused by the rubbing of the Indian land mass, known in geophysical terms as the Indian Plate, and the Eurasian Plate in the Himalaya mountain range, which forced sudden movements in underground faults in the mountain system.\nThe Indian Plate moves north and northeast about two inches a year, he said. The Eurasian Plate is stationary, and earthquakes in the belt running from Kashmir to Burma are caused by the grating of the two land masses, he said.\n''This is a continuing process,'' Dr. Srivastava said, adding that more earthquakes are likely in the coming years in the same region."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-24 00:00:00      \nPointing out that health is an integral part of the development journey, she said it is essential for continued socioeconomic progress Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stressed the need for collective efforts for ensuring universal health coverage (UHC), saying that its benefits are global and fundamental to development. \"Benefits of universal health coverage are global and we need to work collectively,\" she said while delivering the national statement at the plenary session of the High-level meeting on Universal Health Coverage (UHC) at the Trusteeship Council in the UN Headquarters here on Monday afternoon. The premier added: \"Collaboration amongst stakeholders around a common goal like universal health coverage is fundamental to our development ... we should work together to achieve health for all.\" Pointing out that health is an integral part of the development journey, she said it is essential for continued socioeconomic progress. \"Ensuring Universal Health Coverage for all has assumed greater importance. It also helps ensure access to quality health services without adding financial hardship on the disadvantaged people in particular,\" she said. In Bangladesh, the premier mentioned that in the face of all constraints and limitations, the government has developed innovative ways to ensure universal health coverage for all. She said that government's comprehensive support to health sector today includes risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. \"We had also promised to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one third through prevention and treatment as well as to promote mental health and well-being by 2030,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said that when Awami League government assumed office in 1996, she accorded high priority to strengthening local community health services. \"Acknowledging the critical role of health services at the grassroots level, we introduced Community Health Clinics (CHC) in 1998,\" she said. These clinics, she said, are model of public-private partnership where the government provides skilled personnel, medicine and equipment and the local people provide the land for the clinic. In this connection, the prime minister said that the government had planned to construct 14,890 community clinics all over the country, especially in rural areas. \"So far 13,743 community clinics are functioning which provide services to approximately 600,000 individuals daily,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the clinics are accessible to 80% of the population and are located within 30 minutes walking distance of their residences. She said it is estimated that on an average 40 patients receive service from each clinic every day and 90 percent of them are women and children. \"Our efficient health planning and implementation has reduced maternal mortality to 172, infant mortality to 24 and under-5 mortality to 31,\" she said. The prime minister said in Bangladesh full vaccination coverage is now 82.3%, life expectancy is more than 72.8 years while fertility rate per woman has dropped to 2.1. \"We've made commendable success in elimination of tuberculosis and leprosy,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said that the government has already integrated the health-related SDG targets into the long-term development plans. \"Our 'Visions 2021' and 2041' have given top priority to health security. As per our election manifesto 2018, we are planning to expand the universal health coverage even further and make health service free for child under one year and for elders over 65 years,\" she said. Climate Action Summit Later, the prime minister delivered a statement at the Climate Action Summit at the General Assembly Hall in the UN Headquarters. She said the impacts of climate change have been devastating the lives of almost two billion people globally every year. \"Globally, frequency of extreme climate events is increasing. But in Bangladesh, casualties are reduced to almost nil from hundreds of thousands due to efficient early warning system,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. \"We have adopted adaptation and resilience building measures, including an 82-year Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, to deal with issues on climate change, natural disasters and water management,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the government has built 4,291cyclone shelters and 523 flood shelters in the coastal areas to give refuge during disasters. Some 56 thousand volunteers are available to warn and facilitate preparation for danger, she said. The premier said she is delighted to launch today the Risk-informed Early Action Partnership (Reap). It is an ambitious new initiative created by the United Kingdom, Finland and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Sheikh Hasina said she is pleased to announce that over 50 countries and over 20 other organizations are joining this partnership today at its launch. \"Reap aims to make one billion people around the world safer from disasters by 2025 by bringing together the humanitarian, development and climate communities,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh has shown how a strong early warning system and a coordinated approach in disaster management can make a big difference. \"So, we have happily joined this initiative to share our experiences with other vulnerable countries, as well as to learn from others in mitigating the risks of future hazards,\" she said. The prime minister arrived here on Sunday afternoon on an eight-day official visit to the USA to join the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA)."

Affiliated sources have confirmed that numerous fake Facebook IDs had been opened using the names of prominent personalities, politicians, and other renowned people. Based on this information, a request was sent to the Facebook authority to shut the fake personal IDs, pages, and groups, by using certain focal points in the country.  Mustafa Jabbar said: \"We were able to shut down 1,500 Facebook IDs recently. They were being used to spread false propaganda; several of them were owned by militants.\" The removed Facebook IDs are not related to pornography, Jabbar further said. \"These rumours circulated as we are closing down porn sites as well. However, the rumours are false.\" Bangladesh has a better relationship with Facebook than before, the technocrat minister said. \"If we ask for something, Facebook's authorities listen to us. They evaluate the requests with their community standards and try to respond to our requests as fast as possible. I believe it is a great achievement.\" He added: \"More accounts will be blocked in the future. We have already identified them, and our team is working diligently to monitor their activities.\" The Department of Telecom (Dot), under the Posts and Telecommunications Division, is working to monitor the cyber world. A cybersecurity monitoring project has been introduced under Dot, and half of the project has already been realized. Affiliated sources have said the ever since the cybersecurity monitoring project began being implemented, it has become easier to monitor social media sites. The government has IT monitoring cells to gather data on the cyber world as well. Other than that, due to better monitoring--by law enforcement agencies, BTRC, National Telecom Monitoring Cells, and other affiliated organizations--it has become easier to identify IDs, the sources said.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-27 00:00:00      \nBangladesh's banking sector faces a number of major challenges including rising nonperforming loans, credit concentrations, poor culture of professionalism, the rise of family oligarchy, lack of corporate culture, capital market debility, and parallel banking by the government through deficit financing instruments. Many of the challenges, by now, have turned into threats to the country's financial architecture mainly due to two reasons: the central bank's weak leadership and the finance ministry's institutional trespassing on banking affairs. A lack of knowledge on why policies should be consistent has led to a culture of financial indiscipline.  By definition, the central bank is the single most powerful custodian of the banking sector. This is also what the law states. In 1972, Bangabandhu formulated the Bangladesh Bank Order which delineates the powers and responsibilities of the central bank. Of course, it is linked to the finance ministry but the central bank isn't supposed to be a subsidiary office of the ministry. It is supposed to be the custodian of the nation's currency supply and is responsible for preserving the right value of the currency as per the 1972 Order. The 2003 amendments made it clear that the ministry can't interfere in the internal policy decisions of the central bank. But what we have seen is that finance ministers often speak as if they are a head of a monetary body. What we have also seen is that BB seeks endorsements from the ministry even for day-to-day affairs. This is a bad signal for professional bankers but a good signal for defaulters. It is a virtual merger of the central bank with the secretariat under the office of the banking division.  Unfortunately, most of our institutions carry the vestiges of colonial legacy. Bureaucracy, being its best example, warrants reform. And so does our central bank. Why? The British at some point realised that their central bank should be bestowed with greater powers and discretion. The Bank of England's governor enjoys a high level of authority in monetary and financial decisions. He was even made the chair of the financial stability board of Great Britain. If we look further to the west, the Fed chair is deemed as the second most powerful person after the president in America. The world has changed but we haven't. It's as if the ministry expects a completely pliant leadership at the central bank so that the monetary authority can't question any weakness in fiscal capacity, fiscal deficit, and fiscal desperation. This tug-of-war has always been there since the birth of the central bank. But most countries have solved this conflict in two ways: (i) by clearly separating the powers and responsibilities of these two institutions, and (ii) by empowering the central bank to make it a nonpartisan custodian of the economy. While the ministry gets its oxygen from political mandates, the central bank can't. Hence, it looks to the constitution for the powers bestowed upon it to guard the greater interests of the economy in a dispassionate, scholarly, honest, and nonpolitical manner. Timely reform of the BB Order and strong leadership at the central bank are the need of the hour to tackle the threats (calling them \"challenges\" is an understatement) looming in the banking sector. And Bangladesh has to do this, because, unlike other emerging countries, the banking sector is the main vehicle of development since the capital market has already been partly vandalised. The government has to understand that policy inconsistency will ruin the market in the long run. It has to realise that the central bank should be the main controller of the interest rate. All other interest rates, even some offered on government instruments, must follow the market or the long-term bond rates assigned by the central bank. Otherwise, attempts to develop either the bond market or secondary market will be thwarted. Short-term management of fiscal deficit shouldn't empower the ministry to assign out-of-market interest rates to fiscal tools. That is how fiscal desperation ruins the effectiveness of monetary policy. We shouldn't forget what 16th-century economist Sir Thomas Gresham observed: \"Good and bad coins cannot circulate together.\" The bad will drive the good away. In the same way, the \"bad\" interest rates (which are of course \"good\" for the super-rich) on National Savings Certificates (NSCs) are leading to deposit rates offered by the \"poor\" banks becoming dysfunctional. The government wants the lending rates to be brought down to single digits. How can it happen when the government itself is offering double-digit rates on its NSCs? Lending rates must sit on the deposit rates and the spread needed for bankers' bread and butter. Sanchayapatra is doomed to fail no matter how much it grows. The flood of inflows from Sanchayapatra is temporarily hiding the fiscal incapacity of the ministry, but it is leading to a burden on one of the most expensive ways of deficit financing in the world. The interest liability is rising--a threat that will wipe off a big segment of the budget which could otherwise be spent on development. Inconsistent policies and fiscal trespassing are the main hindrances to interest rate rationalisation. The Reserve Bank of India made a policy so that government-offered interest rates are always linked to the central bank's long-term bond rates. It's similar in the cases of Sri Lanka and Pakistan. And the central bank's long-term bond rates by and large follow the neoclassical Fisher equation where the nominal interest rate is a summation of the real interest rate and expected inflation. While the real interest rate, linked with the real economy, should be more or less stable, the nominal interest rate can go up if expected inflation rises, and rates must fall when inflation drops. Our fiscal gurus seem to disregard this theory entirely. It's a threat to the banking sector. The ministry's behaviour, which defies Fisher's formula, neither follows the dynamics of inflation nor does it understand why real interest rates matter for savings. This duality is creating an interest rate anarchy in the entire banking sector, making the most powerful tool of the sector defective. This is the fiercest threat to the banking sector and one which actually masks the ministry's fiscal incapacity. This is one of the main reasons why private investment as a share of GDP has remained almost stagnant for years. This is also one of the main reasons why Bangladesh still ranks below its neighbours in the Ease of Doing Business Index of the World Bank. Thus, institutional irregularities and a lack of understanding of the theoretical underpinnings are at the root of the weaknesses of our banking sector including the default culture and poor governance. We live in a society whose ranking in the Knowledge Economy Index is one of the poorest in Asia and the Pacific. Policymakers seem to be more comfortable creating space for obedience to compliance, and not as comfortable freeing up space for knowledge, research, expertise, and skills. Despite trumpeting about innovation et al, we are the least innovative nation in Asia. We go on and on about our impressive growth figures, but we have failed to generate adequate jobs for the youth in the country. The informal sector still accounts for more than 80 percent of our labour force. Where is this growth going? Doesn't it nullify the truth of Okun's law which says that higher growth generates higher levels of employment? Banking has come to a crossroads, but better ways can still be found. More autonomy for the central bank can be ensured by getting rid of the banking division of the ministry whose dual role is weakening the central administration of BB. We don't need the National Savings Department. Banks are supposed to take on the role of deposit mobilisation. NSD's nonmarket rates are obviously distortive for the market and private investment. Bangladesh shouldn't turn into a \"savings society\". It needs investment more than ever before. More autonomy and greater economic insight of the central bank leadership, along with the elimination of fiscal trespassing on banking affairs, are the answers for a healthier banking sector in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh have achieved their first ever win against India in T20 format on Sunday when they defeat the hosts by seven wickets at Delhi. Now, Tigers have the golden chance to seal the three-match series as India are on a backfoot with a relatively inexperienced bowling attack. Weather is a big concern for the match due to effect of cyclone 'Maha'. According to Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Cyclone Maha, which is expected to hit the Gujarat coast today, has weakened into a severe storm on Wednesday. But still the storm is likely to bring \"heavy rains\" during the next 48 hours in Gujrat state. The weather, however, was clear on Wednesday morning as Bangladesh team practiced in their scheduled time at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium. Tigers started their training with warm-up session in morning and after an intense fielding practice session the batsmen went to nets adjacent to the stadium. India had an optional practice session on Wednesday in the afternoon session. Like their counterparts, they enjoyed the condition which was hot and humid all the day until evening. But, before the sunset the first sign of rain was seen as the dark cloud started to gather during. And around 7pm local time a light thunderstorm hit Rajkot with moderate wind. At the stadium area, pitch covers were blown away and suddenly all the flood lights were went off for few minutes. From the press box area of the Saurashtra Cricket Stadium, strong wind was felt during the raining period. After half an hour the rain, however, stopped.   The weather forecast was suggesting near 50 percent on precipitation on Wednesday evening while the forecast at Thursday evening is predicting near 15-20 percent of precipitation. However, in morning and noon session both teams were preparing for an exciting contest amid rain threat. The pitch in Delhi, where the first game took place, was a tricky one for the batsmen but pitches in Saurashtra Cricket Stadium generally offer good help to the batsmen. Both the captains are focusing on their own game plans rather than concerned about the weather too much. \"We will observe the wicket before the match and then decide about the playing eleven. The wicket looks good. We are expecting a good batting track with an average score of 170-180. Probably we will field the same eleven and don't break the inning combination but the final call will be taken before the toss,\" said Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad at the pre match press conference at Rajkot on Wednesday.  His counterpart Rohit Sharma was also expecting a run feast. \"The pitch looks good. Rajkot is always a good track to bat and it does offer some assistance to the bowlers also. I think it will better pitch than that of Delhi,\" said India captain Rohit  in the pre match media session. "

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-21 00:00:00      \nIn an exclusive session with The Daily Star, Carola van Rijnsoever, ambassador of sustainable development of the Netherlands and director of inclusive green growth under its foreign Ministry; Katja Portegies, director for safety and water of Rijkswaterstaat, the executive agency of ministry of infrastructure and water management, Netherlands; and Prof Shamsul Alam, senior secretary and member of the Planning Commission, talked about the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. Carola van Rijnsoever and Katja Portegies are now in Dhaka, to attend the Bangladesh-Netherlands intergovernmental committee meeting set to take place today. Carola van Rijnsoever said though Bangladesh is a fast-growing economy, climate change poses a risk to its development and bright future. Both The Netherlands and Bangladesh are part of the Global Commission on Adaptation, driving solutions for climate adaptation forward, she added. Katja Protegies said Netherlands has more than 200 years of experience in dealing with water and constructing the country's water-related infrastructures. Based on this experience, the Rijkswaterstaat is well-positioned to assist Bangladesh in the implementation of the BDP 2100, she said. \"A large part of our country lies below sea level; that makes us vulnerable to flooding. Protection against flooding is always vital for us,\" she said. For forty years, Rijkswaterstaat has been responsible for monitoring the quantity and quality of the water. This is a vital service for shipping, agriculture, the distribution of water in dry periods, flood protection and drinking water supply, she said.  Rijkswaterstaat monitors water level, water discharge rates, wave height and flow speed at more than 450 locations along the coast and in rivers, canals and lakes using automatic measuring equipment. These data help Rijkswaterstaat determine the measures to be taken in the event of an excess or shortfall of water, Protegeis added.   Prof Shamsul Alam talked about how Bangladesh Delta Plan will leave an impact on the people of Bangladesh.  As a result of the tremendous economic growth in the past decade, Bangladesh now faces many new challenges related to urbanisation, fresh water supply, land availability, infrastructure, energy and labor, he said.  Bangladesh, one of the largest deltas in the world,  faces many natural hazards such as salinity intrusion in coastal areas, flooding, riverbank erosion and cyclones as an effect of climate change, Alam added.   \"The Netherlands has advanced expertise in the fields of delta technology, water technology and maritime technology. Bangladesh also have acquired broad knowledge and experience on integrated water resources and land use management,\" he said. In 2012, the governments of Bangladesh and The Netherlands signed a Memorandum of Understanding, recognising the importance of developing an overarching \"Delta Plan\" for a safe, sustainable and prosperous socio-economic delta development. The government has developed a long-term BDP2100 to cope with these climate challenges and move the country forward for the next 100 years, he said, adding that it includes major policies, priority investment programmes and institutional reforms to address climate change risks by improved polder management and flood control programmes. BDP2100 aims to contribute to achieving an upper middle-income status and eliminating extreme poverty, Prof Alam said. When asked what kind of help Netherlands is providing to Bangladesh to implement DBP2100, he said although the socio-economic context in the Netherlands is different from Bangladesh, the two countries are facing very similar climate change trends. Carola van Rijnsoever added, \"I want to emphasise that this cooperation is truly beneficial to both countries. The national experts in Bangladesh have a deep understanding of water-related issues. The Netherlands can gain from this knowledge in our objective to develop innovative water management policies.\""

      "text": "India's Drought Is Worst in Decades\n1987-08-16T05:00:00.000Z\nDawn broke in these parched farmlands today with gray clouds, raising a few hopes of rain. But by midmorning the sun was ablaze, once again burning farmers' hopes of relief from India's driest rainy season in decades.\n''I am 75 years old, and I have never seen anything this bad,'' said Naufat Mohammed, a white-bearded farmer, looking at the cracked earth around a well. ''This is God's will, but God is angry with us.''\nAfter weeks of false hopes that the summer monsoon rains would come, India faces the prospect of devastation to the national economy, the uprooting of hundreds of thousands of people and the need for a huge relief effort to distribute drinking water and prevent starvation.\nThe drought, which Government officials say is unprecedented in intensity, has already spread through most of the country, hitting hardest in the northern grain belts. There wells, reservoirs and water tanks are running at dangerously low levels or are already dry. Rain 75% Below Normal\nLess than a third of the country has received normal rainfall this year, with the hardest-hit areas as low as 75 percent below normal.\nAlthough the monsoon floods cause many deaths, the rains are normally one of the great life-giving forces in India, central to its culture and the expectations of its people. The monsoon season is incubated as heat in the subcontinent increases while the Indian Ocean to the south remains cool, unleashing a stormy mix of air that then pushes up from the south.\nAlmost nothing is anticipated as much as summer rains carried by winds heading northward starting in early June. The failure of the monsoon is a severe blow to Indian morale as well as to the survival of its people.\nThere have been no signs yet of death or starvation, but experts say they fear that a large-scale loss of cattle could wipe out the livelihoods of countless families. Milk production has already fallen sharply as the Government struggles to rush fodder such as spoiled wheat or sugar cane to drought areas. Driest in 80 Years\nNew Delhi, 50 miles northwest of here, is suffering its driest season in 80 years. Residents of New Delhi and other cities are suffering water shortages and widespread power cuts so electricity can be diverted to farm areas to run hard-pressed wells and irrigation systems. Other cities are experiencing the same thing.\nAgriculture experts say they fear that India's summer grain crop, once expected to be 90 million metric tons, could fall drastically short. This would force India to rush its 23 million tons of buffer grain, now in storage, throughout the countryside.\nSuch relief efforts helped to check starvation in the drought of 1979-80, which was described as the worst in this century nationwide. The army was called out to help distribute drinking water by train and military trucks, something many experts think could happen on an even larger scale this year.\nOn top of all these problems, the areas in eastern India that are not suffering from lack of rain are experiencing heavy rains and flooding. News reports say that more than 140 people have died in the northeastern states of Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. In neighboring Bangladesh, the death toll has been reported at 350. Emergency Committee Created\nFaced with a crisis that could dwarf all his other political difficulties, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi recently established an emergency committee, of which he is chairman, to oversee drought relief efforts.\nOfficials say a food distribution and rural employment program costing about $1.5 billion is about to be announced. A water distribution plan was announced in Parliament today. These and other steps are certain to worsen the national budget deficit and curtail other development programs.\nAides to Mr. Gandhi say they also fear that bureacratic problems could undercut Government efforts, creating unrest and disenchantment throughout the north. A senior member of the Gandhi Cabinet said he was afraid that on his next visit to his constituency villagers would throw stones at him.\nOfficials say that even if the monsoon were to come now at full force it would not save crops in most areas. The biggest fear is that for some reason the rains may never come at all this year. Although most of India depends on the monsoon of July and August, rainfall lingering into the fall is essential if farmers are to recoup this year with their winter crop of wheat. 'Cannot Image the Horror'\n''If the rain fails even in September, we cannot imagine the horror,' said a former Agriculture Minister, Rao Birendra Singh. He said that from all indications so far, the 23 million metric tons of reserve grain should be enough to prevent starvation - ''provided we do not lose our next wheat crop.''\nThe actual reason for the failure of the monsoon is unclear, although meteorologists say it appears to be part of odd global weather patterns this year, including unusually hot weather in Europe and the United States.\nTwo-thirds of India's annual grain crop is supposed to be grown during the summer monsoon. The problem is especially acute in the 70 percent of the country's farmlands that have no irrigation and depend entirely on rain. In these areas, fields that are normally iridescent-green with rice are bare, brown or stunted.\nBut even the developed farmlands of the north in Punjab and here in Haryana, where irrigation is extensive, are suffering. The Financial Development Commissioner of Haryana said the state had reached ''near-famine conditions.'' Grain Fields Should be High\nA canal running along the main road here was bone dry today. Farmers complained that a 60-foot well was useless because the water it pumped was brackish and salty.\n''This water would destroy any crops,'' said Jivan Singh, whose family members were plowing a nearby field with two oxen in the hope that at some point rain would come and something, perhaps vegetables, could be planted. A few scrubby sprouts of millet grew at his ankles. He said the grain in this field was normally several feet high at this time.\nThe drought has been most devastating in the sandy western regions of Gujarat and Rajasthan states, which have had unusually little rain in three or four years. In these areas, recent visitors say, whole village populations have begun moving in search of water for cattle and people."

The Indian Health and Family Welfare Ministry has proposed the draft amendment to the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements Act, 1954), for magic remedies and drugs promoting fair skin, enhancing sexual performance, treating stammering, infertility in women, premature ageing and greying of hair among others, reports NDTV. The draft amendment has made several additions to the list of diseases, disorders, conditions covered in the Act. The Act already states that medicines, \"magic remedies\" and products to cure any of these 78 diseases, disorders, conditions named should not be advertised. The new additions include ads for drugs for improving sexual performance and skin tone and treating premature aging, AIDS, greying of hair, stammering, sterility in women, among others.  Under the Act, the first conviction is punishable with imprisonment of up to six months or fine or both; and a subsequent conviction can result in imprisonment of up to a year or fine, or both. The amendment proposes to increase the penalties. For the first conviction, the proposed punishment is imprisonment of up to two years and fine up to Rs10 lakh. For subsequent conviction, the imprisonment may extend to five years with a fine of up to Rs50 lakh. The ministry said the amendment is being made in order to keep pace with changing time and technology. It has been decided that suggestions, comments and objections from the public and stakeholders will be sought. They may be forwarded within 45 days from the date of issue of this notice. The draft bill also proposes an expansion of definition of an advertisement. It says: \"Any audio or visual publicity, representation, endorsement or pronouncement made by means of light, sound, smoke, gas, print, electronic media, internet or website and includes any notice, circular, label, wrapper, invoice, banner, poster or such other documents.\"  "

Not only the junior minister, but Senior Secretary Md Shah Kamal of the ministry was also late by an hour to the event titled \"Enhancing Earthquake Resilience: MoU Signing Cemermony\" held at Department of Disaster Management (DDM) in Mohakhali yesterday. The event was scheduled for 11am yesterday and was expected to end at 1:30pm. But it started after 2pm. Shockingly, Swedish Ambassador to Dhaka, Charlotta Schlyter, left the event after waiting for the state minister for about two hours. Among other dignitaries, DFID-Bangladesh Head Jane Edmondson, UNDP Bangladesh Resident Representative Sudipto Mukerjee, and DDM Director General Shahadat Hossain were present at the event. The mayors of Tangail, Sunamganj, and Rangamati municipalities, and Mostafizur Rahman, on behalf of Rangpur city mayor, also attended the program along with a number of high ranking government officials, to face the schedule debacle. When contacted, Selim Hossen, public relations officer of the ministry, said: \"There was an urgent program for the state minister at Savar [in the morning] which is why he was late.\" MoU for earthquake preparedness Considering the vulnerability to earthquakes in Rangpur, Tangail, Sunamganj, and Rangamati, the DDM part of the National Resilience Program (NRP) signed memorandums of understanding (MoU) at Dhaka's DDM office yesterday. The Project Director of the NRP:DDM part and the mayors of Rangpur City Corporation and Tangail, Sunamganj, and Rangamati municipalities signed four separate MoUs on behalf of their respective agencies. Under the MoUs, the municipalities will work closely with project representatives in revisiting existing assessments and conducting vulnerability assessments to identify the major hazards and risks as well as appropriate options for building capacities of the institutions, including all Disaster Management Committees (DMCs), volunteers and the at-risk communities. State Minister Md Enamur Rahman said: \"A gap remains in developing structural responses to earthquakes. Bangladesh can learn a lot from Japan and becoming zero earthquake loss is our goal.\" UNDP Bangladesh Resident Representative Sudipto Mukerjee said: \"The destructive and deadly hazards associated with earthquakes pose a real and serious threat to the lives of people, property damage, economic growth, and development of the country. The earthquake risk for Bangladesh is doubly high when one considers its rapid urbanization.\" National Resilience Program is a unique collaboration among the Bangladesh Government and UNDP, UN Women and United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) that provides strategic support to develop national capacity to keep pace with the changing nature of disasters."

The huge quantity of fertilizer, worth around Tk57 crore, was imported from abroad to meet the demands of farmers from the 19 northern districts of the country when Jamuna Fertilizer Company Ltd (JFCL) came to a halt after a fire incident on November 11, 2018. According to JFCL, since the fire the factory was unable to resume despite repeated attempts, during which over 350,000 tons of urea fertilizer were imported through a government initiative. Among which, 40,810 tons are still reserved at the factory. But the factory owns only two warehouses with a storage capacity of 12,000 tons, therefore almost 28,810 tons are stored in front of the administrative building. However, while visiting the area it was found that the rest of the fertilizers are barely covered with sheets of tarpaulins, and lying under the open sky beside the factory. In the process, the fertilizer, which is otherwise in granular form, absorbs moisture, and turns rocky or melts into liquid in the seasonal heatwave, rain and cold, said local farmers. Workers of the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) said the damage being done to the urea fertilizers which are not being maintained properly, due to lack of warehouse spaces, is going to cause not only the farmers but the government a huge financial loss. Sarker Abul Hossain, Osman Gani along with other BCIC dealers, said, the stored fertilizer loses its effectiveness, becomes coagulated, and then becomes hard to sell, and use.  Aligning with the dealers, Jamalpur Truck and Tank Lorry Owner's Association's Tarakandi union's President Ashraful Alam Manik said: \"The imported fertilizers have declined so much in quality that the sacks leak while loading in them in the truck. Dealers often refuse to store them in their warehouses.\" Farmers from different areas of the district, Hurmuz Ali of Sarishabari, Abdul Karim Mandal of Saatpoa, Belayet Mia, Rafet Mandalo of Charpalisha said, the northern part of Bangladesh has recently suffered a severe flood, and most of the croplands went underwater causing huge loss to the farmers. So, the Jamalpur farmers were planning to make up their losses by harvesting on a large scale. However, the deteriorated fertilizers are shattering their hopes. Frustrated over the maintenance failure of the authority, farmer Belayet Miya said: \"If the farmers do not get enough quality fertilizers for the upcoming Irri-Borro harvest season, the net harvest would be affected.\" \"The authority must import more fertilizers or resume the JFCL, otherwise farmers of the 19 districts would face huge loss due to shortage of fertilizers,\" he added. Regarding the inefficient maintenance of the fertilizers, JFCL's Manager (Commercial) Wahedur Rahman said: \"The fertilizers were stored in front of the factory for the lack of storage capacity in our warehouses. Though it is possible that some of the sacks can get damaged but it would not affect their overall quality by any means. \"Enough fertilizers are stored for the upcoming harvesting season. We would ensure proper supply to field level farmers. And hopefully, they would not face any shortage,\" he added."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-08 00:00:00      \nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit India in the first week of October There appears to be a sudden increase in the engagements between Bangladesh and India in many areas of mutual interest. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit India in the first week of October, while the Indian External Affairs Minister is most likely to pay his maiden visit to Bangladesh on August 20-21. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan is now in India to hold meetings with his counterpart Amit Shah. Railways Minister Md Nurul Islam Sujan will conclude his visit to India today (Thursday). After more than eight years, the Water Resources Secretary-level talks will be held today (Thursday) in Dhaka.  These engagements are taking place in a short period of time and there is no scope for anything different, diplomats concerned told Dhaka Tribune. In such broad relations between Dhaka and New Delhi, engagements in different sectors are quite natural, they said.  Prime Minister Hasina will attend the India Economic Summit of the World Economic Forum, 'Innovating for India: Strengthening South Asia, Impacting the World,' to be held in New Delhi on October 3-4, according to multiple government sources. Although she is going to attend a multilateral event, there will be bilateral meetings on the sidelines with Indian leadership . Also Read- PM Hasina to visit India in October At those meetings, Hasina will discuss bilateral issues concerning the Bangladesh-India relationship, including the water sharing of common rivers. Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar is scheduled to arrive in the capital on August 20 on a two-day trip, his first visit since he was appointed following the formation of the new Indian government led by Narendra Modi.  As this visit will be his first, it is unlikely to have any substantial outcome. Both sides will just touch upon pending issues and talk about ways to find solutions, and will explore new areas of cooperation. The timeframe for the prime minister's visit will be finalised during his visit. Home minister Khan was due to hold bilateral meetings with his Indian counterpart Amit Shah, also president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, at 7:30pm (Bangladesh time) on Wednesday, said a Bangladesh High Commission official in Delhi. The meeting was scheduled to take place in New Delhi at 4:30pm (Bangladesh time), but was delayed due to the death of former Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, he said, adding that the meeting was due to end at around 9:30pm followed by dinner. According to the agenda, the meeting would discuss issues related to putting a halt to the killing of innocent Bangladeshis along the border by the Indian Border Security Force, the smuggling of drugs, human trafficking, and militancy and terrorism, as these are common problems for both neighbours, said a senior official. About the national register of citizens (NRC) in Assam, he said the agenda doesn't list the issue, but if the issue is raised, Bangladesh will put forward its arguments emphasising that it's an internal affair of India. \"We are prepared (regarding NRC),\" he added. A Bangladeshi delegation, led by Railways Minister Sujan, discussed the ongoing railway projects under an Indian line of credit, including the expedited supply of 10 broad gauge and 10 metre gauge locomotives under Indian grants, and other issues. The delegation visiting India from August 3 to August 8, has also gathered experience on Indian railway's catering, ticketing, and operation of trains.  The first Water Resources Secretary-level meeting in more than eight and a half years will take place on Thursday at state guest house Meghna. Both sides will discuss various issues concerning 54 common rivers spanning the two countries, according to a top Water Resources Ministry official. \"Since the issue of the Teesta water sharing agreement is now at the prime minister level, we will not discuss it in detail. But obviously, we will touch upon it,\" he said, adding: \"We will place emphasis on other common rivers which are important too.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-10 00:00:00      \nDespite the coronavirus precautions, voters were enthusiastic Early voting in South Korea's parliamentary election began on Friday with coronavirus patients casting ballots at disinfected polling stations and candidates bumping fists instead of pressing the flesh as they appeal for support. The election could decide the control of parliament and shape President Moon Jae-in's ability to implement his agenda in the final two years of his administration, including looser fiscal policy aimed at creating jobs, raising the minimum wage, and continued re-engagement with North Korea. The National Election Commission set up eight polling stations for more than 3,000 coronavirus patients receiving treatment as well as 900 medical staff at treatment centres in hard-hit areas, including the capital, Seoul, and Daegu city. The election is on April 15 but officials are hoping that people will take advantage of early voting to reduce the numbers crowding polling locations that day. Polling stations were disinfected on Thursday and all voters were required to wear a mask, use sanitizers and wear plastic gloves. Officials checked temperatures and anyone higher than 37.5 Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit) was directed to special booths. Despite the coronavirus precautions, voters were enthusiastic. \"It was a little uncomfortable since I had to put on plastic,\" said Kim Ju-yeon, 22, who voted at a polling station at Seoul Station, referring to the gloves she had to wear. \"But because voting is a must, the experience was reassuring.\" There are 3,500 stations for voters to cast their ballots during two days of early voting starting on Friday. Moon cast his ballot at a polling station near the presidential office, known as the Blue House. \"There might be a long line of voters on the election day. I hope the early voting distributes that number,\" Moon said after voting. The government is also considering how some 46,500 people who have not tested positive but are in self-quarantine - most of them returnees from abroad - can cast their ballots. \"We are in consultation with related ministries on how to ensure the right to vote for those in self-quarantine on April 15,\" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters on Friday. Kim said the people in self-isolation could not take part in the early voting because of the risk they might be infected. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 new coronavirus cases on Friday, bringing the national tally to 10,450. The national death toll rose by four to 208. Candidates who began campaigning early this month have been wearing masks and exchanging fist bumps with voters in small meetings, shunning handshakes and big rallies. \"We're refraining from large rallies as much as possible and also limiting personal contact,\" said Lee Nak-yon, a former prime minister running for the parliament. The head of the main opposition United Future Party, Hwang Kyo-ahn, was spotted disinfecting residential areas. "

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-13 00:00:00      \nBeing able to separate coronavirus from other common sicknesses such as cold or allergies may save people from unnecessary anxiety The coronavirus (Covid-19) has become an epidemic, infecting more than 100,000 people worldwide. While the chances of any individual person catching the virus are still low, it is natural that people may feel worried every time they get a sore throat or the beginnings of a bad cough. Therefore, being able to separate coronavirus from other common sicknesses such as cold or allergies may save people from unnecessary (or otherwise) anxiety.   If you have itchy eyes or runny nose you probably have allergies or a specific kind of cold \"The issue with seasonal allergies is that they affect the nose and eye,\" says Dr. Greg Poland, a professor of medicine and Infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic and director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. \"They tend to be nasal, and most symptoms are localized to the head, unless you also experience a rash.\" Coronavirus and flu symptoms tend to be more systemic \"The flu and the novel coronavirus, these affect other systems and the lower respiratory tract,\" Poland says.  He adds \"You probably won't have a runny nose, but what you might have is a sore throat, a cough, a fever or shortness of breath. So, it's a subtly different clinical diagnosis.\" He says it's very unlikely that allergies would lead to a fever. They generally don't cause shortness of breath either, unless the person has a preexisting condition like asthma. Allergy symptoms occur frequently, and are usually mild Dr. Greg Poland says that if you have similar symptoms around the same time each year then you probably have seasonal allergies. Over the counter medication and other regular health precautions may help you feel better in that case, reports CNN. Coronavirus and flu symptoms can retire you to bed rest \"If you have an acute case of coronavirus or flu, you will feel so tired, so achy, you'd basically be driven to bed. Everybody would see the difference,\" Poland says. \"Allergies may make you feel tired, but they're not going to cause severe muscle or joint ache.\" Mild flu and cold symptoms usually sort themselves out Proper rest and care will usually heal you from normal illness within a few days.  Coronavirus and severe flu symptoms could get worse over time If you have the flu or coronavirus you may get worse when you expect to get better. \"What would increase the suspicion of coronavirus would be if you were short of breath,\" says Poland. \"People can also develop pneumonia from the flu, which has a similar presentation, so either way you're going to want to seek medical attention.\" Allergies, cold, flu and coronavirus could have similar early symptoms Dr. Greg Poland says that initial stages of cold, allergies, flue and coronavirus can look very similar. That is why it is important to notice if the symptoms persist, especially if you are in an at-risk group, reports CNN. \"We're worried about older people, people with asthma or other lung diseases, people with heart disease or diabetes, and also pregnant women,\" he says. Coronavirus cases are usually situational Poland says if you think you have coronavirus any doctor is bound to ask you some contextual questions such as: \"You're like a detective, trying to accept and put together pieces of data,\" he says. \"If someone who hasn't left the middle of Kansas thinks they have the coronavirus, I would say take a Tylenol, have plenty of fluids and rest.\" Just because it isn't the coronavirus, doesn't mean it isn't serious The influenza virus has killed several times more people than the coronavirus during the same time period. And yet it is often dismissed as something far less dangerous. Analyzing data on the impact of these diseases may provide better understanding of their seriousness.  Conclusion While unnecessary anxiety of having the coronavirus is best avoided, it is a good idea to stay cautious, take preventive measures, be mindful of your medical history, and routinely check for symptoms."

On Monday, almost 40 meters of the embankment, surrounding the city, was damaged by the receding flood water coming from Padma, and Jamuna rivers. Areas under Harisabha, Madhya, and Paschim Sreeramdi are at a huge risk due to the renewed erosion.   Locals said, the receding whirling flood water is at its most dangerous form, and in a sudden strike the erosion devoured a large area, while they were able to transfer six buildings.  They confirmed that already four households were washed away, and there are ten other at risk, including a temple. Abu Raihan, deputy engineer of Chandpur Water Development Board (WDB) said: \"We had no idea that the erosion would hit this area again. The whole embankment is at risk right now. \"We are dumping sand bags to reduce the casualties, and another 3000 bags are ready to be used if necessary,\" he added. Visiting the area, Deputy Commissioner Majedur Rahman Khan, Superintendent of Police Mahabubur Rahman, and WDB Deputy Engineer Abu Raihan promised to take every necessary step possible to save the city. Earlier, two months ago, in another erosion strike of Meghna a 300 meter area of the embankment was washed away."

Land areas are finite, and eventually the doubling and tripling of numbers will manifest itself as it has in the past.\nFortunately, we as a nation do not know the face of famine. Other societies have been less favored. When there was a migration into India from Bangladesh, the desperate villagers fell upon the intruders and hacked them to death. The media reported the incident as an act of savagery, but the underlying conditions, depletion of food resources and ultimate disaster, demonstrated in all its ugliness that what little remains can be divided, subdivided, just so far before the bowl is emptied of its last grain.\nParents who have not seen their young wither cannot comprehend famine. A baby who is amply fed emits a strident, lusty cry. A dying offspring slumbers, its cries feeble, till it succumbs to its pitiful fate.\nLest we lull ourselves to the realities, we must educate so that ignorance, stubbornness and pride do not become the apocalyptic horsemen who replicate on our continent the horrors of other worlds.\nThe signs are already present.

They also made themselves felt on the other side of the world, scientists say, causing the unusually heavy monsoon rains that in 1988 brought record floods, death and misery to Bangladesh.\nThese broad, intricately interconnected relationships between the ocean and the atmosphere have been only dimly understood in the past. But now climatologists are making major strides in understanding the ways in which such relationships in one part of the world drastically affect weather conditions, lives and fortunes in another.\nWhile most climate experts believe that the greenhouse effect, a global warming caused by pollutants in the atmosphere, will have a major impact in the decades ahead, even those who argue most strongly for that point of view agree that last year's drought was overwhelmingly a product of natural forces. Even if a warming trend is already under way, as some experts believe, on a year-to-year basis events such as last year's changes in the Pacific exert a far stronger influence on the weather, scientists say.\nThe tropical Pacific is emerging in some scientists' minds as perhaps the planet's most important source of short-term climatic changes.\nThis is the territory of El Nino, the massive strip of abnormally warm water that from time to time stretches westward along the Equator from South America and that sometimes plays havoc with the weather in various parts of the world. But El Nino is only part of the story.\nClimatologists now recognize that it is not just a random phenomenon. It appears periodically, alternating with what has only recently been identified as its opposite twin: an abnormally cold stretch of equatorial water.\nScientists disagree on what to call the cold cycle. It was first dubbed La Nina, Spanish for ''the girl,'' to distinguish it from El Nino, which means ''the boy,'' or Christ Child, so named because the warm cycle appears near Christmas. Some scientists objected to La Nina as sexist, however, and substituted El Viejo, ''the old man,'' as in Old Man Winter. Still others prefer to avoid all this by simply calling the cycles warm events and cold events.\nIt was this cold cycle in the eastern Pacific, some scientists now say, that played a major role in creating the great North American drought of 1988 and the devastating floods that indundated Bangladesh.\nEl Nino and its opposite are the two poles of a continuous back-and-forth action in which the surface waters around the Equator in the eastern Pacific go from one temperature extreme to another every 3 to 6 years. Scientists have named the grand atmospheric changes that accompany these swings, and that are tightly interwoven with them, the ''southern oscillation,'' and it is an object of intense study. More Disruption Predicted\nThe cold phase that affected last year's climate still persists. And if it continues to dominate that part of the Pacific into this spring (in the Northern Hemisphere), as some forecasters predict, scientists say it could disrupt the worldwide weather picture again. But at this point no one can say exactly what its impact would be.\nStill, the fact that scientists now know as much as they do about these mechanisms is a measure of how far they have come in the last decade in understanding short-term, global climatic change. Improved data collection and more advanced computer models of climatic processes have enabled climatologists to develop at least a rudimentary picture of these processes. Until recently, such a picture hardly existed.\n''What's exciting about it is that three years ago, none of us recognized the cold side of this southern oscillation,'' said Dr. James O'Brien, a meteorologist and oceanographer at Florida State University who this year will head the National Academy of Science's committee on the ocean's role in global climatic change.\nPrecisely what triggers a warm or cold phase is not yet perfectly understood, but scientists believe they know much about the general processes at work. A cold phase, such as now exists, develops when strong trade winds, blowing from the east, drive warm surface water to the western Pacific. At the same time, there is an increased upwelling of cold water from the ocean depths off South America.\nAcross the Pacific, the warm water driven westward by the trade winds literally piles up in the western Pacific. This warm water intensifies rainstorm activity in that region, producing unusually strong monsoon rains in South and Southeast Asia. This is a major reason why Bangladesh suffered so in 1988. 'Spring Is Transition Time'\nAt such a time, skies are relatively clear on the other side of the Pacific, near South America, and the sun begins re-heating the water there. The cycle starts to reverse. The reverse trend accelerates when trade winds are at their weakest, usually in the spring. ''Spring is transition time,'' says Mark A. Cane of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory. ''You have the sense that nature rolls its dice in April every year and once it does, the pattern is set for the next year.''\nAs the trade winds weaken, warm water from the western Pacific flows back toward the east, and with it, an area of atmospheric instability that generates thunderstorms and rain. This weakens the trade winds further, and the warm water reaches all the way back to South America.\nAt the same time, less cold water wells up from the ocean depths. The result of all this is an El Nino. The most severe El Nino of the 1980's, in 1982-83, brought heavy rains and flooding to the west coast of South America and severe drought to Australia and the Philippines.\nOn average, each warm and cold phase takes about two years to develop and play out, though some are longer or shorter. Each warm and cold phase also has its own profile -some are major and some are minor. The latest El Nino in 1986-87, for example, was mild, producing sea-surface temperatures of 4 degrees Fahrenheit above average; by contrast, the disastrous 1982-83 event was about 7 degress above average.\nThe present phase represents ''an unusually cold side of the coin,'' says Dr. Kevin Trenberth, who heads the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. Sea-surface temperatures along the Equator dropped 10 degrees from their 1986-87 El Nino high, to about 6 degrees below average. A more usual ''cold event'' brings temperatures of about 3 degrees below average. History of a Drought\nEnter the 1988 United States drought. According to a study by Dr. Trenberth and colleagues that appeared in a recent issue of the journal Science, it happened this way:\nThe cold water along the Equator caused a zone of unstable air just to the north, called the intertropical convergence zone, to move farther north. The convergence zone, where trade winds from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres collide, is a major area in which thunderstorms and rain develop. It tends to occupy the warmest water in the region.\nThis year, for unexplained reasons, a large, abnormally warm patch of water developed southeast of Hawaii, in effect pulling the convergence zone northward even as the cold water along the Equator pushed it. Eventually, the convergence zone overlapped somewhat with the warm patch to the north. The result was thunderstorm activity in an area where it normally does not occur.\nThis area impinged on the southern edge of the eastward-flowing river of air that includes the North American jet stream, which carries the low-pressure areas that bring spring and summer rain to America.\nIn this case, the intense thunderstorm activity disturbed the westerlies, like a rock in the middle of a stream, setting up ripples and swirls in the atmosphere. These developed into high- and low-pressure systems that moved the jet stream far to the north. This made way for a large, rainless high-pressure system, which moved into the gap from the south. It dominated the Midwest for weeks, bringing on the drought.\nOnce the drought began, Dr. Trenberth said, it fed on itself as evaporation at the Earth's surface decreased and surface temperatures thereby increased, ''so that even if a cloud wanted to form, it doesn't have enough moisture to produce rain.'' 'We Don't Understand'\nFor now, other climatologists are treating the Trenberth theory on the drought as they do any new scientific report: as something that must be subjected to further testing. ''It's a sound, useful idea, but it would be stretching it to take it as conclusive at this point,'' said Dr. Cane of Lamont-Doherty. There are probably a number of contributing factors to the drought that have not been identified, he said, adding: ''I don't think we have an understanding of how these droughts come about and why they persist. Which is not to say that we don't understand anything.'' Models of Forecasting\nDr. Cane and colleagues have developed the most ambitious of a number of models that predict the fluctuations of warm and cold cycles in the tropical Pacific. Based on the latest data, for November, Dr. Cane said that the present cold phase should ''bottom out'' about now and that it should start to ease in the summer.\nA forecast by Dr. O'Brien's group at Florida State, also based on November data, says that the cold phase will last another three or four months. ''That's about as far in the future as we tend to look at those things.''\nA third forecast by a group led by Dr. Tim Barnett at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at La Jolla, Calif., calls for the cold phase to persist into spring. ''We're looking for next summer and fall to be more or less normal,'' he said. After that, if scientists are right about the new pattern, another swing toward El Nino, the warm phase, should begin.\nDr. Trenberth said that while global warming from the greenhouse effect may have made the 1988 drought worse, it ''almost certainly'' was not the fundamental cause. Over a long span of time, he said, global warming might make droughts more likely in some parts of the world, and worse wherever they occur. But year-to-year variations in climate are affected more powerfully by ''natural'' climatic forces he said, pointing out that the short-term temperature swings in the southern oscillation are far larger than the short-term differences produced by global warming.\nDr. James E. Hansen of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, whose testimony on the greenhouse effect at the height of the 1988 drought focused attention on the problem, said in an interview that he agreed with this analysis. Dr. Hansen, on the basis of a mathematical model, holds that as the greenhouse effect gets stronger, the frequency of drought will increase significantly. But this change will not start to be noticed until the 1990's, he said.\nSome scientists believe that the warm and cold swings in the eastern Pacific, because they cover such vast stretches, have more effect on global atmospheric temperatures than the greenhouse effect. One, Dr. O'Brien, is predicting that the present cold phase will bring about a sharp drop in average global temperatures, reducing them to 1950's levels and slowing down planetary warming by 30 to 35 years. Others, while conceding the effect, say that estimate is too high.\nWhat long-term effect the greenhouse effect may have, in turn, on El Nino and its sibling is a matter for speculation at this point, one of a many unanswered questions that still challenge climatologists. Global Weather Connections New findings link last year's drought in the United States and floods in Asia to periodic shifts in winds and ocean temperatures in the tropical Pacific. THE SOURCE: According to the theory, the drought originated with unusually cold water along the Equator (1), which pushed the intertropical convergence zone (2), where trade winds collide, farther north than usual. Abnormally warm water southeast of Hawaii also pulled the zone northward. The zone overlapped the warm patch (3), resulting in unusual thunderstorm activity (4). The storms disturbed the atmosphere, (5) setting up ripples and swirls that became high- and low-pressure systems. These pushed the jet stream far north (6), making way for a large, rainless high-pressure system (7), which brought weeks of drought."

Floating storage and offloading tanker J. Nat, which was used by offshore oil and gas companies, left Indonesian water on April 18 even though local activists warned Indonesian authorities about the toxicity of the vessel, says the NGO Shipbreaking Platform. \"Official documents indicate that the tanker has more than 1500 tons of hazardous waste from the oil extraction process onboard, including 1000 tons of slop oil, 500 tons of oily water and 60 tons of sludge oil contaminated with high concentration of mercury,\" reads a statement by the Platform released on Apr 29.  The vessel likely also contains high amounts of mercury in its structures as well as in ballast waters, it added. As most of the shipbreaking yards use the blow torch method to cut vessels, the high concentration of mercury in the steel hull of J. Nat risks the inhalation of mercury vapour, says the Platform. Exposure to it, even at low levels, has been linked to central nervous system damage, kidney and liver impairment, reproductive and developmental disorders, defects in foetuses and learning deficits, according to the statement.  \"Mercury is a naturally occurring element present in virtually all oil and gas fields. Concentrations are especially high in the South American and East Asian regions,\" it quoted Ingvild Jenssen, executive director and founder of NGO Shipbreaking Platform. Citing a recent court judgement on the illegal import of another oil and gas unit -- North Sea Producer, the rights body said the Bangladesh Supreme Court denounced the fraudulent documents claiming the vessel was toxic-free, when it was contaminated by radioactive substances. The court had then called for full transparency on toxic material in end-of-life vessels brought in to the country.   \"In light of the recent judgment on the North Sea Producer, there is no scope to give any authorization for import, beaching, and breaking of the J. NAT. It is public knowledge that Bangladesh will not be able to deal with the hazardous waste flow downstream. The vessel will simply flood our shores with toxic substances and expose our workers to deadly risks,\" the statement quoted Syeda Rizwana Hasan, director of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association. With many units to be decommissioned in the next few years, it is high time that the oil and gas industry collectively seeks sustainable solutions for the recycling of its floating units, said the Platform's founder Jenssen.  \"All actors involved in the oil and gas supply chain, directly or indirectly, have the responsibility to not cause harm to workers and the environment in developing countries.\""

Last year (2019 calendar year) fishermen netted 5,240 tons of Ilish, a 61.72% rise from 3,240 tons in 2015, according to the local office of the Department of Fisheries (DoF). The amount was 3,448 tons in 2016, 3972 tons in 2017 and 5,080 tons in 2018, it said. Shariatpur Fisheries Officer Abdur Rouf said that they worked hard for protecting the brood and mother Ilish during the reproductive season following the instruction of the prime minister and the ministry concerned. The district administration helped them a lot, he said. This increase is the outcome of the government plan, he said and added that the procurement of Ilish there was increasing every year.  Local fishery officials said the drive against netting mother Ilish was the main reason behind the success. Last year 1,366 people were panelized in 293 such drives, they informed. According to the DoF, fishermen catch Ilish in  a 69-kilometre area (covering 15,840 hectares of land) of the Padma and the Meghna rivers in Shariatpur.  About 16,355 people are directly involved with Ilish catching, said the DoF. Sirajul Islam, 45, catches Ilish fish in the Padma river. He said that the increased catch of Ilish brought smiles to the fishermen there. \"I experienced huge catches of Ilish in the region when I was young. But the availability of the fish was declining gradually with the passage of time,\" Shirazul said. \"However, the decline in production saw a u-turn and started to rise in the last couple of years,\" he said and added that it became possible due to the strict policy of the government. The fisherman said that they were getting good prices in the market for their catches.  Manik Hossain, an Ilish trader, said the increased production of Ilish raised the income of traders and fishermen and helped them overcome existing financial crisis. The Ilish netting season starts from July and continues until October. The authorities oversee and protect netting of brood Ilish between November to June.  March and April are the banned months for catching any kind of fishes in  20 kilometres of Shariatpur region, as it is the reproductive period for the Ilish.  During the banned period, the government helps the fishermen by providing 20-30 kg of rice to each of them."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-30 00:00:00      \nOn March 25, listening to a briefing on the then available latest global statistics about the COVID-19, I learnt that the global total of recorded cases was then a little over 400,000, spread across over 169 countries. Of these, the first 100,000 cases had taken 67 days, the second 100,000 about 11 days, the third 100,000 about 4 days, and the last 100,000 less than 4 days. We were told in no uncertain terms that this was the first great pandemic, of truly global proportions in a hundred years, after the so-called \"Spanish flu\" of 1918-20, (which had afflicted over 500 million people or a quarter of the world's population at that time, and inflicted a death toll of between 17-50 million). The entire world today is in a dire economic situation, a global recession worse than the recession of 2009 is inevitable, only this time it would be somewhat different in nature: there would be a very big hit on the services sector, in which there are typically no rebounds; supply chains are standing fractured or not available any longer; there would be a very likely rise in food prices because of severe disruptions to the logistical or other chains on which assured availability of food depends; social safety measures would prove woefully inadequate; and domestic and external shocks would reinforce each other, perhaps exponentially. Three days later, on March 28, 2020, the number of globally recorded cases was nearly 600,000 with the numbers increasing steadily by the hour. In other words, the number jumped from 400,000 to 600,000 in about 3 days. Of these, currently infected patients number over 436,000, of whom over 23,000 are in serious or critical condition. The United States has now surpassed Italy (and China) with the highest number of cases (over 104,000). Mr Trump can now boast of presiding over the new epicentre of this pandemic. I am willing to bet that by the time this article is published all the numbers will be higher. This situation will get worse, given the now well-established trajectory globally. While experts everywhere, from different nationalities and different disciplines in science, are near unanimous in agreeing that the crisis will become worse, much worse, and all countries (including the United States), are either woefully inadequately prepared or ill equipped, or both. Chinese President Xi Jinping has reportedly reached out to President Trump and offered help in sharing knowledge (gleaned from its own experience) and equipment to tackle the critical situation. However, because of stonewalling and sheer cussedness on the part of some, the G-20 virtual summit ended in a fiasco. Mr Trump kept insisting on publicly labelling this disease as the \"Chinese virus/Wuhan virus\", to which the Chinese objected with injured ego. Mr Trump would do well to delve into some history of his own country, and recall that the so-called \"Spanish flu\" of 1918 is now thought by many as actually having originated in an obscure farming community in Haskell county in Kansas, USA where a farm worker caught the infection from a pig, and then carried it to Spain where it ballooned among an unsuspecting population from where it travelled to the World War-I theatre (in which Spain, ironically, was not a protagonist), and then travelled back to the United States, in two successive waves, from Summer, to Fall and then Winter. The Spanish flu should therefore be correctly renamed today as the American flu of 1918. Perhaps this will satisfy the respective egocentricism of the respective world leadership today, who should instead buckle down to addressing the crisis and putting in place institutional arrangement to deal with the current pandemic, and its resultant fallouts on food and employment security and ensure that more such pandemics do not recur. We should assume that more such unexpected pandemics will very likely occur, because there are countless strains of coronavirus among other animals, birds and reptilian species than we know of, and with spaces of separation between species and homo sapiens ever shrinking (or basic principles of ecological equilibrium having been ignored and shattered), the intervals between such pandemics could well also dwindle, alarmingly. Pandemics jump over time and space, across peoples, countries and cultures, ballooning exponentially. Despite all indications to the contrary, people worldwide took the onset of the current pandemic complacently, almost smugly, holidaying on beaches when governments advised them to go into social distancing and self-isolation. When Saudi Arabia and some Gulf states advised their nationals that they should abjure from going to mosques and instead remember God and offer their prayers in the isolation of their respective homes, we have had examples of people in some of the most densely populated Muslim countries (including in Bangladesh and Indonesia) congregating in very large numbers for congregational prayers or \"waz mahfil\" sessions (in which there could have already been some infected people, but quite unaware of their being so). In Malaysia, one such event resulted in notable community transmission of the disease.   In Bangladesh, the officially announced total number of cases today is 48, with 5 fatalities. The official statistics does not necessarily reflect the accurate statistics, because of the very tiny number of the population having been tested, even among the several thousand returnees from China, Europe or elsewhere who were allowed to go home on condition of \"self-isolation\" which was merrily (and most irresponsibly) largely not observed. The Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) announced its detection two days ago of the first community transmission of the disease. I await with considerable trepidation to what the figures will exponentially translate into in, 7 days, 14 days or 21 days from today.   In my last missive on the subject published in this newspaper a week ago (\"Implications of coronavirus for regional and global cooperation\", The Daily Star, March 22, 2020) I had advocated that we needed to shift our focus away from viewing our security within the traditional paradigm only, but consider our overall security as contextually nested in what I describe as ecological security that includes a host of non-traditional causes all of which would at some stage, sooner or later, translate into a traditional security threat as understood conventionally. Ecological and non-traditional security may be defined as maintaining a dynamic equilibrium not only among human societies (friction among whom used to be the traditional source of conflict) but equally, if not far more importantly, between humans and nature, humans and other species and humans and pathogens. Any disruption to this dynamic equilibrium between any two or more component sets of actors or factors integral to this equilibrium would translate into a disturbing, risk-fraught disequilibrium endangering all. Man, as the dominant species with a steadily burgeoning population, has a greater ability today than ever earlier to affect how this equilibrium is maintained. Changes in the complex intertwined relationship between man, nature and other species can be destabilised by changes in nature or in human behaviour. As resources needed by man for his sustenance and development steadily dwindle, fierce competition has already increased among peoples for control over decreasing resources that sustain human societies. In this struggle for control, non-state actors have increasingly emerged as posing by far the greater threat to societal security than conventional military threats by other state actors. Maintaining ecological equilibrium in any given geo-space has, therefore, emerged as increasingly integral to not only ensuring the overall wellbeing of the peoples who inhabit that space, but to ensuring their continuing security, traditional and non-traditional. But this requires exponentially increased cooperation and collaboration between states. Most of the NTS threats need a well-thought out systemic and institutionalised response, in a pan-Westphalian context. I have earlier advocated for establishment of a regional Authority called South Asian Regional Ecological and Environmental Authority (SAREESA), which would have several sectoral bodies under it to address different NTS threats, one of which would be addressing pandemics. Now that we are wading ever deeper into, and increasingly floundering in, a pandemic and we are assured by experts that more such pandemics are very likely to afflict us unless we think in anticipatory mode, and not just to address pandemics--who is to say that some natural cataclysm like another great tsunami, or a mega volcanic eruption or a mega earthquake is not likely to occur anytime soon? I for one, would wish governments and peoples to be prepared for such unpredictable scenarios, however unlikely they might appear to be at cursory glance now. Such an organisation would be an authoritative umbrella body (rather than a toothless association or \"club\") with the mandate and authority to enforce adherence to its collective decisions. It should be headed by a ministerial-level Governing Council, that should meet periodically, at least once a year, by rotation in each member-country's capital. Decisions should be arrived at by a simple-majority consensus. Decisions once taken, are mandatorily binding on every member state. Its decisions are like laws passed by the national parliaments, but where the decisions are in conflict with national laws, they over-ride the latter. The body will derive its funding through mandatory contributions from each of its member states, the amount proportional to its population but weighted by its GDP. Where necessary, it may dictate levying of taxes on income according to income slabs to meet sudden emergencies. For wildcard events, (like the current COVID-19 pandemic) it will maintain an emergency fund of a predetermined amount raised through taxes as well as central funding. Money for this fund is to be raised through levying taxes on specific/related activities, like travel, entertainment, retail sales, etc. While the amount of the levy would be relatively very small, since it is collected on a daily basis from a wide swath of the population across the entire region, cumulatively it would translate into a considerable amount which would be sufficient to cope with an extraordinary emergency in its immediate aftermath. This umbrella body will have at least six sectoral cells to deal with food security, water security, energy security, employment security, health security, and environmental security, respectively. For the moment, let me present only three of these sectoral cells: wildcard events, health security and food security--these are the specific areas where I foresee immediate problems likely to confront us all in the wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic. At the first signs of an event occurring (like current pandemic, or a major tsunami, flood, drought, earthquake or volcanic eruption), it would trigger off a regional warning system that keeps vulnerable populations informed and evacuates endangered populations where deemed necessary. It also activates across the region emergency related services to go into standby mode to cope with health and food security. Ensuring health security With global and regional movements of people and all sorts of goods, including flora and fauna, and particularly microbial or viral passengers having become easier with the communication revolution and induction of super jumbo aircraft, ensuring regional health has become a greater challenge than ever. The contemplated authority's mandate would include regional health management issues linked particularly to communicable diseases (cholera or other diarrheal diseases, typhoid, etc.) that may escalate into epidemics or pandemics. For the purpose, it maintains a central information system of networking that links all national/or designated hospitals to a regional information centre. It monitors the instances of communicable diseases that are known to spread easily, and tracks movements of such diseases if they occur. The centre also maintains a regional health registry, where it stores and updates on a continuing basis, data from its network of hospitals across the region, information on supplies of protective gear for medical personnel and patients, testing kit and life support equipment. Certain industries may be designated and tasked with being geared to produce such kits/equipment/gear on an emergency basis to cater to national and regional emergencies, as well as to replenish stock. It will also monitor animal diseases linked to poultry and livestock on a similar basis and will exercise the authority to impose very strict quarantine regulations in order to forestall spread of man or animal borne diseases across borders. Ensuring food security The authority will require each member state to maintain a minimum reserve of food grains stock (rice, wheat or maize, etc.) sufficient to meet consumption requirements of its nationals for four months, at any given time. This is to meet national emergencies within its own domestic jurisdiction. The cost of this buffer stock is met from the domestic national budget of each member state. Additionally, a pre-determined quantum of food grains, pulses, powdered milk, bottled water, salt and sugar is also stored along centrally designated locations, (close to airports/railway stations/ports) and along the borders with adjacent countries for fast movement to disaster areas in times of extraordinary trans-boundary emergencies. Both categories of the above reserve stocks will have specifically designated shelf lives. These items will be put on the market at least two months before expiry of such shelf life but also be replenished simultaneously with new stock with new shelf lives. The cost of these emergency buffer stocks will be raised through a system of food security tax/levy raised monthly at a rate not less than a minimum percentage of an individual's regular income (say a monetary unit per person irrespective of par value of that unit vis-a-vis the strongest unit in the region). This principle of compulsory contribution will instil a sense of value and participatory ownership that raises the importance of this scheme in the public perception. In case of a disaster outside the region (another region located near or far away, in the same or another continent), individual countries will be required to contribute in aid to the afflicted outsider region from its own domestic reserve, provided it has the capability or a viable plan for replenishment of its own stock in a timely manner. Similar contribution may be made from the regional reserves mentioned above also, provided replenishment is lined up within a reasonable timeframe. The regional authority should be able to requisition multi-modal transportation vehicles (marine, air, riverine or road) from any or all of its member-states' civil and military resources. For this purpose, it can maintain a database of all such available transportation, listing what is available and where at any given time. And for this, the national civil and military bureaucracies will be required to update a centralised database on a regular, continuous and real-time basis. While most ideally, we need to have a regional body for such an unprecedented emergency, (and I had hoped in my last article that this crisis would have impelled us to move towards such a dynamics), if that does not happen, Bangladesh should take the lead in instituting measures envisaged above on a national basis and set an example of good governance that might nudge others to emulate. As Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore famously exhorted: \"if no one heeds your call, walk alone\". Sooner or later, others will be compelled to join, inspired by the example you set.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-26 00:00:00      \nConstruction industries are responsible for 30 percent of the total global resources, 40 percent of the global energy consumption as well as 30 percent of the total greenhouse gas emission. For example, cement is one of the key construction materials used as binder for making concrete. The amount of cement consumption is estimated at four billion tonnes globally. To produce such a high amount of cement, roughly four billion tonnes of carbon dioxide are released into our atmosphere (equivalent to global CO2 emission of 1.4 kg/capita/day). As the global carbon dioxide emission is about 41 billion tonnes, the cement industries are responsible for almost 10 percent of global carbon dioxide emission due to burning limestone to clinker, the major ingredient of cement. The other key materials that are used in construction works are coarse aggregate, fine aggregate as well as reinforcing steel. The global consumption rates of coarse aggregate (stone chips), fine aggregate (sand), and steel are estimated at 3.4 kg/capita/day, 2.2 kg/capita/day, and 0.6 kg/capita/day, respectively. It is clearly understood that for the production of these construction materials, not only a significant amount of energy is consumed, but also a significant volume of natural resources is used, which are depleting rapidly. Construction industries are, therefore, producing a substantial amount of greenhouse gases as well as consuming a huge amount of natural resources. Construction industries are polluting our environment to produce construction materials and depleting the natural resources. A general question comes to mind though: \"Will our future generations have enough natural resources in order to make ingredients for the construction of homes, offices, and other infrastructures?\" This is a big challenge for engineers today to preserve construction materials for future generations. Therefore, it is necessary to produce graduates from our engineering universities who have the knowledge including a sense of responsibility towards the society, environment, and sustainability.      Bangladesh will become a developed country by 2041. Socio-economic development is taking place everywhere in Bangladesh in line with this vision. As a result, the consumption of materials used in construction works is also increasing rapidly. In Bangladesh, the current rates of consumption of cement, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and steel are estimated at 0.5, 1.3, 0.9, and 0.16 kg/capita/day. The current rates are far behind the global rates of consumption. However, the rates will gradually increase to meet the global rates due to socio-economic development needs. To make our world sustainable, the United Nations has set 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 targets for a period of 15 years from 2015 to 2030. The SDGs were set after completion of the period (2000-2015) of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The MDGs were set with the aim of eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, prevention of deadly diseases, expanding primary education, etc. MDGs made significant contributions to the society. It is also expected that SDGs will contribute towards making our world habitable for us and our future generations. Among the 17 SDGs, three are related to nature (SDG 13 - Climate Change, SDG 14 - Oceans and Seas, and SDG 15 - Ecosystem and Biodiversity); four are related to economy (SDG 7 - Energy for All, SDG 8 - Inclusive Growth and Jobs, SDG 9 - Industry and Innovation, SDG 12 - Consumption and Production); five are related to wellbeing (SDG 1 - End Poverty, SDG 2 - End Hunger, SDG 3 - Healthy Lives, SDG 4 - Quality Education, SDG 6 - Water and Sanitation); and five are related to society (SDG 5 - Gender Equality, SDG 10 - Reduce Inequality, SDG 16 - Justice and Peace, SDG 17 - Global Partnership, and SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities). Thus compared to the MDGs, the SDGs have a very wide spectrum consisting of 169 targets related to nature, society, economy, and wellbeing.  Many of the SDGs are closely associated with the construction industries. For example, by constructing a green building, we can contribute to improving people's health and wellbeing (SDG 3 - Good Health and Wellbeing); produce renewable energy at low cost (SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy); create new jobs and boost economy (SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth); introduce innovation through constructing climate-resilient infrastructures (SDG 9 - Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure); develop sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities); produce less waste and circulation (SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production); emit less greenhouse gases to combat climate change (SDG 13 - Climate Action); allow biodiversity, including forests, to flourish (SDG 15 - Life on Land); and build strong global partnerships (SDG 17 - Partnerships for the Goals). It is evident that our architects and engineers need to be familiar with the design of green buildings to contribute to the SDGs in many ways. The construction industries need to take initiatives to implement the SDGs in their business platforms. There are five distinct steps: (1) understanding the SDGs, (2) defining priorities, (3) setting goals, (4) integrating, and (5) reporting and communicating. The goals should be set with time-bound targets. The goals should be monitored, evaluated, reported and communicated among the stakeholders. The industries are to be prepared accordingly, just as universities are prepared for accreditation of their programmes.    Engineers need to consider SDGs during the design, construction, operation, and maintenance processes of buildings. A building needs to be designed keeping in mind energy consumption, material consumption, possibility of utilisation of locally available materials, as well as long-term durability of the building. During construction, a plan for minimising waste should be provided, along with a definite management plan to minimise pollution and ensure health and safety of the workers and all visitors. Materials can be processed in a controlled environment to reduce pollution, improve quality of material, and reduce time and waste. The possibilities of recycling and reusing materials need to be studied carefully. During construction, the methodology of construction, sequence of construction, compaction technique of concrete, curing duration and procedure, removal of shuttering, quality ensuring policies, etc., are to be provided. A maintenance guideline and also re-cycling and re-use of materials after demolition of a structure at the end of service life are necessary. To ensure resilient infrastructures, the local exposure and climate conditions should be carefully considered, such as salinity, flood, cyclone, earthquake, presence of sulfate in soil, etc.   For the sustainability of construction materials in Bangladesh, a significant number of studies have been conducted since 2004 through undergraduate and post-graduate research work under a research project entitled, \"Sustainability of Construction Materials in Bangladesh.\" A significant volume of research studies have been conducted on recycling of demolished concrete made with brick aggregate. The research outputs have been recognised with awards as well as publications in renowned journals, such as ASCE's Journal of Materials in Civil Engineering, Journal of Construction and Building Materials, Journal of Engineering and Structures, etc. The research results demonstrated that demolished concrete can be recycled without compromising the strength requirement of new construction projects. By careful mix design, it is possible to utilise demolished concrete as coarse aggregate to make concrete of strength 4000-6000 psi. Also, studies have been conducted on the utilisation of alternative materials in construction work, such as induction furnace slag as coarse aggregate for concrete, stone dust as fine aggregate for concrete, brick surkhi as fine aggregate for concrete, ladle furnace slag as fine aggregate for concrete, etc. Based on the experimental results, it is understood that these by-product materials can replace natural aggregates (such as stone chips and sand) used for producing concrete. We also conducted several short-term and long-term research projects on utilisation of alternative cementitious materials such as slag, fly ash, silica fume, etc. It was also found that these by-product materials are not harmful for concrete, but have a lot of benefits, such as reduction of carbon dioxide emission, long-term durability, less heat of hydration, long-term strength, etc. There are ongoing studies related to the long-term durability of these materials under natural and artificially created seawater exposure conditions. Design engineers are to be aware of the new findings through continuous learning. Due to the rapid increase in population in Bangladesh, it is necessary to plan for construction of high-rise buildings for offices and residences and avoid stand-alone houses. It will eventually save our valuable fertile land for cultivation.    Construction industries should be aware of the consequences of the consumption of vast amounts of material as well as energy required to produce and maintain the built environment. They also need to come forward and take initiatives so as to achieve the SDGs. The overall industrial atmosphere, quality of product, linkages to the local and international partners, etc., will be improved through these initiatives. Greater cooperation between governments, private sector, universities, and many facets of civil society is necessary to accomplish the SDGs by 2030 and to sustain the human habitat for current and future generations.

Padma River erosion took an alarming turn in the last few days, rendering over 200 families homeless in the Rajeswhawar union of the Chandpur Sadar upazila. The affected people of Rajarchar, Mander Bazar, Khaskandi, Lagnimararchar, and Dewan Bazar areas of the union said onrush of flood waters from upstream and heavy rain in the last few days  swelled Padma-Meghna, flooding the areas on its banks. This made over 200 families of low-lying areas homeless, locals and Water Development Board officials said. A large number of flood victims took shelter on nearby highlands including  Bashgari, Majherchar, Goal Nagar and Rayerchar. Hajrat Ali Bepari , chairman of the Rajeswhawar union said about a thousand other families, living close to the river, are passing their days in anxiety and fear of being devoured by the Padma in the near future. He also said the  erosion along vast areas on the river bank earlier washed away scores of homesteads, schools in the area. The situation had been deteriorated due to constant erosion, he added.  Erosion-hit Kamal, 40, and Akkel Ali, 35, of the union said they had been passing sleepless nights in fear of erosion. \"Where will we go? We are all poor people,\" said Akkel Ali. Gourango, Abul Kalam and Laila of Mander Bazar alleged that unplanned dredging had sped up the erosion.  Executive Engineer of Chandpur Water Development Board Abu Raihan said, \"During the monsoon season the water stream in the river is very high. There are strong vortex current flows. This place is very risky within the union.\" He said they have nothing to do as the union is situated in the char area.  "

Syrian aid workers called urgently for a ceasefire and international help for nearly a million people fleeing the regime onslaught in the country's northwestern Idlib province -- the biggest wave of displaced civilians in the nine-year conflict. Turkey, supporter of some rebel groups in Idlib, has been pushing for a renewed ceasefire in talks with Russia, which backs the Syrian regime. Ankara is eager to prevent another flood of refugees into its territory adding to the 3.7 million Syrians it already hosts. The Syrian NGO Alliance said displaced people are \"escaping in search of safety only to die from extreme weather conditions and lack of available resources\". Erdogan said talks with Moscow over the past fortnight had so far failed to achieve \"the desired result\" and warned that Turkey would launch an offensive into Syria unless Damascus pulled its forces back by the end of the month. He called for Syrian forces to retreat behind Turkey's military posts in Idlib, which were set up under a 2018 deal with Russia designed to hold off a regime advance. The Kremlin quickly responded to Erdogan's threat, warning that any operation against Syrian forces would be \"the worst scenario\". With the Russian-backed offensive, Syrian troops have reconquered swathes of Idlib and retaken the key M5 highway connecting the country's four largest cities as well as the entire surroundings of Aleppo city for the first time since 2012."

Dhaka says transporting refugees to Bhashan Char - a Bay of Bengal island hours by boat from the mainland - will ease chronic overcrowding in its camps at Cox's Bazar, which are home to more than 1 million Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority who have fled neighbouring Myanmar. A document drawn up by the World Food Programme (WFP), the UN's food aid arm, shows the agency has supplied the Bangladesh government with detailed plans - including a timeline and budget - of how it could provide for thousands of Rohingya transported to the island within weeks. It stresses that any relocation should be voluntary and done \"in accordance with humanitarian principles and code of conduct.\" The document, labelled as a \"Concept of Operations\" and dated March 12, outlines how the organization and its partners \"may facilitate the identification, staging, forward movement, reception, and sustainment of refugees\" on Bhashan Char, estimating an initial appeal for donor funding of between $8.6 and $19 million. More detailed operational planning would be needed it says, noting the Concept of Operations had been \"developed quickly and without the benefit of any recent on-site assessment.\" Gemma Snowdon, communications officer for WFP in Cox's Bazar, said the organization was part of \"ongoing discussions\" with the government over the future of the refugee response. \"The viability of safely relocating people to Bhashan Char needs to be thoroughly assessed and WFP is investigating the potential operational needs, financial costs, and challenges in several areas that we traditionally support in emergencies: food security, emergency telecommunications and logistics,\" she said. Refugee influx The numbers of refugees in the Cox's Bazar camps have grown dramatically since August 2017, when a Myanmar military-led crackdown that UN investigators have said was conducted with \"genocidal intent\" prompted some 730,000 Rohingya to flee. Myanmar has denied almost all allegations of atrocities made by refugees during what is says was a legitimate counterterrorism operation by its security forces.  Dhaka is struggling to cope with the influx and wants to start relocating thousands of refugees to the island, which it says has been secured with flood defence embankments and cyclone shelters. A senior UN official told reporters in Dhaka on Thursday the organization welcomed the fact the government had \"taken steps to identify alternative settlements.\" \"As you also know if you have been to Kutapalong and the various camps in Cox's Bazar area, it is clear that there is huge congestion,\" said Volker Turk, Assistant High Commissioner for the UN refugee agency. Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque, who is also the chairman of Cabinet Committee on Law and Order, told Reuters in an interview the government planned to start moving refugees next month. A group of Rohingya refugee people walk in the water after crossing the Bangladesh-Myanmar border in Teknaf, Bangladesh  | Reuters \"We are in talks with UN agencies and they have agreed,\" he said. \"Now we are working on other things like how to move them and other strategies. We are the host country. We will decide where to keep them. And we are doing everything to ensure their safety and security.\" The Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, Mohammad Abul Kalam told Reuters preparations were \"still going on\" and the site was not ready. Bhashan Char, a flat and featureless island that emerged from the sea 20 years ago, has never been inhabited. Housing with corrugated iron roofs and concrete floors and walls for about 70,000 people had been built, but there were only enough cyclone shelters for 17,000. In Cox's Bazar, local officials are compiling lists of the first refugees to be moved, District Commissioner Mohammad Kamal Hossain told Reuters."

Subhankar Sarkar, an Indian citizen, asked if the prime minister possessed citizenship documents under Right to Information Act, on February 17. In response to his question, Under Secretary of the Indian Prime Minister's Office, Praveen Kumar wrote: \"Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is a citizen of India by birth in terms of Section 3 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and as such the question of his having a citizenship certificate which is for citizenship by registration does not arise.\"  Amid ongoing turmoil over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across India, the statement has created quite a stir. Ever since the right wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government passed the CAA, protests against the controversial citizenship law have continued across India, with every citizen worrying over how to prove citizenship. Even Modi fails to show the citizenship certificate.  At least 42 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim violence in northeast New Delhi, amid mounting international criticism that authorities failed to protect minority Muslims. The clashes began over a citizenship law that Modi's Hindu nationalist government introduced in December providing a path to Indian citizenship for six religious groups from neighbouring countries - but not Muslims. Critics say the law is discriminatory and comes on top of other measures such as withdrawal of autonomy for Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir, that has deepened disquiet about the future of India's 200 million Muslims. Critics of the government however blamed this week's violence on members of Modi's BJP, which was trounced in local Delhi elections at the beginning of the month.  The violence morphed into street battles between Hindu and Muslim groups, with the police largely ineffective in ending the violence."

But scientists in several countries are testing a century-old tuberculosis (TB) vaccine to see if it might boost the immune system to reduce respiratory symptoms in people who get new coronavirus infections. Researchers in Australia and Europe are testing whether the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, introduced in the 1920s to fight tuberculosis, might be deployed to combat Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  Clinical trials are focused on two groups at high-risk for Covid-19: health care workers and the elderly. Here is what scientists know, and what they are trying to find out: How can a TB vaccine help with other infections? The BCG vaccine contains a live but weakened strain of tuberculosis bacteria that provokes the body to develop antibodies to attack TB bacteria. This is called an adaptive immune response, because the body develops a defence against a specific disease-causing microorganism, or pathogen, after encountering it. Most vaccines create an adaptive immune response to a single pathogen. Unlike other vaccines, the BCG vaccine may also boost the innate immune system, first-line defences that keep a variety of pathogens from entering the body or from establishing an infection. One study in Guinea-Bissau found 50% lower mortality rates in children vaccinated with BCG than in kids who did not get this vaccine. That is a much bigger drop in deaths than could be explained by a reduction in TB cases. Some studies have found similar reductions in respiratory infections among teens and the elderly.  What scientists do not know Scientists do not have data yet on the effect of BCG vaccination on coronaviruses in general or SARS-CoV-2 in particular. There are also many BCG vaccines, with different capacities to protect against various TB strains. Scientists need to determine which BCG vaccines might have the best ability to boost the innate immune system to fight Covid-19. Who should get the BCG vaccine right now? Scientists say it will take several months to get results from trials testing the BCG vaccine to fight Covid-19.  In the meantime, people should not rush to get it because it has not been widely tested in adults and might be harmful. Also, a run on the BCG vaccine to fight Covid-19 might cause shortages for children who need it to prevent TB. "

      "text": "GROWTH OF CITIES CONCERNS EXPERTS\n1987-02-08T05:00:00.000Z\nScores of urban areas in underdeveloped countries are growing at an explosive rate that may create severe economic and social strains, according to experts gathered at the United Nations this week for a population conference.\nThe populations of Cairo, Manila, Mexico City and other urban areas will grow far beyond all but a few industrialized cities today, they said. But while some experts warned of political and environmental catastrophe, others disputed whether growth would necessarily lead to disaster.\n''These mega-cities are becoming social tinderboxes - the seedbeds for social revolution, civil strife and unrest,'' said Werner Fornos, president of the Population Institute, a public-interest group. ''With the numbers come the problems, so the problems will intensify.''\nMetropolitan Cairo, which is struggling to maintain services for more than 9 million people today, will grow to 13 million by the year 2000, according to United Nations estimates. Metropolitan Manila's population is expected to climb from 8.6 million to 11.1 million. And Mexico City, already the world's most populous metropolitan area, is expected to grow from nearly 19 million people to more than 26 million. 'World Beginning to Polarize'\nMany experts said that urbanization is one of several trends - including a high population growth rate in Africa and an increase in the number of elderly people - that are fueling growth in those segments of the population least able to sustain themselves.\n''Looking at population trends, the world is beginning to polarize in terms of birth rates,'' said Lester R. Brown of the Worldwatch Institute, a research group. ''The question is, will these regions get their birth rates down before they destroy their environmental support systems?''\nAccording to United Nations statistics, the populations of cities in underdeveloped countries are growing at an average of 3.5 percent annually. The average for all cities is 2.5 percent.\nThe experts predicted that 15 cities in underdeveloped countries would grow to between 11 million and 26 million residents by 2000 - populations greater than those of all but the 5 largest cities today. Higher Expectations\nSuch increases would create enormous pressure for social services and economic opportunity, the experts said. In addition, more than half of the new city dwellers will come from rural areas, with heightened expectations that could create more problems, according to Jyoti Singh, chief of information for the United Nations Fund for Population Activities.\nPeople under the age of 24, traditionally the most restive segment of the population, will make up at least 20 percent of these migrants to the cities and more than 50 percent in some urban areas, the United Nations Fund estimates.\nThose under 19 years old now make up about 40 percent of the urban populace in underdeveloped nations, compared with less than 30 percent in industrialized countries, according to the fund.\nSome experts cited food riots and unrest in Cairo, Manila, Teheran and Karachi, Pakistan, as examples of the tension that may occur when people abandon traditional communal ways of life for the city, causing social service systems to collapse.\n''In Cairo, Manila, people are coming into the cities and living in slums -young people whose expectations are high,'' said Mr. Singh, of the United Nations Fund. ''You accumulate people who need jobs and facilities. They become frustrated, creating enormous potential for political instability.'' 'A Very Complex Issue'\nThe outlook is not all dire, however; many experts disputed whether urbanization must necessarily lead to disaster.\nAn ongoing United Nations study of these big cities has found vastly different results related to cultural factors more than size or growth, according to one of its authors, Ellen Brennan, a population affairs officer with the United Nations.\nMs. Brennan cited as stable Lima, Peru and Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, even though growth rates have soared and the governments have provided little support for the populace in the way or housing or jobs.\n''It is a very complex issue - there are no generalizations that can be made about social stability,'' Ms. Brennan said. ''One has to look at it city by city.''"

The agricultural officer said around 4,038 hectares of land in the district have been brought under vegetable cultivation this year. As the flood has affected 3,739 hectares out of 4,038 hectares of fields, vegetable prices have shot up, he said.  Saidur Rahman of Kaley village in Belgachha union of Sadar upazila said \"I have been cultivating vegetable in Kharif-1 season for the last four years and earning good profit.\" He has cultivated pointed gourd on 12 decimals of land spending Tk 6,000 this year, said the farmer. \"I've already sold pointed gourds at Tk 10,000,\" said Saidur, adding that he is expecting to earn Tk 16,000 more from sale of the vegetable. Grower Rezaul Islam of Sanwashi village in Halokhana union under Sadar upazila said he cultivated aubergine on 10 decimals of land and pointed gourd on 22 decimals of land this season. \"I have already sold the vegetables at Tk 31,000. I'm also expecting to earn Tk 43,000 more in the next two months,\" said Rezaul. They are getting good profits from the vegetable farming this season every year, he said. Another farmer Akbar Ali of Chhinaye Haat village in Chhinaye union of Rajarhat upazila said he cultivated aubergine on 40 decimals of land and pumpkin on 16 decimals of land spending Tk 19,000 in May this year. \"I'm expecting to earn Tk 42,000 from sale of the vegetables in the next two months,\" he said. Kurigram DAE Additional Deputy Director (Plant Protection) Sasty Chandra Roy said there are many vegetable growers in Rajarhat and Sadar upazilas and they are known as adapted farmers, who cultivate different types of vegetables during this period of the year, and get a good profit. In the rainy season, extra care is needed for pollination, he said."

Addressing a Seratunnabi gathering at Baitul Mukarram, Bangabandhu says that the four basic principles -- nationalism, democracy, socialism and secularism -- are compatible with the teachings of the Prophet and a happy and prosperous nation could be built on these four principles. Addressing the large congregation, the prime minister says that the Prophet loved all human beings irrespective of their religion and taught people to resist all oppression carried out in the name of religion. He says that the struggle for the realisation of justice, truth and honour are compatible with the teachings of Islam. Bangabandhu urges the Muslims of Bangladesh to practise Islam and abide by the teachings of the great Prophet to prove themselves better Muslims than others. He says as Bangladesh is the second largest Muslim nation in the world, the Muslims of this new state will surely display their love for Islam by following the teachings of Islam. In Bangladesh there will be no attack on any religion and the citizens of Bangladesh will be completely free to practise and profess their respective religions. WE CAN'T IGNORE BANGLADESH, SAYS INDIRA Bangladesh has an important role to play in the sub-continent and we can certainly not ignore Bangladesh, says Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi while talking on major Indian and world problems to the press today. Asked about prisoners of war in India-Pak talks, Indira Gandhi says, \"We are not the only party.\" ACCORD ON FLOOD CONTROL MEASURES The India-Bangladesh talks for mutual cooperation on sharing of water and power resources reach complete accord over cyclone and flood control measures. The representatives of the two countries discuss in detail the terms of reference and the composition of the Joint River Commission. VOTERS' AGE LIMIT MAY BE LOWERED Bangladesh government is considering a proposal for reducing the age limit of voters from 21 to 18, enabling young people to have the opportunity of greater participation in the affairs of the state. Recalling the Awami League pledge embodied in the party's election manifesto to reduce voters' age limit, the Local Government and Rural Development Minister Shamsul Huq says that this decision will amount to the fulfillment of a promise the party had made to the people.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-26 00:00:00      \nI still remember when I was a child; I would sit next to my father every Friday evening while he rested on the armchair and read something from our home's library, or told me stories about his childhood. On one of those days, he had read me a poem, September on Jessore Road. My then 9-year old mind was probably too absorbed in frivolous thoughts to be able to grasp the depth of the words being read. Perhaps that is why I could not help revisiting and rereading this acclaimed thought-provoking piece of work by the American poet Allen Ginsberg. Four decades have passed since the Liberation War that marked the birth of our motherland. But even today, millions of those who left as a consequence live far away from their homeland. The poem specifically provides a critical perspective on this unsung lot who are comparatively less spoken about. Ginsberg has gracefully, yet ingenuously, captured the perpetual despair and perplexities that millions of refugees had to face when they fled over by the Jessore Road as a passage to India during the War. \"Millions of Souls nineteen seventy-one\n homeless on Jessore under grey sun A million are dead, the millions who can walk toward Calcutta from East Pakistan...\" Jessore Road had always remained a crucial link between India and then East Pakistan in terms of communication and exchange but in 1971, it gained new significance. Millions of dejected individuals and families, broken and injured, all cynically affected by the War, made their way to this path which linked Jessore with West Bengal's Kolkata. \"Wet processions families walk... starving black angels in human disguise...\"\n As I gravely read on, I could imagine and relive the perilous and poignant journey. Looking ahead towards hundreds of kilometres to cross, perhaps on foot, with no money, no food, and no shelter. The only thing they held in hand was an ounce of hope for survival. I couldn't help tearing up a little as I deliberated upon the next few lines of the poem -- \"Whom shall we pray to for rice and for care?\n Who can bring bread to this s -- flood foul'd lair?\"   Their perilous escape was the least of their worries as they waited there in the face of severe starvation and horrific living conditions. International aid and relief had reached the border but several political/internal conflicts prohibited their entry. It makes you wonder how they felt then -- a tiny glistening ray of hope was right there, so close, yet so far from them.  During the War, and even today, decades later, Jessore Road still remains an important topic of war and refugee migration. Around 10 million habitants of East Pakistan had escaped to India and even today, many still remain there or somewhere across the world, far away from the place they once called home.   Almost two generations have passed since then. But even today, some monumental pieces of work such as this poem can invoke anguish in your heart for the sufferers and shake you to the core. Today, we are fortunate to be able to speak in a language we call our own, to live in a country we call our own. Yes, it is true that we have not experienced the brutality of the war first-hand. However, it is necessary for us to do our part by always honouring the heroes who fought the war and never forget those oft ignored refugees of the War who had to leave their beloved motherland behind to simply stay alive.

Doctors are never on time; they come, and go as they please' The Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital was designed and built to accommodate 250 in-patients. But, on any given day there are between 400 to 600 in-patients from all corners of the district, during the current monsoon, and cyclone season. International non-governmental organizations (NGOs) along with the Bangladesh government are working to improve the services of the much important hospital, which is the primary source of health care for nearly 250,000 people in the district. Although the hospital is returning to its former glory in providing standardized services, the grievance of the patients from near, and far has not minimized in proportion.  The patients coming to receive health care are raising various complaints regarding mismanagement, irregularities, corruption, and overall patient-doctor experience. The health care process has improved somewhat, but to no good end. Patients said, they are suffering from a shortage of beds, frequent power outages, and hassle from brokers looking for commissions. The hospital should be able to accommodate 250 patients, but in reality, it does not have the required manpower or resources to even run a 150-bed hospital, said locals.   Patients waiting in a jam-packed line in front of the ticket counter to see the doctor is an everyday scenario. After a daylong wait, some who manage to see the doctor is satisfied, while others are disappointed as they do not get the chance.  According to patients and visitors, the women's ward on the fourth floor is always crowded with patients, making it difficult for doctors to attend to each, and everyone. Due to the shortage of beds some patients share beds, while others are accommodated on the floor, and the corridors. Razia Begum, a patient accommodated on the floor said: \"I was admitted two days ago but I was not given a bed yet. I am not getting proper health care. Doctors are never on time; they come, and go as they please.\"  Another patient, Mehrab Hossain said: \"A hospital is supposed to have the cleanest environment, but this place is making people even sicker. The management should promptly take steps to provide more patient-centric services.\" Hospital Coordinator Md Mohiuddin said: \"International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), an NGO, along with the Health and Planning Ministry yesterday inaugurated the newly improved emergency room with increased staff members, and modern equipment. \"We hope to provide modern, and international standard services from now on.\""

Vast agricultural lands have been losing fertility as well as crop yield capacity for over decades due to the loss of topsoil--which is the outermost layer of soil with the highest concentration of organic matter. Farmers in the district have long been victims of exploitation and have been manipulated by local brokers to sell their fertile-most soil to brick kiln owners. In this way, around 52 brick kilns have been set up around the farmlands of Debiganj, Boda, and Atwari upazila, which are using fertile topsoil of thousand hectares of arable land to make millions of bricks every year. Collection of topsoil from farmlands surrounding brick kilns begins after the Aman harvest and continues for the next one and a half months, locals say. As most nutrients and organic properties along with beneficial microorganisms reside on the top part of the soil when removed, the soil becomes infertile; the bare chemical-infested soil residue washes into the adjacent water bodies, resulting in scores of environmental and health hazards. On a field visit, this correspondent saw numerous trucks filled with the soil, and the farmlands dug 10ft to 15ft under.  Near about 500,000 to 1,000,000cft (Cubic Feet) topsoils are being used to make 3 to 4 million bricks every year. Even though removing topsoil is a punishable offence, locals say neither the brick kiln owners nor the authorities abide by the law. They allege local political influencers are behind these atrocities. Dhananjay Rai, a resident of Debiganj's Nayanpara village, said he sold per bigha of topsoil from his land at Tk26,000. Jagadish Chandra Rai, manager of MML Bricks Kiln in Boda upazila, said they need 250,000 to 500,000cft soil each season to make 500,000 to 800,000 bricks. He said: \"We never face any objection from anyone regarding the use of topsoil. We never force farmers, in fact, they are willing to sell soil from their lands for the profits.\" Md Shamim Iqbal, upazila agriculture officer (UAO) of Debiganj, said: \"Due to this trend of diminishing topsoil at such a rapid rate, farmable lands and crop yields will decline in future as well as having devastating environmental impacts.\" Boda UAO Al Mamun Or-Rashid said the brick kiln owners are using a syndicate of brokers to manipulate the farmers to sell their lands. Touhidul Bari Babu, head of the Geography and Environmental Science department of Panchagarh Govt Women's College, said: \"The situation is truly alarming as fertilizers can longer make the soil fertile without putting a stop to the damage of nutrients in the soil.\" Md Abu Hanif, deputy director of the district's Department of Agricultural Extension, said: \"We can only build awareness among farmers so they stop selling topsoil. But, we are unable to take legal action against the brick kilns.\" Sabina Yasmin, deputy commissioner of Panchagarh, was unwilling to comment on the matter, while Debiganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer Prottoy Hasan said they will take measures to ensure proper awareness among farmers and legal actions against the offenders."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-27 00:00:00      \nMore than 300 trees on a road alongside the Padma river in Jagannathpur village of Khoksa upazila were allegedly stolen in broad daylight recently. Locals said Gopgram Union Parishad (UP) Chairman and also Khoksa upazila unit Krishak League President Alamgir Hossain, with the connivance of government officials, felled the trees. The felling of the trees, worth around Tk 6 lakh, started after February 15, when construction work of a two-kilometre-long flood control embankment was undertaken on the road in the village.  The government departments concerned did not raise any objection or stop the political goons of the UP chairman when they started to chop the trees down, claiming to have purchased the trees at an auction of Water Development Board (WDB), alleged locals.  While removing the trees from the road, the thugs threatened witnesses with dire consequences if anyone wished to complain to the administration or police, they also claimed. A member of the same Union Parishad seeking anonymity said, \"Men of the UP chairman chopped down the trees.\"   On February 20, locals submitted a written complaint to upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) of Khoksa in this regard. Contacted, UNO Maffara Tasnim said a three-member investigation committee, led by Upazila Engineer Abdus Samad of Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) in Khoksa, was formed yesterday to probe into the accusation. The committee has been asked to submit its report within seven working days, she said, adding, \"Action will be taken after receiving the report.\" ABM Mehedi Masud, officer-in-charge of Khoksa Police Station, said at the directive of the UNO, a police team went to the spot and found the accusation of trees being felled is true. They seized eight pieces of logs from the spot, but was not clear whether those were chopped down illegally, he said adding that no one filed any complaint with them over the matter yet. Ariful Islam, section officer of WDB in Kumarkhali upazila, admitted that several hundred trees were felled and stolen although those were not put on auction.  \"The trees belong to us [WDB], while the road belongs to LGED. This happened due to miscoordination between WDB and LGED,\" he also said. LGED's Khoksa Upazila Engineer Abdus Samad said they did not authorise anyone to fell the trees. When this correspondent contacted Gopgram UP Chairman Alamgir Hossain for his comments over the accusations, he said, \"I was in Dhaka when the trees were felled.\""

      "text": "TV Review; 'Politics of Food,' on Channel 13\n1988-01-06T05:00:00.000Z\n''THE Politics of Food'' examines worldwide hunger and finds it's the fault of the West. Western creditors and governments, particularly the United States, have joined to choke off world food supplies. The two-hour documentary, on Channel 13 at 10 o'clock tonight, is provocative, but it doesn't have much breadth.\nThe documentary - produced by an international consortium headed by Britain's Yorkshire Television, and narrated by Martin Sheen -visits Minnesota, Brazil, the Sudan, Bangladesh and India. Dispossessed farmers in Minnesota, it finds, have conterparts in the third world; they are all burdened by debt, manipulated by creditors and forced off the land by big business.\nConsequently, much of the world goes hungry, even though there is ample food. The world distribution process, the documentary says, is faulty. Grain and other surpluses pile up in the West, while millions of people starve to death or suffer from malnutrition.\nThe documentary is persuasive about this. How could it not be? The West does indeed have food surpluses, and much of the world does starve. Why does this happen? The documentary suggests that a principal villain is the World Bank, which forces debtor nations to grow cash crops, rather than food that will feed their people.\nNonetheless, the documentary does seem a shade simplistic. Revolutions and wars, one thinks, have done at least as much to disrupt third-world food supplies as bureaucrats in Washington or on Wall Street. At the same time, ''The Politics of Food'' is ambivalent about centralized economies. Are they good or bad? The documentary wants it both ways.\nThus it pleads for family farmers the world over; it argues for rural economies, where governments and banks stay off the farmers' backs. That's decentralization. On the other hand, the only bright spot the documentary seems able to find is a region in India that makes grants to the poor, practices land reform and regulates food prices. That's not decentralization.\nOn television, however, the region is prettily filmed. Mr. Sheen says the inhabitants even elect Communists to office, and that the system is such that ''everything is shared more equally.'' Well, perhaps, but surely world hunger is more complicated than that.\nThe documentary concludes with a warning about ''antidemocratic structures.'' It says they ''are the main cause of hunger.'' That's sufficiently vague to include many things, but whatever they are, they all have their roots in the West. ''The Politics of Food'' is interesting, but it never looks beyond its own horizon."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-02 00:00:00      \nThey are all from Ukhiya and Teknaf refugee camps Police rescued 37 Rohingyas, including women and children, while they were attempting to go to Malaysia illegally by sea from Reju Khal area in Ramu upazila of Cox's Bazar early on Monday. They are all from Ukhiya and Teknaf refugee camps, said Sub-Inspector SM Atik Ullah, the in-charge of Himchari police outpost. Police also detained three people in connection with the human trafficking from the spot. However, police did not disclose the identities of the Rohingyas and the detained human traffickers. SI Atik said: \"On a tip off, we conducted a drive in the Reju canal area where the human traffickers rounded up a group of Rohingyas early in the morning in order to send them to Malaysia illegally by sea.\" Later, police rescued the Rohingyas from the spot, he said.  \"Of the Rohingyas, four are children, 17 women and 16 men. A case was filed against the three human traffickers with Ramu police station.\" Earlier on February 11, a total of 20 Rohingyas died and several others were rescued after a trawler, carrying around 100 Rohingyas, capsized near Saint Martin's Island in the Bay of Bengal.  They were heading to Malaysia by sea illegally, according to law enforcement agencies.  The camps at Ukhiya and Teknaf in Cox's Bazar currently shelters more than 1.1 million Rohingyas who fled persecution in Myanmar.  Taking advantage on the desperation of these Rohingya people, several gangs of national and international human traffickers often lure them into making dangerous journey to aboard by sea illegally for better lives.
