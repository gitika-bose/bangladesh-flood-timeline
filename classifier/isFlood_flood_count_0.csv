Locals accused the administration of doing little to help them With the sudden  rise in water levels, land erosion by the Madhumati, and Nabaganga rivers has taken a serious turn at different places of Narail, forcing people to look for safer places. According to local sources, the erosion has taken a serious turn in Ghagha, Mollikpur, Shierbr, and Makrail areas along Madhumati's banks, and at 15 points including Kargati, Soto Kalia, and Suktogram, of Nabaganga banks. People  of the affected areas have accused the local Water Development Board (WDB) of its negligence as water from the rivers poured into houses in Kalia upazila. ""I have never seen Nabaganga rise so much in the last 35 years. My house was destroyed in a matter of seconds,"" said Ilias Ali, a resident of Sukragram. Many, who have lost their houses in river erosion, are living with their relatives, but some like Julmat Sheikh of Kalia upazila's Noragati village, have been staying under the open sky with their families as they have nowhere else to go. Locals accused the administration of doing little to help them. According to the locals, the WDB has failed to prevent recurring erosion because of their lackadaisical attitude.  Babra-Hachla Union Parishad Chairman Mojammel Hossain said the situation will be brought under control soon. The local contractors declined to perform the emergency work at the beginning of monsoon as WDB officials usually demand 10 percent bribe for such projects, alleged contractors. When contacted, WDB Executive Engineer Md Zulfikar Ali declined to comment over the issue. Meanwhile locals formed a human chain in the district yesterday protesting the  negligence of WDB. Among others, Monisha Ghosh, Profullo Barman, Liton Kumar Ghosh, Kalyani Barman, and Modon Ghosh of the affected areas spoke at the gathering. They urged the administration to take immediate steps to save the people from becoming victims of river erosion.",0

Following approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), Dhaka Wasa had initiated two projects to tackle the issue and improve the water logging situation The water logging situation in the capital has not changed over the years, even after promises from Dhaka Wasa about implementing a master-plan and commitment of the government to find a solution to this problem. People of the city were reminded of the unfulfilled pledges yesterday, after a downpour left numerous areas waterlogged and led to major gridlock on the streets until well after evening. Following approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), Dhaka Wasa had initiated two projects to tackle the issue and improve the water logging situation. But their progress is very slow to make any significant headway. On June 28, 2018, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, then LGRD minister, had blamed development projects around the city for its water logging problem. He had also expressed hope that the problem would end by 2019 -- which has not happened. As a result, the perennial waterlogging scenario in Dhaka is still unchanged. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) recorded 46mm rainfall in the city between 12pm and 6pm yesterday. Just within half-an-hour of thundershowers a little after 12pm, citizens were seen posting on social media videos of waterlogging in a number of areas. Dhaka Tribune correspondents during visits also found many streets and areas inundated. The areas that suffered most include Mirpur's Rokeya Sarani and Kazipara, Jahangir Gate, Green Road, parts of Indira Road, Tejgaon, Panthapath, Shukrabad, Kalabagan, Dhanmondi, Jhigatala, Shankar, Jatrabari, Bashundhara Residential Area, Motijheel, Gulistan, Paltan, Bijoynagar, Fakirapool, Karwan Bazar, Arambagh, some areas in Mohakhali and Gulshan, and many places of Old Dhaka. Talking to Dhaka Tribune, many said waterlogging was still occurring as the drains that are supposed to take the rainwater out are clogged with garbage. At the same time, heavy gridlock on major roads, which were inundated, made it extremely difficult for city dwellers to commute. Sufferings Many people were seen wading through the water to reach their destinations. Sarjin Sharif, a resident of Shankar area, told Dhaka Tribune: ""The road in front of my house is completely submerged. ""I need to go to work, but I cannot even get out of the house to find a vehicle."" Dhanmondi's Road No 27 also went under knee-deep water very quickly, leaving many including students suffering amid heavy rain. Nafisa Nazmul, a former student of Brac University, said: ""I cannot find transport to go to Panthapath from Mirpur 10. The roads are completely underwater."" East Jurain resident Awenim Rahman also told Dhaka Tribune that the main streets in his area were fine, as they were rebuilt and their heights increased recently. ""But the branch lanes, which are still low-lying, are completely inundated."" He said he also faced horrible traffic jam on his way to the office later in the afternoon. ""I found all the roads leading from Gulistan to Paltan, Shahbagh, Kakrail, Dainik Bangla, and Farmgate via Banglamotor and Karwan Bazar absolutely gridlocked,"" Awenim said expressing frustration. Independent University Bangladesh faculty member Kazi Mubinul Hasan said: ""I live in the Bashundhara Residential area. On a usual day, it takes me less than an hour to reach Shukrabad. But today [Tuesday], it took me nearly two hours."" Nilkhet and New Market areas, Elephant Road and Mirpur Road also saw major gridlock after the rain stopped a little after 3pm. The rain even left the roads leading from the main entrances to archways in the Bangladesh Secretariat, adjacent to Zero Point in Gulistan, under knee-deep water for at least three hours. Officers and outsiders both suffered while going from one building to another. Many were even seen entering the offices barefoot. Those turning up at the secretariat without cars were among the worst sufferers. Many said the secretariat had seen a similar problem on Sunday. More rains incoming BMD Meteorologist AKM Ruhul Quddus told Dhaka Tribune that they recorded 45.3mm of rainfall in the capital between noon and 3pm yesterday. Between 12pm and 6pm, a total of 46mm rainfall was recorded. Meanwhile, BMD also recorded the highest rainfall in Sylhet - 120mm. According to a Met Office weather bulletin, light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind over the country was likely again in the next 24 hours as of 9am today. ""There is a chance of light rain on Wednesday in Dhaka, Khulna and Chittagong regions, and in the rest of the country it will rainless,"" said Ruhul. The bulletin added that light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind is likely to occur at most places in Dhaka, Mymensingh, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, many places in Khulna and Barisal divisions, and a few places in Rangpur and Rajshahi divisions during the time. Moreover, it said, some places in Barisal, Chittagong, Mymensingh and Sylhet divisions may see moderately heavy to very heavy falls until this morning. Slow progress of master-plan Aiming to fix the perennial problem, the Ecnec last year had approved two projects -- ""Expansion of Drainage Networks and Development of Canals Project in Dhaka City"" and ""Land acquisition, excavation and re-excavation of Hazaribagh, Baishteki, Kurmitola, Manda and Begunbari canals."" But both, being implemented by Dhaka Wasa are advancing at a snail's pace. One of the projects has registered only 8.25% progress in the past one year, while the other just 1.5% over the span of 14 months. Regarding the extremely sluggish progress, urban development expert Prof Nazrul Islam said such projects, after being passed, advance slowly due to many issues. ""But in course of time, their progress gained pace. But these two projects seem to be progressing very slowly. Only the authorities implementing them can explain why,"" he said. Dhaka Wasa Managing Director Taqsem A Khan was unavailable for comment over phone. However, engineer Nuruzzaman, former member of Dhaka Wasa Board, told Dhaka Tribune: ""Wasa is trying to solve the waterlogging issue by implementing some projects. It is visible that once areas used to remain waterlogged for five to six hours, but this year the water cleared from roads in two to three hours. It is a significant improvement.""",0

With this, Rangpur reported three Covid-19 cases so far A Malaysia returnee in Rangpur's Badargonj upazila has tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19), making him the first such case in the upazila. Badargonj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Nabirul Islam confirmed the matter to Dhaka Tribune around 8: 30pm on Wednesday. The 30-year old man, who returned from Malaysia to the upazila recently, went to Narayanganj where he stayed for one month. Few days ago, he came back from Narayanganj and started suffering from fever, cough, and respiratory problems, prompting health authorities to collect samples. They were later sent to Rangpur Medical College Hospital for testing.  On Wednesday, his reports came back positive, said UNO Nabirul Islam. The UNO also added that 10 houses around the patient's residence and a residential quarter of Badargonj Upazila Health Complex, where his brother lives, were put under lockdown. With this, Rangpur reported three Covid-19 cases so far, according to health authorities. ",0

According to villagers, the disaster occurred due to continuous sand lifting by unscrupulous traders Erosion by the Jamuna river, due to illegal sand lifting, has hit Beltia and Gorilabari areas in Gohaliabari union since Wednesday, which is very close to the Bangabandhu Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge, in Kalihati upazila. The river has already devoured at least 28 dwellings, in areas under the union, in the last two days. According to villagers, the disaster occurred due to continuous sand lifting by unscrupulous traders.  The authorities dumped geo-bags but failed to prevent the erosion that left at least 28 families homeless. Although law prohibits sand lifting within a six-kilometre radius of a bridge, a syndicate of influential traders, having political connections, continued lifting sand near the bridge with powerful dredgers, the villagers said. Over 20,000 people in the union are under the threat of erosion, and are passing their days in panic. When Gorilabari village was visited yesterday, the villagers expressed grave concerns. ""Our tin-shed building, toilet, and tube-well were devoured by the river,"" said Fatema Begum adding that they are now living in somebody else's house. Not only Fatema but also Akbar Ali Akanda, Chand Miah Haji, Abdul Ali Mondol, Abdus Salam, Janab Ali Talukder, Abul Hossain, Korban Ali, Akbar Shikder, Ashraf Ali, Solaiman, Shafiq Uddin, Jahurul Islam, and Khaled Mondol of Gorilabari, and Beltia villages have lost their dwellings due to erosion. They have taken shelter in open spaces, and relatives' houses. ""Many people of the village have lost their houses in the erosion. I have lost my house,"" said Akbar Ali Akanda of the village. During the last rainy season, erosion by the river devoured at least 50 houses, and a 200-metre embankment in the village within a few days. This year, erosion started in Gorilabari village on May 30, and it devoured over a dozen dwellings so far, said Rashida Begum, an erosion victim of the village. Tangail-4 (Kalihati upazila) constituency MP  Hasan Imam Khan Sohel said work  for a permanent embankment in the area, to save the people from erosion, will start in December. ""Each erosion victim will get Tk, 6000, and two bundles of corrugated tins,"" he also said.",0
