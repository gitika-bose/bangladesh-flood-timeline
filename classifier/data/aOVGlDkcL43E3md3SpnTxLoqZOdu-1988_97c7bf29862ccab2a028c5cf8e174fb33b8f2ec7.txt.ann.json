  "text": "CYCLONE BATTERS BANGLADESH COAST\n1988-12-01T05:00:00.000Z\nA cyclone battered coastal areas of Bangladesh and eastern India late Tuesday, killing at least 300 people and leaving a trail of devastation, officials and news reports said today.\nOfficials said the death toll was likely to rise dramatically as recovery efforts progressed and communications in the affected areas were fully restored.\nOfficials told the United News of India that more than 870 people, including 500 fishermen, had been killed. Other Bangladeshi officials said they feared the death toll would be in the thousands. Hundreds of thousands of people were reportedly left homeless and millions of tons of crops were said to have been destroyed. Winds to 120 Miles Per Hour\nThe cyclone struck Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, as it was continuing its recovery from the worst flooding in its history; the flooding in August and September covered three-fourths of the country and caused damages now estimated at more than $1 billion.\nThe storm, with winds of 60 to 120 miles per hour, whipped 10-foot-high tidal waves as it swept across the Bay of Bengal and through the southern and southeastern districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Byrguna, Barisal, Patuakhali, Bhola, Chittagong and the town of Cox's Bazar. Electrical power and communications in those areas were cut off.\nAt least 275 fishermen were reported missing, and officials said they expected many more deaths as reports come in from the hundreds of tiny islands in the Bay of Bengal.\nA relief ministry official said that about 80 percent of the crops and mud and thatch homes in the two hardest-hit districts, Khulna and Satkhira, had been destroyed. Warnings Were Broadcast\nBut he said that human casualties had been minimized by an efficient early warning system that helped people evacuate vulnerable areas. This official predicted the final death toll would be no more than ''a few thousand.''\nGiven the record of previous cyclones in Bangladesh - the most recent in 1985, which killed an estimated 10,000 people - that prediction seemed to a remarkably low figure. More than 300,000 people died in 1970 in the worst cyclone in Bangladesh's history."
