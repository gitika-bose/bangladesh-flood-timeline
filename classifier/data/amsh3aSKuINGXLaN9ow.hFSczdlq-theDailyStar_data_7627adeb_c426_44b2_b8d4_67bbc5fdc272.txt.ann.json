Due to the delay, thousands of inhabitants of several villages in Basail and adjacent two upazilas -- Sakhipur and Mirzapur -- are suffering immensely for long. According to the data provided by Local Government and Engineering Department (LGED) in Basail, the six-kilometre-long road stretching from Kanchanpur to Dhangpara via Pathatghata has remained unusable for locals and unfit for vehicular movement. In a bid to ease the public sufferings, LGED floated a tender for construction and renovation work of the road at a costs of 5.59 crores. Contractor firm Bishal Enterprise got the work order and started the work on April 30, 2018.   Mentionable, although the works were supposed to be completed by May 6, 2019, it still remain incomplete even after eight months of its actual deadline. During a recent visit to the area this correspond saw construction materials lying scattered beside the under construction road in Dhangpara, Jotuki, Poulee, Haluapara and Sankapara area while construction materials did not even reached in many areas. Saiful Islam of Kanchanpur village said they have been facing lots of trouble due to the shabby condition of the road and huge amount of dust in the air. \"We did not saw the contractor concerned at the construction site yet,\" he alleged. Accidents often occur while travelling on the damaged road, Mohammad Ali of the area said. \"As the road is not suitable for vehicular movements local traders suffer immensely while carrying their goods,\" trader Shafiqul Islam said.  \"We have to move on foot as transports are not available due to the bad condition of the road,\" housewife Protima Rani said.  Basail Upazila Parishad Chairman Kazi Alid Islam said the road repair work was in full swing till the beginning of the rainy season, but suddenly it stopped. \"I hope the work will complete in a short time and local people will be benefited from it,\" he added. Basail LGED Upazila Engineer Rozdid Ahmed said about 45 percent of the total work has already been completed and they have served notice to the contractor concerned for completing the work by June this year.
