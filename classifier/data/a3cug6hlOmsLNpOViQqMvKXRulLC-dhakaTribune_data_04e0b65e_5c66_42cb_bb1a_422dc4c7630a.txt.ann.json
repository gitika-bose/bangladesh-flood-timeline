  "text": "Date Published:2019-08-01 00:00:00      \nThis made over 200 families of low-lying areas homeless, locals and Water Development Board officials said. Padma River erosion took an alarming turn in the last few days, rendering over 200 families homeless in the Rajeswhawar union of the Chandpur Sadar upazila. The affected people of Rajarchar, Mander Bazar, Khaskandi, Lagnimararchar, and Dewan Bazar areas of the union said onrush of flood waters from upstream and heavy rain in the last few days  swelled Padma-Meghna, flooding the areas on its banks. This made over 200 families of low-lying areas homeless, locals and Water Development Board officials said. A large number of flood victims took shelter on nearby highlands including  Bashgari, Majherchar, Goal Nagar and Rayerchar. Hajrat Ali Bepari , chairman of the Rajeswhawar union said about a thousand other families, living close to the river, are passing their days in anxiety and fear of being devoured by the Padma in the near future. He also said the  erosion along vast areas on the river bank earlier washed away scores of homesteads, schools in the area. The situation had been deteriorated due to constant erosion, he added.  Erosion-hit Kamal, 40, and Akkel Ali, 35, of the union said they had been passing sleepless nights in fear of erosion. \"Where will we go? We are all poor people,\" said Akkel Ali. Gourango, Abul Kalam and Laila of Mander Bazar alleged that unplanned dredging had sped up the erosion.  Executive Engineer of Chandpur Water Development Board Abu Raihan said, \"During the monsoon season the water stream in the river is very high. There are strong vortex current flows. This place is very risky within the union.\" He said they have nothing to do as the union is situated in the char area.  "
