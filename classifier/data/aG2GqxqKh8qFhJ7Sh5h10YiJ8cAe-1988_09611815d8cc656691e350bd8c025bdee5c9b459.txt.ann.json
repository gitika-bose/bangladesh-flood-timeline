Says Bangladesh Needs $1.1 Billion in Flood Repairs\n1988-11-18T05:00:00.000Z\nBangladesh will need $1.1 billion in extra aid to repair damage from catastrophic flooding there in September and prevent future flooding, according to a United Nations study.\nThe study by the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization also says flooding will reoccur unless countries bordering Bangladesh develop a regional plan to control the many water systems that flow into Bangladesh.\nThe study was presented at a conference Wednesday. The conference raised $500 million, United Nations officials said today."
