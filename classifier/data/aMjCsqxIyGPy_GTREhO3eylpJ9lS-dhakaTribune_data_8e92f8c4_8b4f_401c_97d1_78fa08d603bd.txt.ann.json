  "text": "Date Published:2019-10-16 00:00:00      \nOn Monday, almost 40 meters of the embankment, surrounding the city, was damaged by the receding flood water coming from Padma, and Jamuna rivers The devastating erosion of the Meghna River has once again taken a serious turn in Puran Bazar's Harisabha Mandir area in Sadar upazila, Chandpur. On Monday, almost 40 meters of the embankment, surrounding the city, was damaged by the receding flood water coming from Padma, and Jamuna rivers. Areas under Harisabha, Madhya, and Paschim Sreeramdi are at a huge risk due to the renewed erosion.   Locals said, the receding whirling flood water is at its most dangerous form, and in a sudden strike the erosion devoured a large area, while they were able to transfer six buildings.  They confirmed that already four households were washed away, and there are ten other at risk, including a temple. Abu Raihan, deputy engineer of Chandpur Water Development Board (WDB) said: \"We had no idea that the erosion would hit this area again. The whole embankment is at risk right now. \"We are dumping sand bags to reduce the casualties, and another 3000 bags are ready to be used if necessary,\" he added. Visiting the area, Deputy Commissioner Majedur Rahman Khan, Superintendent of Police Mahabubur Rahman, and WDB Deputy Engineer Abu Raihan promised to take every necessary step possible to save the city. Earlier, two months ago, in another erosion strike of Meghna a 300 meter area of the embankment was washed away."
