  "text": "Bangladesh Intensifies Appeal for Flood Aid\n1988-09-04T05:00:00.000Z\nBangladesh renewed an appeal for emergency international aid today as the official death tollpassed 500 in monsoon flooding that has made millions homeless.\nOfficials said earlier that the floods, which have closed Dhaka's airport, threatened the lives of 10 million people.\nFlooding during the monsoon season is an annual event in Bangladesh, and such flooding in limited proportions is considered essential to a successful rice crop. But last year's floods, which killed about 1,600 people, were described as the worst in 70 years, and this year's devastation is believed to be greater still.\nPresident H. M. Ershad was quoted as saying today that this year's flood ''is far worse than the last year's,'' and added: ''Nobody knows whether this devastation has any parallel in the subcontinent's history.''\nForeign Minister Humayun Rashid Chowdhury told the heads of diplomatic missions in Dhaka that the floods had caused enormous damage to crops and communications networks.\n''This year's flood is more than a natural disaster,'' he said. ''It is an aberration of nature in which 25 million people have lost their homes, and communications networks disrupted totally.''\n''Bangladesh will need about three million tons of additional food grains on top of what is already committed as regular assistance,'' he said, ''to feed nearly half of the country's population for four months before the next crop is expected.''\nMore than 50 people died today, putting the death toll above 500, officials said. Some unofficial estimates put the toll at more than 1,200, but the collapse of communications has made it virtually impossible to get an authoritative assessment. Mr. Chowdhury said there was no sign of any easing of the flooding crisis, adding: ''All major rivers are flowing above danger marks. The human misery and suffering are unbearable.''\nFloods engulfed more than half of the capital, drenching the homes of a third of the city's six million residents.\nOfficials said earlier that thousands of families huddling on river embankments or clinging to their submerged houses could starve to death unless supplies reached them soon. An estimated 10 million people faced starvation or death from poisonous snakes and disease, they added.\nBangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, has so far received promises of more than $600,000 worth of rice and cash from Pakistan, the United States and Australia. Britain has pledged $800,000 in immediate relief."
