  "text": "Heavy Rains Worsen Flooding in Bangladesh\n1988-09-11T05:00:00.000Z\nHeavy rains fell again today, officials said, worsening flood conditions that have covered three-quarters of Bangladesh and left a fourth of its 110 million people homeless.\nOfficials at flood control centers said flooding increased in 12 districts where, earlier in the week, the water level of major rivers had been receding. Dhaka newspapers put the death toll from flooding at 1,451. The Government's count was 630.\nOfficials reported an outbreak of diarrhea in all areas affected by the floods. By Friday evening at least 160,872 people had been afflicted by the illness and 102 had died from it, the officials said. In Dhaka, a city of 6 million, 21,412 new cases of diarrhea were reported Friday by the Government.\nThe rains Friday and early today added to hardships already suffered by millions living on roofs and treetops and huddled together in thousands of camps nationwide without safe drinking water, cooked food or medical care.\nHealth Ministry officials said 30,035 health workers were working to aid victims of water-borne diseases.\nThe officials acknowledged that there was not enough medicine to help all of those affected by the flooding.\nA senior official at the Agriculture Ministry said that ''if the water does not recede in the next couple of days, most of the rice crop will be damaged beyond any recovery.''\nThe Government has 1.3 million tons of grain and has issued an appeal for 3 million tons to compensate for damage to the rice crop. FLOODS CALLED MAN-MADE\nROME, Sept. 10 (Reuters) - The disastrous floods sweeping Bangladesh are now an unstoppable annual event and largely man-made, a United Nations expert said. The official, Tom Elhaut, director of projects in Bangladesh for the International Fund for Agricultural Development, said Friday that deforestation and soil erosion in the Himalayas has removed natural barriers to the monsoon rains and that dikes built to shield development projects have only increased the devastation.\nLast year's severe flooding in Bangladesh was said to be the worst in decades, but was thought to be a freak occurrence. Mr. Elhaut said that catastrophic flooding may become the norm. 'Bound to Recur'\n''This phenomenon is bound to recur,'' he said. ''These are the first two years of a sustained series of catastrophic floods.''\nHe said that this year the problem has grown worse because snow continued to melt in the Himalayas longer than usual and rainfall has been particularly heavy.\nBut he asserted that the environmental havoc wreaked by the destruction of Nepalese forests has done the most damage. ''It is to a large extent manmade,'' Mr. Elhaut said.\nA population increase in Nepal has increased demand for wood faster than trees can be replaced, and growing numbers of animals are eroding the remaining grasslands.\nThe resulting deforestation insures that rain and silt will rush into Bangladesh unchecked.\nOn Thursday, the Dhaka Government called for an international conference on controlling the flood problem, but Mr. Elhaut was skeptical that immediate results could be achieved."
