Acres of low-lying areas of several villages, fish enclosures, and streets became waterlogged as the flood embankments were destroyed by the storm on Wednesday night, said Sharankhola UNO Sarder Mostafa Shahin.  More than 500 fish enclosures were submerged, locals said, and they fear an untimely flood through the damaged embankments due to the high tidal waves.   The villagers are seeking prompt action from the authority and in this situation, they demanded its immediate mending. Contacted, Md Nahiduzzaman Khan, executive engineer of Bagerhat Water Development Board, said, \"We are preparing to install ring dams where the embankment was harmed,\"  The upazila administration has already been directed to assess the losses following Amphan and it will soon be notified, said Bagerhat District Administrator Mamunur Rashid."
