  "text": "Flood Relief in Bangladesh\n1988-07-11T05:00:00.000Z\nArmy troops mounted a big rescue operation today after the death toll in annual floods rose to at least 121 people, forcing large-scale evacuation. At least 5 million people have been affected. An official at the Relief Ministry said soldiers were moving marooned people to safer areas but that rescue operations were difficult in the northeastern district of Sunamganj because all the roads were under deep water. There is no dry surface to land helicopters, he said, and the flooding has made the dropping of food packages nearly impossible."
