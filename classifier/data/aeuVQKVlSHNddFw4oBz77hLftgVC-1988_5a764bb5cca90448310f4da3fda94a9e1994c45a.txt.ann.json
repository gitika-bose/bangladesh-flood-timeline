  "text": "BARTER IS HIS STOCK IN TRADE\n1988-09-25T05:00:00.000Z\nIN THE FALL OF 1986, W. DOUGLASS LEE Jr., an American commodities trader based in London, received a call for help from a representative of a major chemical producer. The United States multinational corporation had sold $8 million in chemicals to Zimbabwe and had agreed to take payment in tobacco rather than cash. The company had resold the tobacco to Egypt and, in the process, had negotiated a $12 million chemicals sale as well. In lieu of cash, Egypt was offering in payment for both deals a shopping list of commodities ranging from pig iron to rice and coriander.\nSoon afterward, Lee was on a red-eye flight from London's Heathrow Airport to Cairo, arriving at 4 A.M. on a Monday in November to begin long rounds of negotiations with senior government officials and top executives of Egypt's state-owned enterprises. His mission: to insure that $20 million in hard currency wound up in the company's coffers.\nThe first trickle of goods traded for cash finally came out of Egypt last February: Lee peddled Egyptian aluminum to a British manufacturer, Egyptian pig iron in Italy and Bangladesh. Sales of Egyptian steel to the Far East are still pending. But the route to obtaining the cash for the chemical company was arduous and littered with obstacles. Over the past 22 months, for instance, Lee has become intimately familiar with Egyptian metals factories, personally inspecting manufacturing methods and quality control and working out the details of product specifications, delivery schedules and pricing contracts.\nThe negotiating etiquette required lengthy meetings refreshed by rounds of the muddy, nerve-jolting coffee favored by the Egyptians and long talks over late dinners, ending, Lee recalls, ''about 2 A.M. after the belly dancers and everything else.'' There were even political delays, such as the cabinet reshuffle that came the night before Lee was scheduled to have a crucial meeting with Egypt's trade minister, who was ousted in the government shake-up.\n''It rarely goes smoothly,'' says Lee, a 40-year-old expatriate who has made his home in England for the last 15 years. ''But when you're successful, the country has a new market for its goods and your client makes its sale and gets its cash.''\nDOUGLASS LEE IS ONE OF A NEW BREED OF FREELANCE middlemen who operate on the cutting edge of world trade - the shadowy but expanding niche known as countertrade. In the 1980's, a growing number of American industrial and financial giants such as General Motors, Dow Chemical and American Express have been engaging in the controversial practice, often with the assistance of experts like Lee.\nIn its broadest sense, the term covers all international trade in which payment is in some form other than cash. A more sophisticated version of barter, the world's oldest form of commerce, countertrade encompasses basic swaps of goods for goods, but also goods for technology, goods for services and even goods for debt.\nCountertrade deals such as Lee's three-legged United States-Zimbabwe-Egypt exchange, starting with chemicals and moving through agricultural products and metals to hard currency, are crafted mainly between Western corporations and the world's least creditworthy big customers, the nations of the Eastern bloc and the third world.\nEastern European governments spawned the international countertrade business in the 50's. Communist bureaucrats wanted advanced machinery and factories for postwar development but, lacking sufficient foreign currency, forced Western exporters to accept some of the payment in goods. They still do. Developing countries have been pushed to countertrade by the debt crunch. With foreign loans scarce, they trade goods to buy necessary imports and new technology.\nOnce shunned by the United States Government and most corporations, countertrade is being reappraised as a tool to open up untapped markets for American products and to help trim the massive trade deficit. ''Countertrade is everywhere now,'' says Leo G. B. Welt, a Washington-based international trade consultant. ''Countries and corporations are increasingly using countertrade as a marketing tool. It gives you a vehicle for doing business when, otherwise, there would be no business.''\nEstimates of the size of this gray area of world trade range from 8 percent to more than 25 percent, depending on definition and method of calculation. More than 60 governments now encourage countertrade, including such major developing markets as China, India and Brazil. Indonesia has made countertrade mandatory on most government import contracts. Peru has elected goods-for-debt transactions as the main vehicle for paying off its $6 billion in foreign bank loans. As a result, British and American financial institutions, including Chase Manhattan, First Interstate of California and American Express, are scrambling to find buyers for everything from Peruvian fish meal to Peruvian vacations.\nStill, countertrade is frowned upon by global organizations such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund. Critics argue that countertrade is not only economically inefficient but also a convenient cover for unfair trade practices and graft.\n''COUNTERTRADE IS A WORLD for the lateral thinker, the innovative entrepreneur, the unconventional businessman,'' says Gilbert Nockles, trade finance director of the countertrade unit of Britain's Midland Bank, a leader among banks in the field. It seems an ideal milieu for a freelance operator like Doug Lee, bearded, informal and quick-witted.\nThe son of a General Electric Company executive who served as an assistant secretary in the Commerce Department during the Nixon Administration, Lee was born in Salem, Mass., and reared in cities on the Eastern seaboard - ''a different one every three years,'' he says - before attending DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind. He graduated in 1970, after spending his junior year at the London School of Economics.\nRecalling that turbulent era, Lee says he did not want ''to grow up in a corporate structure, as I saw my father do.'' If life as an organization man did not appeal to him, he quickly admits, neither did he want ''to end up in my 30's in some pensione in Italy or Spain with nothing.''\nBecoming a commodities trader appeared to offer a lucrative middle ground. He traded metals in New York for three years but realized that London, the hub of the international metals market, was the place to be. Over the next 12 years, Lee worked for several British trading houses, building a network of contacts.\nHis social circle extended far beyond the trading rooms. In the 70's, his apartment in Chelsea served as a gathering spot for writers, artists and rock musicians with origins in the counterculture and anti-Vietnam War movement.\nLee came to countertrade by the traditional route, metals trading. Many of the big countertrading houses, such as West Germany's Metallgesellschaft A.G., Austria's Allgemeine Waren-Treuhand Aktiengesellschaft and Philipp Brothers of New York, got into the business through trading and financing metals deals with Eastern bloc nations.\nHe acquired his first taste of countertrade four years ago, when Rumania offered aluminum coil in payment for tungsten trioxide. Rumania, like many Eastern European nations, did not have the international marketing organization to handle the sale itself. Thereafter, Lee became increasingly interested in countertrade, finding the intricate fashioning of deals more stimulating than the frenetic daily grind of metals trading. Countertrade also presented an entrepreneurial opportunity. In 1985, Lee began working for himself full time, having set up Intertech Resources Ltd. earlier, to handle a few consulting jobs. The business grew slowly, with Lee straining to keep ahead of the American Express bills.\nCountertrade is not a get-rich-quick business like commodities trading, Lee says, nor is it as treacherous. He describes it as a service business for which he collects fees without investing his own capital. The risk is in the possibility of the deal's collapsing. Deals require ''front-end loading'' in time and energy, he says, and have to be nurtured. But once they get going, they tend to be rolled over, and generate a steady stream of revenue.\nCurrently, Lee has a handful of clients, including Dow Chemical, Rank Xerox, Continental Tire and the countertrade arm of Chase Manhattan. Adhering to the unwritten code of confidentiality that governs the business, he will not name the companies that are involved in his deals.\nAlthough he still trades metals, most of his efforts these days are bent toward countertrade. This year he figures Intertech will handle deals valued at $25 million on which he will collect fees of 1 to 10 percent, although usually toward the lower end of that range.\nTo cope with the increased business, last spring Lee hired two experienced traders, Gordon Davidson, a metals specialist with aviation expertise, and Yvonne Tallantire, a dealer in so-called soft commodities. Tallantire has been involved in trading chemicals in China for frozen vegetables. Intertech Resources markets the snow peas, water chestnuts and mushrooms to such European food companies as pizza chains.\nIntertech Resources occupies an unpretentious office on the fifth floor of a converted Victorian residence overlooking Hanover Square in London's fashionable West End. The building's antique cage elevator is shielded from replacement by a historic preservation order. Riding it is the slowest-moving minute and a half in Lee's day. For countertraders, work is usually a matter of juggling several marathon deals at once, keeping in touch with locations spread across a series of continents and time zones by means of telephone, telex and facsimile machine. Frequent travel is a given. To Lee, airports are a second home. He flew 200 times last year, logging 200,000 miles, the equivalent of circling the globe eight times. ''My travel agent loves me,'' Lee says. ''He calls me up for advice.'' Lee travels mostly to places like Bucharest, Skopje, Zagreb and Guangzhou, a far cry from the luxury hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants of the international business circuit. He has learned to welcome the sight of lizards scurrying up the walls of a hotel room in provincial India or China because, he says, ''they're working for you, eating the insects.''\nIn Rumania, Lee never conducts business in his hotel room; he is sure it is bugged. On more than one occasion, he has been tailed. He was roughed up during a left-wing demonstration in Istanbul, and some third world taxi drivers have come close to transporting him off a cliff.\nCorporate clients, even those with in-house countertrade units, hire Lee for his technical expertise and his useful contacts. As a freelance operator, he can sometimes move more easily and wheel and deal a bit more than an employee of a large corporation. ''It doesn't matter what bizarre commodity you hit him with, Lee either knows people who can handle it or he can find them in a few hours,'' says Michael Shaddick, an Australia-based countertrade specialist, who has dealt with Lee. ''He has the contacts to get the deal done.''\nKey officials in the national and regional foreign trade organizations of the Soviet bloc know Lee; they answer his telexes and take his telephone calls. ''It's all very personal and there's no replacing the face-to-face contact,'' he says.\nThus, at times, Lee can put together a deal where others fail or get a shipment into or out of a country that a company could not arrange on its own. Last spring, he was called in to rescue a countertrade in Yugoslavia. A major European tire maker had agreed to take payment for tires in the form of zinc oxide, which can be used in tire production. The arrangement was 500 tons of zinc oxide for each shipment of 30,000 tires. ''I was brought in after the deal was signed,'' Lee recalls. ''The meter was running, but no one had ever thought about the packaging problem.'' The tire manufacturer's machinery was made for grappling efficiently with zinc oxide in one-ton polypropylene ''supersacks.'' The Yugoslavian regional corporation used only 55- and 110-pound bags. Lee's assignment was to find a buyer for Yugoslavia's zinc oxide. The large amount was a potential problem, while the matter of the packaging limited its appeal to Western customers. Lee scoured his Eastern bloc contacts and, within three weeks, found a buyer. ''There was only one country that would take that much - the Soviet Union,'' he says. For the countertrader, at least, the planned economies can be extremely efficient because, when a sale is made, they often place huge orders.\nThough countertrading may seem a less hectic activity than sitting in front of a computer screen trading commodities, the pressures of time and complexity are enormous. A typical contract will stipulate that if one party does not pay for goods with goods within a specified time, usually 90 to 180 days, it must pay in international currency. ''You've got to be constantly asking yourself, 'Do they have us or do we have them?' '' Lee says.\nIn the Zimbabwe-Egypt deal, the American company arranged with British banks to set up escrow accounts covering the chemicals sales. So far, two shipments of tobacco worth $3.6 million have been sent from Zimbabwe, reducing that country's account to $4.4 million.\nThe Egyptian escrow account was not so easily reckoned. Shipments have produced only $600,000 in cash to date. Several deals for commodities on Egypt's list fell through. Trades of salt to Brazil and rice and coriander to Singapore foundered on problems of import licenses and shipping costs; textiles bound for the United States were snagged by quota restrictions. Although contracts can be rolled over, tempers must be kept in check and care taken not to offend third world customers with repeated rejection of their offerings.\nWhen Lee completes trades of Egyptian steel to Taiwan, Singapore and India for dollars - deals he has been working on - the company will have received $13 million in cash. But more than two years will have elapsed before he secures the final payment on the $20 million deal.\nOccasionally, the countertrader becomes, in effect, part of the state planning mechanism. In one ongoing program, Lee is taking computer floppy diskettes out of Bulgaria. The state manufacturer is producing five-and-one-quarter-inch floppies. To meet a shift in the world market to smaller diskettes compatible with the new generation of I.B.M. computers, Lee is advising them to gear up for production of a three-and-a-half-inch size. ''If I can teach them how to make their product more marketable, then I'm doing a lot more for that country than by just trading something with them,'' Lee observes.\nEVEN THOSE WHO ARE CONcerned about the practice agree that countertrade performs an economically beneficial role by supplying some nations with scarce materials, marketing and manufacturing skills. ''Countertrade can be an efficient way of overcoming handicaps and distortions in economies that are rigidly controlled,'' says Michel Kostecki, an economist with GATT in Geneva. ''That is why one must be careful about condemning countertrade generally and, instead, look at it on a pragmatic case-by-case basis.''\nCountertrade comes in many forms, from a straightforward swap of goods to a ''buyback,'' as, for example, when China agrees to buy a television-tube factory from a Japanese manufacturer, but only on the condition that the seller takes part of the payment in television tubes produced by the plant. ''Offsets'' are increasingly required to sell arms and commercial aircraft, even in deals involving Western countries. Two years ago, Britain agreed to buy six airborne warning and control aircraft from the Boeing Company for $1.3 billion only after the American manufacturer promised to farm out $1.30 worth of work on various projects to British subcontractors for every $1 spent on its Awacs.\nThere is one common thread to countertrade: Buyers are using their purchasing power to guarantee markets for their exports. Critics say countertrade deals are a regressive step toward ''bilateralism'' - restrictive, two-way trade - instead of multilateral free trade. So GATT, the World Bank, the I.M.F. and other official bodies view countertrade as a practice that tends to dampen growth.\nCompanies invariably tack a premium onto the price of the products they trade to countries that insist on paying with goods because the sellers expect to be forced to resell what they take in exchange at cut-rate prices. As a result, the country pays above-market prices for its imports while its exports are being dumped on international markets.\nBECAUSE COUNTERTRADE deals are less visible than cash transactions, it is easier to hide such unfair trade practices as subsidies and dumping, as well as illicit payments and graft.\nA countertrader like Lee, with American clients, must operate in the gray area between pragmatism and illegality. One delicate matter is the use of agents. ''There are some countries where you simply won't get in to see the key people without hiring the right agent,'' Lee says. ''American companies may not like it, but it's a fact of life.''\nHe stresses that he would never knowingly hand out a bribe, but admits that agents' commissions (typically, 1 to 5 percent) do open the door to corruption. ''But if the agent gives a kickback to some government official, I don't know about it,'' he says.\nIn Washington, the regulatory climate concerning overseas payments seems to be easing. The trade bill that President Reagan signed last month includes amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that contain exceptions to the ban on payments and gifts to officials to influence a business decision. And there are other signs that attitudes are moderating as countertrade grows.\n''The United States is at a turning point, where companies are deciding whether they are going to make the investment and effort to be competitive globally,'' says Fred Howell, an international economist at the Commerce Department. Last March, Commerce Secretary C. William Verity Jr. told Congress that barter was ''essential'' to America's drive to boost exports. More countertrade was likely, Verity predicted, ''for the simple reason that if we increase exports, as we hope, a lot of developing countries are going to have to pay for them and there is a limit to their liquidity.'' The 1988 trade bill calls for the setting up of an Office of Barter within the Commerce Department to examine how companies can exploit countertrade opportunities.\nIncreasingly, American corporations are doing just that. Dozens of America's biggest companies, such as McDonnell Douglas, Caterpillar, Fluor and Pepsico, as well as the banks, have in-house countertrade teams. But the business can be risky for the unskilled and overly ambitious, as the experience of Sears World Trade proved. The retailing giant set up a countertrade arm in 1982 with a staff of 1,000. After four years of red ink, the subsidiary was shut down.\n''Countertrade is a more difficult and higher-risk business,'' says Charles J. Borg, global manager of the countertrading arm Dow Chemical set up in Zurich four years ago. ''But it does exist. You can't ignore half the world and have any genuine global growth strategy. And if you want to grow, you have to help them.''\nPerhaps the most innovative bank deals are the debt-for-export programs under way in Peru. The banks are trying to recover some of the $6 billion they lent to Lima by taking out such items as shellfish, asparagus, onions, garlic, copper wire and wood products. For every $3 generated by such sales, the banks will keep $1 and give the rest to Peru.\nBritain's Midland Bank signed the first such debt-for-export deal in 1987 and began marketing Peruvian goods earlier this year. ''At the time, there was some debate as to whether this is the sort of thing banks should do,'' notes Gilbert Nockles of Midland. ''But now, everybody and his brother is down there trying to do the same thing.''\nLee is currently working on a few proposals in Brazil, another country with crippling bank debt. He hopes to double Intertech's volume of countertrade deals by entering new markets like Brazil as well as by increasing activity in Eastern Europe and Asia. But there is one commodity he refuses to handle - a carryover from his youth in the counterculture. ''I get offered arms all the time, but I never touch them,'' he says. ''It's a moral thing for me. I just won't.''\nLee derives an income from his business ''in the low six figures,'' he says. It affords him a comfortable style of life. Divorced from an English wife, he tries to spend every other weekend with their three children, ages 11, 14 and 16. He has a house in the London borough of Chiswick and belongs to two private clubs, Groucho's, a hangout for people in the arts and advertising, and the Royal Automobile Club. ''I could never get into the real English clubs,'' he says cheerfully. He has ample firsthand knowledge of the city's night life, though he insists that his pace has slowed. He now tries to begin his days in London at 6:30 A.M., working out on a Nautilus machine.\nHe is also studying Mandarin, building on a linguistic capability he describes as ''restaurant French, German and Spanish.'' For Lee, it's strictly business: ''I want to pick up enough to be seen as making the effort in those Chinese deals.''"
