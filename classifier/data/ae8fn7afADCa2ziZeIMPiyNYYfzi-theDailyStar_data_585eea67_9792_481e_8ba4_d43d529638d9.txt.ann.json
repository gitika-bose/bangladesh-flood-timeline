  "text": "Date Published:2019-10-01 00:00:00      \nThis year, around 98,688 families were directly affected by the floods, while 13.60 lakh families were affected partially. Moreover, 34,999 houses were damaged completely and 5.47 lakh were damaged partially. Reportedly, relief materials for the affected people were also inadequate, although the government might have made sufficient allotment. These people are still struggling to find a livelihood and rebuild their houses. And as the flood water recedes, river erosion has started taking its toll in many areas, destroying schools and homesteads of people. While the state minister for the ministry of disaster management and relief has termed TIB's allegations as baseless, the fact remains that many of the flood victims have been left with no relief at all. We think the government should move away from its denial mode and conduct investigations into the allegations made by the corruption watchdog. The institutional limitations in the government's planning of relief distribution, rehabilitation programmes, emergency response and overall preparedness for such a disaster should be addressed properly for better management of floods in the future. Also, stringent action should be taken against those, including the public representatives, involved in corruption."
