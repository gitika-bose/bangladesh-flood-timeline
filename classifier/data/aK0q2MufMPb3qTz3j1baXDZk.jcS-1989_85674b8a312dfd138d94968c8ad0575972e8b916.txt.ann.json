  "text": "IN THE NATION; Reality at the Summit\n1989-07-14T05:00:00.000Z\nThe earth's capacity to support a rapidly expanding population is declining ominously. So the $2.25 billion Japan is offering the third world for environmental purposes is too little and dangerously near too late.\nNevertheless, Japan's proposal might point the Paris economic summit meeting in the right direction -toward environmental and population dangers that threaten humanity's well-being more certainly than nuclear war.\nThe rest of the more than $40 billion Japan offers in grants and loans to aid economic development, for example, will be largely wasted if current population trends continue. President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt made the point succinctly to Alan Riding of The New York Times:\n''We [ Egyptians ] increase by about one million and a half every year. It threatens to choke all our efforts in all fields and quashes all hope of growth, production and development.''\nEgypt's plight is an old but still shocking story in the third world. Mr. Riding detailed it: a 2.7 percent annual population growth rate, a declining death rate, 53 million people now dependent on the 4 percent of Egyptian land that's arable.\nIf Mr. Mubarak's projection is correct, that will be something like 70 million people by the end of this century (only 11 years from now); and the amount of Egyptian land available to produce food will have declined further as an expanding populace absorbs it for dwellings and businesses.\nEgypt's problem, except for its restricted strip of productive land along the Nile, is by no means the world's worst. Over all, the global population - which doubled from 2.5 to 5 billion between 1950 and 1987 - is expected to expand by another billion mouths to be fed by the year 2000.\nIt took more than a century for world population to double from 1.25 billion to 2.5 billion in 1950. So the extraordinary ''momentum of population growth'' achieved in recent decades ''ensures that human numbers cannot start to decline as a result of reduced fertility in less than half a century'' from now. That's the conclusion of ''Global Change and Carrying Capacity,'' a paper by Paul R. Ehrlich and associates of the Stanford University Institute for Population and Resource Studies.\nThe combination of continued population growth and the threatened ''global warming'' - an average worldwide temperature rise of 3 to 4 degrees Centigrade - is viewed in the institute study as drastically increasing the possibility of inadeqate food supplies in coming decades. A decrease in water availability for major grain-growing areas, limiting harvests, is one obvious consequence of changes in climate that are projected to occur more swiftly than ever in recorded history.\nShifting climate belts will require adjustments in irrigation and drainage systems, at a possible cost of $200 billion worldwide. Planting drought-resistant grains will result in reduced yields, in some cases less than half that of the usual yield of corn. Northward migration of favorable temperature/rainfall belts will shift grain production to areas of Canada and the Soviet Union where harvests will be constrained by thin and infertile soils.\nAlready, the world's arable land is declining each year by an area the size of Colorado - forcing those who once tilled it to move into urban slums or to use up other marginal or forested land. This process accelerates with population growth; and deforestation caused by growing numbers of people who cut down trees for fuel or building supplies, or to clear land for farming, in turn causes erosion, drought and higher temperatures.\nThe institute report quotes authorities who believe ''recent catastrophic flooding in Bangladesh can be attributed in part to massive deforestation in the Himalayas, a phenomenon closely tied to population growth.''\nThe current loss of food-producing areas will increase with global warming because of the consequent sea-level rise expected to reach 1.4 to 2.2 meters by the end of the next century. This will flood agricultural land and wetlands that support fisheries (much of the Florida Everglades will be lost), salinize water aquifers, and make large areas vulnerable to storm damage.\nThe food problems resulting from global warming are ''acute,'' the institute paper warns, ''since leaders in the rich nations have largely failed to realize the magnitude of the changes necessary if the warming is to be sufficiently slowed.''\nThose leaders are meeting in Paris. What else do they have to talk about that's half as threatening or immediate?"
