  "text": "At Least 520 Are Dead In Bangladesh Floods\n1988-09-05T05:00:00.000Z\nThe official death toll in devastating monsoon floods in Bangladesh reached at least 520 today as the stranded and homeless awaited emergency aid. Officials warned that thousands could die before help arrived.\nThey said the number of known deaths from floods, snakebites and disease rose to a minimum of 520; however, unofficial estimates put the toll at more than 1,000.\nDoctors warned that thousands of families taking shelter in relief camps in Dhaka, huddling on river embankments or clinging to their flooded homes, are threatened by starvation and disease.\nAs the flooding disaster grew worse, pledges of foreign aid continued. Japan, responding to an appeal for international assistance, pledged $13 million today, Bangladesh's press agency said. Pakistan, the United States, Britain and Australia have already promised nearly $1.5 million in rice and cash.\nOfficials here point out, though, that supplies from abroad cannot reach the country in quantities until Dhaka airport can be reopened. It has been closed to international flights since Friday when the runway was flooded."
