Apon studied in Gorok Mandal Govt School. Fulbari police station officer-in-charge Rajib Kumar Rai confirmed the matter. The Union Ward 1 UP Member Anwar Hossain quoting the deceased's family members said: \"A week back Apon wanted a mobile phone, which his father was unwilling to buy because of his son being a child, and also that he could not afford to buy it for financial reasons.\" \"But the father promised the boy that he would buy him one. As it was taking a lot of time. The boy became mad with his parents and committed suicide,\" Anwar added. The OC said: \"We are investigating the matter, but primarily we suspect it is as a suicide. An unnatural death case is waiting to be filed at the station.\""
