  "text": "Date Published:2019-07-29 00:00:00      \nFair price has brought smile to vegetable farmers in flood free areas of Sadar, Nageshwari, Bhurungamari and Rajarhat upazilas. They grow different types of vegetables like pointed gourd, pumpkin, aubergine and bottle gourd in Kharif-1 (March-July) season, said Bimal Kumar De, sub-assistant agricultural officer of Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in Kurigram. Nine upazilas in the district have been affected by flood early this month and the floodwater started receding from the areas in the last couple of days. But the growers in eight unions of the four upazilas still continued harvesting the vegetables as floodwater could not enter their fields situated in highland areas. The agricultural officer said around 4,038 hectares of land in the district have been brought under vegetable cultivation this year. As the flood has affected 3,739 hectares out of 4,038 hectares of fields, vegetable prices have shot up, he said.  Saidur Rahman of Kaley village in Belgachha union of Sadar upazila said \"I have been cultivating vegetable in Kharif-1 season for the last four years and earning good profit.\" He has cultivated pointed gourd on 12 decimals of land spending Tk 6,000 this year, said the farmer. \"I've already sold pointed gourds at Tk 10,000,\" said Saidur, adding that he is expecting to earn Tk 16,000 more from sale of the vegetable. Grower Rezaul Islam of Sanwashi village in Halokhana union under Sadar upazila said he cultivated aubergine on 10 decimals of land and pointed gourd on 22 decimals of land this season. \"I have already sold the vegetables at Tk 31,000. I'm also expecting to earn Tk 43,000 more in the next two months,\" said Rezaul. They are getting good profits from the vegetable farming this season every year, he said. Another farmer Akbar Ali of Chhinaye Haat village in Chhinaye union of Rajarhat upazila said he cultivated aubergine on 40 decimals of land and pumpkin on 16 decimals of land spending Tk 19,000 in May this year. \"I'm expecting to earn Tk 42,000 from sale of the vegetables in the next two months,\" he said. Kurigram DAE Additional Deputy Director (Plant Protection) Sasty Chandra Roy said there are many vegetable growers in Rajarhat and Sadar upazilas and they are known as adapted farmers, who cultivate different types of vegetables during this period of the year, and get a good profit. In the rainy season, extra care is needed for pollination, he said."
