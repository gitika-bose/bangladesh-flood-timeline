  "text": "Date Published:2019-07-07 00:00:00      \nErosion by the Jamuna has taken a serious turn in Bhuapur upazila as the river sees a sudden rise in water level due to onrush of water from the upstream in the last one month. Due to the sudden erosion many dwelling houses as well as a vast tract of croplands at different villages under Govindsi, Gabsara and Arjuna unions in the upazila were devoured within a few weeks. The worst affected villages are Khanurbari, Kostapara and Bhalkutia under Govindasi union as over 100 dwelling houses and a vast tract of croplands were devoured by the river in the last few days. The erosion affected people have taken shelter on different roads and other's houses. Meanwhile, demanding steps to protect their villages from the dreadful erosion the affected people, living alongside the river, formed a human chain at Kostapara village on Friday. Several hundred riverside people, carrying placards inscribed with different slogans, took part in the rally. Locals alleged that illegal extraction of sand from different places along the river using powerful dredgers is one of the main reasons behind the erosion. Local influential people, having political clout, extracting sand from the river and sell those from over a dozen sand landing stations within eight kilometre areas stretching from Bangabandhu Bridge East Cantonment area to Govindasi Ghat area, they added. Last year, erosion by the Jamuna devoured numerous dwellings and a vast tract of croplands at Arjuna, Bharua, Kuthir Boira, Jagatpura, Tarai and Balarampur villages in Bhuapur upazila and Gorilabari and Beltia village under Gohaliabari union in adjacent Kalihati upazila. Abdul Mazid of Kostapara village said over 100 dwellings and a vast tract of croplands at three villages under Govindasi union were devoured by the river in the last one week. Although the swelling river has been devouring houses, croplands, rural markets, schools, madrasas and other establishments for the last eight years, no step has been taken to protect the areas, he said. Tangail WDB Executive Engineer Sirajul Islam said Geo bags should have been dumped in the affected areas, but they could not do it due to shortage of Geo bags. Away in Netrakona, a newly constructed embankment along the Mohadeo river in Kalmakanda upazila collapsed within five months of its construction, affecting hundreds of families of at least 25 villages under different unions, reports our Mymensingh correspondent. Water Development Board (WDB) built the 285-metre-long embankment recently at a cost of Tk 17 lakh. Netrakona WDB. Sub Assistant Engineer Ibrahim Khalilullah said the construction work of the dyke was conducted on an emergency basis as there was no scope to start a fresh project to rise of water level in the river. \"We are taking preparation to build a 300-metre embankment in Chikontop and Baruakona areas in the coming dry season with an estimated cost of Tk one crore,\" Engineer Khalilullah said, adding that the dam will be built with concrete blocks and guide walls. Contractor Fazlur Rahman, who got the work order, said the embankment collapsed due to strong current and the recent flash flood. Refuting the allegation of substandard work, the contractor said he completed the work as per the work schedule using bamboo, logs and sand bags. Mentionable, about 3,000 families under Rongchhati, Kharnoi and Lengura unions in the upazila have been affected in the recent flash flood."
