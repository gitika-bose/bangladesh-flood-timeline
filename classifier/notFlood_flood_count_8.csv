Nusrat's family to this day remain under police protection as they continue to receive threats from prime accused Sirajuddaula's cohorts and followers A year had passed since the murder of Nusrat Jahan Rafi, an alim examinee of Sonagazi Islamia Senior Fazil Madrasa in Feni. But her family still awaits implementation of the verdict against the accused in her murder case. On April 6 last, the 18-year-old was set on fire in broad daylight on the roof of the madrasa by people loyal to principal Sirajuddaula, when she refused to withdraw a sexual harassment case her family filed against Sirajuddaula.  After battling for life for four days, she succumbed to her critical burn injuries at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital on April 10, which sparked nationwide outrage and public demand for swift justice against the perpetrators.  On October 24, following a trial all 16 accused were proven guilty, and a Feni court awarded them death sentence under Section 4(1)/30 of the Woman and Children Repression Prevention Act 2000. However, Nusrat's family till this day remain under police protection as they continue to receive threats from Sirajuddaula's cohorts and followers. ""I cannot sleep, thinking of the pain Nusrat had gone through when she was burnt alive,"" said Nusrat's mother, Shirin Akhter. ""We were happy with the verdict and we know the whole country is with us, still I don't understand why the sentence is not being carried out yet?"" she asks with agony. Nusrat's brother Mahmudul Hasan said they constantly receive threats and also have been targeted in social media by the wellwishers of the convicts ever since the murder took place. He said: ""My sister gave her life to fight for her honour and it seems like it has no end."" The Public Prosecutor of the court Adv Hafez Ahmed said the prompt prosecution of the case could not have been possible without Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's direct involvement and her assurance of providing proper justice to the girl. ""We are satisfied with the verdict. But the ongoing trial should soon be addressed and justice should be given to the family as they are waiting for long,"" the lawyer added. The convicts are prime accused SM Sirajuddaula, who orchestrated Nusrat's murder, Nur Uddin, Shahdat Hossain Shamim, Maksud Alam, Saifur Rahman Md Zobayer, Sakhawat Hossain Jabed, Abdul Kader, Absar Uddin, Kamrun Nahar Moni, Umme Sultana Popy, Abdur Rahim Sharif, Eftekhar Uddin Rana, Imran Hossain Mamun, Mohammad Shamim, Ruhul Amin, and Mohiuddin Shakil."

8,"TV Review; 'Politics of Food,' on Channel 13
1988-01-06T05:00:00.000Z
''THE Politics of Food'' examines worldwide hunger and finds it's the fault of the West. Western creditors and governments, particularly the United States, have joined to choke off world food supplies. The two-hour documentary, on Channel 13 at 10 o'clock tonight, is provocative, but it doesn't have much breadth.
The documentary - produced by an international consortium headed by Britain's Yorkshire Television, and narrated by Martin Sheen -visits Minnesota, Brazil, the Sudan, Bangladesh and India. Dispossessed farmers in Minnesota, it finds, have conterparts in the third world; they are all burdened by debt, manipulated by creditors and forced off the land by big business.
Consequently, much of the world goes hungry, even though there is ample food. The world distribution process, the documentary says, is faulty. Grain and other surpluses pile up in the West, while millions of people starve to death or suffer from malnutrition.
The documentary is persuasive about this. How could it not be? The West does indeed have food surpluses, and much of the world does starve. Why does this happen? The documentary suggests that a principal villain is the World Bank, which forces debtor nations to grow cash crops, rather than food that will feed their people.
Nonetheless, the documentary does seem a shade simplistic. Revolutions and wars, one thinks, have done at least as much to disrupt third-world food supplies as bureaucrats in Washington or on Wall Street. At the same time, ''The Politics of Food'' is ambivalent about centralized economies. Are they good or bad? The documentary wants it both ways.
Thus it pleads for family farmers the world over; it argues for rural economies, where governments and banks stay off the farmers' backs. That's decentralization. On the other hand, the only bright spot the documentary seems able to find is a region in India that makes grants to the poor, practices land reform and regulates food prices. That's not decentralization.
On television, however, the region is prettily filmed. Mr. Sheen says the inhabitants even elect Communists to office, and that the system is such that ''everything is shared more equally.'' Well, perhaps, but surely world hunger is more complicated than that.
The documentary concludes with a warning about ''antidemocratic structures.'' It says they ''are the main cause of hunger.'' That's sufficiently vague to include many things, but whatever they are, they all have their roots in the West. ''The Politics of Food'' is interesting, but it never looks beyond its own horizon."

Devotees suffer due to inadequate vehicles, 2021 Ijtema schedule fixed Participated by hundreds of thousands of Muslim devotees, including 2,000 foreigners, the opening phase of the 55th Biswa Ijtema concluded with the Akheri Munajat along the banks of Turag River in Tongi. Maulana Zubair Hassan, the imam of Kakrail mosque in Dhaka, conducted the Akheri Munajat at 11am, praying for the country's welfare and continued growth, and peace for the Muslim Ummah in their worldly life and thereafter. The Munajat, offered both in Bangla and Urdu, lasted for nearly 45 minutes amid heightened security measures. Women participate in Akheri Munajat of Bishwa Ijtema on the banks of the Turag River, in Tongi, on Sunday, January 12, 2020 | Rajib Dhar/Dhaka TribunePakistani alem Maulana Ziaul Haq delivered a sermon after Fajr prayers, followed by a special speech by Indian Islamic scholar Ibrahim Dewla on different aspects, including Imaan and Akhlaq, in the light of the holy Quran and the Hadiths.  The first phase of the annual congregation -- the second largest of its kind after Hajj -- on the outskirts of Dhaka, was mainly participated by the followers of Maulana Zubair, the head of Tabligh Jamaat in Bangladesh.  The second phase of the Ijtema, spanning three days is scheduled to begin on January 17 at the same venue, after a four-day break. Followers of Indian alem Maulana Saad Kandhalvi will participate in the closing phase of the annual congregation, where he will conduct the Akheri Munajat.  Muslim devotees from different walks of life, in great numbers, started thronging the Ijtema venue from the dawn, in order to attend the Munajat. Failing to board a vehicle on the way to the Ijtema grounds, many opted to commute on foot.  The venue was brimming soon after the Fajr prayers, with roads and lanes leading to the grounds packed with crowds of devotees despite the cold weather. Even parts of the Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway were occupied by devotees joining the Munajat.   Train passengers participate in Akheri Munajat of Bishwa Ijtema on the banks of the Turag River, in Tongi, on Sunday, January 12, 2020 | Rajib Dhar/Dhaka TribuneMoreover, the rooftops of residential and industrial buildings around the venue were also packed.  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, accompanied by her younger sister Sheikh Rehana, also joined the Akheri Munajat from her official residence Ganabhaban in Dhaka, in the presence of  State Minister for Religious Affairs, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah. Educational institutions, factories, kitchen markets, shopping malls and offices located in Uttara, Tongi and Gazipur were closed due to the huge rush of people centering the Akheri Munajat.     In order to manage the growing number of devotees coming from home and abroad, the holy congregation is being held in two phases since 2011. Devotees outnumbering transportation vehicles, causing misery Traffic from Airport Road in the capital to Joydevpur Chowrasta, Mirer Bazar of Gazipur Sadar upazila to Tongi, Abdullahpur up until the Bypass Road were suspended for nearly six hours since the Fajr prayers. However, the movement of vehicles started around 12 noon, after the Munajat ended, causing a large number of crowds to pour into nearby roads and highways.   Very few vehicles operated in proportion to the huge crowd leaving the Ijtema premises for their destinations outside Tongi, leading to immense suffering for the devotees. They were left walking towards their destined locations. Cashing in on the situation, transport workers charged exorbitant fares from the devotees.    They were charging up to Tk100 from Azampur, Uttara to Motijheel, Sayedabad, Gulistan, Sadarghat, Azimpur, New Market and Gabtoli. Similar fares were being charged by the driver's assistant of a BRTC bus, for the same distance.   In addition, a large number of motorbikes added to the troubles of devotees leaving the Ijtema premises.  Meanwhile, Bangladesh Railway arranged a special rail service engaging 16 trains to carry passengers to and from Tongi, on the occasion, as it does every year. Plus, every inter-city train crossing Tongi Railway Station stopped there for five minutes.    Schedule set for next year's Bishwa Ijtema The faction of Tabligh Jamaat, led by Maulana Zubair, has fixed the dates for the two phases of Ijtema to be held in January 2021.  Md Mejbah Uddin, a leader of the faction, informed reporters that the first phase of the three-day-long congregation will start on January 8, while the second and last one will be held from January 15. Prior to that, a five-day Jor Ijtema, a gathering organized ahead of the two-phase Bishwa Ijtema, will be held from November 27 this year.  Dowry-free mass marriage  Unlike last year, this year's first phase of Ijtema ended with a dowry-free mass marriage ceremony. On Saturday, the second day of the three-day phase, 101 couples were married without dowry.  The brides and grooms were listed for the event on Thursday, upon their consent.   The second mass marriage is scheduled for the second day of the closing phase of the annual gathering.  A mass marriage is held on the second day of each phase of the Ijtema every year, but it did not take place in 2019 following a Tabligh Jamaat factional feud. "

20,"THE WORLD; Why India Is Still Failing To Stop Its Population Surge
1989-07-09T05:00:00.000Z
WHEN India's Ministry of Health submitted its annual report to be considered in framing the country's 1989-90 budget, it included a cry for help. ''Population control can no longer be the responsibility of one ministry or department,'' it said. ''The entire planning process must be geared toward controlling population.''
More than four decades after independence, India, along with its neighbors Pakistan and Bangladesh, has not been able to control the relentless climb in the numbers of its people. Recent reports project that India, with at least 810 million people now, will pass one billion by the end of the century or soon after. If Beijing maintains its current population policies, India could overtake China as the most populous nation before the middle of the next century.
India has brought its annual population growth rate down to about 2.1 percent, compared with 2.4 percent in Bangladesh and 3.2 percent or higher in Pakistan. But while improvements in agriculture have left Indians statistically able to feed themselves, population remains a source of grave concern in a country where food is not evenly distributed, forests are being razed for firewood or furniture, and good drinking water is scarce.
Indian experts say large families are fostered by low literacy, high infant mortality, inadequate health care and a dearth of sustained information and follow-up services.
''The illiterate peasant does not perceive the danger in numbers, in crossing the one billion mark,'' says India's leading demographer, Ashish Bose, who has done 30 years of field work in villages.
''One of the major failures in India has been the lack of communication between our planners and policy makers and the masses,'' Mr. Bose, head of the Population Research Center of Delhi University's Institute of Economic Growth, said in an interview. ''We do not know how to communicate with illiterate people.'' Ads and Sterilization
Population growth and fertility rates leveled off during the 1970's, and today Indian women still have on average of four to five children. Almost all efforts have been concentrated in the hands of the central Government working through local health authorities, an approach that some experts now question because the country is so culturally diverse.
Radio and television advertising and information from community health centers bring to all India the message that small families are healthier and happier. But this apparently has not been enough. In Rajasthan, with India's fastest-growing population, a survey found that 97 percent of women who refuse birth control were well informed on family planning programs.
Sterilization accounts for at least 90 percent of the successes. Intrauterine devices are a distant second, and some pills and condoms are distributed. Many sterilizations are carried out in temporary ''camps'' where critics say unsanitary and impersonal conditions are a deterrent. Cash or other rewards are offered for being sterilized - up to $12.50 per person - but villagers say some people turn up several times to collect them, distorting the statistics.
Successive Indian Governments have recognized the population problem since independence in 1947, when the population was 342 million. In 1966, family planning was given a department of its own within the Ministry of Health, a step some demographers say was a mistake, since it separated population control from the general Government overview of development. In the mid-1970's, the family-planning drive was endowed with coercive powers that were used by supporters of the late Sanjay Gandhi, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's son and adviser and the brother of Rajiv Gandhi, the present Prime Minister. After widespread reports of forced sterilizations, Indians rebelled.
In 1977, the country's four most populous states voted heavily against Indira Gandhi on this issue, and the Congress Party suffered its first election defeat. The next Government, under Moraji Desai, erased the words ''family planning'' from the books, renaming the program ''family welfare,'' a name still in use.
But Indian experts say it was not only the Sanjay Gandhi program that set back population control. In the 1950's and 60's, the country's priorities were on industrial development, and its limited resources went into huge energy projects, steel mills and the production of consumer goods to replace imports.
''If we had concentrated more on the software, the human resources element - female literacy, education - in the 1950's and 60's,'' said Sam Pitroda, a science adviser to Rajiv Gandhi, ''we would have a population of about 600 million now.'' A Grave Mistake
Mr. Bose said India made a catastrophic mistake in the 1960's when it accepted Western advice about introducing birth-control technology but didn't put enough effort into education and cultural change. Hundreds of thousands of Lippes loops, an intrauterine device, were inserted and large-scale sterilization began. Dirty equipment and a lack of follow-up advice to women led to rampant infections.
Over the years, offers of cash and other incentives were introduced for those willing to undergo sterilization, a tactic Mr. Bose calls ''madness.'' Today, 85 percent of sterilizations are done on women, many of whom already have three or four children.
Finally, Mr. Bose said, bureaucrats were taught to set numerical targets, which over time proved of little use because official figures measuring performance are manipulated to meet the targets.
''We must move away from cold calculations of aggregate numbers to people,'' Mr. Bose said, arguing for enforcement of a 1978 law prohibiting women below the age of 18 from marrying and a change in emphasis in family planning programs so they will aim more at young married couples as they begin having families.
''Looking back,'' he said, ''high tech, money and the bureaucracy -all three have failed.''"

Torture instruments found inside the torture cell of Rajhsahi Polytechnic | Dhaka Tribune The building is situated on the west side of the pond into which Principal Farid Uddin Ahmed was thrown by some Chhatra League leaders and activists on Saturday. The recovered metal rods and pipes were later handed over to the police. Top leaders of Chhatra League's RPI unit and Rajshahi metropolitan unit were unavailable for comments regarding the torture cell until the filing of this report at midnight. DTE Director and probe team Convener SM Ferdous Alam said they would submit their findings within three days. He declined going into the details regarding the torture cell, but said: ""All of our findings will be in our probe report."" Principal Farid said he also heard about the torture cell of Chhatra League. ""But no student or teacher ever lodged any formal complaint out of fear."" The room in Rajshahi Polytechnic where the torture cell is situated | Dhaka Tribune Allegations Many have also accused Chhatra league leaders and activists of extorting students, threatening and assaulting teachers, publicly humiliating female students who rejected their advances, and sitting for exams without attending classes, among other misdeeds. The allegations were made during a demonstration of RPI students, teachers and staff on Sunday. They formed a human chain in front of RPI around 11am on Rajshahi-Naogaon Highway, placing a number of demands to the institute authorities. The demands include permanent expulsion of those involved in the assault on the principal, bringing them to book, ban on politics on campus, ban on outsiders' entry in RPI, ensuring safety of general students and suitable environment for education. Agitated students also tore down many banners of Chhatra League leaders and activists inside the campus during their hour-long demonstration. However, Chhatra League's RPI unit President Mehedi Hasan Regan rejected the allegations levelled against them, including embezzlement of money taken from around 4,000 students -- Tk300 each -- for a freshers' reception that was never organized. He claimed that the teachers and students were lying. ""We didn't embezzle that money. The department heads have the money meant for the freshers' reception,"" he claimed. Regan said he was not on campus when Principal Farid was assaulted. ""We saw in the CCTV camera footage [of the assault] that Chhatra League's [RPI unit] Joint General Secretary Kamal Hossain Sourav was present there only. ""No one else from Chhatra League was there. We are looking into this too and will take organizational action against anyone involved in this,"" he claimed further. Requesting anonymity, many students alleged that Regan and Sourav are very close and they have established a reign of terror on campus by getting involved in different criminal activists. But everyone has been afraid to raise their voice against them, until now. Chhatra League's central committee in Dhaka on Sunday also expelled Sourav from the organization over the assault on the principal and violation of organizational discipline. The organization's Rajshahi metropolitan unit President Rocky Kumar Ghosh also said that they formed a six-member committee to look into the incident. ""Organizational action will be taken against anyone involved."" Case and arrests Principal Farid on Saturday night had filed a case at Chandrima police station, naming eight people and accusing at least 50 unidentified others over the assault. Rajshahi Metropolitan Police Additional Deputy Commissioner Golam Ruhul Kuddus said five RPI students were arrested and sent to court on Sunday for their involvement in the incident. They are Shafi Shahriar, 24, Sohel Rana, 20, Badhon Ray, 19, Ariful Islam, 23, and Ripon Ali, 20. However, police are yet to arrest the Chhatra League men who were named in the case. From the CCTV camera footage, RPI teachers had identified Sourav, Murad, Shanto, Bony, Hasibul Islam, Salman Tony, Habibul and Maruf. Of them, only Sourav and Murad are current students. All of them have gone into hiding, said ADC Kuddus. ""But our detectives are on the case. No one will be spared. We are working to bring all of them to book."""

The website was hacked between late Friday and early Saturday   A government domain page for Manirampur upazila of Jessore district has been recovered after the website was hacked to protest the upazila's AC (Land) punishing elderly men for not wearing masks. A group of hackers named Team Donz claimed responsibility for hacking the website between late Friday and early Saturday. On Friday, a photograph of Manirampur Executive Magistrate and Assistant Commissioner (Land) Sayeema Hasan, taking a photograph of the elderly men holding their ears as punishment for not wearing masks, surfaced on Facebook that generated the criticism of netizens. News of the hacking surfaced on Facebook early Saturday when many users shared a screenshot of the webpage where the photograph of the incident was featured on the website. The hackers replaced the cover photo of the domain page with a photograph of Sayeema punishing the senior citizens. The hackers also added a notice on the noticeboard that read: ""In spite of being a literate person, the assistant commissioner of land acted like an illiterate person,"" which was later removed around 12:20am. Confirming the matter on Saturday afternoon, Jessore district's Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Shafiul Arif said: ""The webpage was hacked and our IT team fixed it at midnight."" The domain page is run under the National Web Portal of Bangladesh (Jatiya Tatthya Batayan). Contacted, Sayeema was not available for comment, despite repeated attempts over the phone. Earlier on Saturday, Sayeema was withdrawn from her workplace after widespread criticism on social media, confirmed Public Administration Secretary Sheikh Yusuf Harun. Punishment gone wrong Following the government's directive for people to stay inside their houses to curb the spread of coronavirus, many government officials and law enforcement agencies have been conducting drives in different areas of the country. A mobile court, led by then executive magistrate Sayeema Hasan, conducted drives in different areas of Manirampur on Friday afternoon. During the drive, she asked the three elderly men, including a van driver and a vegetable vendor, at Chinatola Bazar, to hold their ears in public as punishment. She also captured photographs of the punishment. Her photograph capturing moments with the humiliated elderly individuals later went viral on social media and drew significant criticism."

The patient, who revealed his identity this week as Adam Castillejo, 40, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003  A second patient has been cured of HIV after undergoing stem cell transplant treatment, doctors said Tuesday, after finding no trace of infection 30 months after he stopped traditional treatment. The so-called ""London Patient"", a cancer sufferer originally from Venezuela, made headlines last year when researchers at the University of Cambridge reported they had found no trace of the AIDS-causing virus in his blood for 18 months. Ravindra Gupta, lead author of the study published in The Lancet HIV, said the new test results were ""even more remarkable"" and likely demonstrated the patient was cured. ""We've tested a sizeable set of sites that HIV likes to hide in and they are all pretty much negative for an active virus,"" Gupta told AFP. The patient, who revealed his identity this week as Adam Castillejo, 40, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and had been on medication to keep the disease in check since 2012. Later that year, he was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a deadly cancer. In 2016 he underwent a bone marrow transplant to treat blood cancer, receiving stem cells from donors with a genetic mutation present in less than one percent of Europeans that prevents HIV from taking hold. He becomes only the second person to be cured of HIV after American Timothy Brown, known as the ""Berlin Patient"", recovered from HIV in 2011 following similar treatment. Viral tests of Castillejo's cerebral fluid, intestinal tissue and lymphoid tissue more than two years after stopping antiretroviral treatment showed no active infection. Gupta said the tests uncovered HIV ""fossils"" -- fragments of the virus that were now incapable of reproducing, and were therefore safe. ""We'd expect that,"" he said. ""It's quite hard to imagine that all trace of a virus that infects billions of cells was eliminated from the body."" Ethical dilemma  Researchers cautioned that the breakthrough did not constitute a generalised cure for HIV, which leads to nearly one million deaths every year. Castillejo's treatment was a ""last resort"" as his blood cancer would likely have killed him without intervention, according to Gupta. The Cambridge doctor said that there were ""several other"" patients who had undergone similar treatment but who were less far along in their remission. ""There will probably be more but they will take time,"" he said. Researchers are currently weighing up whether or not patients suffering from drug-resistant forms of HIV might be eligible for stem cell transplants in future, something Gupta said would require careful ethical consideration. ""You'd have to weigh up the fact that there's a 10-percent mortality rate from doing a stem-cell transplant against what the risk of death would be if we did nothing,"" he said. Commenting on The Lancet study, Sharon Lewin, an infectious disease expert at the University of Melbourne, said the findings could provide comfort to patients. But she advised caution. ""Given the large number of cells sampled here and the absence of any intact virus, is the London patient cured?"" she said. ""Unfortunately in the end, only time will tell."""

""We'll have a virtual form of our Prime Minister's presence and India as well through him,"" Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told a group of visiting Bangladeshi journalists at Hyderabad House in Delhi on Wednesday. Indian Prime Minister Modi was scheduled to visit Bangladesh on March 17 to attend the birth centenary celebrations, but postponed it due to the coronavirus outbreak. Following the detection of coronavirus cases for the first time in Bangladesh, the year-long programs chalked out to celebrate the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during the ""Mujib Borsho"" have been rescheduled in consideration of public health.

As part of the first phase of the defence pact, the Indian prime minister will officially announce the handing over of some sports utility vehicles (Tata Hexa) to the Bangladesh Army. The $500million pact was signed between the two neighbours when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina paid a four-day visit to Delhi in July 2018.  Traditionally India supplies defence equipment to Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and of late to Afghanistan. India has also extended $600million defence related Line of Credit (LoC) to Vietnam and another LoC to Mauritius in the past.  Defence diplomacy is emerging as a key element in India's foreign policy, with Delhi eyeing a supply of defence equipment to friendly countries in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, according to experts. Indian to give 150 ambulances As a token of friendship, India will provide 150 ambulances to Bangladesh, 100 for the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujib and 50 others representing the 50 years of relationship between India and Bangladesh, Shringla said. On the donation of ambulances, Shringla said they were a gift from Modi who would make the formal announcement. He said these were not ordinary ambulances but had systems in place so that victims facing trauma could access a nearby ambulance by calling a designated number immediately."

The deal has been signed by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar The United States signed a deal with Taliban insurgents on Saturday that could pave the way toward a full withdrawal of foreign soldiers from Afghanistan and represent a step toward ending the 18-year-war in the nation. But while the agreement creates a path for the United States to gradually pull out of its longest war, many expect the talks to come between the Afghan sides may be much more complicated. The deal was signed in the Qatari capital Doha by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on hand to witness the ceremony. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper called the accord a good step but just the beginning. ""Achieving lasting peace in Afghanistan will require patience and compromise among all parties,"" said Esper, who met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul where they announced a joint declaration in parallel to the US-Taliban accord. The United States said it is committed to reducing the number of its troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 - from the current 13,000 - within 135 days of signing the deal, and working with its allies to proportionally reduce the number of coalition forces in Afghanistan over that period, if the Taliban adhere to their commitments. A full withdrawal of all US and coalition forces would occur within 14 months of the deal getting signed, if the Taliban hold up their end of the deal, the joint statement said. ""We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home,"" said US President Donald Trump in a White House statement. The accord represents a chance to make good on a longstanding promise to get troops out, as he seeks re-election in November. But security experts have also called it a foreign policy gamble that would give the Taliban international legitimacy. Ghani said he hoped the Doha deal paves the way towards lasting peace, telling a news conference in Kabul: ""The nation is looking forward to a full ceasefire.""  The Afghan government said it stood ready to negotiate and conclude a ceasefire with the Taliban, and it affirmed its support for the phased withdrawal of US and coalition forces subject to the Taliban's fulfilment of its commitments. It also said that it remained committed to preventing militant groups from using its soil to threaten the security of the United States, its allies and other countries. Separately, Nato pledged to adjust the coalition troop levels in the first phase too, bringing down Nato's numbers to about 12,000 from roughly 16,000 troops at present. ""We went in together in 2001, we are going to adjust (troop levels) together and when the time is right, we are going to leave together, but we are only going to leave when conditions are right,"" Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who was in Kabul on Saturday, told reporters. Today is a monumental day for Afghanistan. "".. it is about making peace & crafting a common brighter future."" We stand with #Afghanistan. #AfghanPeaceProcess https://t.co/eoP0xftZaa Hope for an end to bloodshed Hours before the deal, the Taliban ordered all its fighters in Afghanistan ""to refrain from any kind of attack for the happiness of the nation."" ""The biggest thing is that we hope the US remain committed to their promises during the negotiation and peace deal,"" said Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline Islamist group. For millions of Afghans, the deal represents some hope for an end to years of bloodshed. ""Peace is extremely simple and my country deserves it. Today is the day when maybe we will see a positive change,"" said Javed Hassan, 38, a school teacher living on the outskirts of Afghan capital, Kabul. Hassan's children were killed in a bomb blast carried out by the Taliban in 2018. Since then, he has been writing letters to world leaders urging them to end the Afghan war."

Dozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment At least 33 Turkish soldiers were killed as violence escalates in Syria's Idlib province after an air strike blamed on Damascus, with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemning ""indiscriminate"" attacks by the Assad regime and Russia. Dozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment, Rahmi Dogan, governor of Turkish Hatay -- bordering Syria -- said Friday. The heavy losses in northwestern Idlib come after weeks of growing tensions between rebel supporter Ankara and Damascus ally Moscow. Stoltenberg ""urged all parties to de-escalate this dangerous situation and avoid further worsening of the horrendous humanitarian situation in the region"", his spokesman said Friday. In a phone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the NATO secretary general ""condemned the continued indiscriminate air strikes by the Syrian regime and its backer Russia in Idlib province"", according to the spokesman. Turkey has urged the Syrian regime to withdraw from Turkish observation posts in Idlib, while Moscow has accused Ankara of aiding ""terrorists"" in Syria. Under a 2018 deal with Russia meant to bring calm to Idlib, Turkey has 12 observation posts in the region -- but several have come under fire from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hastily convened an emergency meeting in Ankara after the Idlib attack. Erdogan's top press aide, Fahrettin Altun, said Turkey's military retaliated against all known positions of the regime after the air strike. In a statement, Altun called on the international community to fulfil its responsibilities to end the violence in Idlib and the regime's ""crimes against humanity"". The latest attack means 53 Turkish security personnel have been killed in the province this month. There was a flurry of diplomatic activity as Turkey's presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin spoke with US national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, state news agency Anadolu reported without giving detail. More civilians killed  Jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels on Thursday re-entered Saraqeb, a key Idlib crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government's devastating offensive. The counteroffensive could, however, be short-lived as Russian-backed Syrian troops continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities. Seven civilians, including three children, were killed in regime and Russian bombardment of Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December. The UN Security Council, where Moscow has systematically vetoed truce initiatives, met again Thursday amid growing concern Idlib is witnessing the nine-year-old war's worst humanitarian emergency. State news agency SANA acknowledged there were ""fierce clashes"" between the army and ""terrorist groups on the Saraqeb front"".  An AFP correspondent accompanied the rebels into Saraqeb, where he found a ghost town of bombed out buildings. The counterattack temporarily reverses one of the key gains of the government since its offensive against the country's last rebel enclave in December. Refugee fears  The cash-strapped government had been keen to fully secure the M5, a highway that connects Syria's four main cities and passes through Saraqeb. The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes were carried out by Assad government ally Russia, heavily criticised by the West for the high civilian death toll from its bombing campaign. State media accused the ""terrorists"" of launching car bombings and other suicide attacks against government forces attempting to retake the town. It said the army had inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, despite the military support it said they had received from Turkey. Some 950,0000 civilians have fled the government offensive, raising fears in Ankara of a new influx of refugees. Turkey already hosts the world's largest number of Syrian refugees -- around 3.6 million people -- placing an increasingly unpopular burden on public services. The country's ruling party spokesman Omer Celik told CNN Turk broadcaster Friday Ankara was not in a position to ""hold"" refugees any longer and called on the European Union to do more. More than half a million of those displaced since December are children, tens of thousands of whom are sleeping rough in northern Syria's harsh winter. UN powerlessness The Turkish president vowed Wednesday Ankara would not take the ""smallest step back"" in the standoff with Damascus and Moscow over Idlib. Erdogan warned the Syrian government to ""stop its attacks as soon as possible"" and to pull back by the end of the month. The UN has repeatedly warned the fighting in Idlib could potentially create the most serious humanitarian crisis since the civil war's start in 2011. Nine out of 15 members of the Security Council on Wednesday urged Secretary General Antonio Guterres to step up his involvement in efforts to restore peace in Idlib. Russian vetoes, often backed by China, have chronically crippled UN action in Syria."

Near about 500,000 to 1,000,000cft (Cubic Feet) topsoils are being used to make 3 to 4 million bricks every year Large-scale use of topsoil from vast areas of farmlands for brick manufacturing in Panchagarh has been inflicting catastrophic damage on agriculture as well the environment. Vast agricultural lands have been losing fertility as well as crop yield capacity for over decades due to the loss of topsoil--which is the outermost layer of soil with the highest concentration of organic matter. Farmers in the district have long been victims of exploitation and have been manipulated by local brokers to sell their fertile-most soil to brick kiln owners. In this way, around 52 brick kilns have been set up around the farmlands of Debiganj, Boda, and Atwari upazila, which are using fertile topsoil of thousand hectares of arable land to make millions of bricks every year. Collection of topsoil from farmlands surrounding brick kilns begins after the Aman harvest and continues for the next one and a half months, locals say. As most nutrients and organic properties along with beneficial microorganisms reside on the top part of the soil when removed, the soil becomes infertile; the bare chemical-infested soil residue washes into the adjacent water bodies, resulting in scores of environmental and health hazards. On a field visit, this correspondent saw numerous trucks filled with the soil, and the farmlands dug 10ft to 15ft under.  Near about 500,000 to 1,000,000cft (Cubic Feet) topsoils are being used to make 3 to 4 million bricks every year. Even though removing topsoil is a punishable offence, locals say neither the brick kiln owners nor the authorities abide by the law. They allege local political influencers are behind these atrocities. Dhananjay Rai, a resident of Debiganj's Nayanpara village, said he sold per bigha of topsoil from his land at Tk26,000. Jagadish Chandra Rai, manager of MML Bricks Kiln in Boda upazila, said they need 250,000 to 500,000cft soil each season to make 500,000 to 800,000 bricks. He said: ""We never face any objection from anyone regarding the use of topsoil. We never force farmers, in fact, they are willing to sell soil from their lands for the profits."" Md Shamim Iqbal, upazila agriculture officer (UAO) of Debiganj, said: ""Due to this trend of diminishing topsoil at such a rapid rate, farmable lands and crop yields will decline in future as well as having devastating environmental impacts."" Boda UAO Al Mamun Or-Rashid said the brick kiln owners are using a syndicate of brokers to manipulate the farmers to sell their lands. Touhidul Bari Babu, head of the Geography and Environmental Science department of Panchagarh Govt Women's College, said: ""The situation is truly alarming as fertilizers can longer make the soil fertile without putting a stop to the damage of nutrients in the soil."" Md Abu Hanif, deputy director of the district's Department of Agricultural Extension, said: ""We can only build awareness among farmers so they stop selling topsoil. But, we are unable to take legal action against the brick kilns."" Sabina Yasmin, deputy commissioner of Panchagarh, was unwilling to comment on the matter, while Debiganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer Prottoy Hasan said they will take measures to ensure proper awareness among farmers and legal actions against the offenders."
54,"Rise in Hunger Seen As World's Harvests Fall and Costs Soar
1989-04-05T05:00:00.000Z
After two years of poor harvests worldwide, poor countries will experience increased hunger and starvation as their bill for imported food soars by more than $5 billion this year, the top United Nations agriculture official says.
Calling the global food situation ''a cause for serious concern,'' Edouard Saouma, director of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said Monday that an expected rise in world grain production this year would be insufficient to rebuild stocks and bring output back in line with consumption.
Another bad harvest in the United States or any other major grain-producing region of the world would have ''very serious implications for world food security,'' Mr. Saouma told the Committee on World Food Security, which monitors global food supplies and is meeting here this week.
The agriculture organization's latest confidential report on food shortages this year lists 15 countries as requiring ''exceptional or emergency assistance.'' The 15 are Angola, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Haiti, Jamaica, Laos, Lebanon, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Peru, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, the Sudan and Vietnam.
In the Sudan, for example, the report predicts ''serious food supply difficulties.'' in the drought- and war-ravaged southern region unless emergency assistance ''is made available immediately.''
Important factors in declining grain production in the northern countries are the severe drought in North America last year as well as policy measures in the United States and Europe meant to curb surplus production. But in addition, many agricultural experts, citing the shortage of spare arable land in many parts of Asia and Africa, warn that some poor countries may be reaching limits of production.
The decline in production has meant a sharp fall in grain stocks, to about 16 percent of annual consumption, their lowest level since the early 1970's, and a rise of 40 to 50 percent in prices, Mr. Saouma said.
A fall in global grain stocks below 17 percent of annual consumption leaves the world vulnerable to a food crisis if harvests fail again and invariably trigger a sharp rise in grain prices, the agriculture organization says. Higher world grain prices will mean better returns for the world's major grain-exporting countries, which include the United States, Canada, Western Europe and Australia.
Mr. Saouma stressed that while the richer industrialized countries can weather the current price rise, poor countries will need to raise spending on imported food from $12.3 billion in 1988 to $17.6 billion this year just to maintain the same, often indequate level of nutrition.
''The increase in import costs will further worsen the balance of payments position of many of the low-income, food-deficit countries, which are already suffering from mounting external debt and adverse terms of trade,'' Mr. Saouma said. Less Famine Aid
Moreover, the increase in the food costs for poor countries comes at a time when the quantity of free food that industrialized countries will provide for famine relief is expected to fall by about a quarter. This is because the donors generally budget cash sums for food assistance, and these buy less when grain prices rise.
The amount of free food Western industrialized countries will donate for famine relief in poor countries this year is likely to fall from the roughly 13.2 million tons they gave in 1988 to about 9.7 million tons, officials of the organization say.
As a result, officials say, some poor countries may be unable to maintain even last year's nutritional levels.
''Over 500 million people are undernourished today and this is going to get worse,'' said James Ingram, head of the World Food Program, an agency affiliated with the agriculture organization that distributes food aid.
In a new effort to help the world's growing numbers of poor and hungry, agriculture ministers from 36 developed and developing countries, including the United States, will meet in Cairo on May 22 to consider a new action plan prepared by the World Food Council, a body set up within the organization in 1974 to review world agricultural policies.
The meeting will bring together ministers from countries representing 68 percent of the world's population and 75 percent of its wealth.
''We've spent enough time analyzing hunger,'' said Gerald Trant, the World Food Council's director. ''The time has come to act.''
In its latest survey of world grain markets prepared for this week's meeting, the agriculture organization forecasts that total production of wheat and coarse grains like sorghum and corn will rise to 1.4 billion tons this year after dropping from 1.33 billion tons in 1987 to 1.25 billion tons last year.
But since the global rice harvest is unlikely to be much higher than last year's record, the organization believes that total world grain production will increase by about 150 million tons this year, or less than the 200 million tons it says is needed to rebuild stocks and bring output back into line with consumption trends."

1988-04-14T05:00:00.000Z
It took just five minutes to memorize her homework poem, said Nazma Akhtar proudly, and she can recite it so fast that the words run together in a flash of 10-year-old enthusiasm: Orange flower, orange flower, Flower of orange, Orange flower will get married With emeralds in her ears.
Nazma, a second grader, barefoot like the other children but with shiny brass bangles in her ears and a delicate brass ''nose flower'' in her nose, wants to be the first person in her family to finish all five years of elementary school.
But her mother says she will probably have to drop out soon, as her two brothers did before her, to help the family in the fields.
If she does drop out, Nazma's story will be the story of most children in this struggling nation, where poverty perpetuates itself and daily hardships leave little time for school or poems.
Bangladesh is typical of the poor nations of the world, foreign aid workers say, where children are seen as an economic asset to hungry families.
Few families can sacrifice their children's labor for the uncertain future benefits of an education.
''We go around to their houses and beg them to let their children stay in class,'' said one of the school's four teachers, Mumtaj Begum. ''I tell them stories of famous people and say, 'These people were just like you and they have become great people because they went to school.' ''
Gulshanara Begum, the young headmistress, said that of 852 school-age children in the area, just 238 were enrolled in the little Aingan school at the edge of the rice fields 30 miles northeast of Dhaka.
Most children, she said, drop out to help their families after just two years of schooling, not really enough to become literate.
On one recent school day, only half of those enrolled were at class. The others, Mrs. Gulshanara said, were busy watering the fields, weeding, fishing and gathering firewood. 'Who Knows the Answer?'
Inside Nazma's classroom, her teacher, in a threadbare white shirt and trousers, gripped his bamboo rod and demanded angrily, ''Two plus two, who knows the answer?''
In the rice paddy outside, a child with a basket of pumpkins on her head walked by, her image reflected in the bright water of the paddy fields.
A boy with a bamboo stick just like that of the teacher brought two thin cows to graze in the small field beside the schoolhouse.
Almost as far as the bamboo trees that shelter Nazma's house, the voices of the schoolchildren could be heard as they learned the numbers: ''One god, two worlds, three earths, four caliphs.''
Given the poverty and lack of education of the villagers, Mrs. Mumtaj described the role of a teacher as extending well beyond the school's walls. Advice on Health and Land
''They come to me for advice on things like health care and land questions,'' she said. ''They even ask my opinion on marriage questions.''
The headmistress, Mrs. Gulshanara, said she had taken short courses in nutrition and family planning, and spent much of her time talking to villagers on these subjects.
In the classroom, she said, she tries to engage the children's minds and to teach them to think.
In an innovation of her own, she said, she has divided her classes into groups for debates on such subjects as literacy and small families. Poverty Hampers Work
''Of course, they are young,'' she said. ''They have trouble articulating their ideas. But at least they try.''
She said her work is hampered by the poverty of the school.
Her bare, concrete-floored classroom was furnished with a water jug, an umbrella, whisk brooms and a blackboard that hung from the wall on fraying ropes.
The children, who write on small slates, have no rulers or maps or toys or musical instruments, she said, and the school has no ball for sports."

Farmers are unable to derive enough profits from their regular jhuming while the poppy fields are offering much more to them The cultivation of opium has been surging in Bandarban despite regular drives by joint forces comprising Bangladesh Army, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and other law enforcement agencies. Almost 25 acres of the poppy crop  were destroyed in different upazilas of the district. Even so, the reason behind the increased interest in poppy cultivation is somewhat surprising for some locals, as this correspondent found during a visit to the area. Most recently, on February 19, the Bangladesh Army destroyed an acre of poppy field in Ruma. On February 16, BGB destroyed three acres of poppy field in Thanchi's Ko-Ong area and just the previous day, on February 15, the army destroyed another acre in Ruma upazila's Tuikkajhiri area, according to law enforcement sources. Bangladesh Army Ruma zone Commander Lt Col Md Goulam Akbar, psc, explained how poppy plants are being used in making the deadly opium and as the drugs are sold at high prices, he said, locals are getting more interested day by day in investing more in poppy cultivation than in their yearly Jhum yields. ""Despite all the challenges we are patrolling even in the most inaccessible parts of the hill tracts to free the region from drugs and we will continue our drives as long as it is necessary,"" said Commander Akbar. On February 4, the security forces in a joint drive led by East Bengal Regiment (EB) Commander Md Ashiqur Rahman destroyed 12 poppy fields across 10 acres of hilly slopes in Saikot and Khulen Khumi areas. The farmers made good their escape. Shoihlaching Marma, a local journalist in Ruma, said that poppy plants grew more in quantity in winter, and as this year's winter was colder, cultivation reached a peak.   Uhlaching Marma, chairman of Ruma upazila, said the local authorities were taking different measures to discourage the farmers from growing poppy, including arranging meetings to raise awareness about the consequences of the illicit cultivation.  ""Jhuming"", an age-old practice of the indigenous people of the hill tracts, is now facing a challenge because of the flawed transportation system that bars farmers from selling their produce and earn an easy livelihood, said Lu Pru Ong Marma, a Ruma resident. Farmers are unable to derive enough profits from their regular jhuming while the poppy fields are offering much more to them. This factor might be making the farmers inclined to take risks and despite the drives, cultivation is on the rise this year, the local added. Members of the Arakan Liberation Party (ALP), which is a Rakhine political party in Myanmar, and its armed wing, the Arakan Liberation Army (ALA), somehow cross the border near Ruma, Thanchi and Alikadam upazilas and cultivate the illicit plant with help from locals, smuggling it back to Myanmar, said local sources. The profits gained from these drugs are the main source of income for the insurgent militant group, locals say. Md Shamsul Alam, upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) of Ruma, said the authorities had directed the local representatives to warn residents about the aftermath of such illegal cultivation and would arrange regular meetings to raise awareness about the problem. He said: ""Despite our warnings, if anybody tries to break the law, they will face punishment."""
60,"DINING OUT; A REWARDING PASSAGE TO INDIA
1988-02-21T05:00:00.000Z
A QUICK and delicious passage to India can be made enjoyably at a modest storefront restaurant named Bonani in Stamford.
Named for a wooded garden in Bangladesh (the owner's home), Bonani evokes a sense of India, in limited space, through photographs on the pine wainscotted walls, Indian music and especially through the seductive aroma of cumin, cardamom and curry spices wafting from the kitchen.
Though it began as a take-out shop in Westport (which is still going strong), Bonani has blossomed into a bona fide restaurant with a large menu featuring many chicken, lamb, beef and shrimp variations, and a vegetarian corner. Emphasis is on South Indian cuisine, though there are dishes from across the map of India.
If you are a novice at Indian food, you might begin with the assorted Indian hors d'oeuvres, which give you a sampling of pakora (vegetable fritters), samosa (minced meat fritters), kebabs (minced, spiced and tightly pressed beef patties) and spicy pappadams (large crispy wafers).
An admirable starter was the chef's special appetizer: pieces of marinated chicken breast in a green pepper-onion sauce enlivened with fresh coriander. Consider also steaming hot mughlai paratha, an oven-browned envelope of dough filled with minced meat, eggs, chopped green pepper and onions. Listed under breads, it makes a generous appetizer as well.
Most successfully seasoned of many entrees were chicken tikka masala (chunks of marinated breast in an aromatic pale pink yogurt-almond sauce), chicken dhansak (well spiced in a tangy herb sauce with bay leaf), shrimp Madras (jumbo shrimp in a smartly spiced coriander-tomato sauce) and chicken patiala (white meat in a resonant tomato paste). Mattar paneer, a vegetable dish of cheese cubes and peas, had a hint of cardamom and considerable subtlety.
The platter of light basmati rice served with entrees is a special treat, seasoned with whole cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and ghee (clarified butter). All three condiments offered as add-ons to the meal were satisfying, from the mild mango chutney to the very hot mango lime pickle. The soothingly cool cucumber raita (a yogurt-based refresher, intended to offset the heat of the various spicy dishes) was a standout.
Lamb vindaloo, one of the most incendiary creations in the Indian repertoire, made with a variety of spices, was mild at Bonani, as though concern for customers' palates led the chef to hold the chilies. We vindaloo lovers were disappointed, though others might find this dish (and the chicken vindaloo) adequately seasoned.
Some dishes at Bonani were acceptable, but somewhat pale renderings of their usual selves: rogan josh (lamb with tomato, red pepper pods and fresh coriander), shag gosht (lamb with spinach) and aloo-mutter-gobi (a vegetable dish that had only phantom seasoning). A large platter of lamb biryani (rice with lamb and vegetables) was surprisingly characterless, devoid of the nuts and saffron mentioned on the menu and served with a soupy dhal (lentil) sauce and a fiery onion chutney.
You should avoid such tepid offerings as the bland, thin mulligatawny soup, with a whisper of lemon but no other semblance to this old Anglo-Indian standby, and the vegetable soup, a similar broth, with the addition of a few peas and cauliflower bits. The pappadams and poori (deep-fried, puffy, crisp bread)had excellent flavor, but were excessively greasy.
The mystique of Indian desserts often eludes western tastebuds, but the intention is to have something light, delicate and restful after a hotly seasoned meal. The dessert trio at Bonani filled the bill exactly: rasmalai (cream-soaked Indian cheese), gulab jaman (small, honey-soaked dough balls) and firni (pink custard with rose water).
The price at Bonani is certainly right: $25.35 for a three-course dinner for two, with beverages, tax and tip extra. That's hard to beat for a different and, on the whole, satisfying dining adventure. The menu is large enough, with sufficient succulent choices, to make dining at Bonani a rewarding Indian voyage.

Despite serious discord and disputes between the countries of South Asia, the concept of a common future of the region based on increasing cooperation among the people and governments has somehow survived because of strong geographical, economic and cultural factors. More recently however, this concept itself has been increasingly threatened. India has moved closer towards its eastern borders. Pakistan had already leaned more closely towards both China and some Arab countries. To a lesser extent, Nepal and Sri Lanka have also moved towards China. Sectarianism has weakened cultural relationships in South Asia level. Terrorism has become an issue of relentless discord and tension. The decline of the overall prospects of close cooperation at this juncture is tragic as this is probably the time when close cooperation is most needed. South Asia is passing through a critical phase of climate change which requires various countries to focus on new emerging developmental and environmental challenges as well as increase cooperation to face these extremely difficult challenges for which the region is not at all well prepared. South Asia has 16 percent of the world's population, over 30 percent of the world's poor, only 2 percent of its land and 1 percent of oil resources. So, the developmental challenges here were already acute before the advent of the disruptive manifestations of climate change. Experts see South Asia as a region where some of the most serious impacts of climate change are likely to emerge. In addition, a range of related life-threatening environmental problems have also been worsening in the region, including freshwater scarcity, decline in water tables, serious threats to rivers, deforestation, soil/land erosion and sharp decline in natural fertility, air quality, threats to safe food and proliferation of various hazards. The need to reduce GHG emissions while meeting basic needs of all people with dignity is a huge challenge, the most important real challenge for South Asia. South Asia can stand up to this challenge in a sustained situation of peace and stability where it is possible to devote most efforts, talents and resources for this. The actual situation, sadly, is a very different one. South Asia is commonly seen to consist of eight countries--India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bhutan and Maldives. Two of these are nuclear powers. The chances of actual use of nuclear weapons have increased in recent times. It is well known that any use of nuclear weapons, or any accident relating to these, can have destructive impacts not just in the nuclear weapon countries but also in neighbouring countries. While six out of eight countries of South Asia have absolutely no involvement with nuclear weapons, they may have to bear the consequences of their use or even deployment/storage by two countries. South Asia has emerged as one of highest arms-importing regions of the world. Combining direct and indirect expenses, the total military expenditure may be much higher than what is stated officially, denying precious resources for urgent development and environment protection tasks. South Asia has seen two extremely violent partitions and a much higher number of violent secessionist movements and insurgencies. It has also seen four wars involving India and Pakistan, and a persistent state of foreign invasion and internal violence in Afghanistan for over four decades. Terrorism is a big source of violence but also has a larger and more destructive role as a trigger for an all-out war. On the whole, war and civil war, secession and insurgency are likely to have claimed nearly six million lives in South Asia in the post-World War II phase. The number of people who were displaced or ruined in other ways is higher. Sectarianism and sectarian violence remain at high levels. Secularism has very dim prospects. Democracy has had its ups and downs in various countries of the region. It survives at rather low levels of achievement. Democracy needs to be strengthened from many points of view, one of the most important being the creation of conducive conditions in which alternative viewpoints can emerge and acquire strength. These alternative views should seek peace, harmony, environment protection, justice and equality (including gender-based justice and equality). An accompanying effort would be to make dedicated efforts to spread values of universal peace, non-violence, non-dominance, non-discrimination and social equality (including at the gender level), a wider understanding of honesty and sincerity as well as some basic human rights and duties. Such an effort if sustained for about five years can help to change public perceptions so that democratic leaderships devoted to peace, justice and environment protection can emerge.

In Ankara, talks between Turkey and Russian ended without agreement on stopping clashes in which 13 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Syria in one week Government forces seized control of a highway in northwest Syria for the first time since 2012 on Tuesday as they pressed their campaign to eradicate the last rebel strongholds in Idlib province and the Aleppo countryside, a war monitor said. In Ankara, talks between Turkey and Russian ended without agreement on stopping clashes in which 13 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Syria in one week. Relief agencies meanwhile said an exodus of hundreds of thousands of civilians from the afflicted areas was the largest such movement in nine years of war and a new humanitarian crisis was unfolding. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government forces had seized the entire length of the M5 highway after driving rebels from their last foothold on the road. The M5 runs from Aleppo in the north to the capital Damascus then on to southern Deraa. They took control of the highway after capturing a western suburb of Aleppo from insurgents. The latest advances by President Bashar al-Assad's Russian and Iranian-backed troops came after 13 Turkish soldiers were killed in the Idlib region in the past week, prompting some of the most serious confrontations between Ankara and Damascus of the war. Ankara deployed thousands of soldiers to stem the Syrian offensive. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels downed a helicopter believed to belong to the Syrian government in the town of Nairab, Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber reported on Tuesday. Since the new push began, government forces have recaptured more than 600 square km of territory and in recent days have taken control of dozens of towns and villages. Last week they recaptured the crossroads town of Saraqeb, on the M5. Turkey has several military personnel stationed there to prevent further Syrian advances after eight of its soldiers were killed by Syrian shelling. A Russian delegation arrived in Ankara on Saturday days after the attack to hold talks aimed at stopping clashes. On their final day of talks, a second Syrian attack on Turkish troops in the Taftanaz area killed five more troops. Ankara has said that it retaliated to both attacks, destroying several Syrian targets. It said would drive back Assad's forces unless they withdraw by the end of the month. It also told the Russian team that attacks against Turkish posts must stop immediately. The Russians left Turkey after talks ended on Monday, a Turkish diplomatic source said, with no apparent agreement. The Kremlin said on Tuesday all attacks on Russian and Syrian forces in Idlib had to stop.  Air raids Rescue teams in the region said Russian and Syrian war planes bombed several towns in Idlib, with most air raids on towns in western Aleppo, including a residential area in the city of Daraat Izza. At least 13 civilians were killed overnight in the air strikes, they said. The rapid advances by Assad's forces in Idlib have driven nearly 700,000 people from their homes towards the closed-off Turkish border in the past 10 weeks. Most of those displaced are women and children. ""This is, from our initial analysis, the largest number of people in a single period since the Syrian crisis began almost nine years ago,"" Jens Laerke, spokesman for the United Nations' OCHA humanitarian agency, told reporters in Geneva. ""So it's the fastest growing displacement we have ever seen in the country. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Andrej Mahecic said the harsh winter weather was making their suffering worse and shelter was hard to find. ""Even finding a place in an unfinished building is becoming nearly impossible,"" he said, adding that mosques were full. Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot absorb any more. It said it will halt new migrant waves from Idlib and its military will remain there. One Turkish politician urged President Tayyip Erdogan to go further. ""There will be no peace in Turkey until Assad is brought down from his throne. Turkey must start plans to enter Damascus now, and annihilate the cruel ones,"" said Devlet Bahceli, chairman of Erdogan's nationalist partner party. Witnesses and rebels said on Tuesday a new column of Turkish reinforcements, including tanks, rocket launchers and armoured vehicles, crossed the border into Idlib overnight. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels have also begun an new offensive against the government forces near army-controlled Saraqeb and Nairab to push troops away from Idlib city, where more than one million people live. The battle for Idlib is a crucial stage of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of combatants and civilians, made millions refugees in their own country or overseas, and fractured the wider Middle East since it broke out amid the Arab Spring in 2011. Forces arrayed against Assad, Syria's ruler for nearly 20 years, have failed to dislodge him but he now presides over a devastated country. Moscow's military intervention in 2015 helped swing the war decisively in Assad's favour. Despite being on opposing sides, Turkey and Russia collaborate for a political solution to the conflict."
64,"About New York; A 'Mother' Waits With Open Arms At Ports of Call
1989-05-13T05:00:00.000Z
The big man at the top of the gangplank wore lots of tattoos and a leer. ''Hiya, sister,'' he said. ''Welcome to the love boat.''
The Rev. Barbara C. Crafton, who has been called Sweetie, Cupcake, Honey Doll and more, was unabashed. The Episcopal priest, one of the first 50 women ordained in 1980, has visited some 4,000 ships and heard it all. Her ministry is to the 200,000 seafarers from 60 countries who call each year at ports in the area.
''The job is real dirty and ugly,'' said Mother Crafton, as she prefers to be known, director of Seafarers' Services for the Seamen's Church Institute of New York and New Jersey. But the joy of comforting achingly lonely souls is immense. ''The smallest sort of thing you do is a big thing,'' she said.
Things like distributing armloads of magazines, offering a lift to stores, arranging a phone call home, setting up a soccer game, counseling marriages split by half a planet and helping seafarers fight for what few rights they have. Mother Crafton has gone into lockers to administer last rites; in these days of refrigeration, bodies are shipped home rather than buried at sea. She has exorcised demons from unlucky vessels.
It is all some distance from Mora, Minn., the farm town where Mother Crafton grew up landlocked and driven by an ambition to go where not everyone was blond. Now 38 years old, she is sailing a voyage that has included study at Rutgers, Princeton and the General Theological Seminary; a marriage, two daughters and a divorce, and work from cabaret singer to parish priest.
Mother Crafton's love affair with the sea began when the seamen's institute - which is ecumenical but affiliated with the Episcopal Church - asked her to perform the Cole Porter songs she loves. She expected ''a swashbuckling bunch of beer-swillers.'' What she found were ''polite little Asian boys'' far, far from home.
''I felt sorry for them,'' she said. Thus it was that
Mother Crafton left her New Jersey parish and went to work on the waterfront in 1983. It was a different waterfront from the wild and wooly one prevailing when the institute, in 1844, launched the first of three floating churches -steeples and all - that became East River landmarks. It was different, too, from the macho jungle Marlon Brando prowled in ''On the Waterfront.''
Fierce competition has changed the maritime industry. To raise productivity and slash costs, ships have become larger and more automated, carrying smaller crews and spending 12 hours rather than a week in port. Most now register under what are called flags of convenience - Panama's, say, or Liberia's - to avoid taxes and labor rules that American or European flags would mandate.
Today's sailors come from the bargain basement, the villages of the third world. Mother Crafton tells of a Greek cruise ship in which 50 Bangladeshis in a crew of 600 were kept in despicable conditions: eight in rooms meant for two, no bedding, the toilet a smelly hole in the next room. Unlike sailors of other nationalities, the Bangladeshis were denied shore leave for fear they would bolt.
Mother Crafton knew she could not do much, but she attacked a particularly egregious insult - men who made 50 cents an hour having to pay 55 cents for a soda. She succeeded in forcing the price to 20 cents, but probably only for as long as the boat was berthed.
She has seen other bad things. A Filipino whose village scraped together $1,400 to pay his way to Miami so he could become an $800-a-month assistant chef. All that was available was a messboy's job at $200 a month.
She saw a Chinese seaman break his neck and slowly die on a cold December day. She tells of ships abandoned at New York docks and bewildered crews running out of food. Missing fingers are common. Some shipping companies keep such inadequate records that families aren't notified of a death. All they know is that the checks no longer come.
''You don't have to treat people like dogs to make money,'' declared Mother Crafton, who admits the world labor market is sufficiently glutted that owners can make even more by doing precisely that.
And there is the loneliness. Today's seamen are gone for a year at a stretch, missing children's births, parents' deaths. Mother Crafton fears the effects of the solace many seek from prostitutes. Seamen, she worries, could become Typhoid Mary's carrying AIDS far and wide. She has distributed 30,000 pamphlets warning of the dangers in six languages.
Mother Crafton doesn't force religion on people. But while chauffeuring three Colombian seamen from Red Hook Terminal in Brooklyn to the Fulton Street Mall, she did recall that some of Jesus's apostles were seamen.
''This is neat work,'' she judged."

Tea workers in Moulvibazar suffering in bitter cold At least six children died from pneumonia in Khagrachhari between January 1 and 13, according to local medical professionals.  Due to the cold wave that has been sweeping across Bangladesh for over a week, there has been a rise in pneumonia and cold-induced diarrhoea infection in the hill district,  particularly in the rural areas.  Confirming the death toll, Dr Rajendra Tripura, paediatric specialist at Khagrachhari Sadar Hospital, said the hospital had received many patients whose health had deteriorated because of primary treatment being neglected.  Newborns and children are the worst sufferers of cold-related diseases - pneumonia and diarrhoea - in the district, hospital sources said. Most of these children are aged between 6 and 18 months.  Children with severe cases of pneumonia have been getting admitted to the hospital. Many of them are in critical condition.  The hospital staff are overwhelmed with the growing number of patients coming in, sources have said.  Dr Nayanmoy Tripura, resident doctor at Khagrachhari Sadar Hospital, said at least 1,200 people had been treated for pneumonia and diarrhoea in the hospital since the advent of winter.  Medical professionals have advised local citizens, especially guardians of children, not to panic and instead arrange proper medical care in time.  Moulvibazar tea workers suffer in bitter cold A bitterly cold weather has gripped the seven upazilas of Moulvibazar, making life miserable for tea workers, especially the elderly and children. Due to dense fog, the sun remains invisible for most of the day in Sreemangal and Kamalganj.  ""The bitter cold leaves us shivering even inside the house,"" said Koloti Ghatuar, an elderly woman working at Kurma tea garden, beside the Dhalai River. The temperature was recorded at 11 degrees Celsius in Sreemangal on Tuesday, said Anisur Rahman, assistant meteorologist at the local met office. Dr Zakir Hosain, resident medical officer at Kulaura Upazila Health Complex, said the number of patients suffering from cold-related diseases had increased in the last few days.  Workers of Harincherra tea garden went to the local union parishad office for warm clothes, but did not get any help, said Swapan Nayek, a Sreemangal resident. The impoverished people of the tea garden areas are the worst sufferers as they can hardly afford any warm clothes, according to Rajghat Union Parishad Chairman Bijoy Benarjee. Around 400,000 workers of 92 tea gardens in the district are suffering, yet they have not received any help from the tea garden owners, complained Makhon Lal Karmakar, president of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union.  But Bangladesh Cha Sangsad Vice-Chairman Shafwan Chowdhury said tea garden owners had provided support to tea workers this winter, though on a limited scale. District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Ashraf Ali said the authorities had distributed Tk10 lakh and 43,200 blankets among cold-stricken people in the district, and allotted Tk2 lakh to help the poor buy winter clothes for children."
69,"BURMA: At a Glance
1988-07-24T05:00:00.000Z
Economy
Despite fertile farm land, rich teak forests and large deposits of petroleum and precious gems, Burma is among the world's poorest nations. It was once the world's leading rice exporter, but it experienced spot food shortages in 1987. Its economic decline is generally attributed to poor Government management and to a crippling war against several ethnic minorities seeking autonomy. Per capita income is less than $200 a year; firmer estimates are made more difficult by the existence of a vast black market, which is generally considered to be larger than the official economy. Japan and West Germany are major aid donors, and the United States has a modest assistance program, mainly directed at combatting the opium trade. People
Two-thirds of the 38 million people are ethnic Burmans. Important minorities include Chinese, Indians, Karens, Shans, Chins and Kachins. Burmese Communists form the largest rebel force; Karens lead the second-largest guerrilla group. The guerrillas have been active since independence in 1948, but riots involving Burmese under the Government's control are a recent phenomenon. About 85 percent of the people are Buddhists. The literacy rate is estimated at 66 percent. Government
After independence from Britain in 1948, Burma had a parliamentary democracy. In 1958, the army chief, Gen. Ne Win, was asked to form a caretaker Government to resolve a political crisis. Elected government was restored in 1960. General Ne Win staged a coup in 1962 and has ruled since then, imposing an isolationist and socialist one-party state. A poorly equipped army of about 160,000 is responsible for internal order and for resisting rebel attacks. Land
With 262,000 square miles, Burma is nearly the size of Texas. It shares frontiers with Bangladesh, India, China, Laos and Thailand. Much of the country is mountainous and heavily forested. Most of the agricultural and population centers are clustered along the Irrawaddy River valley and its broad delta. Rangoon, with a population of 3.5 million, is the capital and the largest city. Mandalay, in the heart of the country, is the second-largest city and the center of traditional culture. (Sources: Associated Press, World Almanac, Europa Year Book)"

Bhutan to Raise Tourist Fees In January
For the first time in eight years, Bhutan is raising the daily fees that it charges travelers. Since 1980 Bhutan has charged tour companies a fee of $130 per person per day, and a trekking fee of $95 a day. The trekking fee is for those who do not stay in hotels but join hiking and camping tours. Those fees are passed on to tourists who sign up for trips. (Individual travel, for which there is an even higher fee, is rare because making arrangments is difficult.) As of Jan. 1, Bhutan will increase tour-group rates for the peak tourist season - April and October - to $250 a day for tourists and to $130 a day for trekkers. Proportionate increases are to be imposed during the other times of the year. The highest fees coincide roughly with the Paro Festival in the spring and the Thimphu and Wangdiphodrang Festivals in the fall.
Bhutan's government has ''realized they don't have the manpower or the hotels and infrastructure for tourism,'' said Brent Olson of Inner-Asia Expeditions in San Francisco, ''so they want to maintain tourism at the present level, about 2,400 tourists a year, for the next few years.''
Bhutan closed its official tourist agency in the United States a year ago. For information, contact agencies that specialize in Bhutan trips. Two are Inner-Asia Expeditions, 2627 Lombard Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94123 (800-551-1769 or 415-922-0448) and Bhutan Travel, 120 East 56th Street, New York, N.Y. (212-838-6382).

The number of flights between the United States and Queensland, Australia, will increase this fall as the result an agreement between the United States and Australian Governments. Qantas now hass three flights a week from the West Coast to Cairns. On Nov. 1, Continental will begin three flights a week from San Francisco and two from Los Angeles to Cairns and on to Brisbane. United will offer flights to the two cities sometime in early 1989.
Cairns, in tropical northern Australia and near the Great Barrier Reef, has become increasingly popular with American travelers in the last few years, according to the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation.
In return for granting the new flights, Qantas will be allowed to fly into new cities in the United States, to be chosen later this year.
Round-trip coach fares for the Continental flights will be $1,195 during November, according to the airline. On Dec. 1 the fare will increase to $1,395. Meeting in Asia: A Greeting Guide
While a handshake is acceptable on being introduced to a resident of most Asian cities, other forms of greeting may be customary. Also, there are often may be prohibitions about men shaking hands with women. In general, do not greet someone by his or her first name until you are so addressed. Some other guidelines follow.
Australia: Women do not usually shake hands with other women. Friends or acquaintances seen at a distance are greeted with a wave.
Bangladesh: When introduced to a man it is customary to shake hands; when introduced to a woman, nod and greet with words.
China: A slight bow or handshake is customary. Chinese use the full title of a guest during introductions.
Fiji: Fijians greet each other with a smile and raised eyebrows, but a handshake is acceptable.
Hong Kong: Handshakes are common. Family members are greeted in order of age, oldest to youngest. Titles are used in introductions.
India: Men and women do not usually shake hands with one another. Common greeting for all is to place palms together at chin level and bow slightly, and say, to Hindus, ''namaste'' (pronounced na-mas-TAY) or ''namaskar'' (na-mas-CAR) and to Moslems, ''salaam aleikum.''
Indonesia: Handshakes customary only on first introduction or when someone leaves on a long journey or returns from one. A hand placed on one's heart while shaking hands means the person greeted is very special.
Japan: Bow for formal greeting, nod for informal greeting.
The Philippines: Men should wait for Filipino women to extend their hands. Men may also pat one another on the back.
South Korea: Men greet each other by bowing slightly and shaking hands with both hands or the right hand. Women do not usually shake hands. A younger person greets the older first.
Tahiti: Tahitians usually kiss each other on the cheek when meeting.
Taiwan: Handshakes customary only for males who are acquaintances or close friends. On first aquaintance a nod or slight bow is appropriate.
Thailand: Place hands together in a prayer position at the chest, bow head to touch index fingers and say ''Sawadee'' (pronounced sah-wah-DEE). Younger person greets the older first. U.S. Warnings On Travel to Asia
Here are summaries of travel advisories issued by the State Department for Americans considering a visit to Asia. For up-to-date information call the Department of State's Citizens Emergency Center at 202-647-5225.
Afghanistan. Avoid travel: continuing conflict between Soviet forces and resistance fighters.
Burma. Defer travel: civil disturbances.
Cambodia. Many areas, including that surrounding Angkor, are considered unsafe: guerrilla operations.
China. Chinese regulations prohibit travel without permission in some areas. Tibet is closed to foreign travel except for Lhasa and some other areas, but this ban is not consistently enforced.

As part of the demonstration, the Uber riders also staged a sit-in procession in the afternoon. The agitating riders alleged that the ride-sharing company suddenly decided to trim its base fare from Tk 30 to Tk 25 and per kilometer fare from Tk 12 to Tk 10. During the demonstration, which continued for around two hours from 11am in front of the Uber office, the aggrieved riders chanted slogans against the fare-cut and asked the authorities concerned to withdraw the decision. Md Russel, an Uber rider, told the Dhaka Tribune that the Uber authorities suddenly reduced the base fare by Tk 5 and kilometre fare by Tk 2. ""When we approached the local office about the reduction, they said that they have nothing to do as it was decided centrally,"" said the Uber rider.

76,"THE WORLD; An Election's Approach Brings Out the Indian in India
1988-10-16T05:00:00.000Z
THE formation of a new Indian political party last week was a reminder that sometime in the next year -maybe as early as February - the people of India will go to the polls to cast their votes in a national parliamentary election and in so doing make some important decisions about the country's future.
Should Rajiv Gandhi, a grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru and son of Indira Gandhi, be given an opportunity to continue the political dynasty that has dominated the nation since independence 40 years ago?
If Mr. Gandhi wins convincingly, will this be a mandate to continue his modernization drive, which has brought India to the brink of becoming a modern society with greater links to the West and to Japan and other industrialized free-market Asian nations?
And if he goes, should India withdraw more into its nationalist, protectionist self and choose a more solitary and self-reliant path that many believe would better safeguard the nation's traditions and character?
It was significant that India's newest political organization, the centrist People's Party, fell into bickering within moments of its creation over the last-minute change of its name from the Socialist People's Party.
Perhaps more than any other genuinely democratic nation, including the social democracies of Western Europe, India has socialism with a small ''s'' in its heart and in its blood. It is an Indian socialism, a not strictly orthodox creed woven into the homespun nationalism of Mohandas K. Gandhi. Indian socialism is summarized in the emotive word ''swadeshi'' - ''from our own land'' -and symbolized by the egalitarian costume of white kurta, dhoti and sandals worn from the village well to the halls of power.
Indian socialism was strengthened and internationalized by British and Indian Fabians and by Communists who shared in the country's struggle for independence and still play a political role today.
In foreign policy, Indian socialism has been encouraged by four decades of close association with the Soviet Union, and by involvement in third world organizations espousing nonalignment but often siding with the Soviet bloc against the West.
When neighbors such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh began to accept free-market economic policies (not to mention closer relations with the United States), Indians seemed to become more, not less, convinced of the rightness if not righteousness of their ways.
When an election approaches, politicians say, parties in India often tend to veer back to their nationalist, Indian socialist roots. The rhetoric of self-reliance and self-assuredness - pitched in earthy terms to millions of Indian villagers and cloaked in anti-Americanism for a traditionally left-of-center intellectual elite - wins votes.
Already, Kamalapathi Tripathi, a longtime politician of Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party, has made an overture to Indian Communists to bury differences and to join to counter the potential strength of the new middle-of-the-road People's Party, which is still framing its domestic policies, and the larger opposition National Front, to which it belongs.
He was rebuffed; the leader of India's Communist Party dismissed Mr. Gandhi as a ''class enemy.'' Indian Communists, in their zeal to upset Mr. Gandhi, are welcoming the formation of an oppositon coalition to the right of them because it would attract more conservative Congress (I) voters while Communists seek to draw off the party's leftists. Criticism From All Sides
The main strength of the People's Party -many of whose leaders, including its president, V.P. Singh, a former Finance and Defense Minister, were members of the Congress (I), is that it could offer a viable, broad-based alternative to Mr. Gandhi's Government. Parties of the Marxist left or radical right could not do this and therefore could not bring down the Gandhi Government alone.
Opposition politicians are now in the process of working out the policies and strategies that they hope will achieve this.
Rajiv Gandhi, who stepped into power within hours of his mother's assassination in 1984 by Sikh members of her bodyguard and then won the election that followed, is being criticized from almost every side these days. But central to much of the discussion is his apparent pragmatic tilt toward the West.
Mr. Gandhi's supporters say that openings to the industrialized world are necessary if India is at last to make the leap into the high technology and large-scale industrial development and raise its standard of living.
His critics, pointing to a recent multimillion-dollar deal that will allow Pepsico Inc. to enter the Indian market, accuse the Prime Minister of succumbing to ''economic imperialism,'' selling out the national heritage and endangering domestic industries that will not be able to compete with the soft-drink and food processing plant that it is setting up.
Pepsi is almost certain to be an election issue, with some opposition politicians pledging to abrogate the contract if the Prime Minister is defeated. One of them, George Fernandes, threw Coca-Cola out of India when he was a minister in an opposition Government in 1978.
But much has changed in 10 years. Many veterans of the independence generation are gone. Their grandchildren attend American, not British, universities. ''American-returned'' prospective spouses are in demand for a generation accustomed to unisex beauty parlors, discotheques and aerobic dance classes, which came late to India and are regularly excoriated as symbols of decadent foreign influence.
In the coming months Indians with new outlooks will be asked to decide who they are and where they want to be led. Decades ago, Nehru, the first Prime Minister, sensed the same searching mood.
''Sometimes as I reached a gathering, a great roar of welcome would greet me: Bharat Mata ki jai! - Victory to Mother India!'' he wrote in ''Discovering India.''
''I would ask them unexpectedly what they meant by that cry, who was this Mother India whose victory they wanted? My question would amuse them and surprise them, and then, not knowing exactly what to answer, they would look at each other and at me.''"

The 57-member bloc says all international legal instruments will be used to hold perpetrators accountable The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has called upon the ad hoc ministerial committee, led by Gambia, to take immediate measures to launch a case of Myanmar's human rights violations against the Rohingyas at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on its behalf. It also affirmed its support for the committee on human rights violations against the Rohingyas in Myanmar, using all international legal instruments to hold accountable the perpetrators of the crimes, according to the final communique issued after the 14th Islamic Summit Conference held in Mecca, Saudi Arabia last Friday, reports UNB. Bangladesh is currently hosting more than 1.1 million Rohingyas in Cox's Bazar -- a vast population which is putting immense economic, environmental and diplomatic pressure on Bangladesh. The OIC's call came after Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the conference sought OIC's help in providing justice to the Rohingyas and ensuring their safe repatriation to Myanmar. Some 750,000 Rohingyas had fled brutal military atrocities in Myanmar's Rakhine state since August 25, 2017. Before them, over 300,000 others fled to Bangladesh after several waves of violence. The conference insisted on the importance of conducting international, independent and transparent investigations into the human rights violations in Myanmar -- including sexual violence and aggression against children -- and to hold accountable all those responsible for these brutal acts in order to give justice to the victims. The 57-member bloc also called for ensuring free and unrestricted access to humanitarian assistance by affected persons and communities. They also reiterated deep appreciation for the people of Bangladesh and the Hasina administration for opening their borders and giving shelter to the forcibly displaced Rohingyas, consistently supporting them with the country's scarce resources. The conference called on the member states to come up generously to share the increasing burden of Bangladesh. Myanmar urged to take steps The Myanmar military has been accused of torching Rohingya villages, killing Rohingyas and even raping Rohingya women -- allegations that rights groups say are tantamount to genocide. Even after signing of deals with Bangladesh and UN agencies on repatriation, the Rohingyas say the conditions in Rakhine are not safe enough for them return and there is no guarantee of citizenship and security. Meanwhile, violence in Rakhine is escalating due to fights between the security forces and the Arakan Army in the recent months and further complicating the situation. The OIC summit welcomed various mechanisms established at international level to improve the situation in Rakhine State, and reiterated its support to regional mechanisms -- particularly Asean -- in conducting the necessary needs assessment to identify areas of cooperation in order to create conducive conditions for the Rohingyas' safe, voluntary, and dignified return. The conference also condemned the inhumane situation in which the Rohingya Muslim community lives, and called for urgent action to end acts of violence and all brutal practices targeting this minority. It also urged giving them their rights without any discrimination or racial profiling. It emphasised that the Myanmar government is fully responsible for the protection of its citizens and underscored the need to stop the use of military power in Rakhine immediately. The conference urged Myanmar to take practical, time-bound and concrete steps to restore the citizenship of Rohingya IDPs and forcibly displaced Rohingya Muslims who were deprived of their nationality, with all associated rights, especially the right to full citizenship. It also urged the country to allow and facilitate the return in safety, security and dignity of all Rohingyas internally and externally displaced, including those forced into taking shelter in Bangladesh. It reaffirmed its commitment to the implementation of the resolutions of OIC summits and ministerial conferences."

In Bogra, flower sellers are concerned as flower sales have fallen compared to previous years In a unique turn of events, Bangladesh will celebrate the Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun, the first day of Bangla calendar month Falgun, on the same day -- today -- this year. The exceptional situation, however, is not the bearer of good news for the country's flower merchants, who make huge profits every year on both of these days that generally falls on consecutive days in February. Pohela Falgun used to fall on February 13. But after the Bangla Academy adjusted the Bangla calendar last year, the day will be celebrated on February 14 from this year on, alongside Valentine's Day. With one day of the celebrations gone, the local flower markets in different districts -- from which florists also sell flowers to the traders in capital Dhaka -- have already reported a slump in retail flower sales.  Also, the absence of buyers -- who are mostly students -- because of the ongoing SSC and equivalent examinations will play a role in this, fear the businesses. In Bogra, flower sellers are concerned as flower sales have fallen compared to previous years. Bogra Flower Merchant Association General Secretary Laxman Das Amit said: ""We have received a smaller amount of flowers from the wholesalers as the prices are high."" ""Also, as both Pohela Falgun and Valentine's Day will be observed on the same day, we are expecting a fall in our business, otherwise these occasions are generally the most profitable days for us every year, now we have only one day for both,"" he told our district correspondent Nazmul Huda Nasim. In Meherpur, flower demand and price have both gone up; however, florists are expecting a one-third drop in their sales target, reports our correspondent Ashraful Islam. Local trader Tutul said: ""This year, the Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun have fallen on the same day, which is also Friday. So, a dip in sales is very likely."" In Sirajganj, flower sellers are already experiencing a loss in business. Usually, they sell around 70,000 flowers during the Pohela Falgun-Valentine's Day celebrations every year, but there is doubt whether they would sell even one-fourth of that today. Local merchants said they would surely face a slump because most of the schools and coaching centres are also closed due to the SSC exams, reports our district correspondent Aminul Islam Khan Rana. In Comilla, florists have also reported a slump in sales, and a hike in prices, despite a rise in demand. Apart from citing the same reasons, they said the prices have gone up as they could not import flowers due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, reports our correspondent Masud Alam. Still, there is hope Meanwhile, in Chuadanga, florists expect to sell flowers worth of Tk30 lakh between today and the International Mother Language Day, which would be observed on February 21, reports our correspondent Mehedi Hasan. Local flower merchant Akul Hossain said roses, tuberose, marigold, gerbera daisy and gladiola flowers are trending and are on high demand in the market. ""We hope to make a good profit during Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun. ""Hopefully, the sale will also be high on February 21."" Demand for flowers along with the cost has also gone up in Nilphamari ahead of Pahela Falgun and Valentine's Day. Local florist Ajgar Ali said he sold flowers worth Tk1.25 lakh since February 1 and expects his sale to go up today, reports our district correspondent Md Taieyb Ali Sarker."

The choi plants are used predominantly in Khulna, Bagerhat, Jessore, and Satkhira Although the use of Chilli (Pepper) in sub-continental food was not noticeable until the Portuguese came to India in the 15th century, yet, the conquest of the hot spice in our palates is persistent and actually thriving till date. The Bangladeshi culinary tapestry, which stemmed from the coalescence of distinctive cultures adapted throughout the establishment and influence of different colonies in India, is famous for its distinctive taste, be it pungent, savoury or sweet. Given the enclosures, with abundant crops and fish, Bengalis adapted a unique spice called Choi Jhal (Piper Chaba), which enabled them to complement their curries with hot, vinegary and aromatic taste, all at once. Choi Jhal, an exquisite spice Choi Jhal, is one of the most popular and unique spices in the south-western region of Bangladesh. The chopped stems, roots and skin of the plant are used while cooking food, especially meat and fish. The choi plants are used predominantly in Khulna, Bagerhat, Jessore, and Satkhira. Choi is a creeper which grows around larger trees. Leaves and stems of the Choi look like betel leaves. Betel and Choi are two species of the same family, Piperaceae. It is a relatively expensive spice in Bangladesh, and the roots are usually more expensive than the stems because of their stronger aroma. How it is used in curries Choi Jhal is mainly used as a taste enhancer. It makes the food hotter and spicier. In Bangladesh the use of Choi Jhal is unique, because the twigs, stems or roots of it, not the fruit, are used as spice.  Curries of beef, mutton and fish can be prepared with Choi Jhal but it is not much popular with vegetables. Commonly a little amount of the dried up Choi Jhal twigs, stems or roots are thrown into the boiling curries, ten to fifteen minutes before the cooking process ends. The softened roots enrich the aroma and flavour of the curry. Though it highly prescribed to use it with garlic and fenugreek, it is suggested by some esteemed cooks not to use it with ginger. Economic prospect of Choi Jhal in Khulna Over the course of time, Choi Jhal became almost extinct from other areas but farmers of the south-western region, Khulna, the third largest city of Bangladesh are cultivating the exquisite spice and earning much with their implicit imports and exports. Nabadip Mollik, a farmer from Dumuria, made it possible to easily commercialise the spice with its original qualities intact, by producing ground Choi Jhal. He said: ""The spice is exquisite and costly but the raw products lose its qualities. With our ground spices it is far easier to use."" Additional Deputy Director, Md Nazrul Islam at Khulna Agricultural Extension Office(KAEO) said demand for the spice is increasing exponentially. ""Not only curry but pickles made of Choi Jhal is delicious as well,"" he said. Choi Jhal has been treating different kinds of diseases and it has a number of herbal uses, specially the antimicrobial and antioxidant active ingredients, the results of this kind of compounds exhibited good to excellent applications, said KAEO Deputy Director Pankaj Kanti Majumdar."

'We have received 10 bodies so far and 35 injured in Civil Hospital' At least 10 people were killed in a suicide blast that hit a police vehicle in south-western Pakistan on Monday, officials said. Two police personnel were among those killed in the blast in the city of Quetta, the capital of Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. ""We have received 10 bodies so far and 35 injured in Civil Hospital,"" a hospital official told Reuters. Two police officers were among the dead, a senior police official confirmed.  The suicide bomber wanted to target rally of a religious group, but blew himself up when police stopped him, Abdul Razzaq Cheema, Quetta police chief, told reporters. Last month, 13 people were killed in Quetta when blast ripped through a mosque during evening prayers. Mineral-rich Balochistan province is at the centre of the $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is part of Beijing's massive Belt and Road infrastructure project. Violence in Balochistan has fuelled concerns about the security of projects such as a planned energy link from western China to Pakistan's southern port of Gwadar."

Being able to separate coronavirus from other common sicknesses such as cold or allergies may save people from unnecessary anxiety The coronavirus (Covid-19) has become an epidemic, infecting more than 100,000 people worldwide. While the chances of any individual person catching the virus are still low, it is natural that people may feel worried every time they get a sore throat or the beginnings of a bad cough. Therefore, being able to separate coronavirus from other common sicknesses such as cold or allergies may save people from unnecessary (or otherwise) anxiety.   If you have itchy eyes or runny nose you probably have allergies or a specific kind of cold ""The issue with seasonal allergies is that they affect the nose and eye,"" says Dr. Greg Poland, a professor of medicine and Infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic and director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. ""They tend to be nasal, and most symptoms are localized to the head, unless you also experience a rash."" Coronavirus and flu symptoms tend to be more systemic ""The flu and the novel coronavirus, these affect other systems and the lower respiratory tract,"" Poland says.  He adds ""You probably won't have a runny nose, but what you might have is a sore throat, a cough, a fever or shortness of breath. So, it's a subtly different clinical diagnosis."" He says it's very unlikely that allergies would lead to a fever. They generally don't cause shortness of breath either, unless the person has a preexisting condition like asthma. Allergy symptoms occur frequently, and are usually mild Dr. Greg Poland says that if you have similar symptoms around the same time each year then you probably have seasonal allergies. Over the counter medication and other regular health precautions may help you feel better in that case, reports CNN. Coronavirus and flu symptoms can retire you to bed rest ""If you have an acute case of coronavirus or flu, you will feel so tired, so achy, you'd basically be driven to bed. Everybody would see the difference,"" Poland says. ""Allergies may make you feel tired, but they're not going to cause severe muscle or joint ache."" Mild flu and cold symptoms usually sort themselves out Proper rest and care will usually heal you from normal illness within a few days.  Coronavirus and severe flu symptoms could get worse over time If you have the flu or coronavirus you may get worse when you expect to get better. ""What would increase the suspicion of coronavirus would be if you were short of breath,"" says Poland. ""People can also develop pneumonia from the flu, which has a similar presentation, so either way you're going to want to seek medical attention."" Allergies, cold, flu and coronavirus could have similar early symptoms Dr. Greg Poland says that initial stages of cold, allergies, flue and coronavirus can look very similar. That is why it is important to notice if the symptoms persist, especially if you are in an at-risk group, reports CNN. ""We're worried about older people, people with asthma or other lung diseases, people with heart disease or diabetes, and also pregnant women,"" he says. Coronavirus cases are usually situational Poland says if you think you have coronavirus any doctor is bound to ask you some contextual questions such as: ""You're like a detective, trying to accept and put together pieces of data,"" he says. ""If someone who hasn't left the middle of Kansas thinks they have the coronavirus, I would say take a Tylenol, have plenty of fluids and rest."" Just because it isn't the coronavirus, doesn't mean it isn't serious The influenza virus has killed several times more people than the coronavirus during the same time period. And yet it is often dismissed as something far less dangerous. Analyzing data on the impact of these diseases may provide better understanding of their seriousness.  Conclusion While unnecessary anxiety of having the coronavirus is best avoided, it is a good idea to stay cautious, take preventive measures, be mindful of your medical history, and routinely check for symptoms."

1988-09-25T05:00:00.000Z
IN THE FALL OF 1986, W. DOUGLASS LEE Jr., an American commodities trader based in London, received a call for help from a representative of a major chemical producer. The United States multinational corporation had sold $8 million in chemicals to Zimbabwe and had agreed to take payment in tobacco rather than cash. The company had resold the tobacco to Egypt and, in the process, had negotiated a $12 million chemicals sale as well. In lieu of cash, Egypt was offering in payment for both deals a shopping list of commodities ranging from pig iron to rice and coriander.
Soon afterward, Lee was on a red-eye flight from London's Heathrow Airport to Cairo, arriving at 4 A.M. on a Monday in November to begin long rounds of negotiations with senior government officials and top executives of Egypt's state-owned enterprises. His mission: to insure that $20 million in hard currency wound up in the company's coffers.
The first trickle of goods traded for cash finally came out of Egypt last February: Lee peddled Egyptian aluminum to a British manufacturer, Egyptian pig iron in Italy and Bangladesh. Sales of Egyptian steel to the Far East are still pending. But the route to obtaining the cash for the chemical company was arduous and littered with obstacles. Over the past 22 months, for instance, Lee has become intimately familiar with Egyptian metals factories, personally inspecting manufacturing methods and quality control and working out the details of product specifications, delivery schedules and pricing contracts.
The negotiating etiquette required lengthy meetings refreshed by rounds of the muddy, nerve-jolting coffee favored by the Egyptians and long talks over late dinners, ending, Lee recalls, ''about 2 A.M. after the belly dancers and everything else.'' There were even political delays, such as the cabinet reshuffle that came the night before Lee was scheduled to have a crucial meeting with Egypt's trade minister, who was ousted in the government shake-up.
''It rarely goes smoothly,'' says Lee, a 40-year-old expatriate who has made his home in England for the last 15 years. ''But when you're successful, the country has a new market for its goods and your client makes its sale and gets its cash.''
DOUGLASS LEE IS ONE OF A NEW BREED OF FREELANCE middlemen who operate on the cutting edge of world trade - the shadowy but expanding niche known as countertrade. In the 1980's, a growing number of American industrial and financial giants such as General Motors, Dow Chemical and American Express have been engaging in the controversial practice, often with the assistance of experts like Lee.
In its broadest sense, the term covers all international trade in which payment is in some form other than cash. A more sophisticated version of barter, the world's oldest form of commerce, countertrade encompasses basic swaps of goods for goods, but also goods for technology, goods for services and even goods for debt.
Countertrade deals such as Lee's three-legged United States-Zimbabwe-Egypt exchange, starting with chemicals and moving through agricultural products and metals to hard currency, are crafted mainly between Western corporations and the world's least creditworthy big customers, the nations of the Eastern bloc and the third world.
Eastern European governments spawned the international countertrade business in the 50's. Communist bureaucrats wanted advanced machinery and factories for postwar development but, lacking sufficient foreign currency, forced Western exporters to accept some of the payment in goods. They still do. Developing countries have been pushed to countertrade by the debt crunch. With foreign loans scarce, they trade goods to buy necessary imports and new technology.
Once shunned by the United States Government and most corporations, countertrade is being reappraised as a tool to open up untapped markets for American products and to help trim the massive trade deficit. ''Countertrade is everywhere now,'' says Leo G. B. Welt, a Washington-based international trade consultant. ''Countries and corporations are increasingly using countertrade as a marketing tool. It gives you a vehicle for doing business when, otherwise, there would be no business.''
Estimates of the size of this gray area of world trade range from 8 percent to more than 25 percent, depending on definition and method of calculation. More than 60 governments now encourage countertrade, including such major developing markets as China, India and Brazil. Indonesia has made countertrade mandatory on most government import contracts. Peru has elected goods-for-debt transactions as the main vehicle for paying off its $6 billion in foreign bank loans. As a result, British and American financial institutions, including Chase Manhattan, First Interstate of California and American Express, are scrambling to find buyers for everything from Peruvian fish meal to Peruvian vacations.
Still, countertrade is frowned upon by global organizations such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the International Monetary Fund. Critics argue that countertrade is not only economically inefficient but also a convenient cover for unfair trade practices and graft.
''COUNTERTRADE IS A WORLD for the lateral thinker, the innovative entrepreneur, the unconventional businessman,'' says Gilbert Nockles, trade finance director of the countertrade unit of Britain's Midland Bank, a leader among banks in the field. It seems an ideal milieu for a freelance operator like Doug Lee, bearded, informal and quick-witted.
The son of a General Electric Company executive who served as an assistant secretary in the Commerce Department during the Nixon Administration, Lee was born in Salem, Mass., and reared in cities on the Eastern seaboard - ''a different one every three years,'' he says - before attending DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind. He graduated in 1970, after spending his junior year at the London School of Economics.
Recalling that turbulent era, Lee says he did not want ''to grow up in a corporate structure, as I saw my father do.'' If life as an organization man did not appeal to him, he quickly admits, neither did he want ''to end up in my 30's in some pensione in Italy or Spain with nothing.''
Becoming a commodities trader appeared to offer a lucrative middle ground. He traded metals in New York for three years but realized that London, the hub of the international metals market, was the place to be. Over the next 12 years, Lee worked for several British trading houses, building a network of contacts.
His social circle extended far beyond the trading rooms. In the 70's, his apartment in Chelsea served as a gathering spot for writers, artists and rock musicians with origins in the counterculture and anti-Vietnam War movement.
Lee came to countertrade by the traditional route, metals trading. Many of the big countertrading houses, such as West Germany's Metallgesellschaft A.G., Austria's Allgemeine Waren-Treuhand Aktiengesellschaft and Philipp Brothers of New York, got into the business through trading and financing metals deals with Eastern bloc nations.
He acquired his first taste of countertrade four years ago, when Rumania offered aluminum coil in payment for tungsten trioxide. Rumania, like many Eastern European nations, did not have the international marketing organization to handle the sale itself. Thereafter, Lee became increasingly interested in countertrade, finding the intricate fashioning of deals more stimulating than the frenetic daily grind of metals trading. Countertrade also presented an entrepreneurial opportunity. In 1985, Lee began working for himself full time, having set up Intertech Resources Ltd. earlier, to handle a few consulting jobs. The business grew slowly, with Lee straining to keep ahead of the American Express bills.
Countertrade is not a get-rich-quick business like commodities trading, Lee says, nor is it as treacherous. He describes it as a service business for which he collects fees without investing his own capital. The risk is in the possibility of the deal's collapsing. Deals require ''front-end loading'' in time and energy, he says, and have to be nurtured. But once they get going, they tend to be rolled over, and generate a steady stream of revenue.
Currently, Lee has a handful of clients, including Dow Chemical, Rank Xerox, Continental Tire and the countertrade arm of Chase Manhattan. Adhering to the unwritten code of confidentiality that governs the business, he will not name the companies that are involved in his deals.
Although he still trades metals, most of his efforts these days are bent toward countertrade. This year he figures Intertech will handle deals valued at $25 million on which he will collect fees of 1 to 10 percent, although usually toward the lower end of that range.
To cope with the increased business, last spring Lee hired two experienced traders, Gordon Davidson, a metals specialist with aviation expertise, and Yvonne Tallantire, a dealer in so-called soft commodities. Tallantire has been involved in trading chemicals in China for frozen vegetables. Intertech Resources markets the snow peas, water chestnuts and mushrooms to such European food companies as pizza chains.
Intertech Resources occupies an unpretentious office on the fifth floor of a converted Victorian residence overlooking Hanover Square in London's fashionable West End. The building's antique cage elevator is shielded from replacement by a historic preservation order. Riding it is the slowest-moving minute and a half in Lee's day. For countertraders, work is usually a matter of juggling several marathon deals at once, keeping in touch with locations spread across a series of continents and time zones by means of telephone, telex and facsimile machine. Frequent travel is a given. To Lee, airports are a second home. He flew 200 times last year, logging 200,000 miles, the equivalent of circling the globe eight times. ''My travel agent loves me,'' Lee says. ''He calls me up for advice.'' Lee travels mostly to places like Bucharest, Skopje, Zagreb and Guangzhou, a far cry from the luxury hotels and Michelin-starred restaurants of the international business circuit. He has learned to welcome the sight of lizards scurrying up the walls of a hotel room in provincial India or China because, he says, ''they're working for you, eating the insects.''
In Rumania, Lee never conducts business in his hotel room; he is sure it is bugged. On more than one occasion, he has been tailed. He was roughed up during a left-wing demonstration in Istanbul, and some third world taxi drivers have come close to transporting him off a cliff.
Corporate clients, even those with in-house countertrade units, hire Lee for his technical expertise and his useful contacts. As a freelance operator, he can sometimes move more easily and wheel and deal a bit more than an employee of a large corporation. ''It doesn't matter what bizarre commodity you hit him with, Lee either knows people who can handle it or he can find them in a few hours,'' says Michael Shaddick, an Australia-based countertrade specialist, who has dealt with Lee. ''He has the contacts to get the deal done.''
Key officials in the national and regional foreign trade organizations of the Soviet bloc know Lee; they answer his telexes and take his telephone calls. ''It's all very personal and there's no replacing the face-to-face contact,'' he says.
Thus, at times, Lee can put together a deal where others fail or get a shipment into or out of a country that a company could not arrange on its own. Last spring, he was called in to rescue a countertrade in Yugoslavia. A major European tire maker had agreed to take payment for tires in the form of zinc oxide, which can be used in tire production. The arrangement was 500 tons of zinc oxide for each shipment of 30,000 tires. ''I was brought in after the deal was signed,'' Lee recalls. ''The meter was running, but no one had ever thought about the packaging problem.'' The tire manufacturer's machinery was made for grappling efficiently with zinc oxide in one-ton polypropylene ''supersacks.'' The Yugoslavian regional corporation used only 55- and 110-pound bags. Lee's assignment was to find a buyer for Yugoslavia's zinc oxide. The large amount was a potential problem, while the matter of the packaging limited its appeal to Western customers. Lee scoured his Eastern bloc contacts and, within three weeks, found a buyer. ''There was only one country that would take that much - the Soviet Union,'' he says. For the countertrader, at least, the planned economies can be extremely efficient because, when a sale is made, they often place huge orders.
Though countertrading may seem a less hectic activity than sitting in front of a computer screen trading commodities, the pressures of time and complexity are enormous. A typical contract will stipulate that if one party does not pay for goods with goods within a specified time, usually 90 to 180 days, it must pay in international currency. ''You've got to be constantly asking yourself, 'Do they have us or do we have them?' '' Lee says.
In the Zimbabwe-Egypt deal, the American company arranged with British banks to set up escrow accounts covering the chemicals sales. So far, two shipments of tobacco worth $3.6 million have been sent from Zimbabwe, reducing that country's account to $4.4 million.
The Egyptian escrow account was not so easily reckoned. Shipments have produced only $600,000 in cash to date. Several deals for commodities on Egypt's list fell through. Trades of salt to Brazil and rice and coriander to Singapore foundered on problems of import licenses and shipping costs; textiles bound for the United States were snagged by quota restrictions. Although contracts can be rolled over, tempers must be kept in check and care taken not to offend third world customers with repeated rejection of their offerings.
When Lee completes trades of Egyptian steel to Taiwan, Singapore and India for dollars - deals he has been working on - the company will have received $13 million in cash. But more than two years will have elapsed before he secures the final payment on the $20 million deal.
Occasionally, the countertrader becomes, in effect, part of the state planning mechanism. In one ongoing program, Lee is taking computer floppy diskettes out of Bulgaria. The state manufacturer is producing five-and-one-quarter-inch floppies. To meet a shift in the world market to smaller diskettes compatible with the new generation of I.B.M. computers, Lee is advising them to gear up for production of a three-and-a-half-inch size. ''If I can teach them how to make their product more marketable, then I'm doing a lot more for that country than by just trading something with them,'' Lee observes.
EVEN THOSE WHO ARE CONcerned about the practice agree that countertrade performs an economically beneficial role by supplying some nations with scarce materials, marketing and manufacturing skills. ''Countertrade can be an efficient way of overcoming handicaps and distortions in economies that are rigidly controlled,'' says Michel Kostecki, an economist with GATT in Geneva. ''That is why one must be careful about condemning countertrade generally and, instead, look at it on a pragmatic case-by-case basis.''
Countertrade comes in many forms, from a straightforward swap of goods to a ''buyback,'' as, for example, when China agrees to buy a television-tube factory from a Japanese manufacturer, but only on the condition that the seller takes part of the payment in television tubes produced by the plant. ''Offsets'' are increasingly required to sell arms and commercial aircraft, even in deals involving Western countries. Two years ago, Britain agreed to buy six airborne warning and control aircraft from the Boeing Company for $1.3 billion only after the American manufacturer promised to farm out $1.30 worth of work on various projects to British subcontractors for every $1 spent on its Awacs.
There is one common thread to countertrade: Buyers are using their purchasing power to guarantee markets for their exports. Critics say countertrade deals are a regressive step toward ''bilateralism'' - restrictive, two-way trade - instead of multilateral free trade. So GATT, the World Bank, the I.M.F. and other official bodies view countertrade as a practice that tends to dampen growth.
Companies invariably tack a premium onto the price of the products they trade to countries that insist on paying with goods because the sellers expect to be forced to resell what they take in exchange at cut-rate prices. As a result, the country pays above-market prices for its imports while its exports are being dumped on international markets.
BECAUSE COUNTERTRADE deals are less visible than cash transactions, it is easier to hide such unfair trade practices as subsidies and dumping, as well as illicit payments and graft.
A countertrader like Lee, with American clients, must operate in the gray area between pragmatism and illegality. One delicate matter is the use of agents. ''There are some countries where you simply won't get in to see the key people without hiring the right agent,'' Lee says. ''American companies may not like it, but it's a fact of life.''
He stresses that he would never knowingly hand out a bribe, but admits that agents' commissions (typically, 1 to 5 percent) do open the door to corruption. ''But if the agent gives a kickback to some government official, I don't know about it,'' he says.
In Washington, the regulatory climate concerning overseas payments seems to be easing. The trade bill that President Reagan signed last month includes amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that contain exceptions to the ban on payments and gifts to officials to influence a business decision. And there are other signs that attitudes are moderating as countertrade grows.
''The United States is at a turning point, where companies are deciding whether they are going to make the investment and effort to be competitive globally,'' says Fred Howell, an international economist at the Commerce Department. Last March, Commerce Secretary C. William Verity Jr. told Congress that barter was ''essential'' to America's drive to boost exports. More countertrade was likely, Verity predicted, ''for the simple reason that if we increase exports, as we hope, a lot of developing countries are going to have to pay for them and there is a limit to their liquidity.'' The 1988 trade bill calls for the setting up of an Office of Barter within the Commerce Department to examine how companies can exploit countertrade opportunities.
Increasingly, American corporations are doing just that. Dozens of America's biggest companies, such as McDonnell Douglas, Caterpillar, Fluor and Pepsico, as well as the banks, have in-house countertrade teams. But the business can be risky for the unskilled and overly ambitious, as the experience of Sears World Trade proved. The retailing giant set up a countertrade arm in 1982 with a staff of 1,000. After four years of red ink, the subsidiary was shut down.
''Countertrade is a more difficult and higher-risk business,'' says Charles J. Borg, global manager of the countertrading arm Dow Chemical set up in Zurich four years ago. ''But it does exist. You can't ignore half the world and have any genuine global growth strategy. And if you want to grow, you have to help them.''
Perhaps the most innovative bank deals are the debt-for-export programs under way in Peru. The banks are trying to recover some of the $6 billion they lent to Lima by taking out such items as shellfish, asparagus, onions, garlic, copper wire and wood products. For every $3 generated by such sales, the banks will keep $1 and give the rest to Peru.
Britain's Midland Bank signed the first such debt-for-export deal in 1987 and began marketing Peruvian goods earlier this year. ''At the time, there was some debate as to whether this is the sort of thing banks should do,'' notes Gilbert Nockles of Midland. ''But now, everybody and his brother is down there trying to do the same thing.''
Lee is currently working on a few proposals in Brazil, another country with crippling bank debt. He hopes to double Intertech's volume of countertrade deals by entering new markets like Brazil as well as by increasing activity in Eastern Europe and Asia. But there is one commodity he refuses to handle - a carryover from his youth in the counterculture. ''I get offered arms all the time, but I never touch them,'' he says. ''It's a moral thing for me. I just won't.''
Lee derives an income from his business ''in the low six figures,'' he says. It affords him a comfortable style of life. Divorced from an English wife, he tries to spend every other weekend with their three children, ages 11, 14 and 16. He has a house in the London borough of Chiswick and belongs to two private clubs, Groucho's, a hangout for people in the arts and advertising, and the Royal Automobile Club. ''I could never get into the real English clubs,'' he says cheerfully. He has ample firsthand knowledge of the city's night life, though he insists that his pace has slowed. He now tries to begin his days in London at 6:30 A.M., working out on a Nautilus machine.
He is also studying Mandarin, building on a linguistic capability he describes as ''restaurant French, German and Spanish.'' For Lee, it's strictly business: ''I want to pick up enough to be seen as making the effort in those Chinese deals.''"

Prayer 'can be performed at home due to the coronavirus preventive measures' Saudi Arabia's Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdulaziz Al al-Sheikh, the highest religious authority in the country, said that Muslim prayers during Ramadan and for the subsequent Eid al-Fitr feast should be performed at home if the coronavirus outbreak continues, Saudi's Okaz newspaper reported on Friday. ""Ramadan's Taraweeh (evening) prayer can be performed at home if it cannot be performed at mosques due to the preventive measures taken to fight the spread of coronavirus,"" he said in response to a question, adding that the same applies for Eid prayers, according to the paper. The holy fasting month of Ramadan begins next week. Saudi Arabia in mid-March stopped people performing their five daily prayers and the weekly Friday prayer inside mosques as part of efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus. On Thursday, the Prophet's Mosque in the holy city of Medina said it was banning events which dispense evening meals in the mosque to those in need during Ramadan to break their daily fast.

The planning minister said concerned experts from Bangladesh Army in cooperation with the experts from Russian Federation would implement the project The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) has approved the Physical Protection System (PPS) Project for Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant with an estimated cost of Tk3,449.05 crore in a bid to ensure the security of the plant. The approval came at an Ecnec meeting, with its chairperson and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair, held at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area on Tuesday. While briefing reporters after the meeting, Planning Minister MA Mannan said a total of 6 projects involving an overall estimated cost of Taka 4,447.76 crore were approved, reports BSS. ""Of the total project cost, Tk4,439.86 crore will come from the state exchequer while the rest of Tk7.90 crore will come from the organization's own fund,"" he said. Of the approved six projects, five are new while the other is a revised project. The minister said the Nuclear Security and Physical Protection System Cell and Bangladesh Army, Army Headquarters, GS Section (coordination) will implement the project by March 2023. The main project objectives include ensuring security to the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant through implementing the physical protection system side by side, creating a supporting environment for generating safe and protected nuclear power. It also aims to face the risks generating from Design Basis Threat (DBT) or outside of DBT for the nuclear power plant. The planning minister said concerned experts from Bangladesh Army in cooperation with the experts from Russian Federation would implement the project. A bilateral protocol between Bangladesh and the Russian Federation was signed on September 17 last year and in light of that agreement, the project has been undertaken. According to the Planning Commission, establishing nuclear security infrastructures is indispensable for implementing any nuclear power plant project and it is also separate from the construction work of nuclear power plant. Besides, establishing an effective national nuclear security infrastructure is also very much important as a precondition for setting up a nuclear power plant. The main project operations include some 300 acres of land acquisition, 1214678 cubic meter of land development, public works for security and physical protection system."

Recalling the long history and close relations between the two countries, Malikzad said his country is keen to promote trade and business relations with Bangladesh Newly appointed Afghan Ambassador to Bangladesh Abdul Qayoom Malikzad on Wednesday requested Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to reopen Bangladesh's diplomatic mission in Kabul, to renew the historical and cultural relations between the two countries. The ambassador made the request when he made a courtesy call on the premier at Ganabhaban in Dhaka on Wednesday, said PM's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim, reports BSS. Recalling the long history and close relations between the two countries, Malikzad said his country is keen to promote trade and business relations with Bangladesh. Afghanistan was one of the first countries that recognized Bangladesh after its independence, he said, appreciating Bangladesh's economic progress and graduation from the LDC to the status of developing countries. Welcoming the newly appointed Afghan Ambassador in Dhaka, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stressed strengthening the trade relations between Dhaka and Kabul, saying that Bangladesh gives value to relations with its neighbours. Bangladesh imports a huge amount of dry foods from Afghanistan every year and Afghanistan can import high quality medicine from Bangladesh, she said. Congratulating Sheikh Hasina for her party's victory in the last general election, the Afghan envoy underscored the need for strengthening cooperation between the two countries, especially between its chambers of commerce. Sheikh Hasina said people voted for her party as they benefit when the Awami League comes to power. She said her government is running the country with commitment to meet the basic needs of people, as dreamt by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In this regard, the prime minister highlighted her government's social safety net program for the marginalized people, saying financial support is being provided for promotion of education of poor families and distressed people under the program. Sheikh Hasina also drew a line between the economic progress of Bangladesh and Pakistan after the independence.  ""After the independence, the exchange rate of Bangladeshi Taka and Pakistani Rupee was 1.56 and 1.00. Now the rate is 1.00 and 1.66,"" she said. The Afghan envoy informed the prime minister that the two countries are waiting to sign five memorandums of understanding (MoU). He also informed the prime minister that democracy in his country is progressing and expressed his willingness to import more pharmaceutical items from Bangladesh. Principal Secretary Md Nojibur Rahman and PMO Secretary Sajjadul Hasan were also present."

PM Hasina to hold exclusive meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping Bangladesh and China have planned to take their 'strategic partnership' to a new height when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visits the country next month. Beijing has invited Prime Minister Hasina to pay an official visit from July 1-5, a senior official in Dhaka told UNB, saying that both sides are finalizing things for the important visit. The Chinese government also invited the Prime Minister to attend the annual meeting of the ""New Champions"" which is known as ""Summer Davos"" to be held in Dalian, July 1-3. It will be Sheikh Hasina's first bilateral visit to Beijing following her party's victory in the last parliamentary election. She will have meetings with President Xi, and Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and discuss ways to strengthen cooperation in broader areas. A good number of bilateral documents are likely to be signed during the visit. Prime Minister Hasina is expected to have an exclusive meeting, on July 2, with the founder and Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum (WEF) Prof Klaus Schwab in Dalian. She is also expected to be a panelist at a session on Cooperation in the Pacific Rim at the WEF Dalian. Beijing has already placed five specific suggestions for deepening Bangladesh-China strategic partnership of cooperation with an emphasis on strengthening 'strategic mutual trust'. ""First, we need to deepen strategic mutual trust, and then we need to deepen economic integration,"" Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Zhang Zuo said at Cosmos Dialogue recently.  Other suggestions put forward by him were to deepen interaction, have stronger cooperation on security, cultural exchange, and people's connectivity. He said that China wants to join hands with Bangladesh to become good partners with equality, and mutual trust. Summer Davos, themed 'Leadership 4.0: Succeeding in a New Era of Globalization', is bringing together leaders from every sector, and every part of the world to discuss how to cooperate on the challenges ahead. Globalization 4.0 represents fundamental changes in the global economy that are reshaping companies, communities, and countries at an unprecedented scale. These changes are driven by environmental challenges, regional competition, economic disparities, and technological disruption. They, in turn, require different forms of leadership, and collaboration adapted to this new era of globalization. Platform strategies, and systems leadership are key business concepts behind the sweeping technological changes propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Leadership 4.0 requires an understanding of how new champions, that are gaining economic influence, are disrupting. and transforming current industry models. WEF engages leaders who have the vision, and values to shape the future in this new context. The Annual Meeting of the New Champions is designed as the foremost global summit on innovation, and entrepreneurship with more than 1,500 participants, 100 working sessions, and community activities, along with the opportunity to engage in several new forum initiatives."
126,"India Trade Dispute Brings Austerity to Nepal
1989-05-25T05:00:00.000Z
The Nepalese Government, digging in for a long siege in a trade war with India that is being seen here as a test of Nepalese sovereignty, has introduced austerity measures and started reordering its development plans, officials here say.
Since India closed all but two border crossings two months ago, ostentatious living has been forbidden in the Hindu kingdom, where most of the 18 million people are poor. Social gatherings, including wedding receptions, are being monitored, officials of the Government of King Birendra said in interviews.
At their most optimistic, Nepalese officials and business leaders say they will make the most of a cutoff of Indian consumer goods by encouraging local industries to fill the vacuum. New sources of imports and markets for exports are being sought. But some local business leaders and diplomats say serious problems are developing.
India, through which most of landlocked Nepal's imports and exports pass, closed 19 of the 21 border crossings on March 23, and a week later allowed petroleum products agreements to lapse, depriving Nepal of fuel.
At the root of the dispute is Nepal's insistence on two treaties, one for trade and one for transit rights. India wants one, as it had before 1978. As the dispute drags on, diplomats here say, it becomes more apparent that Katmandu wants to review all its relations with New Delhi, embodied in a 1950 treaty now described as ''colonial.''
To the surprise of some diplomats, the Nepalese, most of whom cannot afford imported luxuries, appear to have closed ranks behind King Birendra's Government. Officials are reported to have concluded that the dispute with New Delhi will probably not be resolved until after India's elections, expected near the end of this year.
A good harvest of wheat and mustard seed, from which edible oil is made, has reduced fears of a serious food shortage. Medicines are being flown in from Bangladesh, the Government spokesman, Radhe Shyam Bista, said. Black-market trading is also going on along the India-Nepal border.
Royal Nepal Airlines has been able to fly in enough fuel from Dhaka to restore all domestic air links and sustain international routes, Mr. Bista said. But taxis and private cars have been made idle by shortages, causing tourism's biggest problem, and a number of restautants have closed.
On the surface, daily life in the Katmandu Valley appears to be continuing without serious interruption, with limited diesel and gasoline supplies arriving from China or Singapore. India is allowing transit of essential goods.
But business leaders and diplomats suggest a ''hidden crisis'' is developing as Government and private projects wind down and the poorest day laborers lose jobs. Tourism has also been affected. May and June are traditionally the month when Indian tourists fill hotels vacated by Westerners.
Government departments have been ordered to stop buying furniture, vehicles and land. Foreign visits and official receptions are being curtailed and the use of cars restricted.
The behavior of ''dignitaries and distinguished persons'' will be watched to determine whether they are obeying a recently enacted Social Reform Act forbidding lavish entertaining and other unneccessary expense.
Officials say a program for greater self-sufficiency in essential goods will be introduced. Large-scale development projects will also be reviewed."

1988-09-03T05:00:00.000Z
LEAD: Dazzling advances in research and ever-increasing harvests in many developing countries have not been able to protect the world's poor from malnutrition. But a simple rethinking of the ways governments give food assistance may achieve what high tech has not.
Dazzling advances in research and ever-increasing harvests in many developing countries have not been able to protect the world's poor from malnutrition. But a simple rethinking of the ways governments give food assistance may achieve what high tech has not.
Such rethinking is now under way in some of the neediest and most debt-distressed countries. The best of their new food programs show that it is possible to reduce malnutrition substantially, quickly and affordably - without fostering dependence on welfare. The key is to target food program to those in need. Obvious? Yes, but too many programs have squandered benefits on those who do not require special attention.
Until recently, Brazil's annual $1 billion wheat subsidy was available to the rich and poor alike. In a number of African countries, subsidies go to foods like meat and butter, which are out of the reach of the poor even with the subsidy - and the poor continue to go hungry.
An income test would seem the most sensible approach to deciding who gets benefits, but it is often unworkable. Even in the United States, where income reporting is systematized, the food stamp program has been jeopardized by charges of abuse. In the developing world, where income is less documented and often takes the form of food a family grows for itself, determining eligibility by income is next to impossible.
Some countries have found creative, alternative ways to reach the neediest. They target programs by place, type of food, age and signs of faltering growth in children, or even by season. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, several countries are beginning to concentrate food resources in scarce months, before the harvest, when malnutrition is most severe.
Thailand and Brazil now focus on regions where malnutrition is concentrated, in the northeast of both countries. Several Brazilian states have gone further. They target the favelas, the very poor neighborhoods, by subsidizing basic foods for customers of small stores. Because better-off Brazilians prefer not to journey into favelas, even for lower prices, the benefits go to those who need them. In Colombia, poverty is scattered throughout the country. So the Government ranked each county according to poverty criteria such as infant mortality and access to health care. Food coupons were distributed to the needy in the 30 percent of counties ranking lowest in these categories.
Some countries target by subsidizing foods consumed primarily by the poor. In Bangladesh, rice is the preferred grain for those with money; thus, a subsidy on sorghum, which is nutritionally splendid, benefited only those too poor to buy rice. Morocco, which is restructuring its subsidies to emphasize foods eaten by the poor, expects to give the poor greater nutritional benefits for one-fifth the former cost. This year, Mexico established a similar but even larger program than Morocco's, dismantling many of its generalized subsidies.
Tamil Nadu, a state in India, targets a food and nutrition education program in the poorest areas for those at greatest risk. Nutrition workers in 9,000 villages weigh children monthly and provide daily feedings for 90 days to those whose growth is faltering. At the same time, they teach mothers of underweight children how to improve nutrition at home within their means. High-risk pregnant and breast-feeding women also receive food.
The benefit of the Tamil Nadu project has been dramatic and enduring. Serious malnutrition has declined by about 50 percent. Two years after children complete the program they are, on average, a significant four pounds heavier than children who did not participate. Sri Lanka is now developing a similar program.
What makes all of these targeted programs so attractive is that they are cost-effective. Food stamps and other broad subsidies often eat up 10 to 20 percent of national budgets. But the new programs get better results at projected costs of only 1 to 2 percent of national budgets, and overall costs are much lower than in conventional approaches. Because these programs provide food only when or where it is most needed, they are less likely to foster a welfare mentality.
None of this is to suggest that alleviating the underlying causes of poverty should not remain the most important goal. Education, jobs and access to land are all sorely needed. But the poorest cannot wait. A direct attack on malnutrition is needed as well, and governments willing to make that effort now have effective and affordable measures to make it happen."

""The Prime Minister will deliver her directives to the deputy commissioners, assessing the overall situation across the country with regards to coronavirus,"" he added. Principal Secretary of Prime Minister Ahmad Kaikaus, on Monday, held a videoconference with divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners in preparation of the Prime Minister's videoconference scheduled for Tuesday. Bangladesh has so far recorded five deaths in the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 global pandemic."
136,"Excerpts From the News Conference Given by Bush in Paris
1989-07-17T05:00:00.000Z
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference in Paris yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times: OPENING STATEMENT
Well, we've just concluded two and a half days of intensive and productive meetings with the summit counterparts on economic and political issues.
And let me take this opportunity first of all to thank President Mitterrand for his most gracious hospitality.
The summit, in my view, was a clear success. We met in a time of sustained economic growth and agreed that the prospects are good for the continued expansion without inflation of that growth. It was against this backdrop that we conducted a wide-ranging discussion on critical global issues, from East-West relations to the growing environmental challenge that we face.
We came to Paris at a truly remarkable moment. The winds of change are bringing hope to people all around the world. And who would have thought just a few short years ago that we would be witness to a freely elected Senate in Poland or political pluralism in Hungary.
I was really touched by what I saw and heard in those two countries - people determined to keep their dreams alive, people determined to see a Europe whole and free. Backing Hungarians and Poles
And that's why America brought to this summit our determination to support the reform movement in Hungary and Poland. People yearning for freedom and democracy deserve our support. And it's because of the community of values shared by these summit countries that we were able to agree to meet soon to discuss concerted action that'll help Poland and Hungary.
Democracy and economic growth go hand in hand, whether in Eastern Europe, the Summit Seven, or the developing world. And, therefore, much of our discussion here in Paris centered on economics. We reaffirmed our international economic cooperation and our whole policy coordination process.
Our strength and debt strategy was firmly supported. We reaffirmed our determination to maintain and improve the multilateral trading system, calling for the completion of the Uruguay Round by the end of 1990 and extending the GATT to new areas, including agriculture.
This summit marked a watershed on the environment. And we agreed that decisive action is urgently needed to preserve the Earth. We committed to work together as well as with the developing world to meet our responsibility of global stewardship. 1990 Meeting in U.S.
The measures we've agreed to in Paris are timely and they lay the groundwork for further specific steps when we meet again next year in the United States.
And, finally, I was especially pleased to find that my colleagues share our sense of urgency and sense of the importance of the worldwide fight against drugs. Among other steps, we agreed to establish a financial action task force to find new ways to track and prevent the laundering of drug money.
I look forward to meeting my summit colleagues in the United States next year as we continue working on these and other priority issues, build on the progress that we made -genuine progress that I think was made here in Paris.
And I might say that I was very pleased that this meeting coincided with the bicentennial here. It was a very moving experience for all of us. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Gorbachev's Offer Now I will be glad to take any questions. Helen.
Q. Mr. President, . . . Mr. Gorbachev wants to play a part in the world economic discussions. Would he be welcome at the next economic summit table?
A. Well, I think that's a little premature. But it was very interesting, I found, that a leader of the Soviet Union would address a letter to the French President as head of this year's summit. We talked about that letter a great deal. There's an awful lot that has to transpire in the Soviet Union, it seems to me, before anything of that nature would be considered.
We're talking about free market economies here. And, but - I found fascinating the very fact of the letter. But there was no -there certainly - I don't think any indication that the next - that he will be attending the next summit. He'll get a very courteous and very thoughtful reply from Mr. Mitterrand. Role of Small Nations
Q. How about the . . . countries - Bangladesh - would they ever be welcome?
A. Well, this is an economic summit of countries whose economies were drawn together by the free economies of the West. And so I don't think there's a question at this point of expanding the summit. There is concern about the economies in the world that aren't doing so well.
Now Bangladesh is a country that does need aid and, indeed, the communique addressed itself to trying to help Bangladesh. Yeah. Wait a minute, excuse me, Terry, and then go.
Q. Mr. President, you've consulted with the NATO allies on military matters in Brussels, and then you've had an economic summit here in Paris. What's left before you sit down with Mr. Gorbachev for a superpower summit?
A. A little more time, I think.
Q. Don't you have anything to discuss with him now that you've got all this groundwork laid?
A. Oh sure. Let me explain to those who aren't familiar with the policy that Secretary Baker had met a couple of times with Mr. Shevardnadze. There will be another such meeting of that nature. And at an appropriate time, I will have a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev. But I don't think anything at the summit influences a bilateral - that bilateral meeting. Criticism on Environment
Q. Mr. President, the summit calls for decisive action on the environment, but various environmental groups are saying that you did not take decisive action. Could you respond to that?
A. Well, I did see some one or two groups. They didn't think I took decisive action when I sent up - or took proper action when I sent a very far-reaching clean air proposal up to the Congress. And so some have been critical.
Many have been supportive on the broad -the very fact - I'll tell you where we got a lot of support is the very fact that the communique addressed itself with some specificity to various environmental goals. The whole concept of cooperation on research technology and transfer to the L.D.C.'s; the prevention of pollution; the idea of setting up monitoring stations so we can better predict and thus avoid environmental disaster.
There were - there was a lot of common ground - in fact, I would say that on that and perhaps anti-narcotic, there was most fervor. And so I think many environmental groups see the very fact that this matter was on the front burner as being very positive. And the summit did take - make strong enough statements to commit all of our members and hopefully others around the world to sound environmental practice. Poland and Hungary
Q. Mr. President, you promised in Poland and Hungary that you would seek concerted action on the part of the countries meeting here to help those countries. Now there seems to have been a pledge that there would be concerted consideration of actions - no dollar figure attached and no specified action promised - and a meeting apparently planned. Do you feel you got what you wanted, sir?
A. I think so. And you'll notice, Brit, that in both Poland and Hungary I stopped well short of setting dollar figures or challenging others to meet dollar figures. But on this one let there be no doubt there was unanimity that we should address ourselves to the problems of Poland and Hungary, and so I was not disappointed. I didn't go in there with a specific package of - with dollar figures on it. And I think an early meeting to do just that is good.
It called for food aid to Poland; that's specific. It doesn't have a figure on it, but - no, I think we got what we sought. And there was no rancor on that question, and no division on the question. But there was unanimity that we have to move on it. Yeah, Owen. Reaction to Gorbachev
Q. . . .What is an appropriate response from the West to such an extraordinary request by Mr. Gorbachev to become part of the economy of the Western democracies?
A. We would welcome any movement by the Soviet Union towards market-oriented or Western economies. There's no question about that. And there's nothing begrudging about our saying - in replying to Helen's comment - in my replying to Helen's that I don't expect Mr. Gorbachev to sit as a member of the - at next year's summit. But the discussion was - it started off by, What do you think he means by this? And a lot of discussion - we'll get the experts to analyze it. And all of that took place. And people concluded that it was just one more manifestation of the changing world we're living in. And that, I think, was the main message. And then where we go from here, his -some of that has been addressed in the communique, because we talked in there about help for the third world. And some of his letter, as you know, was on that very subject. So it was - when it came in, Mr. Mitterrand read it off to the group there and then said, Well, what will we do? And my suggestion was - which he had intended to adopt anyway - that he, as the man to whom the letter was addressed, would reply to it.
So that's the way it was. And the fact that it's happening, taking place. The President of the United States can go to Eastern Europe and witness the very kind of change we're talking about.
I'll tell you - I want to get to the reply to Carl's question here - but the most, almost the most dramatic for me was when Mr. Nemeth, the Prime Minister of Hungary, handed me that piece of barbed wire, tearing down the Iron Curtain between Hungary and Austria. Now who would have thought that possible? And this letter, just one more manifestation of the exciting times we're in, of change. They're moving toward our open system, our free system, our system of free election. And that's the way I would look at the letter in that context. Carl. A Summit in Texas?
Q. Mr. President, in connection with next year's summit, there's been some talk among some of your people about possibly having it in your own state of Texas, possibly in San Antonio. And I wondered whether you'd like to see that?
A. Well, I'd have to run that by The Dallas Morning News and see how they felt about it. But that's a distinct possibility. However, it's too early; no decision has been made. The fact that Jim Baker's from Houston and I'm from Houston and Bob Mosbacher's from Texas should have nothing to do with where the next summit's going to be. And there has been no decision.
Q. That wouldn't mean some discrimination against Dallas because of your roots?
A. No, none whatsoever. Get that down: The fall elections are up in 199 - ummm. Charles. Style of the Summit
Q. Let me follow on the question about the summit. These things have gotten a lot bigger than they were originally planned to be. Hundreds of your people, thousands of us. It's your first summit, but you've got to host the next one. Have you given any thought to how you want to do it in terms of style?
A. No. But I'll tell you the part - and I'm the new boy, the new kid in school - but the part I found most interesting was the unstructured part, the part where you sit with these other leaders, tell them what you think, listen carefully to what they think. And that happened sometimes in the corridors or sometimes before a structured seminar, sometimes at a meal. And I would like to think that the more emphasis we placed on that kind of interaction, the better it would be.
But there was no discussion by the Soviet - the summit interlocutors on how to restructure it. Indeed, it went smoothly. And that - I will again say that Mr. Mitterrand handled the formal part very well. But for me, I'd like to see more just plain unstructured interaction between the leaders where you don't just have to talk on the agenda items. Yeah, yeah, John. Money for Space
Q. It'll be 20 years ago next Thursday that man first landed on the Moon. . . . your Administration . . . to announce on Thursday we're going to go back to the Moon, possibly even to Mars. Can you and Dick Darman find that kind of money in the budget?
A. Well, you put your finger, John, on some of the real problems - the major problem -on setting major goals for space, space exploration. And whether we will be ready by next week and - or later this week to make any momentous announcements, I'm not sure. I have not made a decision on what we will say on that historic day.
Q. Wouldn't it be cheaper if you went in with the Soviets on it, though?
A. Well, that has been suggested. But -and some, as you know, some discussions have gone on, not, I don't think, recently between us and the Soviets on this. But certainly the concept of international is not offensive to me. But we'll have to wait and see, because no decision - we're going to go right across and work our way back down here. Weakening of Economy
Q. Mr. President, Friday's economic indicators showed some weakening of the U.S. economy. Apparently some of your summit partners expressed some concern about that. What assurance did you give them - and can you give us - that we're not headed for a recession?
A. Well, you know, ironically, none did express to me their concern about the U.S. economy stalling out. We really didn't get into that discussion. I must say that from time to time it is a matter of concern to me, and thus I've tried to think through with our Secretary of the Treasury and others the concept of how the interest rate structure should be. But I've had no indication from home, nor have we picked up any here, that they felt that the U.S. economy was going to move towards a recession. And that's the thing, of course, that you'd want to guard against.
Our growth has not been as robust as the growth in some other countries, but it -we're still moving. And when you have a several trillion dollar gross national product, you take a small percentage of growth and it makes for enormous dollar figures in growth. The Soviet Economy
Q. Mr. President, how much change would the Soviet Union have to make before they could earn an invitation to next year's economic summit? And if you can't answer that specifically, at least could you give us some sense of scale?
A. Well, one, as you know, I have welcomed the reforms that are taking place in the Soviet Union. But I don't - this concept of the Soviets coming to a G Seven summit has never been, to my knowledge, thought much about until this letter appeared, so there's no standards for entrance into the G Seven.
The Soviet economy needs a lot of work. And I say that not to be critical, but certainly that's an objective judgment. The economy is in bad, bad shape. Far worse shape than the, oh, Western economies. And so I think what we ought to do is to encourage the kinds of economic changes in Eastern Europe and, to the degree the Soviet would not consider that an intervention into their internal affairs, in the Soviet Union. And that - those should be the next steps. Welcome the - welcome the interest that was shown by this letter. This wasn't an application for admission to the G Seven; it was saying let's do something in a common way about solving problems around the world. Europe's Future
Q. Mr. President, you've talked about a whole and united Europe, and Mr. Gorbachev has talked about a common European home. Are they the same concepts, or what is the difference? Is there a difference between the role of the U.S. in those two statements?
A. Europe whole and free is our concept. His common European home is fine so long as, as I've said earlier, you can move from room to room. And that means a - coming along further on human rights; that means much more openness. It means support them when you see the move toward perestroika and glasnost.
But it means an evolution in the Soviet Union. And it means an evolution in Eastern Europe. And we've begun to see it. A Europe whole and free does not visualize a Europe where you still have barbed wire separating some people. Or you still have human rights abuses in one or two of the countries that are egregious.
And so it is whole and free, and the common home theme is a good one. I mean that's a very good theme, and we should encourage it. But we want to see these countries continue to move towards what works, and what works is freedom, democracy, market economy, things of that nature.
Q. Mr. President, in the meeting of the G Seven, is there room or does - did you sense that the countries want U.S. leadership or they want the U.S. to be a coequal partner?
A. You mean with the Soviets?
Q. Yes.
A. No, I sense that they - that those colleagues feel that we have disproportionate responsibility. I think there's a keen interest in how I will work with the Soviets. There's no question about that. I felt that very clearly. Serious Change in East
Q. Mr. President, going back to the other day in Poland, an elderly man said that when people talk to you folks about change, just remember that the Communists still have the bayonet. So my question to you is, do you believe that countries like Poland and Hungary are really going to have serious and permanent change, or is there a line that their leaders and that Moscow just won't go past?
A. Well, no, I think that you've already seen serious change. I think you see the political situation in Hungary, for example, is absolutely amazing compared to the way we used to view Hungary. And if the Soviet Union, instead of taking their troops out of Hungary had tried to tighten down, I don't expect we'd see the kind of change in Hungary that we're seeing today.
And so I'd say that we're a long way from what Gorbachev has spelled out as a common European home, but it's moving. So let's encourage the progress.
Q. Mr. President,. . . there is a course that's going to lead to a permanent change or again the question is are the Soviets going to step in and pull the rug out from under it some day.
A. Well, I would quote Mr. Gorbachev's words back to him on that when he told me in New York and what Jim Baker has heard from Shevardnadze and what everybody who interacts with the Soviets here. And that is that perestroika is for real; that you cannot set the clock back; it is going to go forward. And so I would see that as what guides now. However, I have said as long as there are enormous imbalances in conventional forces and in certain categories of strategic forces, the West should keep its eyes wide open. And indeed there was some reference to that in this communique. There was unanimity on the part of the NATO allies that we ought to be cautious and that we - and so to answer your question, it's not done - it's not a done deal. On the Cold War
Q. As you put all of this together, what you said about Poland and Hungary and Gorbachev asking to join the world economy, as a matter of policy do you see the cold war as over, and do you think the West has won?
A. I don't like to use, quote, cold war, unquote. That, that, that - there's a connotation, has a connotation of worse days in terms of East-West relationship. I think things have moved forward so that the connotation that those two words conjure up are - is entirely different now. And yet I don't want to stand here and seem euphoric that everything is hunky-dory between the East and the West on arms or on differences in economy or on how we look at regional problems. We have some big differences still.
But let's encourage the change, and then I can answer your question in a few more -maybe a few more years more definitively. Yes.
Q. Mr. President, the summit seven leaders are celebrating a gathering that was so successful it went for two and a half days instead of three. Could you not find another half-day's worth of problems to discuss and maybe resolve, sir?
A. We were kind of running out of gas. I'll tell, it's been a vigorous experience in physical fitness for me, and I try to stay in pretty good shape. But this one, when you couple the summit with the bicentennial and then tack on Poland and Hungary, I wasn't about to argue that we needed more time and - nor was anyone else. I think the fact that this rather complex agenda was completed in harmony is the fact that ought to really carry the spotlight, not the fact that we finished in advance. There's going to be plenty of opportunities to discuss a lot more problems that exist around the world. The Stealth Bomber
Q. Mr. President, the Stealth bomber had a couple of setbacks this week. And Senator Nunn, as I understand it, indicated that he's not going to pay for a plane that just taxis. Do you have faith in this project or are you alarmed by the recent developments?
A. Well, it's Senator Nunn and 250 million other Americans that pick up the bill for it. But if he's not going to pay for it, I mean, it's a, it's a decision that the Congress is going to have take collectively. If Senator decides it isn't a good idea, it's going to be a whale of a fight. But I think that legitimate questions have been raised about this - the bomber. And Secretary Cheney has addressed them very forcefully, giving the Administration's position.
Q. Mr. President, you're giving away money to Poland and Hungary, and you're talking about spending more money on the environment and there are a lot of needs at home, and now you're in a new budget cycle. Is this the time - and you promised today to reduce the deficit, the U.S. budget deficit - is this the time to announce that it's necessary to raise taxes in the United States?
A. No.
Q. How are you going deal with that?
A. Well, we've already got a proposal up on the Hill and look at it very carefully. And our director of the O.M.B. has done a very good job in sorting out priorities. He's worked -and our Cabinet has given him full cooperation. And the proposals that I have made can be and are included in our budget thinking, not just for this year but beyond. But you put your finger on something that does trouble me. When I come to countries like Poland and Hungary, I wish we did have more, more funds with which to help others, encourage private investment and public-private partnerships and privitization. I wish we had much more to do there or speedily apply to environmental concerns or anti-narcotics cooperation.
So I don't want to sound like we have it all made at all. We've had to sort through priorities in a very complicated way. But to answer your question, you have to go up to the question that was earlier asked about the economy itself. And I do not want to risk screeching growth, modest though it may be, to a halt by raising revenues in the way that some have suggested. Democracy and Economy
Q. All through Eastern Europe you talked about two themes constantly. One, encouraging democracy and . . . market economy and, two, that you weren't there to try to raise tensions with the Soviet Union or challenge them in any way. But my question is, if what you want is carried out . . . democracy and market economy - aren't you really talking about the dissolution of the Soviet empire. And is that what you mean when you call for a Europe that's whole and free?
A. The Soviet empire, if you mean the imposition of a Marxist system or socialism, in their definition, system on others, yes, I'd like to see Europe whole and free. And - but with the Soviet moving towards market - and they're not there - towards more freedom, towards more openness, they themselves have recognized that their system doesn't work. So you don't run the risks or have the same tensions that we might have had 10 years ago talking about the very same themes I talked about in Poland and Hungary. . . . And this is the last one. I've got to do it for the Houston guy.
Q. Thank you. Is Mr. Mitterrand free to reply to the Gorbachev letter himself or will it be circulated or would you like to see the letter? How would you like to that to go -
A. No. I think that he should reply to it himself. He has a good relationship with Mr. Gorbachev. Gorbachev was here; they've had some follow-up, I believe. And the letter was addressed to him, albeit as president of the summit.
Q. Mr. President, did you, in this summit, achieve all your goals. Do you have the feeling of being the winner No. 1 of the summit?
A. Well, I pointed out before we came over here that something of this nature ought not to be judged in terms of winners and losers.
I am very satisfied that the summit achieved its goals. Every other summit leader tells me that it was the best summit they have attended. We're together as how we approach the East. We're together as how we approach the environmental question. I didn't take a question on third world debt, but there's a strong endorsement for the Brady plan. And there was dissension on that approach. So it came together, very, very well.
Mr. Brady - and I shouldn't say this; I know this is going to get me in real trouble -but if the Brady plan looks like it's going to be successful, we may call it the Bush plan. Thank you all very, very much."

The organizations said such measures pose threat to the safety and well-being of the refugees as well as Bangladesh host communities and aid workers Some 50 undersigned organizations have urged the Bangladesh government to lift ongoing mobile internet restrictions and halt the construction of barbed wire fencing around the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar in light of the growing Covid-19 pandemic. In an open joint letter to the Bangladesh prime minister, the organizations said such measures pose threat to the safety and well-being of the refugees as well as Bangladesh host communities and aid workers. Posted on Human Rights Watch website on Wednesday, the letter was signed by Amnesty International, Arakan Rohingya National Organisation, Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, British Rohingya Community UK, Canadian Burmese Rohingya Organization, Harvard Law School International Human Rights Clinic, among others. The letter said that as the Covid-19 pandemic spreads to Bangladesh, unrestricted access to information via mobile and internet communications is crucial for slowing the transmission of the disease and saving the lives of refugees, humanitarian workers, and the general population of Bangladesh. ""Lifting restrictions will not only enable community health workers to quickly share and receive the most reliable and up-to-date guidance during this evolving pandemic but will also help in coordination with community leaders. We urge you to ensure refugees, local communities, and aid workers alike can freely access mobile and internet communications, in the interest of protecting human rights and public health,"" the letter noted. It also mentioned that since September 2019, Bangladesh authorities have prevented Rohingya refugees from obtaining SIM Cards and directed telecommunications operators to restrict internet coverage in Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar District.  ""These restrictions should be lifted in light of the government's recommendation to those experiencing Covid-19 symptoms to contact the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, hotline. Without a phone or SIM Card, abiding by this instruction is impossible,"" it added. Furthermore, the signatory organizations mentioned that without access to mobile and internet communications, aid workers and others will be forced to deliver critical health information in person, heightening their risk of exposure to Covid-19 and slowing the effectiveness of the response. Bangladesh government has so far reported 6 deaths and 56 infected by Covid-19.  The fast spreading coronavirus, which was first reported in China's Wuhan, has infected more than 936,100 people and claimed above 47,200 lives across 203 countries and territories and two international conveyances, according to Worldometer. Globally, a total of 194,578 infected people have also recovered from Covid-19, a pandemic announced by the World Health Organization (WHO). Read the full letter here"

What makes it different from the last DNCC polls is the absence of strong candidates As many as three million voters are set to go to the polls tomorrow to elect a new mayor and councillors for new wards, in the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) by-polls, without any enthusiasm or electioneering in sight. What makes it different from the last DNCC polls is the absence of strong candidates.  This has failed to generate a buzz among voters, not to mention lack of strong opposition candidates. While five candidates will vie for the mayoral position, only ruling Awami League-nominated candidate Atiqul Islam was seen to be electioneering, which ended yesterday.  The other candidates are Shafin Ahmed from Jatiya Party, Anisur Rahman Dewan from National People's Party, Shahin Khan of Progressive Democratic Party, and independent candidate Abdur Rahim. Polling for mayoral elections will be held in 54 wards of DNCC. Also 36 new wards, 18 in DNCC and 18 in Dhaka South City Corporation, are up for elections on the same day. Unlike the mayoral by-polls, vigorous campaigns are being conducted by candidates for councillor posts, as the posts are being contested for the first time. Election materials, including ballot papers, have already reached the offices of the returning officers concerned, as the Election Commission finalizes its preparations for the elections scheduled tomorrow. Arrangements are already in place to send the election materials to the polling centres by today, before voters head to cast their ballots starting 8am tomorrow.  The elections will take place until 4pm without any interval. A public holiday has been announced in DNCC areas so that all voters can exercise their voting rights. Electioneering concluded on Tuesday Returning Officer for the DNCC mayoral polls, Md Abul Kashem, told BSS that no candidate or none in favor of any candidate can conduct any meeting, rally, or procession starting midnight in the DNCC areas, after the electioneering schedule ended on Tuesday.  ""No offices will remain open on that day. But Public academic examinations will be held as per schedule. Students residing in hostels or residences for study purposes will be exempt from the directives concerning leaving election areas"" the RO said. Kashem added that the ban on traffic movement will be relaxed on highways and inter-district roads inside DNCC, considering the issue of public suffering, but vehicular movement on connecting roads will remain banned. Vehicle restrictions According to a home ministry circular, motorcycle transport will be banned in DNCC polling areas from today till Friday 6am.   Meanwhile, all vehicle traffic in the area--excluding emergency services--will be banned for 24 hours starting Wednesday midnight (12am) to Thursday midnight (12am). Vehicles affected by the ban during the by-elections are: motorcycles, trucks, motorized three-wheelers, taxis, microbuses, jeeps, pickups, and cars. Water vessels moving through the area will also fall under the vehicle ban. However, the restriction on vehicle traffic will be loosely implemented on important roads, streets, and highways leading into and out of Dhaka, and at inter-district bus terminals. The circular also directed non residents or voters in the DNCC to leave the area by Tuesday midnight (12am), to ensure a peaceful by-election, and to avoid facing legal action on voting day. Filling a void The DNCC mayoral post fell vacant with the death of Annisul Huq on November 30, 2017. According to the schedule declared by the Election Commission, the by-polls for the DNCC mayoral post were supposed to be held on February 26 last year. But a High Court bench stayed the election for six months after hearing two separate writ petitions on January 14 last year. However, another High Court bench later cleared the way to hold the by-election by withdrawing the stay order."

Bangladesh maintains friendship with all, he says Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen has said Bangladesh wants to see peace and stability across the world noting that around 12.2 million Bangladeshi citizens live in various parts of the globe. Momen was talking to reporters at International Mother Language Institute after a meeting of sub-committee of celebration of the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Tuesday, reports UNB. Chief coordinator of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Birth Centenary Celebration National Implementation Committee Dr Kamal Abdul Naser Chowdhury and former foreign minister AH Mahmood Ali were present at the meeting, among others. The minister said Bangladesh has adopted a ""balanced policy"" without any deviation from the path shown by father of the Nation - ""friendship to all and malice towards none"". ""We have good relations with everybody,"" he told reporters mentioning countries like India, China and the USA.   When asked about escalating tensions between Iran and the USA and any possibility of third world war, the foreign minister said: ""Hope not, I do not think there will be a third world war.""

In this globalized world, he said peace and stability are must and there will be negative impacts if the peace and stability are hampered in any part of the world. He said they are in touch with Bangladesh Mission in Iraq and Bangladeshis so far remain safe. Earlier, Bangladesh Ambassador in Baghdad Abu Maksud M Forhad assured Bangladesh nationals living in Iraq of providing all sorts of support and urged them not to get worried and lose their mental strength. In a video message, he said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is in touch and enquiring about their condition round the clock. He said they will remain available round the clock for any support that may be required. The video message was issued for Bangladesh nationals amid escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran following the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani near Baghdad airport on January 3. Over 200,000 Bangladesh nationals are believed to be living in Iraq. On Friday, the Bangladesh Embassy in Baghdad requested Bangladeshi expatriates in Iraq to stay alert and maintain caution considering the current security situation in the Middle-Eastern country. The embassy will remain open 24/7 to extend consular services to the expatriates. Everyone has been requested to extend cooperation. Between 2009 and November last year, 75,748 Bangladeshis went to Iraq for work, according to the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training."

Amid ongoing turmoil over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across India, the statement has created quite a stir India's Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi has no citizenship documents, Modi's office said in reply to a query on Friday, reports Anandabazar. Subhankar Sarkar, an Indian citizen, asked if the prime minister possessed citizenship documents under Right to Information Act, on February 17. In response to his question, Under Secretary of the Indian Prime Minister's Office, Praveen Kumar wrote: ""Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is a citizen of India by birth in terms of Section 3 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and as such the question of his having a citizenship certificate which is for citizenship by registration does not arise.""  Amid ongoing turmoil over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across India, the statement has created quite a stir. Ever since the right wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government passed the CAA, protests against the controversial citizenship law have continued across India, with every citizen worrying over how to prove citizenship. Even Modi fails to show the citizenship certificate.  At least 42 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim violence in northeast New Delhi, amid mounting international criticism that authorities failed to protect minority Muslims. The clashes began over a citizenship law that Modi's Hindu nationalist government introduced in December providing a path to Indian citizenship for six religious groups from neighbouring countries - but not Muslims. Critics say the law is discriminatory and comes on top of other measures such as withdrawal of autonomy for Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir, that has deepened disquiet about the future of India's 200 million Muslims. Critics of the government however blamed this week's violence on members of Modi's BJP, which was trounced in local Delhi elections at the beginning of the month.  The violence morphed into street battles between Hindu and Muslim groups, with the police largely ineffective in ending the violence."

""We want to control traffic in Dhaka city digitally...some parts of the capital have already been brought under such a system and if the system is introduced in other parts, the sufferings of the people will be reduced to a great extent,"" she said. The prime minister said this in replying to a supplementary raised by Jatiya Party lawmaker Kazi Feroz Rashid in the House during a question-answer session with Speaker Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury. The Leader of the House said her government has reintroduced an automatic signalling system in the capital which had almost gone out of order previously. She said traffic could be controlled manually in some areas, but there are allegations that manual traffic control is ineffective.    Sheikh Hasina said the biggest problem is that city commuters do not follow traffic rules. Referring to the notorious traffic jams in London and Washington, the Leader of the House said traffic jams are now a worldwide problem. She said people are buying more cars as the population's financial solvency is on the rise. In reply to a question from treasury bench member Didarul Alam, the premier said a number of projects were executed in the last 10 years through various ministries and departments, while many schemes are being implemented to ease traffic jams in the capital.

156,"Fast of Ramadan Ends With Feasts
1989-05-03T05:00:00.000Z
Fast of Ramadan Is Soon to Be a Feast
TOMORROW evening Muslims will search the night sky for the new moon. If they see the first sliver of light or hear of its official sighting in Mecca, they will end their monthlong fast at daybreak and eat heartily in celebration.
Since April 6, the beginning of Ramadan, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar, millions of devout Muslims around the world have abstained from all foods and liquids from the first light of morning to sundown.
The morning after the new moon reappears - either Friday or Saturday - Muslims will begin the month of Shawwal and celebrate the id al-fitr, or festival of fast breaking. It is a day of thanksgiving, when they will dress up, exchange gifts, visit friends and eat.
In the observance of the fast, Ramadan is like the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur and the Christian period of Lent. Muslims believe that God revealed the Koran to Mohammed during this month in the seventh century.
Ramadan is more than a time of fasting. It is a time of restraint and reflection, of prayer and peace. It is a time of kindness and charity, of family and community.
It is also a time when food takes on a greater significance. ''That which we deny ourselves is more appreciated,'' said Ahmed Almontaser, a Muslim who owns the Moroccan Star Restaurant in downtown Brooklyn.
As the sun sets each evening during Ramadan, Muslims often join to break their fast with dates and water, as the prophet Mohammed is said to have done. Then facing Mecca and bowing on their knees with their heads to the ground, they make their sunset prayer.
Afterward they have the iftar, or evening breakfast. The foods are simple and hearty: soups and stews made from lamb, chicken or beef to keep up strength during the fast.
On a recent Sunday about 400 Muslims - with backgrounds as diverse as Afghan, Egyptian, African-American, Palestinian, Pakistani, Spanish and Bangladeshi - gathered in Brooklyn for a community iftar at Masjid Al Farouq, a mosque on Atlantic Avenue between Fourth and Fifth Streets. They represented 17 Islamic centers in the New York region. Sneakers, work boots and oxfords were strewn in piles in the hallways, because Muslims must remove their footwear upon entering a mosque.
The men - some in business suits, others in loose tunics - covered their heads with turbans and woven caps. They prayed and broke their fast upstairs. The women, wearing ankle-length cloaks and scarfs concealing their hair, prayed and ate downstairs.
Shortly after a meal of lamb stew and Egyptian bread, they said their nighttime prayer, followed by a special prayer for forgiveness said only during Ramadan. Then they went home to sleep, where by custom they would rouse themselves at 3:30 or 4 A.M. to eat a light snack of fruit or yogurt, or even bagels and lox, to tide them over for more than 16 hours of fasting.
For Osama Younis, an Egyptian-born orthodontist, his wife, Mona, and their three children, each day of Ramadan begins with the predawn breakfast and a visit to their mosque in Mount Vernon, N.Y., for early prayers. Afterward, they return home to read a chapter of the Koran and then slip back into their beds for an hour's nap before beginning the workday or school day.
''It is not difficult,'' Dr. Younis said. ''Allah gives us strength.''
Fasting during Ramadan is required of all adult Muslims, and children are encouraged to fast as much as they can. Pregnant women or those who are sick or engaged in hard labor may postpone their fast, fulfilling it when it is less a hardship.
''Non-Muslims always ask why do we stay hungry all day,'' said Abdul-Salam Hamid, who came to New York from Pakistan 20 years ago. ''Half of the world is hungry. Many are dying of hunger. In this way we can feel their pain, understand their suffering and become more compassionate, more giving. Allah wants us to recognize this, to do good deeds and to learn how to control our temptations.''
Mr. Hamid, who owns Shaheem Sweets, a bakery and restaurant chain with four stores in Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn, admitted that he sometimes absent-mindedly took a taste of his pastry. But according to Muslim law, an unintentional bite does not break the fast.
During the last days of Ramadan, Muslims often sleep in the mosque, making intensive devotions. They await the Night of Power, which commemorates the first revelation of the Koran and a time when the faithful believe God will answer all prayers. Before feasting this week, each family must give food or money to help feed the poor.
There are more than five million Muslims in the United States, according to the Federation of Islamic Associations in Detroit. Because Islam brings together a multitude of traditions and cultures, there is no distinctive Islamic cuisine; there are no symbolic foods, except dates, that all Muslims eat in breaking their fast.
''While Muslims who are from the Middle East eat baba gannouj - mashed eggplant in sesame butter - and falafel, we'll have fried chicken and potato salad,'' said Njeri Abdul-Mumit, an American-born Muslim who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.
But there are some similarities among the foods that many Muslims eat. Alcohol and pork are forbidden. All meat must be halal (that is, from animals ritually slaughtered). Dried fruits are very common, and sweets of all types are savored.
Muslims of Pakistani and Indian descent often make a special sweet pudding called sevian to begin their feast and to give to friends. Middle Easterners favor honey and nut-filled pastries like baklava and kinafa.
Sweets symbolize the joy Muslims feel after receiving God's blessings during Ramadan, Mr. Hamid said. And for him, the festival of fast breaking is a double celebration: ''It is my bakeries' busiest day.''

163,"BOOK NOTES
1989-01-04T05:00:00.000Z
Stalin With Warts
A book published in 1987 by the Johns Hopkins University Press is scheduled to become the first book on Stalin by a Western historian to be published in the Soviet Union. Moreover, the Soviets have promised to allow the author to read and approve the translation before its publication this year.
The book is ''Stalin in October: The Man Who Missed the Revolution,'' by Robert M. Slusser, a professor of history emeritus at Michigan State University. It describes Stalin's return from Siberian exile to Petrograd in March 1917 and his editorship of the party publication Pravda during the months leading up to the Bolshevik Revolution the following November. Professor Slusser writes that on the night of the revolution, Stalin stayed in the offices of Pravda rather than taking to the streets to join in the storming of the Winter Palace. Later, of course, Stalin had the history of the revolution rewritten in favor of a more laudatory version of his activities.
J. G. Goellner, director of the Johns Hopkins University Press, said Progress Publishers, the Soviet publishing house, was reluctant to buy Mr. Slusser's biography in 1987, because it did not think it could get clearance for the project. But after the policies of Mikhail S. Gorbachev encouraged more openness, Aleksandr Avelichev, the head of the publishing house, sent Johns Hopkins an offer. That contract was eventually signed in Boston.
During the Frankfurt Book Fair last October, Mr. Avelichev asked to renegotiate the contract to increase the print run to as many as 200,000 copies. Mr. Goellner said that when he expressed surprise at so large an order, Mr. Avelichev replied: ''I don't think you understand what a big event this is going to be. We have nothing on Stalin in this country except what Stalin wanted written. This will open the door through which our own historians can now walk.'' Titles That Scan
Alex Shoumatoff has written eight books of nonfiction, ranging from his search for his Russian roots to accounts of his travels in many lands. His most recent book, ''African Madness'' (Knopf), consists of four articles, revised from their original appearances in The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, on Madagascar, Dian Fossey, AIDS in Africa and the trial of Jean-Bedel Bokassa, the former ruler of the Central African Republic.
While writing, Mr. Shoumatoff uses working titles that are often vastly different from the published titles, although he stayed with ''African Madness'' for this book.
''It came to me as a sound more than as a meaning, although I thought there was enough meaning for a good title,'' Mr. Shoumatoff said. ''But from its cadence, you know it's probably by the same guy who wrote 'Russian Blood,' 'Florida Ramble' and 'The Rivers Amazon,' '' three of his previous books.
The working title for ''Russian Blood,'' Mr. Shoumatoff said, was -what else? - ''Rootski.'' For ''Westchester: Portrait of a County,'' he used ''Beyond the Bronx.'' And his book on the Amazon, published by Sierra Club Books, was ''The Big Amazon.'' When his editor suggested ''The Rivers Amazon,'' Mr. Shoumatoff was dubious. He said, ''I thought, sure, by the man who brought you 'The Brothers Karamazov.' ''
Yet even the most carefully considered titles are not always as distinctive as authors might like. Shortly after publication in 1986 of his book ''In Southern Light,'' based on his travels in Zaire and along the Amazon, Mr. Shoumatoff asked at a store in Manhattan whether it carried the book. The clerk said yes, and directed him to ''Southern Light,'' a fictional interpretation of the story of Genesis by J. R. Salamanca. When Mr. Shoumatoff tried again, he was directed to the travel section. ''I thought, that's more like it,'' he said, ''until I saw 'South Light,' by Michael Parfit, a book about the Antarctic.''
''One of these days,'' Mr. Shoumatoff said, ''I'm going to invite those other two authors for a drink at the Algonquin and propose that we publish all three books in one bound edition.'' Profits to the Poor
Dominique Lapierre's book ''The City of Joy'' (Doubleday) is about the impoverished people of Calcutta, India, to whom the author promised 50 percent of the royalties. Since its publication three years ago, the book has sold about five million copies worldwide and Mr. Lapierre said it had earned the poor about $1 million - along with much more from the donations that accompanied many of the 70,000 letters from readers.
That money, Mr. Lapierre says, has been used to finance a number of projects in whole or in part: a home, schools and a training center for 150 children of lepers; three rehabilitation centers for lepers; three homes for 125 physically and mentally handicapped children from the slums; a medical dispensary in Bhangar, an area south of Calcutta in which as many as 700 patients are treated each day; a mobile medical dispensary in a remote area of the Ganges delta, and a home and school for 75 orphan children from an area near Bangladesh.
Mr. Lapierre and his wife, who also donated solar energy water pumps to 10 drought-afflicted villages in India, were recently made honorary citizens of Calcutta."

Habiganj workers demand govt food relief from starvation Workers at 23 tea gardens in Sylhet have been abstaining from work due to the fear of coronavirus transmission for the last five days. Hundreds, among the 10,000 permanent workers and 50,000 temporary workers, demonstrated with a sit-in protest on Tuesday at their respective tea fields, demanding protective gear for work, said Raju Goala, president of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union in Sylhet. Answering a query, he told Dhaka Tribune that the workers are prepared to work as per the premier's directives if Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is provided to them with their salary for the last five days, when they abstained from work. He added that they will go for a large movement if the demands are not fulfilled. Sylhet Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Abul Kalam Azad said Tk12 lakh and 521 tons of rice have so far been allocated for marginal communities in the district to fight the coronavirus crisis so far. However, the allocated resources were not for the district's tea workers. ""Over video conference on Tuesday, the premier instructed to keep all tea gardens of the country operational,"" added the ADC. The tea worker's leader Raju Goala, said: ""People in other occupations in the country are in quarantine, but there were no clear guidelines for tea workers. To avoid risk of virus transmission, workers are abstaining from work. ""Although poor people in the district are receiving government support, none is allocated for tea workers.  ""Most of the workers are hired on a temporary basis. They routinely work at places other than the gardens. They could not work at these other places due to the virus outbreak and the authorities do not have any specific guidelines regarding how workers will not starve, but yet be safe,"" added Raju. In Habiganj, hundreds of tea workers demonstrated in Chunarughat upazila demanding government relief.  During a three hour protest in front of the upazila parishad until 12pm yesterday, they chanted 'Du Mutho Bhat De (give us two fistfuls of rice) as a slogan. Tea worker Koilash Munda said: ""We will die of starvation before catching coronavirus. No one has come to our aid so far."" Nipen Paul, joint secretary of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union central committee, said: ""Tea workers were not given leave. We asked workers of some of the gardens to abstain from work. We couldn't arrange government allocations for workers by contacting the upazila administrations. I have heard that workers protested for food in Habiganj."" Debashish Das, manager of Deundi Tea Garden in the upazila, said: ""We haven't received any instruction from the authorities to allow leave for the tea workers and we haven't put pressure on them to come to work either."" He added that no worker from his tea garden received any government relief. Chunarughat Upazila Nirbahi Officer Shattyajit Roy couldn't be reached for comment over phone."
168,"In Bangladesh, Women Can't Go Home Again
1988-04-17T05:00:00.000Z
Shafia Khatun has made a pioneering journey from rural poverty to a low-paying job in a crowded garment factory, and she may never be able to go home again.
Part of a small new industry fueled by American imports, she and 200,000 other women have defied Islamic tradition and planted the seeds of a slow social transformation in this nation.
Village elders objected to her leaving home to work in the big city, Miss Khatun said in an interview at her tiny dirt-floored rented room. ''It will be difficult for me to live again in my village because I have been in the city earning money,'' she said.
For the same reason, and because she cannot afford the traditional wedding payment, her chances of finding a husband have also been reduced, said Miss Khatun, who at the age of 14 is already eligible for marriage.
The labor of women like Miss Khatun is a boon to this nation that has relied on exports of animal hides, jute and tea for most of its foreign earnings. Planners here now dare to talk, with guarded hope, of industrialization.
The garment boom began here only recently when the United States opened its quotas to Bangladesh while restricting imports from other Asian nations. America now takes in 85 percent of the country's garment exports.
Clothing exports to the United States grew from $45 million in 1984 to more than $300 million last year, making Bangladesh the sixth-largest supplier of apparel to America.
''This is the cheapest country where you can work,'' said Paolo Tacchinardi, a garment manufacturer from Milan. ''You can pay the workers, the manager and the shipper, and the shirt is still three times less when it arrives in Italy.'' He added: ''You may think that we are wearing things made by women and children. But if we did not come here to give them work, these people would have nothing.''
Redwan Ahmed, the owner of Saleha Garments Ltd., where Miss Khatun works, said women are essential to his industry.
Bred to subservience, he said, they will work for as little as $13 a month and accept harsh conditions and long hours without complaint.
''If I appoint 400 men workers, they immediately start making union politics,'' he said. ''Not the women.''
And with the low salaries they are willing to accept, he said, ''You get more workers for less investment.''
Roushan Jahan, a scholar who has researched the new phenomenon of women workers, said factory owners sometimes lock their doors to keep women at their places for overtime work. She said the women often have too little schooling to compute the wages due them and are frequently shortchanged.
Deepening poverty and landlessness throughout the country has forced a compromise with cultural norms, said Mrs. Jahan.
In traditional Bangladesh, women are in effect the property of their fathers or husbands. They receive less education, less food and poorer health care than their brothers.
Miss Jahan said women had traditionally worked at home or in the homes of neighbors but that in times of famine or calamity, tradition had been set aside and women had been sent out to help in the fields or to scavenge.
The continuing crisis of poverty and overpopulation has now reached a level at which the social norms themselves may be changing, she said. Miss Khatun said her widowed mother had sent her to work because she could no longer afford to feed her.
While some workers manage to send home a part of their earnings, Miss Khatun said she could barely survive on her own and was helping her family simply by feeding herself.
At work on her own, she said, she tries to maintain the standards of propriety to which she was bred, although she may already have cut herself off from a respectable future.
She said she leaves her home only for the short walk to her workplace and avoids improper comportment.
Although she sometimes allows herself to watch television through the window of a neighbor, she said, she leaves whenever a movie is shown.
''It is not proper for a young girl to watch a movie,'' she said."

A cold wave in normally tropical northern Bangladesh has killed at least 33 people in the last week, a newspaper reported today.
Temperatures in the region have hovered near 42 degrees Fahrenheit since Monday, and the newspaper New Nation said the victims were laborers and other poor people who were unable to protect themselves from the cold.
At least 18 people were reported killed in the Kurigram district, 150 miles north of Dhaka, in the last three days, the English-language daily said. Another 15 deaths were reported from the Pabna and Rangpur districts, also in the north.
Such low temperatures are rare in Bangladesh, which has a tropical climate for most of the year. Of its 110 million people, most people live in houses with mud floors and walls woven from straw and bamboo, which offer little protection from the cold."

""It is not just happening in Bangladesh. This is not unique for Bangladesh,"" a spokesperson at the US Embassy in Dhaka said on Sunday, reports UNB. The spokesperson said this is a temporary measure and the US citizens will return to Bangladesh again once the situation improves globally.  The spokesperson also said the US Embassy in Dhaka will remain open.  The US Department of State and US Embassy in Dhaka have arranged a special chartered flight for US citizens who wish to return and their families.  The special flight will be departing from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday. The spokesperson said the aircraft will be full, but did not specify the exact number of returnees. The size of the commercial aircraft was also not disclosed.  The special flight will include a Dhaka to Doha, Qatar leg followed by a connecting flight to Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC, said the US Embassy in Dhaka. Passengers will remain on the aircraft in Doha.  All passengers must agree to reimburse the US government for the flight by signing a promissory note for approximately the amount of a full-fare economy flight, or comparable alternate transportation, to the designated destination that would have been charged immediately prior to this crisis, said the Embassy.  The note must be signed and presented before boarding. No cash or credit card payments will be accepted at the airport.    ""You will be responsible for any arrangements or costs (lodging, onward destination or local transportation, etc) beyond Washington, DC.  The US Embassy is unable to book any onward travel for you. The exact departure time and routing of this chartered flight are subject to change,"" said the Embassy.  Asked why US is shifting its citizens to the US despite the risky situation there, the Embassy spokesperson said it is true that the US has been hit very hard but everybody takes their own decision. In the US, over 120,000 cases of Covid-19 and more than 2,000 deaths due to the viral infection had been recorded as of Sunday evening. "

A spat between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic escalated when United States President Donald Trump angered China by referring to the pathogen as the 'Chinese Virus' Coronavirus disease or Covid-19 is an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus. It is now an officially declared global pandemic. The number of coronavirus cases globally stood at 202,270 with 8,212 deaths, across 167 countries and territories at 5pm Wednesday, according to a tally compiled by Dhaka Tribune from official sources. A lot of explanations have been advanced regarding the source of the coronavirus. Understandably, public-health officials want to pin down the virus's source so that they can prevent new outbreaks.  A lot of conspiracy theories are also making the rounds. The question essentially boils down to one point: was Covid-19 developed in a laboratory, and is it being used as a biological weapon? A related question is whether the virus was made in the laboratory purposefully, or did the virus made in the laboratory accidentally escape the laboratory.  The lab-escape theory is so far the more widely accepted conspiracy theory.  Chinese authorities maintain that Covid-19 likely originated at a market in Wuhan where people were selling wild animals. But Iranian, Russian, and some Chinese media outlets claim that the emerging public health crisis comes from US biological weapons.  A spat between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic escalated when United States President Donald Trump angered China by referring to the pathogen as the ""Chinese Virus."" The two countries have sparred over the origin of the virus for days, with a Chinese official promoting theories claiming it was brought to China by the US army and Washington officials using terms seen as stigmatizing a nation.  ""The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus,"" Trump tweeted on Monday night. Some skepticals including politicians in the US and China have both suggested that the Covid-19 may actually be a bioweapon that was manufactured in a lab.  The only difference between their conspiracy theories is who's being accused of doing the manufacturing. On the one corner are some people in the US who are hinting or in some cases openly claiming that China put together this virus.  Steve Mosher, a social scientist, wrote on February 22 an opinion piece for the New York Post entitled, ""Don't buy China's story: The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab.""  In the piece, Mosher summarises why he believes Covid-19 may have been accidentally spread by China's National Biosafety Laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where researchers have studied bat coronaviruses.  Mosher says that the lab is less than 10 miles away from the seafood market where a clustre of Covid-19 cases was first discovered. Mosher believes that the said lab is located in the Institute of Virology in Wuhan, where the dangerous pathogens were purportedly kept and looked at as potential bioweapons.  There were reports that in the 2003 SARS outbreak, the SARS-CoV virus escaped from virology labs in China. He says Chinese virologist and bioweapons expert Major General Chen Wei's visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology with military scientists in January was an exercise in damage control. But not only in China, there are at least six same kind of facilities in the US in Georgia, Maryland, Texas and Montana.  According to the Federation of American Scientists website, seven others may be planned, under construction, or possibly finished in various cities such as Massachusetts, and Virginia. These labs also study and house a range of dangerous pathogens.  Not to be outdone, some in China have made similar suggestions, except that it's the US that built the virus and released it in China.  One of the most popular topics on the Chinese microblog Weibo was a one-minute clip of a US congressional hearing this week on how the country was dealing with the coronavirus. In the video posted by the People's Daily, Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is asked whether there may have been deaths attributed to influenza that could actually have been the result of Covid-19.  Redfield responds in the affirmative: ""Some cases have been actually diagnosed that way in the United States today."" Redfield's answer was enough to add fuel to a conspiracy theory that has been gaining traction over the past two weeks in China - that the coronavirus did not originate in China but may have come from the US instead. ""The US has finally acknowledged that among those who had died of the influenza previously were cases of the coronavirus. The true source of the virus was the US!"" one commentator said.  ""The US owes the world, especially China, an apology,"" another said. ""American coronavirus,"" one wrote. The theory has gained traction over the past few weeks, after a respected epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, said in a passing remark at a press conference on February 27 that although the virus first appeared in China ""it may not have originated in China."" Zhong later clarified his statement, saying that the first place where a disease is discovered does not ""equate to it being the source.""  China's ambassador to South Africa said last week on Twitter that the virus was not necessarily ""made in China."" So till now it looks like conspiracy theorists on both sides haven't really provided any compelling evidence that SARS-CoV2 was produced in a lab, whether in the US, in China, in Iran or in the other world."

Scientists say it will take several months to get results from trials testing the BCG vaccine to fight Covid-19 There is no vaccine against the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, that is spreading rapidly around the world. But scientists in several countries are testing a century-old tuberculosis (TB) vaccine to see if it might boost the immune system to reduce respiratory symptoms in people who get new coronavirus infections. Researchers in Australia and Europe are testing whether the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, introduced in the 1920s to fight tuberculosis, might be deployed to combat Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  Clinical trials are focused on two groups at high-risk for Covid-19: health care workers and the elderly. Here is what scientists know, and what they are trying to find out: How can a TB vaccine help with other infections? The BCG vaccine contains a live but weakened strain of tuberculosis bacteria that provokes the body to develop antibodies to attack TB bacteria. This is called an adaptive immune response, because the body develops a defence against a specific disease-causing microorganism, or pathogen, after encountering it. Most vaccines create an adaptive immune response to a single pathogen. Unlike other vaccines, the BCG vaccine may also boost the innate immune system, first-line defences that keep a variety of pathogens from entering the body or from establishing an infection. One study in Guinea-Bissau found 50% lower mortality rates in children vaccinated with BCG than in kids who did not get this vaccine. That is a much bigger drop in deaths than could be explained by a reduction in TB cases. Some studies have found similar reductions in respiratory infections among teens and the elderly.  What scientists do not know Scientists do not have data yet on the effect of BCG vaccination on coronaviruses in general or SARS-CoV-2 in particular. There are also many BCG vaccines, with different capacities to protect against various TB strains. Scientists need to determine which BCG vaccines might have the best ability to boost the innate immune system to fight Covid-19. Who should get the BCG vaccine right now? Scientists say it will take several months to get results from trials testing the BCG vaccine to fight Covid-19.  In the meantime, people should not rush to get it because it has not been widely tested in adults and might be harmful. Also, a run on the BCG vaccine to fight Covid-19 might cause shortages for children who need it to prevent TB. "

The park also known as the Gymkhana Lake is bordered on its south side by the Morgan School in Deobhog, from where it stretches till the Mobarak Shah Road With the ever rapid growth of urbanization taking place in Narayanganj, it is difficult for locals to catch a breath of fresh air in one of the oldest industrial districts of Bangladesh. Sheikh Russel Nagar Park is a nice change of pace where people come to enjoy the natural scenic beauty filled with vegetation and to open their lungs to the clean and fresh air free of all the pollution.The park also known as the Gymkhana Lake is bordered on its south side by the Morgan School in Deobhog, from where it stretches till the Mobarak Shah Road. With the implementation of vegetation projects and other conservational efforts around the previously abandoned waterbody, the Sheikh Russel Nagar Park has now transformed into a modern eco-park, befitting of a popular recreational spot. The park resembles Hatirjheel, the mid-town drainage and sanitation project of Dhaka. There are walkways, plants along the paths, street lights, and foot lights throughout the area.  There is a meeting pavilion for visitors in the park, a viewing deck, and a walking bridge. There are three beautiful docks surrounding the 410 metre long and 150 metre wide lake. The park also has an open theatre for social events and gatherings. A few other things like toilets for men and women, a swimming pool, a fountain, and a bicycle lane are now being made.  Narayanganj City Corporation began the construction work of this place in November, 2016. Even though construction is not yet complete, it has become popular among people. On Friday evenings, the park is packed with nature lovers and their families and friends.  According to the Local Government Engineering Department of Narayanganj, the area allocated for the Gymkhana Park is 38.5 acre. In July of 2016, Narayanganj City Corporation awarded Ratna Enterprise the tender for building the park on a budget of Tk7.74 Crore.  According to Narayanganj City Corporation, Tk19.14 crore has already been spent to complete the second phase of construction. A third phase of construction worth Tk16.96 crore will be initiated shortly. Locals have welcomed the park and said that people are at last being able to get some fresh air. They do not want the space to be turned into a trade centre or a space for the homeless. Abdur Rahman, general secretary of the Citizens Committee told Dhaka Tribune: ""The park is a blessing for the public. This place was once abandoned and became a hub for various shady activities. This conservation of the lake has made the area beautiful."" Considering Narayanganj's polluted atmosphere this park will help keep the ecological balance, said AB Siddique, District secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA).  He said: ""There is no space for children to play and no space for plants and trees either in Narayanganj. This park will give the kids a place to spend their time and ensure a fresh environment for people."" Considering all this, Narayanganj City Corporation has welcomed this new addition to the city."

Mobile courts will also conduct drives to check on ticket prices Holidaymakers will have a smoother journey on the roads ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr compared to previous years, Secretary of Road Transport and Highway Division, Md Nazrul Islam, has said. ""Trucks and lorries will not be allowed to ply on the roads three days ahead of Eid,"" the secretary told journalists. He said this after meeting with top officials of the division, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), and the transport owners' association's leaders on ensuring a safe, comfortable, and hassle-free journey for homebound people, on Thursday. However, vehicles carrying daily essentials and medicines will not fall under the purview of the instructions, he added.  The secretary said the condition of the roads is better than in previous years, and the authorities concerned will take immediate steps to resolve any issues that might arise.  ""The public will not suffer on the roads [during the Eid holidays], this year,"" Nazrul said.  Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC), and the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges, will operate control rooms that will work round-the-clock with the BRTA to ease the movement of the holidaymakers.  BTRC will also operate a special bus service. Mobile courts will remain active at all times, and will conduct drives to check on ticket prices and unfit vehicles.  Public transport owners have also been asked to remain alert, Nazrul said. Law enforcement will ensure that no makeshift markets are set up on highways, and no buses are parked arbitrarily. The government has asked garment factory owners to provide Eid workers their holidays in phases, to avoid an extra rush prior to Eid day, the secretary added."

Since late December last year, 4,400 deaths have been recorded around the world The World Health Organization (WHO) is characterising the outbreak of the new coronavirus as a pandemic, its Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Wednesday. ""We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have therefore made the assessment that Covid-19 can be characterised as a pandemic,"" he told a news conference. The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, halting industry, bringing flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of sporting events and concerts. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, its ""highest level of alarm,"" on January 30 when there were fewer than 100 cases of Covid-19 outside China and eight cases of human-to-human transmission of the disease.  BREAKING ""We have therefore made the assessment that #COVID19 can be characterized as a pandemic""-@DrTedros #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/JqdsM2051A Now there are more than 121,000 cases in 121 countries and territories, while over 4,400 people have died, with the numbers expected to climb. China remains the hardest-hit overall with more than 80,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths. The WHO no longer has a category for declaring a pandemic, except for influenza. WHO officials have signalled for weeks that they may use the word ""pandemic"" as a descriptive term, but stressed that it does not carry legal significance. The novel coronavirus is not the flu. Under its previous system, the Geneva-based agency declared the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak a pandemic. It turned out to be mild, leading to some criticism after pharmaceutical companies rushed development of vaccines and drugs."

Commuters, farmers, businessmen suffered a lot though central transport leaders called off strike The bus strike that crippled the southern and other districts around the country for the past three days was called off early Thursday after the government assured considering their demands. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal announced that the strike was called off around 1am on Thursday, after a four-hour-long meeting among the representatives of the Bangladesh Truck-covered-van Goods Transport Owner-Worker Unity Council, Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association and Bangladesh Bus-Truck Owners Association at his residence in Dhanmondi. Despite the minister's assurance, bus owners and workers continued the strike in several parts of the country on Thursday. In Jamalpur, normal transportation has not yet resumed on every route till filing of this report around 6pm. The workers of the Dhanbari area were restricting the movement of vehicles on the Jamalpur-Dhaka route in the evening. On condition of anonymity, one of the Jamalpur Bus-Minibus Workers Union leaders said they had discussed the issue with the transport workers, and plying of passengers on the route would soon return to normal. In Dinajpur, normal transportation services have resumed on the Hili-Bogra route since Thursday morning after the workers were assured that their demands would be met. Confirming the resumption of transportation services, Public Relations Officer Sohrab Hossain of the Hili Land Port said transporting of goods was hampered for the last five days, but normalcy returned as soon as the workers pull out their strike. In Jhenaidah, commuters were forced to use banned three wheelers as hundreds of buses were left in a frozen state at the Kaliganj central bus terminal as the strike was still in force. In Khulna, the same situation prevailed as no inter-district buses left the terminal.  Khulna Motor Workers Union General Secretary Md Ziaur Rahman Mithu said the Bus Owners-Workers Federation presented a draft proposal to the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges for amending the newly enacted Road Transport Act. In Chuadanga, no passenger buses and goods-carriers left the city on Thursday.  Local vegetable farmers and businessmen expressed fear of huge financial losses as they could not dispatch their goods to different parts of the country. In Naogaon, transport workers have continued their strike for the fourth successive day. When asked why they were continuing the strike, local bus driver Sumon said: ""We did not enforce the strike after consultation with the central leaders. The problem is ours, so we will not call off the strike based on their decision."" In Narail, commuters had to suffer a lot as no buses left the station. Moreover, they had to count extra money and time for commuting in three wheelers. In Satkhira, although bus services remained suspended, a limited number of trucks were seen plying on the roads. Businessmen of the Bhomra port had to pay twice the usual amount to ship their goods due to the scarcity of trucks. In Tangail, transportation services remained suspended for the second consecutive day on the Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway. Three wheelers were charging extra and long route commuters were opting for trains due to the scarcity of buses. In Kurigram, commuters had to face distress due to the continued strike. Even the transport workers assaulted the drivers of the three wheelers near the central bus terminal.  One of the workers said they will not allow the plying of any transport from the terminal.

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court rejected Gupta's curative petition A court in Delhi on Monday stayed the execution of the four convicts in the 2012 Delhi gangrape and murder case, ANI reported.  Akshay Thakur, Vinay Sharma, Mukesh Singh and Pawan Gupta were scheduled to be hanged at Tihar Jail in Delhi on Tuesday at 6am. The court deferred the matter after one of the convicts, Pawan Gupta, filed a mercy petition before India's President Ram Nath Kovind earlier in the day. His lawyer had requested the court to stop the execution citing the petition. Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana rapped his lawyer for filing the curative and mercy pleas so late. ""You are playing with fire, you should be cautious,"" said the judge, adding, ""One wrong move by anybody and you know the consequences."" Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court rejected Gupta's curative petition. He had sought commutation of his death penalty to life imprisonment. The four convicts were given the death penalty - first by a trial court in September 2013, which was upheld by the Delhi High Court six months later and the Supreme Court in May 2017.  The death warrants were first issued for January 22, and then postponed to February 1 because of the mercy pleas filed by two of the convicts.  Gupta was the only one among the four convicts who had not availed of the legal remedies. His counsel had told a sessions court in Delhi earlier this that he could not avail any legal remedy as his earlier lawyer did not meet him during the seven-day period granted by the Delhi High Court. The four men, along with two others, raped and brutally assaulted a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in a moving bus in Delhi on the night of December 16, 2012.  The woman succumbed to her injuries two weeks later at a hospital in Singapore. The gangrape triggered huge protests in the Indian capital and across the country.  One convict died in prison, while a minor convict was sent to a detention home for juveniles and was released in December 2015."

What if the fruit you love is available in the market not only for a few months, but throughout the whole year? And what if this very fruit does not need to be imported but is grown locally and sold at a street cart in your neighbourhood? That is the goal of the Year-Round Fruit Production for Nutrition Improvement project -- to make fruits available all over the year and meet the nutrition demand of the population. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) has been implementing it since 2014-15. An adult is supposed to consume 250 grams of fruit daily but per capita intake is 80 grams in Bangladesh at present, according to the agriculture ministry. Even a decade ago, local fruits were limited to Bangladesh's hot and humid summer. People keenly waited for May, June and July when mango, litchi, jackfruit and most other fruits would make their way to the market. The second month of the Bangla calendar, Jaistha (mid-May to mid-June), is aptly called the Madhu Mas (honey month) because most of these fruits become available around this time. However, the scenario has changed now. Several fruits are found almost all the time. Mehedi Masood, the project director, said earlier fruits would be available during the three summer months, but the government is focusing on year-round production. ""Now you will find guava, papaya, pineapple and some other fruits almost round the year. We are also expanding the production tenure of mango."" Since the inception of the project, more than one lakh farmers were given training on fruit cultivation through the horticulture centres, the official said. In addition, 21-22 lakh fruit trees were planted across the country during the period, he added. ""Inspired by the initiative, farmers planted 2 crore fruit trees on their own."" Not only are some fruits found for a longer period in the market, the cultivation of high-yielding varieties has increased the overall fruit production many times over. In 2006-07, 4.74 lakh hectares were under fruit cultivation yielding 87.86 lakh tonnes, according to DAE. The acreage has since jumped to 7.24 hectares, with an output of 1.21 crore tonnes in 2017-18. In these 11 years, fruit production went up by 33.26 lakh tonnes. ""Good profits and demand for fruits in local and international markets encourage the farmers to produce more fruits, using high yielding seeds,"" the project director said. Besides, more exotic fruits are grown locally now, catering to a larger fruit market. Alongside the traditional local varieties, foreign fruits like avocado, rambutan, strawberry, orange, date, dragon fruit, and fig have become popular and locally available. According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Bangladesh is one of the highest fruit-growing countries in the world, and it is the 10th largest tropical fruit producer. Over the last 18 years, the country's fruit production has been increased by 11.5 percent on an average annually, the UN body estimates. According to the agriculture ministry, 56 varieties of fruits were cultivated in Bangladesh about a decade ago, the number of which has increased to 72 now. With the cultivation of fruits increasing and the list of new varieties growing, Bangladesh's dependency on fruit import has already come down. According to the customs department, the first eight months of 2017-18 fiscal year saw the import of 2.82 lakh tonnes of apples, mandarins, oranges, pears and grapes. It went down to 2.52 lakh tonnes during the same period of 2018-19. Agriculturalists say people usually buy imported fruits between September and January when fruit production and supply remain poor. After the launch of the round-the-year fruit project, various fruits have become available almost all over the year. Guava tops the list. It is available even in winter. Project director Masood said the farming of Thai guava, which was introduced in 2005-06, has expanded across the country because it bears fruit quickly and commands a good price. ""It takes only about five months to grow the fruit,"" he said. In 1980-81, Bangladesh's guava production was 9,000 tonnes, which rose to 506,478 tonnes in 2017-18, registering a 56-fold increase in 37 years. Bangladesh has also been among the top 10 countries in the production of significant fruits -- second in jackfruit, seventh in mango, and eighth in guava, according to FAO. The cultivation of nutritious varieties like dragon fruit, avocado, pomelo, watermelon, muskmelon, Burmese grapes or lotkon, jujube, hog plum, and Indian gooseberry or amlaki has largely increased over the last 4-5 years. ""A silent revolution has taken place in the country's fruit sector. People are taking Thai guava instead of apple. As a result, apple import is dwindling,"" project consultant SM Kamruzzaman told The Daily Star. ""We are planning to ensure availability of fruits round the year."" He also said currently they are planning to produce mango round the year and expand the production of persimmon and high-yielding oranges. Project director Mehedi Masood said the government plans to ensure round-the-year availability of fruits by 2030."

215,"FILM; Satyajit Ray Gives Ibsen A Bengali Spin
1989-05-07T05:00:00.000Z
Satyajit Ray, Sidelined for more than half a decade by heart disease, is about to return to the cinema world with his 26th feature film - and first screen adaptation of a play, Henrik Ibsen's ''Enemy of the People.''
The film will have its premiere at the Cannes Festival, which begins on Thursday. Called ''Ganashatru'' in Bengali, the picture has already been picked up by distributors in Britain and France.
It won't open here in Calcutta till next fall, however, because the 67-year-old Mr. Ray, always the perfectionist, doesn't want to subject it to the city's un-air-conditioned theaters during the suffocating summer. ''They keep the fans whirring all the time,'' he said. ''It ruins the soundtrack.''
''Why I chose a play for the first time in my career,'' Mr. Ray explained, relaxing in his Calcutta apartment on a warm Bengali night, ''was that for five years I hadn't made a film because of illness. Then the doctors suggested that I could go back to making films provided I worked only in the studio, not on locations.
''If it had to be confined within the studio, then I started thinking of a play,'' he said. ''I had read Ibsen as a young man in college, and 'Enemy of the People' I remembered. I read him again. It seems the play could be brought up to date, transplanted to Bengal and turned into a completely Indian story, relevant to modern times.
''So I decided on Ibsen, and we got going,'' he said. ''I wrote a screenplay. I adapted it. Three or four writings, and there it was, ready to be filmed.''
''An Enemy of the People,'' a five-act play Ibsen wrote in 1882, tells the story of Thomas Stockmann, a doctor in a Norwegian resort who falls afoul of vested interest when he tries to sound a warning that the town's mineral baths have been polluted by industrial wastes. Seeing their local prosperity threatened, even liberals turn against him, seeking to suppress his scientific report. He is hounded into isolation, a man of principle who has become an enemy of the people.
The play was thought to be Ibsen's sharp retort to Norwegian society's negative response to his previous play, ''Ghosts.'' ''An Enemy of the People'' portrays a hypocritical middle class, easily persuaded to trade in their idealism for security.
Mr. Ray, who casts the man he calls ''my favorite actor,'' Soumitra Chatterji, as his Dr. Gupta, the Bengali Stockmann, said the shooting of the film went very well and that his health seemed to improve in the process. The director comes close to being worshiped by Calcuttans, who save their highest regard for artists. In a city where people will pay for tape of Mr. Ray's voice, his health is a matter of great local concern.
Dressed in the white cotton shirt and trousers Bengalis call ''Punjabi pajamas,'' Mr. Ray said he feels very close to Calcuttans and would not want to work anywhere else. Sounds of the city drifted through the large open windows as he talked in his huge, high-ceilinged study piled with papers and books. The elegant old apartment, a virtual film set for intellectual Calcutta life, has had to make only one concession to modernization: an elevator has been installed outside in the hall to save Mr. Ray, who has had coronary bypass surgery, a climb up several flights of stairs.
''Everything was made inside the studio in Calcutta,'' he said of ''Ganashatru,'' a film about 100 minutes long. ''We had a 45-day schedule; we finished in 28 days. We worked incredibly fast, particularly because I had a wonderful set of actors. It was O.K. on the first take much of the time, so I didn't even have to take a second take or third take.
''I had an ambulance and a doctor in attendance,'' he said. ''My cardiologist would occasionally drop in. My family physican would come. You see, they were interested because it was the story of a doctor. Apart from taking my blood pressure and pulse, they were interested in what was going on and how the doctor was behaving in the circumstances.
''Their verdict was that I kept better when I was shooting,'' he said with a low laugh. ''The adrenaline, or whatever, caused an improvement in my health. They said that I should certainly be making one film a year, and that in the next film, I could even include a few outdoor scenes.''
Mr. Ray calls his version of ''An Enemy of the People'' ''a free adaptation of Ibsen. ''People will recognize Ibsen,'' he said. ''The debt to Ibsen is there. The five-act structure is there. But apart from that, I've had to make changes. You inevitably have to make changes. People behave differently, you see.'' Mr. Ray says he dealt with the staginess inherent in a dramatic work by pulling it farther and farther out from under the proscenium as he went along. This attempt to give the story a cinematic feel has wrought additional alterations in the Ibsen work.
''The first act has a lot of words, a lot of entrances and exits,'' he said. ''But it's as cinematic as I could make it.
''Gradually, more and more, as the story develops, it departs more and more from Ibsen and becomes more and more cinematic,'' he said. ''Particularly, the public meeting that takes place in the film is very, very unlike the scene in the play. It's very mobile and free: lots of camera movements, cuts and this and that and not a plethora of dialogue.''
Mr. Ray said he knew that the Ibsen play would have contemporary appeal in India as well as abroad, apart from its novelty as an Indian's view of a Scandinavian theatrical work.
''It deals with topical problems,'' he said. ''Pollution is still a problem, as much as it was a hundred years ago - more than that, much more than that.'' Mr. Ray is optimistic that this timeliness of topics, among other attractionss - not the least beings his reputation - will help India's National Film Development Corporation, the production's backers, to market the film in the United States.
''There is considerable interest abroad, partly because it's Ibsen,'' he said. ''And then, Arthur Miller had an adaptation of the Ibsen play, which has been playing in London recently and is doing very well. So I'm sure there's an additional reason for interest in this film.''
Like this film, Mr. Ray's previous work, ''Ghare Baire'' (''Home and the World''), based on a story by Rabindranath Tagore, was also shown abroad before being screened in Calcutta. But Mr. Ray, who has an international stature not shared by most of the rest of India's directors - Bengali or otherwise - dismisses brusquely the contention of some Indians critics that his films are made for foreign audiences.
''I always make my films primarily for my own audience,'' he said. ''I've never known what kind of film will export well. I have never been able to fathom what goes down well with the Western audience.
''You know, I made a film once called 'The Music Room,' which I thought was so Indian, because it had lots of Indian classical singing and dancing and music and whatnot,'' he recalled. ''It deals with problems which are totally Indian. I thought that film would never export. But it did very well abroad, and now in France, it's my most popular film. It's considered to be one of the great films of all time.'' He laughed heartily. ''I just don't understand.'' ''My first film was a success in Calcutta, a big success in Calcutta, even before it won a prize in Cannes,'' he said of ''Pather Panchali,'' released in 1955. ''It's wrong that people say that my success abroad eventually gave me a footing here. That's not true.
''I've always made films with an Indian audience in mind,'' he said. ''In fact, I've often had great difficulties in translating the dialogues, because they were so Indian, and so Bengali. So if I had thought of the Western audience first, then I certainly would have thought of different films.''
Mr. Ray said his deep attachment to the state of Bengal has led him to reject foreign film-making offers all of his life.
''I could have made films in Hollywood,'' he said.''I've had offers, many offers, which I turned down, because I don't have my roots there. I want my roots to be in the place where I work. I'm deeply rooted here, and I'm only interested in Indian subjects.''
The director acknowledges that with a relatively small - by Indian standards - Bengali market, and with a ban on Indian films in neighboring, Bengali-speaking Bangladesh, he has been grateful for his success abroad.
''The international market helps me to survive as a film maker,'' he said. ''There's no question about it, because I have a small market in India. That is to say, it's a Bengali-speaking audience primarily. Now, of late, I have started putting in English subtitles for Bombay, Delhi and Madras, but that still is a small market.''
Satyajit Ray has won dozens of prizes. This year, President Francois Mitterrand of France came to Calcutta to present him with the Medal of the Legion of Honor. But Mr. Ray has never won an Oscar.
''I've won almost every other kind of prize, except the Oscar,'' he said, reflectively. ''But you see, my films have never been entered for the Academy Awards. I have no agents in America, and it's just not happened. But I'm quite happy with what I have.''"

221,"In Africa, a Cow Is Still Not Just a Cow
1988-11-29T05:00:00.000Z
To the Editor:
While Princess Irene of Greece (letter, Nov. 18) is to be congratulated on her many fine projects, including now sending surplus Common Market cows to the third world, I can't help questioning the fate of productive milk cows that go to Uganda or other parts of Africa.
I don't know what conditions prevail in India or Bangladesh, but I have lived for many years in Africa, and the attitude of the average African toward cattle is such that if such a project were to be undertaken, I think it would fail without strict supervision. Cattle in Africa are regarded as ''lobola,'' or bride price, an index of social prestige and a custom very much alive in Africa, and the more cattle the better, without regard to condition or whether or not they produce milk. Which is why one sees herds of emaciated cattle in rural Africa.
I had personal experience with this attitude in a semirural environment, where the family had good elementary education. The family, consisting of six children and one adult, had one milk-producing cow, and when a serious drought affected the region, I offered to send money beyond what I was sending for their own needs to keep the cow alive. This was refused, and the cow was sold for a paltry sum that would have bought milk powder for about two months.
I don't know what the solution might be, but attitudes must first change before inroads can be made to alleviate Africa's mass, periodic famines. ZELDA MACK Vero Beach, Fla., Nov. 19, 1988"
223,"MAN IN THE NEWS; Diplomatic Handyman: Diego Cordovez
1988-04-16T05:00:00.000Z
A talent for waiting and a sense of humor have helped bring Diego Cordovez success in his six-year search for an Afghan settlement.
A patient negotiator, he has been stalking that elusive quarry since 1982 when, as the United Nations Secretary General's personal representative, he first sought to negotiate among the various parties in the vast Palais des Nations in Geneva.
At first business was slow and unpromising. The Russians refused United Nations mediation. The Afghan guerrillas would not deal with the Soviet-backed Government in Kabul at all and Pakistan, which agreed to represent the insurgents, would not share a negotiating table with it.
The innovative Mr. Cordovez, a 52-year-old Ecuadorean lawyer who has worked for the United Nations since 1963, started by talking to each side separately. It was uphill work. Shuttle Diplomacy
Then he hit on the idea of ''proximity talks'' - putting each side into a separate room and ''shuttling'' back and forth between them, while the United Nations disarmament talks droned on in an intervening conference hall.
Although progress remained slow, there were reasons to laugh. Overzealous guards, told to keep the warring factions apart, regularly locked delegates in the lavatory for fear they might bump into a member of the opposing camp. Mr. Cordovez took to limping through the corridors to signal that his talks were still limping along, despite everything.
Throughout all the disappointments and frustrations, Mr. Cordovez remained cheerful and persistent, maintaining that what was needed most was time and plenty of it. He was right. It took three years to persuade Kabul to cut the timetable for pulling out Soviet forces from Afghanistan from 43 months to 9.
Even now, Mr. Cordovez is banking on time, the great healer, to make his agreement a success. The accord provides for Soviet forces to leave Afghanistan but not for the Afghans to stop killing each other.
But Mr. Cordovez remains hopeful that once Afghanistan's warring factions see the provocative Russians leave, they will bury their Kalashnikovs and compromise. ''It takes time for them to understand their fate is in their own hands now,'' he said.
A stylishly dressed, plumpish man with horn-rimmed glasses, Mr. Cordovez is almost always laughing at something, occasionally himself. Enjoys Tinkering
He was born in Quito on Nov. 3, 1935; he and his wife, Maria Teresa, have a son, Diego. Mr. Cordovez enjoys carpentry and tinkering (he uses the French word bricolage) with broken things - useful hobbies for a United Nations bureaucrat.
A lover of good food, wine and Cuban cigars, Mr. Cordovez also enjoys reading biographies of the famous. Not even his closest friends would call him modest.
Mr. Cordovez was appointed an Under Secretary General by Kurt Waldheim a few months before he stepped down as Secretary General.
In 1965 he was sent to the Dominican Republic when it was in the throes of revolution. Six years later he was involved in the violent birth of the nation of Bangladesh. In 1980 he was the senior official accompanying a mission to Teheran that failed to resolve the United States Embassy hostage crisis. He had better luck later that year when he helped settle a dispute between Malta and Libya over seabed rights.
Despite his optimistic temperament, Mr. Cordovez's friends say he suffers occasional fits of gloom. A few days ago, with the Afghan talks on the verge of collapse, he said he was through with diplomacy and would go back to Ecuador to manage his family's horse ranch when this job was over. That seems unlikely now.
His job as Under Secretary General for Political Affairs includes settling the Persian Gulf conflict, too, so another odyssey lies ahead.
Mr. Cordovez plans frequent trips to Afghanistan in the coming months to oversee compliance with the treaty and to encourage the country's factions to reach a political settlement.
He is preparing seriously for the task. Visitors to his offices here are treated with Coca-Cola bottled in Kabul and offered a variety of Marlboro cigarettes popular in Afghanistan these days - they are made in the Soviet Union."

A slapstick comedy about a ten-year-old boy fervently idolizing Hitler? Jojo Rabbit is indeed a nod to the remarkable power of humour Rainer Maria Rilke, one of the most gifted German poets who is frequently quoted in Jojo Rabbit, appealed to his readers to ""let everything happen"" to them, to delight in the humbling embrace of all beauty and terror. And Taika Waititi's coming-of-age drama Jojo Rabbit is the rare convergence of these two profound, albeit opposite truths of life. Jojo Rabbit is a World War II satire revolving around a German boy named Jojo who joins a Hitler Youth camp and starts having qualms about the Third Reich afterwards when he discovers his mother has hidden a Jewish girl named Elsa in the crawlspace of their house.  A slapstick comedy about a ten-year-old boy fervently idolizing Hitler? Jojo Rabbit is indeed a nod to the remarkable power of humour.  What this miracle of a film does so effectively is that it attempts to take the power away from the fascist narrative and exposes its idiocy through comedy. It sheds light on the buffoonish petulance of the likes of Hitler, but does not reduce the horrors of the Holocaust, rather emasculates its perpetrators with the help of a stellar cast and a balanced script.    Thomasin McKenzie plays a Jewish girl named Elsa in Jojo Rabbit, following her acclaimed performance in 2018's Leave No Trace| IMDb Jojo is a lonely young boy whose father has gone to war, never to come back. He has in turn filled the absence of his father with blind fanaticism. Hitler heils has certainly helped him drown out the noise within his troubled mind. However, upon finding Elsa, constrained by his innate nobility and ostensible cowardice, Jojo slowly begins to question the Nazi juggernaut. Telling this story from a child's perspective is arguably what makes the film work.     Thomasin McKenzie, who plays Elsa, has delivered another brilliantly understated performance following her acclaimed role in Leave no Trace. Elsa - a creative Jewish girl - does not give in to rage; her resilience rises above the oppression inflicted upon her people. She is caged, yet appears to be the embodiment of the strength that keeps the spirit of resistance alive.  On the other hand, Scarlett Johansson, in the vibrant role of Jojo's single mother, manages to pull off one of her career-best performances to this date, by playing an elegantly witty character who is unafraid to go beyond the mere aesthetics of resistance and the good old convenient life for a just cause.   Scarlett Johansson has earned her first two Oscar nominations - Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress - the latter for Jojo Rabbit| IMDb The depiction of Nazis as good people is bound to make certain critics blast this film, much like the fate in store for the Oscar-winning German film The Lives of Others. In light of the current political divide, there is merit to this discussion.   In August, 2017, neo-Nazis paraded the streets of Charlottesville, chanting anti-Semitic slogans. The US President Trump later famously addressed ""the very fine people"" on both sides, pandering to some of his white supremacist base. Consequently, he established a moral equivalence that in all objectivity does not exist.  Thankfully, Taika Waititi is more tactful than that. He succeeds at finding the tricky balance between the evils of fascism and the allures of resistance. There is an astonishing poignancy beneath the surface of humour, and whenever it swells into a crescendo, the transition feels seamless.  As World War II approaches its end in the latter half of Jojo Rabbit, we as audience members find ourselves not laughing along with Hitler. Rather, we are laughing at him, chipping away at his racial hatred. Therein lies the brilliance of Jojo Rabbit. "

Hundreds of thousands of Muslim devotees braved a cold spell to take part in the final prayers on the banks of the Turag in Gazipur's Tongi on Saturday The 55th edition of Bishwa Ijtema is expected to end with the second phase's Akheri Munajat or final prayer on Sunday on the banks of the river Turag at Tongi. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim devotees braved a cold spell to take part in the final prayers on the banks of the Turag in Gazipur's Tongi on Saturday, amid heightened security measures. On the second day of the first phase's Ijtema, the second largest congregation of the Muslim community after Hajj, Islamic scholars delivered sermons on different aspects of Islam in the light of the holy Quran and Hadith on Sunday. The Muslim devotees have thronged the Ijtema ground under the open sky while more than 1,500 foreign devotees from 35 countries, including from Jordan, Libya, Africa, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Palestine, the USA, Turkey, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, England, joined the Ijtema from the first day of the second phase. People from all corners of the country started streaming into Tongi since Saturday evening to join the Akheri Munajat. Many made the journey to the venue on foot as a large part of Dhaka Mymensingh Highway was closed to traffic. Md Anwar Hossain, commissioner of Gazipur Metropolitan Police, said the plying buses will remain closed on Dhaka-Mymensingh highway from Gazipur Chowrasta intersection to Mohakhali in the capital from 4am for smooth movement of the devotees. Buses from northern districts will remain halted at Konabari in Gazipur while all link roads towards Tongi will be closed during the Akheri Munajat, he added.

In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants -- Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh has been struggling with air pollution for a long time. Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Brick kilns, vehicles run on fuel containing higher levels of sulphur, as well as construction work, have all been identified as major sources of air pollution. Air quality further declines during the dry months -- from October to April -- but improves during the monsoon."

He proposed a three-point plan for India's current economic slowdown and social unrest Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has spoken out against the recent predicaments unravelling in India including the economic slowdown, social unrest, and global coronavirus epidemic. Over the past few weeks, Delhi has been subjected to extreme violence over religious disputes following the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which provides access to citizenship for religiously persecuted minorities, excluding Muslims.  Singh, in an op-ed in The Hindu, even criticized people who use past instances of such violence in India's history to justify the present violence in the country, adding that: ""Every act of sectarian violence is a blemish on Mahatma Gandhi's India."" Singh suggested that the Indian government implement a three-point plan which includes taking measures to contain the coronavirus threat, withdrawing or amending the Citizenship Act, and creating a holistic fiscal stimulus plan to boost consumption demand.  By removing religious stipulations from the Citizenship Act, India would be ending the toxic social climate and foster national unity, as well as reviving the economy. India's economy is currently facing an economic slowdown due to a lack of new private investment, since investors are unwilling to take on new projects over the looming uncertainty of volatile social tensions.  The lack of investment translates to a lack of jobs and incomes, which in turn means a lack of consumption and demand in the economy. This lack of demand further suppresses private investments, leading to a vicious cycle.  Singh, a renowned economist, stated that no amount of tweaking of tax rates, showering of corporate incentives, or goading will propel Indian or foreign businesses to invest, when the risk of eruption of sudden violence in one's neighbourhood looms large. Furthermore, the fear of the coronavirus epidemic reaching India threatens to dampen economic growth, further exacerbating the dire situation of the Indian economy. Despite the ambiguity of the situation, Singh proposes that India launch a full-scale, mission-mode operation to counter the threat immediately. Moreover, Singh has said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi must convince the nation that he is cognizant of the dangers and reassure the nation that he can help tide over this period of violence and uncertainty as smoothly as possible. He must also provide details of a contingency plan for the threat of the coronavirus scare. He adds that the virus contagion and the slowing down of China can potentially open up an opportunity for India to unleash reforms to become a larger player in the global economy and vastly improve prosperity levels for millions of Indians. ""It is time to confront the harsh reality of the grave risks we face as a nation and address them squarely and sufficiently."" "

Despite the coronavirus precautions, voters were enthusiastic Early voting in South Korea's parliamentary election began on Friday with coronavirus patients casting ballots at disinfected polling stations and candidates bumping fists instead of pressing the flesh as they appeal for support. The election could decide the control of parliament and shape President Moon Jae-in's ability to implement his agenda in the final two years of his administration, including looser fiscal policy aimed at creating jobs, raising the minimum wage, and continued re-engagement with North Korea. The National Election Commission set up eight polling stations for more than 3,000 coronavirus patients receiving treatment as well as 900 medical staff at treatment centres in hard-hit areas, including the capital, Seoul, and Daegu city. The election is on April 15 but officials are hoping that people will take advantage of early voting to reduce the numbers crowding polling locations that day. Polling stations were disinfected on Thursday and all voters were required to wear a mask, use sanitizers and wear plastic gloves. Officials checked temperatures and anyone higher than 37.5 Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit) was directed to special booths. Despite the coronavirus precautions, voters were enthusiastic. ""It was a little uncomfortable since I had to put on plastic,"" said Kim Ju-yeon, 22, who voted at a polling station at Seoul Station, referring to the gloves she had to wear. ""But because voting is a must, the experience was reassuring."" There are 3,500 stations for voters to cast their ballots during two days of early voting starting on Friday. Moon cast his ballot at a polling station near the presidential office, known as the Blue House. ""There might be a long line of voters on the election day. I hope the early voting distributes that number,"" Moon said after voting. The government is also considering how some 46,500 people who have not tested positive but are in self-quarantine - most of them returnees from abroad - can cast their ballots. ""We are in consultation with related ministries on how to ensure the right to vote for those in self-quarantine on April 15,"" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters on Friday. Kim said the people in self-isolation could not take part in the early voting because of the risk they might be infected. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 new coronavirus cases on Friday, bringing the national tally to 10,450. The national death toll rose by four to 208. Candidates who began campaigning early this month have been wearing masks and exchanging fist bumps with voters in small meetings, shunning handshakes and big rallies. ""We're refraining from large rallies as much as possible and also limiting personal contact,"" said Lee Nak-yon, a former prime minister running for the parliament. The head of the main opposition United Future Party, Hwang Kyo-ahn, was spotted disinfecting residential areas. "

In the last general election held on December 30, a total of 881,619 non-EVM votes were declared invalid by the returning officers of 299 constituencies Experts are saying Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) can prevent invalid or spoilt votes during any polls in Bangladesh. The 11th parliament polls on December 30, which witnessed highest number of invalid votes ever recorded, is also a testimony that EVMs are fullproof as far as  rate of spoilt ballot papers or invalid votes is concerned.   In the election held on December 30 last year, a total of 881,619 votes were declared invalid by the returning officers of 299 constituencies.  Invalid votes have been seen in almost all constituencies (except Rangpur 6) where votes were cast manually, i.e. by stamping a seal on the ballot paper. But all the votes were declared valid in the following constituencies, where electronic voting machines (EVMs) were used: Dhaka 6 and 13, Chittagong 9, Rangpur 3, Khulna 2 and Satkhira 2. Muhammed Sohul Hussain and Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Sakhawat Hussain, who served the ATM Shamsul Huda-led Election Commission as election commissioners from 2007 to 2012, had suggested the use of EVMs to prevent invalid or spoilt votes. While talking to the Dhaka Tribune over the phone, Sohul Hussain said ""Hopefully Bangladesh will adopt EVMs for the whole electoral process in future."" ""We introduced EVMs during our tenure. People will realize no vote-rigging can be done using these voting machines; rather votes are easily and safely cast. There will be no misconception in this regard,"" the former election commissioner added. While talking about how votes are counted as spoilt, he explained: ""Votes can become invalid on the off-chance that the voter did not intend to vote for that specific symbol. Sometimes, they might unfortunately stamp seals onto the wrong symbol during the manual ballot paper process. They then stamp the seal again on their favoured symbol. In these cases, ballot papers are announced invalid due to the double seal. ""But in EVMs, just pressing a button, the valuable vote is cast and then locked to count as a valid vote. People can easily go through this process. Furthermore, there is no chance to count any vote as invalid in EVMs,"" he further added. Former election commissioner Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Sakhawat Hussain told the Dhaka Tribune: ""Allegations of vote-rigging, like in the recently held 11th parliamentary election, would be reduced if EVMs are installed in all constituencies."" He said: ""There is no issue of counting invalid votes in EVMs. I think the time has come to think about overall issues regarding this. Are we going to take votes by EVMs or not?"" ""As you are saying, the number of invalid votes in this election is not a small number. EVMs will be beneficial in the future, where everyone can cast their votes and no vote will be considered as invalid,"" the former election commissioner added. ""Regarding other allegations, I think party people seizing the election booths should be prevented,"" he said. In 2014's 10th parliamentary polls, the invalid vote count was 263,037; 636,294 in the 9th; 449,082 in the 8th; 462,302 in the 7th; and 373,322 in the 5th."

The lower intensity of conflict in Syria and Iraq has contributed to this decrease, observes PEC The Press Emblem Campaign (PEC) noted with satisfaction a decrease in the number of journalists killed so far in the year compared with the same period last year.  On the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, the PEC noted a 56% decrease registering 20 victims in 12 countries from January 1 to April 30 against 46 during the same period last year, using the same metrics. The figure is the lowest figure since 2006.  PEC Secretary-General Blaise Lempen observed the lower intensity of conflict in Syria and Iraq contributed to this decrease. In addition, the continuous engagement of governments, associations and civil society in favor of the issue of the safety of journalists has certainly produced positive effects. It is also true that other means are used to neutralize journalists. The situation remains steadily hostile in Mexico with six journalists killed and Afghanistan with four killed, which adds up to half the victims since the beginning of 2019.  One journalist was killed in the following countries: Ghana, Honduras, India, Iraq, Northern Ireland, Kenya, Libya, Pakistan, the Philippines and Yemen. The PEC strongly condemns the killings and calls for quick identification of the killers and bringing them to justice."

Although still producing earthen pots and utensils, lack of innovation and inability to use technology has held them back without ever reaching their full potential. In the small village of Kartikpur in Bhedarganj upazila of Shariatpur, a dynasty of potters, namely Pals and Kumars, have sustained the rare pottery industry in spite of the onslaught of technological advancements. Although still producing earthen pots and utensils, lack of innovation and inability to use technology has held them back without ever reaching their full potential. A host of potters in Kartikpur, namely Samir Pal, Pradip Pal, Sandip Pal, Gobind Pal, Jawahar Lal Pal and Uttam Pal, have a few factories set up in the region, where they create at least 3,000 items, including utensils, collectibles, and household products. These items include terracotta shades, tiles, candle stands, flower vases, coin boxes, wall coverings, wall pots, visiting card boxes and scores of other such products. Hundreds of workers from the neighbouring villages of Rambhadrapur and Dingamanik are also recruited in the factories, breaking an age-old tradition of only Pal community members working in the craft. A wide range of NGOs and other development agencies, namely Aarong, Caritas, Heed Bangladesh, Usha Handicrafts and more, usually purchase products from Kartikpur's potters, which are sold across the country, as well as internationally in countries spanning Europe, North America, the Middle East, and neighbouring countries like India. Every factory etches their logo on their products for authenticity. Work reportedly goes on throughout the year, with products ranging between 1.5 inches to 6 feet, costing anywhere between Tk5,000-30,000. Potters said they usually begin the process by gathering alluvial soil and mixing it with water. The clay mixture is then processed, using an imported filter from Germany, and kept on a special pan for 20 days. After 20 days, the excess water is drained and the clay formation that remains, known locally as mundu, is dried in the sun and mixed with very little water, forming the base for all their pottery items. They said that newly-formed pottery items and must be stored in closed rooms for 10-12 days before fire curing, after which they are colored as required and are then delivered to clients.  Previously, clients would market the products for the potters, but now they have taken over the marketing process themselves. Sandip Kumar Pal, a potter, said his family has been in the pottery business for generations. He was first inspired by an art faculty of then-Dhaka Art College in 1976 to showcase his products and to sell them in Dhaka and Chittagong. After gaining exposure, he was approached by several NGOs and other agencies, who signed contracts with him to market his products further and beyond Bangladesh. He also said the agencies are now showcasing his products in countries across the world, fetching foreign currency in the process. Uttam Kumar Pal, another potter, lamented that the production price of a night lamp is between Tk70-80, but sells for only Tk90-95. Even worse, when it is sent to Dhaka it sells for anywhere between Tk400-500. ""My factory also builds clay elephants 5-7ft long, which cost Tk15,000-20,000 to make,"" he added, ""but they sell in Dhaka for Tk30,000-40,000."" Rangadip Pal lamented that at one point, he used to earn Tk60,000 a month from selling his pottery items, but now the scenario is not as rosy as before. He has gained a lot more in state honors and recognition than before, but his income has not been the same, as the revenue numbers are not good enough to replenish his working capital on a monthly basis. The potters sought government intervention for the sustainability of the industry. Enam Ahmed, deputy manager of the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) industry assistance centre in the district, acknowledged the contribution of these potters to the economy and culture. He added they will provide more technical support to the potters if they request their assistance, in terms of innovation, integrating technology into their trade, and financial support, if necessary."

THY HAND, GREAT ANARCH! India: 1921-1952. By Nirad C. Chaudhuri. 979 pp. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. $29.95.
On his wedding night, Nirad Chaudhuri, a man in his early 30's, sat beside his bride for the first time. He was in a state of high anxiety, but not because his previous sexual experiences had amounted only to gazing from afar at a young woman in a nearby house and studiously reading the classics of French pornography. What he was worried about was whether his new wife would permit him to pursue his passion for phonograph recordings of European classical music. Carefully he broached the subject: Could she spell ''Beethoven''? To his great relief she slowly responded: ''B,E,E,T,H,O,V,E,N.''
Nirad Chaudhuri is a fiction created by the Indian writer of the same name - a bizarre, outrageous and magical transformation of that stock character of imperialist literature, the Bengali Babu. Ever since Mr. Chaudhuri failed his M.A. examination in history at Calcutta University and threw over a secure post as clerk in the military accounts department, he has devoted himself to responding to the notion that Indians could not be truly learned in the civilization of Europe. As a man of culture - not, as he would put it, in the anthropological sense - he would beat the British at their own game.
Now 91 years old and living in Oxford, England, Mr. Chaudhuri has written this monstrously long memoir - ''Thy Hand, Great Anarch!'' - as a way to settle scores not only with the British, but with India's nationalist leaders, that is, with those who opposed and finally defeated the Westernization of Indian civilization. He sees himself as the last survivor of the so-called Bengal Renaissance, the vital and creative cultural movement that was initiated by Ram Mohan Roy (c. 1774-1833) and that came to an end with the death of Rabindranath Tagore in 1941.
According to Mr. Chaudhuri, the Bengali Hindu gentry lost their rightful role as the political and cultural leaders of modern India, partly as a result of their own moral limitations, but mostly because of a combination of British racism and the rise of democratic politics. To reverse the old colonial cliche, British imperialism was a fine thing except for the British, for they continually opposed the efforts of Indians to participate in the European way of life. But the real villains, the author says, were Nehru and especially Gandhi, who threw over the opportunity of their youthful experience in England to deny all that could have revitalized India.
Mr. Chaudhuri didn't have the advantages of India's leaders. Born in 1897, his knowledge of things European came almost entirely from the Imperial Library in Calcutta or from books purchased at great personal sacrifice. In 1942, with Tagore dead, with the Japanese just east of Bengal and the political leadership of Bengali Hindus eclipsed by Bengal's Muslim majority and, at the national level, by non-Bengalis like Gandhi and Nehru, Mr. Chaudhuri said his goodbye to all that and left Bengal. ''My people had no future,'' he decided, ''and I was not prepared to share their fate.''
For the previous five years he had been private secretary to an important leader of the Indian National Congress, Sarat Chandra Bose, whose younger brother, Subhas, drummed out of the Congress, had joined the Axis powers as leader of the Indian National Army. Always pro-British - Churchill, the fiercest antagonist of Indian nationalism, was his political hero - Mr. Chaudhuri accepted a position as a writer of propaganda (frankly so called in those days) for the Government broadcasting system in Delhi. In his previous career as a freelance journalist, editor and radio commentator, he had written in both Bengali and English; now he virtually gave up Bengali and along with it much of the Bengali style of living. For the first time in his life, he adopted English clothing, of course of the best material and cut. He also made the supreme sacrifice and started eating English-style food, having come to the conclusion that ''good English cannot be written on [ an Indian ] diet.''
In 1947, Mr. Chaudhuri set out to write ''The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian.'' That was also the year of India's independence and partition. Bengal was divided, with Mr. Chaudhuri's birthplace in what is now Bangladesh. His memoir follows the pattern of much Bengali fiction. There is a sensitive and lyrical description of early childhood and education in the rural heartland of Bengal, followed by an account of a painful uprooting to the city of Calcutta; in the end, the hero is cast adrift in tragic isolation - all this a romantic echo of the classical Hindu stages of life.
The ''Autobiography'' took Mr. Chaudhuri's life story and his account of India's modern development to 1921. ''Thy Hand, Great Anarch!'' is the continuation, ending the story in 1952 with the publication (in 1951) and reception of that first book. It was only three years later that Mr. Chaudhuri got to travel to his beloved Europe (the account of that brief trip is his best book, ''A Passage to England''). In 1970, thanks to the personal patronage of the American sociologist Edward Shils, he settled down in England, never to return to India.
The reception of ''The Autobiography of an Unknown Indian'' invalidated its title. Mr. Chaudhuri became notorious, celebrated in England and the United States, denounced in India. In his first book he had declared himself a failure, but here, for all his bitterness, the protagonist is characterized by immense self-satisfaction.
Mr. Chaudhuri deliberately had the ''Autobiography'' and most of his subsequent books published initially in England, on the grounds that only then would they receive attention in India. In ''Thy Hand, Great Anarch!'' he portrays himself as ''a Cassandra, giving warnings of calamities to come.'' It is only out of frustration that he has accepted the more comfortable role of shoring up the ethnocentric self-confidence of Westerners by debunking India. ''Even now my countrymen have not learnt to be afraid of me, and pay no heed to what I write.'' It is sad but understandable that Mr. Chaudhuri prefers what he calls ''my literary standing in the English speaking world.''
This book's title, derived from Alexander Pope's ringing conclusion to the ''Dunciad,'' announces the author's bitter satirical purpose, for he depicts both modern India and the modern world as mired in a reign of chaos. The subtitle, ''India: 1921-1952,'' makes the book sound like a history, and indeed much of it is made up of lengthy historical essays or high-flown disquisitions about the rise and fall of civilizations.
As a historian Mr. Chaudhuri is useful insofar as he recounts personal experience - for example, his accounts of the Bose brothers or of Hindu-Muslim riots at the time of partition. But much of the history in this book is second-hand at best. Great cascades of flowery erudition, allusions to the histories of ancient Greece and endless quotations of French poetry are of interest mostly as evidence of Mr. Chaudhuri's artfully constructed persona. Indeed, he points out the hollowness of the whole enterprise as a work of scholarship by saying at the outset that a history of the period cannot be written, since all the documents are false and all historians ignorant or dishonest. And only he is left to tell the tale. But he also says that the tale is not worth telling, that nothing was achieved by all the political events of the period, that Gandhi had nothing to do with the departure of the British, that the British left out of sheer exhaustion at the hands of Hitler. If one were to ask how he can know what he claims to know, the history would vanish into air. A good editor would have removed most of it.
But people have said the same thing about ''War and Peace.'' Although Mr. Chaudhuri may not be what Saul Bellow would call the Tolstoy of the Bengalis, he may remind many readers of Nabokov's Pnin."

At least six people were killed - including a 17-year old high school student - after two nights of rioting in the capital as police clashed with protesters opposed to the re-election of President Joko Widodo Tens of thousands of  Indonesian military and police were deployed on the streets of Jakarta Thursday, as a deadline approached for a presidential challenger to file an appeal over claims of widespread cheating in last month's election. At least six people were killed - including a 17-year old high school student - after two nights of rioting in the capital as police clashed with protesters opposed to the re-election of President Joko Widodo. The violence has been fanned by claims from Widodo's rival Prabowo Subianto, a retired general, that the April 17 poll was a fraud. Indonesia's election commission on Tuesday confirmed Widodo had beaten Subianto, who has until Friday to challenge the results at the Constitutional Court. The 67-year-old has appealed for calm and said he would pursue legal channels, as he did, unsuccessfully, against Widodo in the 2014 election. Election officials and analysts discounted Subianto's claims of rampant cheating in the world's third-biggest democracy, after India and the United States. The government has partly blocked access to social media - including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram - in a bid to clamp down on fake news and hoaxes linked to the violence. At least six people are dead and hundreds injured as Indonesia continues to grapple with post-election riots. https://t.co/o6L14Mm4QT On Wednesday evening, the area around the election supervisory agency's office erupted in fresh skirmishes with thousands of protesters chanting and waving Indonesian flags. Some hurled stones, fireworks and molotov cocktails at riot police who lined up behind a razor wire barricade near the election supervisory agency building, where a police post was torched. Police pushed back the main group of rioters after firing tear gas and rubber bullets at the demonstrators.  An Australian Broadcasting Corporation news crew said it was attacked without warning by a mob. 'Provocateurs' Indonesia's capital been gripped by bigger demonstrations in the past, but the level of violence in this week's clashes has not been seen in years. Among the half-dozen people killed was a 17-year-old high school student and a 19-year-old, according to local media. Authorities said the victims died from gunshots or blunt force trauma, but denied that they fired live rounds on the crowds. It remained unclear who was responsible for their deaths. By Thursday morning, Jakarta's streets were relatively quiet as the police and military kept a close watch on buildings in the downtown core, including the election supervisory agency building - the centre of much of the violence - as well as parliament, embassies and the presidential palace amid fears of more unrest. Nearly 60,000 security personnel were deployed Thursday, nearly double the previous number, after Widodo vowed that he ""won't tolerate"" more riots. Authorities have blamed the violence on ""provocateurs"" that they claimed had come from outside Jakarta to stir up trouble. ""We've detained more than 300 suspects and are now interrogating them,"" said national police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo. Elsewhere, smaller election protests were held in Sumatra's Medan city and in Pontianak on Borneo island, where over 500 demonstrators armed with stones and firecrackers blocked roads, damaged vehicles and set two police posts alight, local police said."

The official death toll since the outbreak in the country has risen to 22,745 Deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy rose by 575 on Friday, up from 525 the day before, while the number of new cases declined slightly and scientists warned that infections were now mainly happening among family members. The daily tally of new cases stood at 3,493, down from a previous 3,786, with both deaths and infections extending the broadly stable situation in place over the last 12 days. This plateau is considerably lower than the peaks reached around the end of March, but the downtrend has not proceeded as was widely hoped in a country that has been in lockdown for almost six weeks. ""Probably most of the infections that have occurred since the lockdown have occurred within families,"" Giovanni Rezza, a director of Italy's top health body, the Superior Health Institute (ISS), told a news conference. Nuclear physicist Paolo Branchini, who has been focusing on the trend of cases and deaths in Italy, told daily Corriere della Sera on Friday that the lockdown initially put a lid on infections but had now ""exhausted its beneficial effect"". Branchini said that because the main source of infections was now within families, the only way to reduce deaths and cases further was to put all people who tested positive in dedicated centres away from their relatives. The official death toll since the outbreak came to light on February 21, has risen to 22,745, the Civil Protection Agency said, the second highest in the world after that of the United States. However, the Italian authorities acknowledge that the true number of fatalities is much higher. The Superior Health Institute said a survey on a sample of nursing homes suggested more than 40% of residents who died from February 1 to April 15 had either tested positive for the new coronavirus or had symptoms consistent with the disease. Restive regions The government has said its tough restrictions on movement and the closure of most businesses will continue at least until May 3, but there is not yet any clear plan over to what extent, or how gradually, it will then be lifted. In the meantime, some of Italy's 20 regions are threatening to take autonomous action. Luca Zaia, the head of the northern Veneto region which has made particular progress in bringing the outbreak under control, said on Friday he wanted to relax restrictions before May 3. ""The lockdown doesn't exist anymore,"" Zaia told reporters, in reference to the government having allowed a few types of business to reopen over the last week. In response, the chief of the southern Campania region around Naples, Vincenzo De Luca, said if northern regions did not respect all the curbs in place, Campania would ""close its borders"" and refuse entry to non-residents for any reason. The outbreak remains heavily concentrated in the northern regions of Lombardy, around the financial capital Milan, and neighbouring Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna. The number of officially confirmed cases in Italy on Friday totalled 172,434, the third highest global tally behind those of the United States and Spain."

Fighting climate change plays a key role as rising temperatures create more amenable conditions for diseases to spread The novel coronavirus will not be the last pandemic to wreak havoc on humanity if people continue to ignore links between infectious diseases and destruction of the natural world, environmental experts have warned. ""I'm absolutely sure that there are going to be more diseases like this in future if we continue with our practices of destroying the natural world, deforestation and capturing wild animals as pets or for food and medicine,"" Dr Enric Sala, marine ecologist and part of National Geographic's Campaign For Nature, told The Independent. The World Health Organization has reported 8,778 deaths and 209,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The virus is thought to have initially passed from animals to humans at a ""wet market"" selling produce, seafood and live animals in Wuhan, China in December but this is not yet confirmed. Researchers in China have suggested that pangolins, mammals known as 'scaly ant-eaters', are the probable animal source of COVID-19, according to scientific journal Nature. China has since issued a ban on consumption and farming of wild animals, and wildlife markets. However, environmentalists warn of a broader issue: Humanity's voracious destruction of diverse ecosystems which brings us in closer contact with wildlife than ever before. David Quammen, author of 2012 bestseller, Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, became interested in infectious diseases while researching Ebola and has been warning about the risk of pandemics ever since. He told The Independent: ""Our highly diverse ecosystems are filled with many species of wild animals, plants, fungi and bacteria. All of that biological diversity contains unique viruses. ""When we tear down tropical forests to build villages, timber and mining camps, kill or capture wild animals for food, we expose ourselves to those viruses. ""It's like if you demolish an old barn then dust flies. When you demolish a tropical forest, viruses fly. Those moments of destruction represent opportunity for unfamiliar viruses to get into humans and take hold."" Dr Samuel Myers, principle research scientist at Harvard's Department of Environmental Health and director of the Planetary Health Alliance, told The Independent: ""Human incursions into wildlife habitat bring people into closer proximity with wildlife populations. ""What we know is that other animals are an enormous reservoir of pathogens, many of which we haven't yet been exposed to."" Vector-borne diseases - those from living organisms that can transmit infectious pathogens between humans, or from animals to humans - account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases and cause more than 700,000 deaths each year, according to WHO. They have increased over time. Around 30 new infectious diseases emerged during the 1950s, according to a study in journal Nature. By the 1980s, that number more than tripled.  We have previously seen the spread of other zoonotic diseases like HIV, Ebola, SARS, MERS and Zika. Dr Myers said: ""The HIV epidemic and Ebola were thought to have emerged from bushmeat hunting. MERS and SARS came out of live animal 'wet markets'.  ""At the live markets in Wuhan, for example, there was an extraordinary number of exotic species alive in cages, all in proximity to each other and to humans in a way that you would never find in the natural world."" He added: ""It's a combination of the size of the human ecological footprint and globalization. Once a pathogen has made that jump from animals to humans, it has the capacity to spread around the globe very quickly with air travel."" Regulation and education on the dangers of consuming wildlife plays a part in mitigating the risk. Quammen said: ""There are people all over the world desperate for protein who eat wild animals. It's not something I want to demonize as a Chinese vice. ""There are so many of us hungry for resources that as we reduce the wild down to these tiny remnants, we offer ourselves as a target of opportunity for viruses."" Dr Sala said: ""When it comes to populations that depend on the exploitation of nature for their day-to-day living, alternatives have to be provided. ""Governments have a key role in setting policies that protect the nature world and regulate or ban wildlife trade. Companies can help. The world already produces enough food for 10 billion people, only we waste a third of it."" Fighting climate change plays a key role as rising temperatures create more amenable conditions for diseases to spread. Dr Myers said: ""We're aware that malaria is being found in higher latitudes, and higher altitudes, like in the Kenyan Highlands where we never used to see temperatures as warm."" The decimation of the natural world extends far beyond infectious disease outbreaks, Dr Myers points out. ""We're seeing impacts on the quality and quantity of food we produce; exposure to noncommunicable diseases like heart disease, cancer and respiratory disease along with mental health impacts, population displacement and conflict,"" he said. With biodiversity loss and a growing global population - expected to rise by 2 billion to 9.7 billion by 2050 - seeking food sources, the question of the next pandemic is not if but when, experts warn. ""If we get [COVID-19] under control, then we can be glad that human ingenuity and will managed to control this one. But after we celebrate for five minutes, we should start thinking about the next one,"" David Quammen said. Sweeping change is needed including making the crucial link between human health and conservation of the planet. Dr Sala said: ""They are not disconnected. There is no sustainable human health without a healthy ecosystem. These infectious diseases we have experienced over the last 20 years are best proof of that. ""Keeping the wild places intact, banning the hunting and traffic of wildlife species, many of which are endangered, would not only be practical but beneficial in terms of human health and economics. ""For governments and policy-makers, it is going to be very clear that investment in protecting our natural world is the most cost-effective one they can make."" "

273,"SALMAN RUSHDIE: FICTION'S EMBATTLED INFIDEL
1989-01-29T05:00:00.000Z
BRICK LANE, IN LONDON'S EAST END, IS A neighborhood peopled by those whom the city never expected to accommodate. It is a neighborhood of Asians - as they are called by the English, who are comfortable still with the old colonial term that did not distinguish among the many peoples east of Europe. There are thought to be 40,000 Asians in Brick Lane, mostly Muslims from Bengal, a region cleaved in 1947 when India was partitioned and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) created. They have come for many reasons - exiles, refugees, schemers - and they have not always been welcomed. ''Asian'' suggests not only the distance the immigrants have traveled but also the distance at which they remain. And something more troubling, a sense of unease and estrangement, is suggested by newer, post-colonial terms: quotas, fourth world, National Front, Paki-bashing.
I walked in Brick Lane one morning last November with the novelist Salman Rushdie. Rushdie, who is 41, was born in Bombay; he was sent to England to be schooled, and later chose to settle in London because London was where he could write the fiction he wanted to. In Bombay or in any other city in that part of the world, there wasn't the climate for the writer he wanted to be, not yet.
''I wanted to write globe-swallowing, capacious books, ones with that sense of size, novels that expressed history, the public side of things as well as the private, the intimate,'' he had told me when I'd first met him, in New York, early last fall.
And he did write such books. Two sweeping, stylistically dazzling novels - ''Midnight's Children'' and ''Shame'' - established his reputation in the early 1980's as one of the most important writers of his generation in England. Moreover, he is the only one among them - I am thinking of such writers as Martin Amis, Julian Barnes, Ian McEwan - whose books have traveled well. Rushdie, in the United States especially, is discussed in the company of our world storytellers: Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Milan Kundera, Gunter Grass.
When I first met Rushdie, I had just finished reading his extraordinary new novel, ''The Satanic Verses,'' now making its way into American bookstores. (A review appears today in The Times Book Review.) The book may be understood as the third volume of an unintended trilogy, one in which a novelist named Salman Rushdie moves not only westward but inward, searching for yet another way to redescribe a world increasingly connected, but in no way whole.
The societal fissures that Rushdie examines in ''The Satanic Verses'' have been sharply, if strangely, mirrored in the book's reception. In England, it has attracted praise, award nominations (it won Britain's Whitbread prize as best novel), and many, many readers. In England, it has also been vilified and even burned at rallies by Islamic fundamentalists. The controversy - and it is not just England's controversy; the book has been banned in India, Egypt and Saudi Arabia - is about more than the book, of course. But like all controversies surrounding novels, it has reopened one of our great cultural questions: how and why does fiction mean so much?
The book's opening pages tell of an astonishing, fantastical immigration: Two middle-aged Indian actors, Gibreel Farishta and Saladin Chamcha, hurtle through cold thin air toward the English coast - singing, razzing each other, and already, like all immigrants, longing at once to remember and to forget. They have been blown out of a hijacked airliner, and miraculously, after a 29,000-foot free-fall, survive and make their ways to London. In episode after episode of the loose, shifting narrative that moves the novel forward and frames its many stories, they struggle to get a fix on London, and on themselves. They learn new ways of construing the world. They are mugged by ghosts - old lovers, old habits of mind and feeling. They return to the East, in jumbo jets and dreams, but never fully, never again. (An excerpt appears on page 48.)
Deep, at times fathomless questions are plumbed: what is the nature of Good? Of Evil? Is Farishta an archangel? Chumcha Satan? Was their fall a contemporary version of The Fall? But the novel never strays too far or too long from London's streets: Rushdie's prose - the lustrous, alloyed English he's fused from street slang, Great Books, rock songs, ad jingles, immigrant patois, everything - has a way of keeping us in the crowded, gritty here and now, even in the book's most phantasmagoric pages. Farishta and Chumcha, and the Dickensian array of characters they encounter (or imagine), people what is ultimately the first major novel of the new England, an England with more than two million immigrants, one in which it is no longer clear, exactly, what ''English life'' comprises, what ''being English'' means.
A good deal of the novel unfolds in a neighborhood called Brickhall - a neighborhood, Rushdie had told me, utilizing one of his favorite locutions, that ''is and is not'' Brick Lane. I had asked him when I'd met him in New York if he might show me around - Brick Lane is not a part of London a Western visitor sees - and he had agreed. But when I'd arrived in London and phoned him, I'd expected he would tell me he had changed his mind. In places like Brick Lane now, there were individuals vowing to kill him.
EARLY IN OCTOBER, ''THE SATANIC Verses'' had been banned by the Indian Government under pressure from several Muslim leaders, who insisted that the novel - two hallucinatory chapters of which involve a prophet who is and is not Mohammed - was insulting to Islam, blasphemous. By the end of October, the controversy had surfaced elsewhere, and angrily - in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Egypt, South Africa, every country or city with a sizable Muslim population, including London, where the book had been published in late September and had quickly become a best seller.
Rushdie and his book were denounced in mosques around the city. Hundreds of protest letters (most of them form letters, a sign of an organized campaign) were arriving each day at the London offices of Viking, the book's publisher. Leaders of Islamic groups attending the annual Conservative Party convention in Brighton called on the Thatcher Government to ban the book; and it was reported that Britain's Attorney General had been asked to begin criminal proceedings against Rushdie under the archaic blasphemy laws. Rushdie received several phone threats. When, on the night of Oct. 25, he attended the awards dinner for Britain's most prestigious literary prize, the Booker -''The Satanic Verses,'' with its many good reviews, was among the six novels nominated, but did not win - he was accompanied by a bodyguard.
In the months that followed, the controversy would not abate. Two weeks ago, in the city of Bradford in northern England, 1,500 Muslims held a demonstration at which they burned copies of the novel. W.H. Smith, Britain's biggest bookseller (it has 430 shops), withdrew the book from display in its two Bradford outlets - this at a time when it remained high on the best-seller lists. Officials at Viking, which is believed to have paid an advance of about $800,000 for world hardbound and paperback rights to the book - a huge sum for a literary work - is bracing for similar protests here next month, when Rushdie arrives in the United States to give public readings from the book. Already, in New York, Viking has received protest letters and calls from thousands of American Muslims, and there have also been a number of bomb scares, which are being investigated by the F.B.I., at the company's offices.
I had suggested to Rushdie, when I'd talked with him on the phone, that it might not be such a safe thing for him to walk around Brick Lane.
''You cannot let something like this take over your life, or you have lost,'' he said. He sounded frustrated, beleaguered.
Was he sure?
''They're not going to know my face from the book jacket. They're not allowed to buy the book.''
I took a taxi to Rushdie's home in a northern borough of London, and he greeted me at the door, smiling and shaking his head. ''So strange, all this, isn't it,'' he said. Rushdie's face was dominated last fall by a black, gray-flecked and somewhat pointy beard, which he has since shaved off - and a number of cartoonists in the English papers had been inspired by it, working him up for the review columns as Satan. But it didn't convince; his eyes, heavy-lidded behind thick glasses, are too soft. There is no hardness, either, to the way he holds himself and speaks. You see in his small gestures and phrasings a hint of formality once adhered to, but this has given way to gentlemanly casualness. The tautness, the sharp edges, are kept within somewhere, to emerge only in the writing.
We drove down to Brick Lane in Rushdie's Saab, and parked along a small, charmless side street of small factories and tenements. It was a cold, damp morning, the sky the color of fine ash, and the only ones on the block were three young men unloading heavy rolls of cloth from the back of a truck. Rushdie explained that this was still London's garment district. The garment business had once been owned by English Jews who employed other English Jews, but now it was dominated by the Bengalis. ''That is the mosque down on the corner,'' pointing down the block to what looked to me to be simply a large meeting hall. ''It used to be a synagogue.''
We walked down the block, and turned onto Brick Lane, the narrow shopping street from which the neighborhood derives its name. There was a Muslim butcher shop, and the Aladdin Sweet Center, and signs in Arabic script above all the storefronts, and in the air the smell of curry. ''The thing you have to understand about a neighborhood like this,'' Rushdie said now, ''is that when people board an Air India jet and come halfway across the planet, they don't just bring their suitcases. They bring everything. And even as they reinvent themselves in the new city - which is what they do - there remain these old selves, old traditions erased in part but not fully. So what you get are these fragmented, multifaceted, multicultural selves.
''And this can lead to such strange things,'' he continued. ''You will find teen-age girls in this neighborhood who in so many ways are London kids: Levi 501's, Madonna T-shirts, spiky hair. They never think at all of going back to India or Pakistan, even for a visit. They might actually have been born here in London. And yet you may find among them a willingness, an eagerness in some cases, to have an arranged marriage. An arranged marriage.
''Or this story: In this very neighborhood, it was early in the 1980's. A Pakistani father stabbed and murdered his daughter, his only child, because he heard she had made love to a white boy. Which turned out not to be true, but that is not my point: My point is that he had brought with him this idea of honor and shame. And when I wrote about this later, I said that although I was obviously appalled - I mean, what can be more awful than murdering your own child? - I understood what had motivated him. I am a first-generation immigrant from that part of the world. I know how you can be here, and, in a way, still there.''
The setting for ''Midnight's Children'' is Rushdie's boyhood Bombay, that for ''Shame'' a country he describes as ''not quite Pakistan'' - he had written here but about there. ''The Satanic Verses'' is his first novel to deal with London, with the city that has been his home for 20 years. I asked him why it had taken him so long to write about it.
''I think I just had to do a lot of things first,'' he said. ''I had to make my reckonings with those other parts of the world I had come from. Before I had the platform from which to approach this country.''
As we walked down the street, he pointed out a video shop that rents tapes of Bombay-produced Hindi films, hundreds of different ones.
''Watching these films is entertainment of course,'' he said, ''but this also nourishes, yes? And in a way, when I go back - inside me, when I've written, if you understand -this going back to the East nourishes me. More than anything else, I would say.''
Later, as we got back into his car, I asked him if he thought those who wanted his book banned - if he thought they too were, inside themselves, ''going back,'' seeking some kind of nourishment in their religion, their orthodoxy.
''If you are asking me if I understand them, well yes, I understand them. But in a way they are not 'going back' to something. Their extremism is actually something fairly new. I have written about Islamic culture in the novel - Islamic culture set against the background of the West. Basically, Islamic culture is the one in which I grew up - I know it well. Its narratives are my narratives.''
''But their Islamic culture is something new and dangerous. You have a situation where a handful of extremists are defining Islam. And what makes it even sadder for me is that they are simply feeding the Western stereotype: the backward, cruel, rigid Muslim, burning books and threatening to kill the blasphemer.''
THE FOLLOWING morning, I walked up to the London Central Mosque in St. John's Wood -the city's largest mosque and, I was told, the organizational base for the protest against ''The Satanic Verses.''
The mosque is huge, with a glittering golden dome I could glimpse, despite the day's thick fog, as I walked toward it through Regent's Park. I wanted to see Dr. Ali Mugram al-Ghamdi, director general of the Islamic Cultural Center, which has its offices at the mosque. Dr. al-Ghamdi was leading the fight against ''The Satanic Verses'' in London - he had been quoted as calling the novel ''the most offensive, filthy and abusive book ever written by any hostile enemy of Islam.'' I had tried to phone him, and could not get through, and so I'd decided to simply present myself.
It was a Friday, prayer day, not the best day to talk, his secretary explained, but yes, Dr. al-Ghamdi would see me. He emerged from his office minutes later. He was a short and round man, elegantly dressed in a pin-stripe suit and fine silk tie. He extended his hand in greeting, invited me in, and pushed closely together two chairs, where we sat.
I explained how I had spoken the day before with Rushdie about his novel, its spiritual themes. After our walk in Brick Lane, we had gone to a pub, and at one point, as we talked, he had said, ''I obviously did not set out to write a novel about Islam - and it is not a novel about Islam. The novel does deal with spiritual life, very much so - that's one aspect of the book. There is a hole inside me where God used to be - I am no longer an observant Muslim - and I wanted to explore this hole. And of course that's what novels do, isn't it? Explore.''
And now, sitting with Dr. al-Ghamdi, I asked if he could understand the book in this way - as an inquiry.
''The book is really very, very offensive,'' he said gently, with no bitterness. ''I cannot overstate this. And I cannot expect you - you who are not a Muslim - to feel this.'' Then, addressing my question more directly: ''This was something that the author deliberately did. This was not just a slip of the pen.''
We discussed the parts of ''The Satanic Verses'' that have caused most offense to fundamentalist Muslims. Gibreel Farishta, who back in Bombay had starred in popular religious films, suffers a breakdown, and we are made privy to his mad dreams, dreams in which he supposes himself to be the Archangel Gabriel. For many Muslims, the Koran is held to be the ''uncreated'' Word of God, dictated by the Archangel Gabriel through the Prophet Mohammed, and written down, perfect and unaltered, by the Prophet's scribes.
In the dreams of Rushdie's Gibreel, a certain Salman the Persian, in the employ of the Prophet Mahound, makes a deliberate mistake in his transcription - he wants to see just how divine the Prophet is - and when the Prophet reads over the text, the mistake goes unnoticed.
Rushdie also ''redreams'' (his word) the famous episode in Islam of the ''Satanic verses,'' from which the novel takes its title. Historians of Islam explain it this way: Mohammed was under pressure from the citizens of Mecca to moderate his staunch monotheism, to accommodate his new faith to the city's traditional polytheism, to make room in Islam for three local goddesses. He did; he had his scribes write down verses praising al-Lat, al-Uzza and Manat as the ''swans exalted, whose intercession is hoped for.'' But he soon revoked these verses. He'd had a true revelation from the Archangel Gabriel, who told him they had been dictated by Satan.
Mahound, too, is visited by Satan and tempted to do more than utter compromised verse to scribes. Mahound likes to eat what he forbids others to - ''those fabled and legendary unclean creatures, what's their name, prawns.'' He also likes the whores. Where, in the Koran, Mohammed has many wives, revered as the Mothers of the Believers, the fictional Mahound has a brothel.
I said to Dr. al-Ghamdi that even though Christian fundamentalists might object to the use of Christian allegory and symbol in a novel like ''The Scarlet Letter,'' or to historical depictions of Christ in movies like ''The Last Temptation of Christ,'' they have come to see that in Western society, there is no way to enforce religious orthodoxy. Anyway, I said, most Western readers would understand Mahound as a religious hypocrite, a satiric creation, nothing more, nothing historical.
Dr. al-Ghamdi looked now to be practicing patience. ''For us,'' he said, ''this is not a matter of long ago. The Prophet Mohammed and his family are alive for us. They are here, with us, and we love them so much. I am prepared - and not only me - I am prepared to die one thousand deaths to assure that Mohammed and his family are not hurt. Such anguish this book has caused.''
I asked him what the solution was.
He wanted the book banned, he said. He would like Viking to act on its own, to withdraw the book from the stores.
I told him that Viking had issued statements saying it had not meant to offend anyone, that it regretted any distress the book may cause, but that it believed in Rushdie, his novel - and especially in freedom of expression. I said that freedom of expression was a very important Western concept.
''Islam has never been accepted here all through history,'' Dr. al-Ghamdi said. ''Here, you can just trample on people's feelings. You call that freedom of expression? And then you are shocked when emotions run high.''
I asked him about the threats made on Rushdie's life. What did he feel about these threats? Wasn't he, whether he realized it or not, inciting people with his talk?
His face tensed. ''We are trying to project a mature community here,'' he said. ''I am doing my best to keep the community in check.''
He got up from his chair, walked over to his desk, and lifted from it a manila folder thick with papers. ''These letters,'' he said, ''you should see what people say.'' I asked if I could read them. ''They are in Arabic,'' he said. ''You do not read Arabic.'' He picked one up himself, then another, then another. And now he giggled a little. What did it say? ''This is not for you,'' he said. Our meeting was over.
THAT EVENING, I was invited to a dinner party at Rushdie's home. It was to be a New England-style Thanksgiving feast, planned and cooked by Rushdie's wife, the American writer Marianne Wiggins. (Rushdie's first marriage ended in divorce several years ago. He has a 9-year-old son by the marriage, Zafar.) Their house is a four-story row house on what had not long ago been a working-class block, and Rushdie's studio is on the top floor; there, each morning at an electric typewriter, he tries to write 700 good words. He had yet to begin a new novel, that would take time, much thinking. He would travel first, write essays. Rushdie is a writer in the very English way of Orwell - he takes stands. He has written a slim, sympathetic book about Sandinista Nicaragua, and he has frequently spoken out - in the British papers, on television -on what he sees as Britain's two great problems: ''institutionalized'' racism (in employment practices and housing), and the domestic policies of the Thatcher Government.
Rushdie's politics do not sit well with many in English literary circles, and especially, it would seem, with the press. He is described as arrogant, self-righteous. Challenging Rushdie's thinking about racism in England, and his sincerity as well - and perhaps revealing the very tension he is seeking to deny - a reporter in The Sunday Times of London Magazine recently wrote: ''Certainly he is assimilated to the extent of being one of the 20 just persons summoned to the [ Harold ] Pinter dinner table in Campden Hill Square to discuss opposition to Thatcherism.''
In the front room on the parlor floor as I entered Rushdie's house that night, I saw two large tables: There were to be many guests. A number of them were already downstairs, clustered in the kitchen and in Wiggins's study: the critic Michael Ignatieff; the American writer Michael Herr, author of the Vietnam book ''Dispatches''; the poet Tess Gallagher, in town for a memorial held in honor of her husband, Raymond Carver. A literary crowd; Rushdie has many friends in literary circles, too. And Rushdie was in good spirits, truly at home (as most writers are) among writers he likes.
Upstairs later, watching Rushdie propose a toast above the all-American turkey and stuffing and sweet potatoes, I recalled a passage from ''The Satanic Verses'': An Indian boy, at boarding school in England only a few days, comes down to breakfast to find a kipper on his plate. He has no idea how to eat it, and his fellow students have no intention of telling him.
'' [ H ] e cut into it, and got a mouthful of tiny bones. And after extracting them all, another mouthful, more bones. It took him ninety minutes to eat the fish.'' Chewing, he has this revelation: ''England was a peculiar tasting smoked fish full of spikes and bones, and nobody would ever tell him how to eat it.'' He discovers he is tough and vengeful. ''I'll show them all,'' he swears. ''See if I don't.''
After dinner, I asked Rushdie about the kipper: It seemed too painful, too sadly funny, to be anything but autobiographical. ''Yes, I'm afraid it's only slightly embellished,'' he said. ''And I've never eaten another one.''
He'd been sent from India to Rugby at age 13. His family was Bombay upper-middle-class; his grandfather had made the family money and his father, who died two years ago, had, in Rushdie's words, ''spent the rest of his life losing it.'' Salman, the only son (he has three sisters), had attended the British-style Cathedral School in Bombay before being sent abroad.
''I was miserable at Rugby,'' he told me a couple of days later when we sat and talked again at his home. ''I think I had actually wanted to go - I was groomed for it. Very conventional. Bookish - I was the kind of boy who got books for presents. No good at games.
''But at Rugby I was suddenly an Indian. There are no Indians in India. There are classes, of course, and regional identifications. Here in England, however, it is largely understood as a race - and at the school-boy level, back then, that was no fun.'' The boys at Rugby not only watched Rushdie struggle with his kipper, but scrawled racist graffiti. He has told friends of his that he never really made a friend there.
His father had attended King's College, Cambridge, and he expected his son to follow when he was graduated from Rugby. Rushdie refused, then pleaded, then enrolled for classes in the fall of 1964. He knew he wanted to be a writer, he told me - his hero, he said, was the acclaimed Urdu poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz. However, he chose to study not literature but history. (Most of the references to Islamic history in ''The Satanic Verses'' are drawn from one of his college papers.) Rushdie liked Cambridge. It was the 1960's: ''Everyone was rethinking things,'' he said. ''I was too.'' He became interested in the theater, got parts and worked backstage as well in a number of college productions.
In the spring of 1968, he graduated from Cambridge, and returned home - not to Bombay, but to Karachi. His parents had moved there several years before. ''I was so angry they had moved to Pakistan,'' he said. ''But in truth when I'd left England, I'd only purchased a one-way ticket.''
His stay in Pakistan turned out to be short, sour. Not long after arriving, he began putting together a production of Edward Albee's ''Zoo Story'' for the country's new government-operated television station.
''Well,'' he said. ''it turned out one of the lines in the play includes the word 'pork.' A character is regularly attacked by his landlady's dog, and to keep the dog away he goes and buys these hamburgers, which he tosses to it. It doesn't work: The dog doesn't go for the hamburgers. And the character has to say something to the effect that he can't understand why the dog doesn't like the hamburgers. After all, there isn't enough pork in them to make them disgusting.
''O.K. The play is censored. One can't say the word 'pork' on TV in Pakistan. So I appeal. I say, What more could you ask for? Here is a play in which an actor points up how disgusting pork is. I mean, this is very sophisticated antipork propaganda if you consider it. But no one saw it that way. Pork was simply a four-letter word.''
An article he wrote for a small magazine on his first impressions of Pakistan was also censored. Before the end of the year, he was back in England. He would return East in the future only to visit.
It was in 1970, after having worked for a time in experimental theater, when Rushdie turned his energies to writing fiction. ''I'd always imagined myself telling stories, and now I imagined I had stories to tell,'' he said.
Beginning at that time as well, and then for 10 years, he worked to support himself as an advertising copywriter, first at Ogilvy and Mather, then at Charles Barker. Nights, weekends he devoted to his novels. Drafts came slowly (and still do; it took Rushdie five years to complete ''The Satanic Verses''). He abandoned one novel, about a Muslim holy man. Late in 1973, having taken time off from his advertising job, he completed what would be his first published novel, ''Grimus'' - a dystopian allegory set on an imaginary island, a novel quite remote from the kind of writing he would do later. (The book was poorly received.) However, the language, aural and eclectic, hints at things to come, as does this line from the book: ''It is the natural condition of the exile, putting down roots in memory.''
This process of using one's own stories and experiences began for Rushdie with ''Midnight's Children,'' which he completed in 1979. He had traveled to Bombay shortly after finishing ''Grimus,'' and the trip had been important to him. He decided at that time not only to write an autobiographical novel, but to write one that would encompass the biggest of India's cities, its people and history.
''I think I saw the Bombay I had grown up in slipping away,'' he told me, ''and that made me get on with the writing. I felt I had to reclaim the city - and also my own memories of it. I wanted to tell India's story, or stories, as well as my own.'' ''Floating in the amniotic fluid of the past,'' as he writes in ''Midnight's Children,'' Rushdie not only found his own story, and that of the nation of India; he found a way of telling. He mixed the fabulous and the historic, he made room for anecdotes, tales, essayistic asides, political commentary, digressions, retracings, sidetracks - the draft of the novel ran to 900 pages.
''Midnight's Children'' was a huge critical success. It won the 1981 Booker Prize, and along with the prestige came a check for $10,000. Rushdie was 34, but in a photo I have seen of him holding up the check, he could be a struggling graduate student, save for the grin that conveys: I guess I showed you.
ON MY LAST DAY IN London, I visited Rushdie again, and we talked more about his novel. But talk kept spilling beyond strictly literary matters. The Islamic fundamentalists came up again. ''I am most afraid that they will succeed in reducing the novel in people's minds to a pamphlet,'' he said.
Two weeks ago, after the Bradford book burning, I spoke with Rushdie on the phone, and he said: ''When they burned my book, in a way as if it were a pamphlet, I think they went too far. It is such a charged image. It got people concerned about me, sympathetic toward me, who had been content to sit on the sidelines. There were Labor Party M.P.'s - Asians representing Bradford - who attended that book burning; that's a horrible thought for many people. They get to thinking, 'If it's him today, it's me tomorrow.' ''
It struck me, his use of ''him,'' ''me,'' ''they.'' I remembered what he had told me just before I left his house that day in London:
''In writing 'The Satanic Verses,' I think I was writing for the first time from the whole of myself. The English part, the Indian part. The part of me that loves London, and the part that longs for Bombay. And at my typewriter, alone, I could indulge this.
''But most of the time, people will ask me - will ask anyone like me - are you Indian? Pakistani? English?
''What is being expresssed is a discomfort with a plural identity. And what I am saying to you - and saying in the novel - is that we have got to come to terms with this. We are increasingly becoming a world of migrants, made up of bits and fragments from here, there. We are here. And we have never really left anywhere we have been.'' THE TROPICAL ISLE
Gibreel Farishta floating on his cloud formed the opinion that the moral fuzziness of the English was meteorologically induced. 'When the day is not warmer than the night,' he reasoned, 'when the light is not brighter than the dark, when the land is not drier than the sea, then clearly a people will lose the power to make distinctions, and commence to see everything -from political parties to sexual partners to religious beliefs - as much-the-same, nothing-to-chose, give-or-take. What folly! For truth is extreme, it is so and not thus, it is him and not her; a partisan matter, not a spectator sport. It is, in brief, heated. City,' he cried, and his voice rolled over the metropolis like thunder, 'I am going to tropicalize you.'
Gibreel enumerated the benefits of the proposed metamorphosis of London into a tropical city: increased moral definition, institution of a national siesta, development of vivid and expansive patterns of behaviour among the populace, higher-quality popular music, new birds in the trees (macaws, peacocks, cockatoos), new trees under the birds (coco-palms, tamarind, banyans with hanging beards). Improved street-life, outrageously coloured flowers (magenta, vermilion, neon-green), spider-monkeys in the oaks. A new mass market for domestic air-conditioning units, ceiling fans, anti-mosquito coils and sprays. A coir and copra industry. Increased appeal of London as a centre for conferences, etc.; better cricketers; higher emphasis on ball-control among professional footballers, the traditional and soulless English commitment to 'high workrate' having been rendered obsolete by the heat. Religious fervour, political ferment, renewal of interest in the intelligentsia. No more British reserve; hot-water bottles to be banished forever, replaced in the foetid nights by the making of slow and odorous love. Emergence of new social values: friends to commence dropping in on one another without making appointments, closure of old folks' homes, emphasis on the extended family. Spicier food; the use of water as well as paper in English toilets; the joy of running fully dressed through the first rains of the monsoon.
Disadvantages: cholera, typhoid, legionnaires' disease, cockroaches, dust, noise, a culture of excess.
Standing upon the horizon, spreading his arms to fill the sky, Gibreel cried: 'Let it be.' (From ''The Satanic Verses'' by Salman Rushdie. Copyright (c) 1989 by Salman Rushdie. Used by arrangement with Viking Penguin Inc.)"
274,"Micro-loans to the World's Poorest
1988-02-21T05:00:00.000Z
WITH the help of 5 of her 12 children and a son-in-law, Maria Alfonsa Lopez braids rope in La Colonia Independencia, one of the western hill barrios of Tegucigalpa, Honduras. It is an occupation her family has pursued for generations.
Thanks to four loans totaling $400 from a three-year-old community group called Asepade, a Spanish acronym for investment adviser, she has broken the grip of the local moneylender. He had been charging her 10 percent a day to finance her stock of rope, which she twists into clotheslines, hammocks and lassos.
''The loans have helped me quite a lot, and I am now able to earn a profit,'' she said in a recent telephone conversation from Tegucigalpa.
She has used the profits to expand her business and to install a cement floor in the shack where she lives with her family in the dusty satellite community.
Mrs. Lopez is one of 2,500 individuals in the Tegucigalpa area who have received entrepreneurial loans from Asepade over the past three years.
Throughout the third world, from Bangladesh and Senegal to Tegucigalpa, such loans, from a variety of donors, have helped several million small entrepreneurs - those who sell flowers, mangoes and papayas, braid rope, sew dresses, catch fish and perform other small-scale activities that are at the core of developing economies.
The practice of microenterprise lending began in the early 1980's and grew slowly, but from the experience to date, most experts agree that it works.
Not only is there an excellent repayment record, but also a ''trickle up'' effect on the local economy. Profits from Mrs. Lopez's rope making, for example, meant an extra order for the local cement mixer who made her new floor. Prospering entrepreneurs may also hire additional help.
''IT generates a flow of money,'' said Wayne G. Broehl, professor of administration at the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth. ''And as you heighten the money economy, then you make new opportunities for other people, providing a real multiplier effect.''
A shortage of working capital is generally perceived as one of the biggest obstacles to third world development. ''The capitalist model depends on resources flowing easily to the opportunities,'' said Howard H. Stevenson, enterprise professor at the Harvard Business School. In developing countries, he added, ''what strikes me is how tightly controlled the resources are. It is impossible to pursue the opportunities.'' Microenterprise lending can break the logjam.
The local enterprises are not big enough to qualify for bank loans. To buy additional raw materials or a wider net to catch more fish, people who need cash must generally turn to local loan sharks who charge up to 20 percent a day in interest.
The ''trickle up'' programs, by contrast, usually charge interest rates of 2 to 4 percent a month, amounts comparable to commercial bank rates in the particular countries.
''Once there is a source of credit at commercial rates, costs drop, income rises and there is more money for tortillas or rope,'' said Stephen H. Gross, associate director for Latin American operations of Accion International, a nonprofit development organization. ''Suddenly you are increasing buying power of a large number of people and recyling money into the economy.''
Accion, which provides funds for Asepade, the community group that helped Mrs. Lopez, is among a score of organizations that are behind the entrepreneurial movement.
Their seed money comes from private and public benefactors, including multinational corporations, foundations, the Agency for International Development of the State Department, and multinational agencies such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the United Nations Development Program.
A few third world banks, like the Commercial and Savings Bank of Somalia and the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, practice micro-lending and make it profitable by keeping transaction costs low.
Boston-based Accion, an acronym for Americans for Community Cooperation in Other Nations, is financed by such organizations as the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Exxon, I.B.M. and the Agency for International Development.
Started during the Kennedy Administration, Accion also sends volunteers to work in Latin American slums.
ANALYZING its experience in 13 Latin American countries, Accion discovered that a loan of $30 can double a small merchant's family income in six months, according to William W. Burrus, the executive director. The group also found that every $1,100 lent to small enterprises generates one additional job.
The concept of helping cash-short entrepreneurs with small-scale loans appears to have originated in Bangladesh with an economics professor named Muhammad Yunus, who studied at Vanderbilt University and returned to teach at the University of Chittagong.
He founded the Grameen Bank in 1979 after arguing with conventional bankers that the 50 percent of Bangladeshis who are landless and the 80 percent who are illiterate could still be good credit risks.
Today the bank, which is 75 percent-owned by its borrowers (who must be savers and, eventually, buy shares in the bank), with the remainder owned by the government, operates 330 branches serving 6,000 Bangladesh villages, and is handling 215,000 loans, more than half of them to women.
This and other small credit programs evolved in response to growing frustration with large-scale assistance projects.
According to early economic development theories, the benefits of big investments in power plants, hydroelectric stations, irrigation works and highways were expected to ''trickle down'' through an economy and lift the living standards of the poor.
But after decades of commitments of many billions of dollars living standards have actually fallen in some countries. (This year alone the World Bank, the biggest of the multilateral lenders, will channel nearly $20 billion to about 80 countries.) Influenced by the spread of ''trickle up'' entrepreneurialism, development policy is increasingly shifting to programs that have a direct impact on peoples' lives, grass-roots projects that fill basic needs for food, shelter, education and health services.
''The big infrastructure projects are still needed to improve overall economic performance,'' said John W. Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, a research organization specializing in third world issues. ''But these entrepreneurial programs - which really do demonstrate the magic of the marketplace - clearly deserve to be supported.''
The ''trickle up'' approach has also won strong backing in Congress, which late last year passed legislation instructing the Agency for International Development to direct $50 million in the current fiscal year and $75 million next year to finance third world small-credit programs.
''It represents a dramatic new direction in foreign assistance,'' said Representative Edward F. Feighan, Democrat of Ohio, who introduced the legislation in the House along with Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, Republican of New York.
Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, one of 50 Senate sponsors, said that among other things he believes the small loans will counter the narcotics trade.
He said that in Bolivia cocaine depends on a cheap supply of migrant laborers to harvest coca leaves. Out of economic necessity, thousands of Bolivian workers migrate to the coca-producing lowlands to earn income from this harvest.
He cited studies by the Foundation for International Community Assistance (Finca) - an organization similar to Accion - showing that a $50 loan provides enough working capital to encourage such alternatives as making cloth or marketing vegetables.
All of the operators of the small loan programs report a high repayment rate. Mr. Gross of Accion says that fewer than 1 percent of the borrowers default. The Grameen Bank of Bangladesh reports a repayment rate of better than 97 percent. So does Finca, an acronym for farm in Spanish, which operates a network of 600 banks with 32,000 borrowers in Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, Costa Rica and El Salvador.
''The poor are bankable,'' said Idriss Jazairy, president of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, which provided $3.4 million to the Grameen Bank for its seminal village lending program in 1980.
Most such programs are based on a solidarity principle. Although loans are made to individual entrepreneurs, each individual is in a group of four or five others who are in line for similar credits. Together they act as co-guarantors. If one individual is unable to make timely payments, credit for the entire group is jeopardized, which results in heavy peer-group pressure on the delinquent.
In the Grameen model an individual joins a group of five borrowers who meet weekly with an officer of the bank trained in small-scale financial activities. He provides management advice. All repayments take place at the group meetings.
At first only two members of the group are allowed to apply for a loan. Depending on their repayments, the next two borrowers can apply, and then the fifth.
Grameen entrepreneurs have used their money for the purchase of cows, cycle repairing, weaving, pottery and even perfume making.
''We are not doing any favors. We are in business,'' Mr. Yunus said in an interview with a New York Times correspondent in Bangladesh.
According to Mr. Yunus and other experts, the small-credit activity offers exciting possibilities.
''You could enter into a huge market of banking specifically oriented to profit-making loans to the poor,'' said Jeffrey Ashe, a Boston economic consultant. He envisions whole networks of small-loan shops. ''I'd love to see franchisable McDonald's or Burger King-type money stores accessing this particular market,'' he said.
But high transaction costs are a formidable barrier to financial institutions in developed countries.
''IT'S very far afield for most commercial bankers,'' said Mary Houghton, president of the South Shore Bank of Chicago, which runs such programs in the United States through a nonprofit unit of the bank. For the past 15 years, South Shore's owners have wanted the bank to turn a profit, but also play a role in urban neighborhood redevelopment.
In the third world, however, village banking benefits from economies of scale. Since many of the loans are similar, a single bank representative may monitor the progress of thousands of loans weekly.
In countries with high unemployment rates, the job-making potential of microenterprise lending is particularly appealing to policy makers.
Ramon Uceta makes furniture in the Dominican Republic's capital of Santo Domingo. He borrowed $67 initially from the local Accion affiliate, and now 33 months and 13 progressively larger loans later, he employs 14 workers and lives in a new development in a house with running water and electricity.
Before he entered the program he was paying 20 percent a month to loan sharks. Now his interest rates are down to 1 1/2 percent a month.
In Cali, the third-largest city of Colombia, loans of about $50 enabled a group of women to start a business. They first bought sewing machines, then banded together to make baby clothes now sold in Colombian shops.
Although there is a growing body of encouraging experience with small loans, many experts caution against excessively high expectations, noting that there is no single, simple answer to the problem of raising living standards around the world.
''How do you cause small-scale enterprise to spread rapidly enough to make a difference?'' asked Robert L. Payton, scholar in residence in philanthropic studies at the University of Virginia and a former ambassador to Cameroon in West Africa.

The first phase of Biswa Ijtema, the world's second largest Muslim congregation after Hajj, will end today through the Akheri Munajat [final prayer]. Maulana Zubair Hassan, the imam of Kakrail Mosque in the capital and leader of a faction of Tabligh Jamaat, will administer the Munajat seeking blessings and well-being for mankind. Thousands of devotees from home and abroad will take part in the prayer. Tabligh Jamaat, a coalition of Muslim devotees, has been organising the event on the bank of Turag river, near Tongi upazila of Gazipur, every year since 1967. The first phase of the Ijtema is mainly allocated for the followers of Maulana Zubair.  The second phase will be held from January 17 to 19. This phase is allocated for the followers of Indian preacher Maulana Saad Kandhalvi. FIVE MORE DIED IN IJTEMA Meanwhile, five more devotees died at the Ijtema venue yesterday, mostly due to heart attack and old-age complications. With them, a total of nine people died so far since Friday. The dead are Ali Azgar, 70, from Barisal; Md Yusuf, 45, from Narayanganj; Md Shahjahan, 60, from Brahmanbaria; Tamij Uddin, 65, from Cumilla; and Abdur Razzak, 50, from Rajshahi. Manjur Rahman, deputy commissioner of Gazipur Metropolitan Police, said the bodies were handed over to the families after their namaz-e-janaza at the Ijtema ground. To ensure security of the event, law enforcement agencies have taken up a multi-layered security measures. Members of police, Rab and intelligence agencies have been deployed in the adjacent areas. Over 400 closed-circuit television cameras, 25 watch towers and 11 checkpoints have been set up to monitor the area, police said."

The fine ash drifting into the school gym on gusts of wind is a constant reminder for evacuees in the Philippines of the volcano that threatens to bury their homes forever. As they sit in the spaces fenced in by the few bags and boxes of belongings they could carry, evacuees wonder how long they will have to wait to know whether Taal volcano will devastate the region or sputter back to sleep. ""It's all in God's hands now. We are not sure if we will have a home to return to,"" said Leonita Gonzales, 52, who fled with the rest of her household from the danger zone around Taal. Her banana palms were destroyed by the ash that fell after the volcano started to gush smoke on Sunday. She is uncertain whether her home's tin roof will be able to bear the weight either. Nearly 44,000 people have fled the 14km (nine mile) danger zone around Taal, where volcanologists have warned a devastating eruption could rain rocks and magma and set off a tsunami from the lake in which the volcano sits. On Tuesday, more than 1,100 evacuees packed into the gym and classrooms at the state university at the Santo Tomas town, some 20 km (12 miles) northeast of where Taal continues to puff clouds of ash and steam through old and new fissures. Occasional tremors signalled the forces rumbling beneath the earth and set hearts pounding. ""Don't tell me you're brave. When disaster strikes, you will call on all saints, big or small,"" said Obet Dionglay, 61, who had trekked through roads deep with ash to seek refuge. Dionglay's hut had been crushed by bamboos bent to the ground by the weight of the ash and he had little hope that his three pigs and dozen chickens would survive. Dionglay recalled Taal's last eruption in 1977, when his hometown of Talisay had escaped largely unscathed. Although Taal is one of the world's smallest active volcanoes only 311 metres (1,020-foot) high, it can be deadly: an eruption killed more than 1,300 people in 1911. At the evacuation centre, a couple of dozen kids kept busy with an impromptu dance class. A delivery of water gave some people a chance to wash the grit from their bodies for the first time in days, but many complained of a lack of sleeping mats, blankets, toiletries and face masks despite generous private donations. ""For now, we endure, we live with nothing,"" said Ferdinand Paderan, 39, who evacuated with his wife and two children. But even as thousands more people were being evacuated from the danger zone, some defied official warnings to head back in to collect belongings or tend livestock that they could not bring out. ""I went home and checked it. It's a good thing no one stopped our tricycle on the way home. I fed the chickens and the dogs,"" said Leonel Gonzales, 32, a tourist guide at Taal Lake, who fled with his one-year-old daughter and pregnant wife. ""We will stay here to make sure we are all safe. We will check on the pets again when the volcano calms down."""
279,"Rushdie Is Still Planning to Visit U.S. Next Week

A death sentence by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and other protests have not altered the plans of the novelist Salman Rushdie to come to the United States next week to promote ''The Satanic Verses,'' his American literary agent said yesterday.
''As of now he will be here on schedule,'' said the agent, Andrew Wyley. ''I think some things will change, but his intention is to come to the United States to promote the book.'' The book has been on sale in American bookstores for several weeks.
Viking Penguin, which bought world rights to the novel, had scheduled an 11-city American tour for Mr. Rushdie, to include readings at four universities. That itinerary - scheduled to start next week, to coincide with the official American publication Feb. 22 - was largely completed before the book was banned in India last October.
A Viking publicist suggested yesterday that in view of the recent violent protests, Mr. Rushdie might tape interviews to be broadcast.
Both Mr. Rushdie and Viking issued statements yesterday denying that the book was intended to defame or insult.
In a statement issued in Britain, Mr. Rushdie said: ''The novel is not an attack on Islam or any other religion, but an attempt to challenge preconceptions and to examine the conflict between the secular and religious views of the world. Ironically, it is precisely this conflict which has now engulfed the book.''
He added that many Muslim writers and readers had expressed support for the book and strong disapproval of the campaign against it.
Mr. Wylie said that two writers' groups, PEN and the Authors Guild, ''voiced their strong support for him.''
After a meeting of Viking officials yesterday, the publisher released a statement deploring the violence and loss of life.
The book has now been banned in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and South Africa.
Noting the Khomeini threat and the violent protests over the book in Pakistan and India, the statement said: ''Neither we nor the author of this novel published this book with intent to offend. We very much regret the distress the book has caused.'' The statement added that publication of the novel ''rests upon the principle of freedom of expression, which is one of the cornerstones of all democracy.''
In December, Viking employees were forced to vacate their building on West 23d Street twice because of bomb scares over the book, but things appeared calm yesterday. The company has hired plainclothes security officers since those incidents, and they are posted at the front and rear entrances to the building. The Viking offices are on the fifth floor.
There were no demonstrators near the Viking office, and there were only a few phone calls all day protesting Viking's publishing ''The Satanic Verses.'' Asked if there has been any activity, a plainclothes security guard in the reception room replied, ''Not too much; it's been too quiet,'' emphasizing the word ''too.''"

Further east, Iran has the third highest case load after China and Italy, with nearly 13,000 confirmed cases, according to WHO data The World Health Organization will start testing for coronavirus in rebel-held northwest Syria later this week, the agency's regional head said on Monday, adding that he was ""very concerned"" about the spread of the pandemic to a region where the health system has been wrecked by a long civil war. Only about half of medical facilities in the wedge of rebel-held Syria are operational. Nearly a million people recently displaced by violence are living in make-shift housing or crowded camps. ""We are hoping ... to have the machinery and the tests sometime this week so we can start testing,"" said Dr Rick Brennan, emergency director for the region, told Reuters. ""And we are very concerned. All of the surrounding countries have documented cases."" Syria's government has started testing in areas in the rest of the country, although has not yet reported a case to the WHO. Turkey to the north confirmed its first case last week and Iraq has at least 93 confirmed cases. Further east, Iran has the third highest case load after China and Italy, with nearly 13,000 confirmed cases, according to WHO data. However, Brennan, who just returned from a mission to Iran last week, said that the number of cases reported could represent only about a fifth of the real numbers. The reason was that testing, as is the case even in some wealthy European countries, was restricted to severe cases. ""We've said the weakest link in their chain is the data,"" he said. ""They are rapidly increasing their ability to test and so the numbers will go up,"" he said. Iran's response to the pandemic has drawn strong criticism, both from government critics, and a UN official last week. However, Brennan was generally upbeat about Tehran's response. ""There's a great commitment and they are taking it seriously from the highest level of government."" Iranian authorities say they have been especially hard hit by global supply shortages for tests and protective equipment, blaming the impact of US sanctions. Brennan described visiting new centres with dozens of beds where everything from the bed sheets, to the oxygen masks had been made locally. However, he said that some of the locally-produced personal protective equipment was exposing medical workers to risks. He acknowledged that some health care workers had been infected, although the cause of infection was not clear. ""We are impressed that Iranians have acknowledged their weaknesses and are working on them,"" Brennan said. "

The crisis is so severe that the government has declared a nationwide emergency and urgently appealed for help from the international community Pakistan's farmers are struggling to combat the worst locust plague in nearly three decades as insect swarms decimate entire harvests in the country's agricultural heartlands and send food prices soaring. Heavy rains and cyclones sparked ""unprecedented"" breeding and the explosive growth of locust populations on the Arabian peninsula early last year, according to the United Nations. The insects have since fanned out and wreaked havoc on farms from East Africa to India before making their way into Pakistan from the desert on the country's southwestern border with Iran.  The crisis is so severe that the government has declared a nationwide emergency and urgently appealed for help from the international community.  Officials in southern Sindh province fear the infestation will devastate the supply of cotton, the local cash crop, ahead of its harvest in the coming months.  Local surveys of the damage are continuing, but the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture says nearly half of all crops have been destroyed near the port city of Karachi. ""I have not seen an infestation like this one in my career,"" said Shehbaz Akhtar, an agricultural official charged with locust eradication efforts in the village of Pipli Pahar in central Punjab province. 'Combat operation' Local authorities had ""launched a combat operation"" to clear the area of infestation with pesticide sprays, he said.  Clouds of the noxious gas envelop the nearby fields each morning, where villagers gather the husks of dead insects for an official bounty of Rs20 rupees per kg bag. ""We spray twice a day here,"" says Fayyaz Azeem, clad in a face mask and thick industrial gloves on top of a tractor discharging pesticide into rows of crops. But the process is slow and time-consuming, and by the time locusts are killed off in one field they have often already destroyed the next. The pesticides used by officials are also dangerous for consumption, so even when the locusts are dead the remaining crops have to be discarded. Some farmers have been forced to opt for more desperate solutions while waiting for their fields to be sprayed and have attempted to scare off the swarms by shouting and banging pots.  A team of Chinese experts has arrived in Pakistan to survey the crisis, food security ministry chief Muhammad Hashim Popalzai told AFP. Beijing could also offer aerial spraying - a much faster and more efficient method of pest control - and Pakistan may also import pesticides from China. Earlier reports circulating online suggested China was planning to send thousands of ducks to Pakistan to devour the scourge. Pakistani officials said no such plans were being considered. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has also set up meetings between India and Pakistan to prevent the swarms from spreading, Popalzai said. 'What can I do?' Agriculture accounts for 20% of Pakistan's GDP but the sector has already struggled for years in the face of drought and dwindling water supplies. The country is also experiencing 12-year inflation highs, with the cost of sugar nearly doubling and flour prices jumping 15% in the past year. Years without a locust attack meant the government ""had become complacent"" about the risks of a new infestation, said Pakistan Farmers Bureau president Zafar Hayyat. Though he applauded the steps being taken to fight the plague, Hayyat warned of the risk that swarms would return mid-year after the next locust breeding season.  For many farmers in Pipli Pahar, the extermination campaign has already come too late.  Sitting in the corner of a wheat field with her cow, Rafiya Bibi watches the flurry of pesticide spraying around her.  The locusts have already destroyed her crops of canola, sunflower, chili and tobacco, which she had bought after borrowing 45,000 rupees from the government. With no harvest, she has no way to repay the loan."

Teesta deal remains uncertain; Indian foreign secretary says NRC, CAA will have no impact on Bangladesh; Modi's Dhaka visit would fully exemplify India's strong sentiment of goodwill  Visiting Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla has said within 2020, New Delhi expects to finalize deals with Bangladesh regarding water sharing of seven common rivers, except the Teesta River. He said both the countries need to expedite harmonization the data of water flow of the rivers so that water sharing can be finalized as early as possible. Shringla made the statement while addressing a seminar on Bangladesh-India relations as the keynote speaker at a Dhaka hotel on Monday, reports BSS. Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) and Indian High Commission in Dhaka jointly organized the seminar titled ""Bangladesh and India: A Promising Future."" The Indian foreign secretary, however, appeared to be uncertain about the deal on Teesta River saying an agreement on water sharing of this particular stream could only be finalized on the basis of consensus of all the stakeholders, an apparent reference to India's West Bengal state. Prime Minister's International Affairs Adviser Dr Gowher Rizvi attended the program as the chief guest. Shringla, who previously served as Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka, however, said the Indian side was working on concluding the process of the agreement as early as possible. ""We know this is an emotive issue on both side of the border but there is no diminution of the commitment of our government,"" he told the seminar. In August last, Bangladesh and Indian agreed on preparing a framework on interim water-sharing agreements on seven rivers -- Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla, Feni and Dudhkumar. Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Riva Ganguly Das and BIISS Chairman Fazlul Karim also spoke at the program, among others. The Indian foreign secretary said India and Bangladesh recognize there is ample room for progress on each of the rivers that both the neighbours share while serious dialogue has resumed between the officials responsible for water sharing matter since August 2019. ""Let me assure our friends here that we remain committed to finding the best possible solutions to sharing scarcities and hardships fairly during the dry season,"" he said. He said good arrangements to share waters of the 54 transboundary rivers in fair and environmentally sustainable manner lies in broader national interests of the two nations. India sees no NRC, CAA impact The visiting Indian secretary said the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will have no impact on Bangladesh, reports UNB. ""These are purely internal to India,"" Shringla said. ""Let me clearly state here what our leadership has repeatedly confirmed at the highest level to the government of Bangladesh: this is a process that is entirely internal to India. Therefore, there'll be no implications for the government and the people of Bangladesh. You've our assurance on that count,"" he explained. Modi's visit India's top foreign ministry bureaucrat said Narendra Modi's Dhaka visit later this month would fully exemplify ""India's strong sentiment of goodwill, trust and respect for Bangladesh"". Indian Prime Minister Modi has been specially invited to participate in the inaugural ceremony of Mujib Year later this month. ""We are looking forward to this visit ... because Bangabandhu is just so iconic - as a globally-recognized statesman and iconic symbol of liberation for Bangladesh and for our subcontinent,"" he said. In India, he said: ""There is a special resonance to his name. He is as revered and as remembered in India, as he is here in Bangladesh."" Rohingya issue The Indian foreign secretary said there is also often interest and sometimes ""uninformed speculation"" about their position on the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine State of Myanmar, and its impact upon Bangladesh. ""Let me clearly say that India is deeply appreciative of the spirit of humanism that motivated Bangladesh to offer shelter to nearly one million displaced people. And we fully recognize and sympathize with the enormous burden that you're facing. ""As the only country that's an actual neighbour of both Bangladesh and Myanmar, we're committed to offering the fullest support for any mutually-acceptable solution that'll enable the earliest possible return of displaced persons to their homes in Rakhine State and to a life of dignity,"" he said adding that this should be done in a manner that is ""safe, secure and sustainable"". Border killing Responding a question why border killings still took place after both border guards agreed to use non-lethal weapons the Indian foreign secretary attributed the incidents to cross-border criminal activities.  He claimed that the casualty figures of Indians was equal to that of Bangladeshis but acknowledged that the border killing issue was consistently coming up in Bangladesh-India relationship.

In an exclusive interview with Dhaka Tribune's Humayun Kabir Bhuiyan,  Danish Ambassador to Bangladesh Winnie Estrup Petersen discussed a wide range of bilateral issues with particular emphasis on cooperation to help enable green growth How do you describe the current bilateral relations between Bangladesh and Denmark? How could it be further enhanced? In one word, I would describe it as excellent. Our partnership has been growing over the years. Yes, I am proud that we have a good partnership. We cooperate with each other in a wide range of sectors, especially climate change and agriculture. The existing strategic cooperation between the labour ministries of the two countries is aimed at improving occupational, health and safety conditions for Bangladeshi workers through exchange of knowledge and experience. A number of Danish companies, businesses and NGOs are present in Bangladesh. Denmark also works closely with Bangladesh in several international forums. For instance, both countries are members of the Human Rights Council and look forward to opportunities to work together. Our relations are wide and deep and I am a proud Ambassador of Denmark in Bangladesh. With continued cooperation on the issues of mutual interest, the relationship will transform and only deepen as Denmark shifts its bilateral focus from aid to trade, which will result in increased emphasis on green growth and issue of sustainability in Bangladesh.  I reckon in every relation, there are areas for dialogues. As our bilateral ties are rooted in strong foundations any issues can be addressed through dialogue and consensus. What are the new areas of cooperation by which both countries can be benefited? I think we are looking to explore green growth in several sectors, especially the readymade garments industry. By green growth, I mean each company will manufacture its products organically, resulting in the use of less water and thus less pollution. To simply put it into words, Danish companies are coming to Bangladesh to offer green solutions for local manufacturers. Dhaka is a densely populated business hub of the country. Unprecedented fire hazards over the past several years have drawn quite a bit of attention. Hence, Danish firms are collaborating with Bangladeshi organizations to set up small fire fighting stations equipped with easy-to-use fire fighting devices. There is another option for efficient fire fighting we are considering --e.g., motorbikes equipped with fire fighting instruments, for quick responses to fire incidents. It is a flexible and good technology.  We are also looking forward to cooperating with Bangladesh with respect to wind energy.  Denmark has expertise in developing cities that are more liveable, green, energy efficient and adaptable to traffic regulations.  We are identifying Danish expertise, technologies and innovations that may benefit both countries. Are you satisfied with the current trade volume between Dhaka and Copenhagen? How can this be increased? I am pleased with the present-day trade volume between the two countries and yet more can be done. Trade between the two countries is clearly in favour of Bangladesh. We would like to see increased Danish trade with Bangladesh. Is Danish investment in Bangladesh satisfactory? What does Bangladesh need to do more to attract higher Danish investment? There are about 40 Danish companies engaged one way or another in Bangladesh, which is  rather an impressive figure from a small country like Denmark. Bangladesh is a good market with an impressive growth trend. The Bangladesh economy needs more foreign investment in strategic areas to continue its growth momentum in the coming years. There are opportunities to bring Danish investment and businesses to Bangladeshi market. However, Danish companies face steep challenges mostly related to predictability of policies and legislation. Danish companies work best in a rule-based business environment. Business climate has to be well-regulated. Danish companies are not accustomed to dealing with bureaucratic red tape and they have a zero tolerance to corruption. Do you think the international community is doing enough to solve the Rohingya crisis? What do you think the solution is to this protracted crisis? As long as the crisis is not resolved, we have not done enough. As things stalled in the United Nations Security Council, the international community, including Denmark, is exploring alternative routes, which include proceedings at the Human Rights Council, International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court.  Denmark, a big contributor in terms of providing humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya people in Cox's Bazar, is working with the Bangladesh government and other global partners to provide the necessary support in addressing current and emerging challenges centering on the crisis."

304,"A Far-Flung Corporate Empire
1989-07-12T05:00:00.000Z
B.A.T. Industries, the target of Sir James Goldsmith's $21 billion takeover bid, is one of the most far-flung international corporations, selling insurance in Australia and the United States, producing paper pulp in India and Portugal, and processing tobacco in Zimbabwe and Zaire. Its shares, which are traded in New York as well as London, are widely held by individuals and institutions that specialize in assembling global portfolios.
Although B.A.T. itself is not a household name in the United States, many of its subsidiaries and their products are. The company sells Kool and Barclay cigarettes, owns the Marshall Field's and Saks Fifth Avenue department store chains and offers insurance policies through the Farmers Group. It also produces NCR Paper and other carbonless paper products and has a 40 percent stake in Imasco, the Canadian consumer products company that owns the Hardee's fast-food chain and Peoples Drug Stores. Little Fat at Headquarters
Such diversity is what attracted the attention of Sir James and his partners, who describe the London-based company as a conglomerate whose parts are worth more than the whole. Analysts agree that the company has many highly independent operating units that could readily be sold to pay the debt Sir James would pile up in the proposed acquisition, but they also say that B.A.T. has a lean corporate structure from which little fat could be cut.
The company employs only 100 people at its London headquarters and another 100 at the Louisville, Ky., headquarters of Batus Inc., its holding company for United States subsidiaries. That might limit the profits to be gained in breaking up B.A.T.
''B.A.T.'s managers are excellent, and it is unlikely that Sir James could find anyone better,'' said Roy D. Burry, who follows the company for Kidder, Peabody & Company in New York.
Many analysts count the most likely casualty in any takeover, Patrick Sheehy, B.A.T.'s chairman, as one of the company's chief assets. A veteran of the British Army who fought his way up the corporate ladder through appointments in Nigeria, Ghana, Ethiopia and the Caribbean, Mr. Sheehy has a record that analysts say demonstrates both toughness and competence.
''He has got his hands on the helm, and we think he knows where he wants to go,'' said Paul Himmelheber, vice president of Himelheber Investment Research, a Philadelphia stock research firm. Highly Decentralized Structure
Under Mr. Sheehy, B.A.T. has evolved a highly decentralized structure, emphasizing four main business lines: tobacco, insurance, paper and retailing. Operations within these businesses are run independently enough that dismemberment could be relatively easy. ''It's not just the big four pieces,'' Mr. Burry said. ''There are pieces within the pieces you can break off.''
B.A.T. started out as the British-American Tobacco Company, which was created in 1902 by an agreement among international tobacco barons to divide the world market. James Buchanan Duke, founder of the American Trust Company, agreed with the Imperial Tobacco Company, which had a near monopoly in the British market, that each concern would sell tobacco products only in its home country. British-American Tobacco, with the Duke family as its majority shareholder, was created to sell cigarettes throughout Britain's colonies and protectorates.
Despite aggressive diversification efforts, the cigarette business still accounts for two-fifths of B.A.T.'s sales and nearly half its profits. B.A.T. owns the Louisville-based Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, the nation's third-largest tobacco company and the maker of such cigarette brands as Capri, Kool, Barclay, Viceroy and Raleigh. B.A.T. also has full or majority ownership of tobacco companies in 38 countries, ranging from Switzerland and the Netherlands to Nicaragua, Suriname and Bangladesh. A Shade Smaller Than Texaco
With $31 billion in sales and $1.7 billion in pretax profits last year, B.A.T. is only a shade smaller than Texaco Inc. or the Du Pont Company. Only nine American industrial concerns are larger.
The company's diversification campaign began in earnest during the 1970's, when B.A.T. began using the huge cash flow from its tobacco operations to buy retailing and paper-making companies. The results from these acquisitions were decidedly mixed, analysts say.
The subsidiaries that have given B.A.T. the most trouble have been retailers. It sold three of its department store chains - Kohl's, Crescent and Frederick & Nelson - in 1986. The company also failed in its efforts to rebuild Gimbels, which was dismantled in a series of asset sales. About 5,000 employees were thrown out of work by the moves. Shift to Insurance in 1982
Marshall Field's and Saks, which showed poor fashion judgment in the mid-1980's, were also disappointments. But with help from B.A.T. to invest in sprucing up their stores, both chains are now doing well, Mr. Burry said.
Mr. Sheehy shifted diversification targets after taking over in 1982, replacing retailers with insurance companies. B.A.T. paid $1.4 billion in January 1984 for Eagle Star Holdings P.L.C., a leading British company with strong sales of life insurance policies, after Eagle Star became the target of a hostile bid from Allianz Versicherungs A.G. Germany's largest insurer. Last December, Batus, which accounted for 30 percent of B.A.T.'s sales last year, completed a $5.2 billion hostile takeover of Farmers Group Inc., a Los Angeles-based company that is the third-largest home and auto insurer in the United States.
Both acquisitions have generally done well under B.A.T.'s management, analysts say, with B.A.T. successfully retaining the senior Farmers management that has made the company among the more profitable in the industry. Eagle Star has had poor results only in the United States. Loss on Eagle Star Unit
B.A.T. disposed of Eagle Star of America in late 1986 for $34.5 million, after pouring in nearly $39 million to shore up the subsidiary's inadequate reserves.
In testimony last year at California Insurance Department hearings into the Farmers acquisition, a senior B.A.T. official blamed bad management in the early 1980's for Eagle Star of America's poor performance.
The spectacle of B.A.T. as a takeover target provoked comments yesterday that the poacher of companies was in danger of being poached itself. But with the exception of a bitter eight-month battle last year to take control of Farmers Group, B.A.T. has pursued almost exclusively friendly takeover bids."

Instead of being termed as a punishment house, the jail seems more like a skill development centre with all kinds of skills being taught to the inmates It is a common perception that jails are punishment centres where criminals are tortured and beaten up to change their criminal activities and bring change in them. However, the Kushtia Jail presents a different picture. Instead of being termed as a punishment house, the jail seems more like a skill development centre with all kinds of skills being taught to the inmates. The jail authorities here focus on making the prisoners self-reliant and help them channel their time and energy towards positive contribution to the society.  Established in 1968, the Kushtia Jail has the capacity to house 600 inmates. However, the jail currently houses 950 inmates, including 40 females. The initiative - which was started on June, 2017, by the Superintendent of Jail Md Zaker Hossain - is solely funded by the jail and works as a self-sufficient project where each inmate teaches another, said officials from Kushtia jail. The prisoners are engaged in many skillful activities including fabrication unit, weaving, handicrafts, dressmaking, power-loom, electrical and music training. In the fabrication unit, inmates make various items like Sari (a local garment worn by Bangladeshi women), Lungi (A garment worn by local Bangladeshi men), and monochords (one chord musical instrument) which are sold at the sales centre of the jail. Similarly, prisoners at the weaving unit manufacture handloom items like blankets, bedsheets, pillow covers, towels, fabric pieces, and hand-crafted products. Moreover, the prisoners take music and Arabic lessons every morning lessons from the districts' most esteemed teachers. They get to pursue their inner passion, organize regular cultural programs and even perform in front of guests visiting the prison. Prison authorities say, they identify the illiterate inmates as soon as they arrive at the prison, make a list, assess and enlist them to different groups to make the learning experience better and coherent, in order to help them achieve their goals in line with their interests. At the same time, a library has been set up inside the jail. The initiative has been taken to give prisoners a chance to read books. However, there is a lot of work left to be done in the library due to lack of funds. Sohel Rana, a prisoner who is sentenced to life at Kushtia Jail, is said to have helped 900 illiterate inmates so far to learn the basics. From 2017 to till date, 3,288 people have been taught to sign their names by him. Nahid Hasan, Nasim, Channu Miah, Fazle Rabbi, Nur Mohammad, who served at the jail in different times, said they were trained in electronics and now, as free citizens they are working as professional electricians and earning good money to support their families. Nur Mohammad, a resident of Chourhash area of Kushtia municipality, said that he too, like his other inmates, he feels dignified and empowered after getting back to his normal life. He said: ""I am a professional electrician and earn Tk600 each day. It feels good to be self reliant."" Rubel Hossain of Sadar upazila said he is grateful to the jail authorities for his new life and said: ""I now work at a telecom shop and earn Tk10000 each month.  My life has changed."" Parul's husband, Ismail, serves at the prison, and she said that he was previously  illiterate but can now can read and write. When contacted, Superintendent of Jail Md Zaker Hossain said their focus is on making the jail a correctional centre, rather than punishing them for which they are already convicted. ""We are working day and night to make the prisoners self-reliant so that they can live their lives as responsible citizens after finishing their terms here."" ""The prisoners are getting half the amount of what their manufactured products are sold for and that can help them to re-initiate their learning when they get out,"" he added. Deputy Commissioner Md Aslam Hossain said: ""We are discussing with the concerned authorities to see if the prisoners can be helped  with loans that can help to kickstart their business after leaving the prison."""

313,"Trade Bill Has Special Favors For Companies
1988-04-11T05:00:00.000Z
Buried deep in the 1,000-page trade bill that Congress is trying to complete this week are provisions benefiting companies making everything from drugs and disposable diapers to cooking ware and frozen cranberries.
These special provisions have created a powerful constituency behind the bill, even as debate continues over other, more controversial aspects of the legislation.
Hard bargaining is expected this week between the White House and Congress, with President Reagan setting the stage by reiterating his veto threat in his radio address Saturday, asserting, ''I will veto a bad trade bill before I let a bad trade bill veto our economy.''
The greatest benefit, potentially worth more than $100 million, would go to the Warner-Lambert Company. A provision deftly inserted by its lobbyists would extend for three and a half years its patent on a cholesterol-reducing drug called Lopid.
The patent is due to expire in July 1989, at which time the company would face competition from generic producers, which, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration, would be free to sell a similar drug at lower prices.
Now prescribed only for people suffering from inflammation of the pancreas, Lopid is Warner-Lambert's third-largest-selling drug, and the company is seeking F.D.A. approval for its wider use. Lopid sales last year were $101 million, up 74 percent over the year before.
Hundreds of other companies would also benefit, chiefly from miscellaneous tariff reductions that have been tacked onto the legislation in the more than two years of its gestation. Among these are the Procter & Gamble Company, which would get cheaper sodium polyacrylate polymers, a moisture-absorbing chemical, for use in superabsorbent disposable diapers; Corning Glass Works, which would have duties suspended on its Visions cookware imported from plants abroad, and Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc., which would be able to import frozen cranberries from Canada duty-free. White House Objections
It would all come to naught, however, with a Presidential veto, assuming it is not overridden. The White House objects not to the special-interest sections of the bill, but to broader proposals affecting the economy at large.
The main targets are proposals to force companies to give at least 60 days' notice of impending plant closings, to require disclosure of sensitive foreign investment information and to limit Presidential flexibility in some trade decisions.
The President's advisers may urge that he sign the bill if these proposals are eliminated or modified, Administration officials said.
Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 3d and Clayton K. Yeutter, the United States trade representative, are expected to meet with the Democratic Congressional leadership early this week to try to lay the framework for compromise. Unresolved Issues
House and Senate negotiators came to a series of agreements on March 31, just before the Easter recess, but there are some unresolved issues -chiefly relating to investment and agriculture - likely to be taken up early this week.
Many provisions of this sweeping legislation, only the second trade bill this decade, would produce changes that would affect the nation's overall posture in trade and competitiveness.
But the impact would not be felt until well into a new Administration, when new cases are brought by companies seeking protection against imports, or complaining about unfair foreign trade practices.
On the other hand, patent extension and tariff suspension have practical effects that make the bill a point of considerable immediate interest in many board rooms. Where Consumers Could Suffer
Some tariff-cutting benefits could be passed on to consumers in lower prices, Congressional aides pointed out. But the most controversial of the special-interest provisions, the Lopid patent extension, could work against the consumer by denying the benefits of a cheaper generic equivalent.
Warner-Lambert's president and chief executive, Joseph D. Williams, a former president of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, personally managed the intensive lobbying effort, a sign of how important the issue is to his company.
One major victory was getting the patent extension attached to the bill. Usually this kind of legislation stands on its own and might be subject to intense scrutiny. But there were no public hearings before the Lopid provision was added to the omnibus bill last June. The risk in this strategy lies in the veto threat.
''There is a certain internal logic in making this a part of the trade bill, since this is an industry very much involved in U.S. trade,'' said Edward S. Knight, the company's legislative counsel and a partner in the Washington law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld.
''The pharmaceutical industry makes a positive contribution of $800 million to the balance of trade,'' he stressed. ''Companies in France, Germany and Japan are in the process of developing and marketing drugs that would compete against Lopid.''
The chief House sponsor of the extension was Representative Butler Derrick, Democrat of South Carolina, who has a big Warner-Lambert plant in his state. Spirited Opposition
But there was spirited opposition, chiefly from Representative Robert W. Kastenmeier, Democrat of Wisconsin, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties and the Administration of Justice, who did not like the idea of special-interest provisions in a trade bill.
Also weighing in against the patent extension was Eric Hard, a staff attorney for Public Citizens' Congress Watch, a public-interest watchdog group, who argued that the losers would be ''America's poor, sick and elderly, as well as the taxpayers, through Medicare and Medicaid'' -Government programs that pay for drugs for the elderly and poor.
A month's supply of Lopid costs anywhere from $40 to $70 in drugstores. ''If a person on a fixed income is prescribed three or four such drugs,'' Mr. Hard said, ''the dilemma is readily apparent.''
Other provisions of the bill were intended to give added tariff protection to specific companies, such as the Smith Corona Corporation, the only surviving American producer of portable electric typewriters in American.
Smith Corona has long complained about what it contends is the ''dumping'' of Japanese typewriters at unfairly low prices in the United States, and in 1979 won an order imposing higher duties on the Japanese products.
But the Japanese added calculating and memory features to their typewriters, thus changing the product classification to one not covered by the dumping order.
The Smith Corona provision, sponsored by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, would help Smith Corona, which manufactures in Cortland, N.Y., obtain dumping duties against ''later-developed typewriters.''
But most changes involve tariff suspensions to help a domestic industry dependent on materials not made in this country. Gumball Trinkets
One of the largest price reductions could come on gumball-machine trinkets. Tariffs on the jewelry and small toys wrapped in the plastic balls had been levied at up to 30 percent of the import price of the product itself. That duty would end. Before the gumball provision was added to the bill, one Senate aide noted, it had to be established that these products are made only outside the United States, in such countries as China, Taiwan and Bangladesh."

At the same time, political parties aside from the ruling Awami League party have been clamouring against the use of EVMs, claiming it is not secure and is even 'unconstitutional.' In the face of immense public pressure, authorities deferred the Dhaka city corporation polls, but political pressure has failed to remove Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) from the election. Election day was scheduled for January 30 - a holiday for Saraswati Puja - which prompted an outcry from rights groups which called it discriminatory. The Election Commission refused to change the date initially, offering a tottering defence, but later rescheduled elections for February 1. At the same time, political parties aside from the ruling Awami League party have been clamouring against the use of EVMs, claiming it is not secure and is even ""unconstitutional."" Chief Election Commissioner KM Nurul Huda said on December 25 that EVMs would not be used if there were objections, but later said they would be used.  EVMs were deployed in limited fashion in the 2018 General Elections, and saw only half the votes cast with them in six constituencies. Voter reactions were mixed, with complaints about the machines showing technical glitches. Though the EC said on January 21 that the army will not be deployed for the polls, Colonel Kamal Uddin, director of the project implementing EVMs, said army personnel familiar with the EVM technology will be present at every centre to help the presiding officers. The EC has deployed 35,000 EVMs in 2,468 polling centres for use in the Dhaka polls.  File Photo: Voters cast their votes via EVMs | Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune Twice the machines Colonel Kamal said that each centre will have double the machines. ""We are doubling the EVMs at each centre to instantly move from any machine that shows problems."" Authorities declined to reveal the cost of the EVMs being used. The machines were purchased from Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory (BMTF). In September 2018, it was reported that the government has approved Tk3,825 crore for the procurement of 150,000 machines at a cost of Tk2 lakh each. In 2011, the EC purchased EVMs from the BMTF at Tk46,501 apiece, which were considered more vulnerable and were subsequently destroyed. Colonel Kamal said returning officers and presiding officers are already being trained to use the EVMs. A demonstration is set for January 27 and the EC has scheduled a mock vote for January 30 to familiarize voters with the technology. Hack-proof EVMs? Colonel Kamal confidently said: ""The EVMs are very secure. As for hackers, if they have guts and are tech savvy, they can try hacking the EVMs. EVMs are not even connected to the internet."" However, hacking is not limited to the internet. Experts have pointed out that EVMs are still vulnerable to manual tampering. Components can be compromised, but the complexity of the process makes wide scale tampering unfeasible. He also said the EC's decision to widely use EVMs stemmed from responses to  city corporation elections in other districts.  Brig Gen Mohammad Sidul Islam, director general of the EC's NID Wing, said: ""Voters can only cast ballots in their own constituency. No other EVM will accept his ballot. On election day, the presiding officer inserts an SD card into the EVM, with voter data of that particular constituency . Anyone not on the list will be unable to vote and anyone listed in one constituency will not be able to vote in another. The EC said around 70 staff are working round the clock to tweak and upgrade the EVM system in whatever minute way possible, before the machines are rolled out."

Despite a court directive to stop the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics, the health authorities have taken no concrete steps in this regard, raising the spectre of superbugs, which cause some seven lakh deaths globally per year. Sale of antibiotics without requiring prescription from registered physicians is still high in the country, The Daily Star has found visiting over two hundred drug stores and talking to experts. Bacteria-fighting drugs known as antibiotics help control and destroy many of the harmful organisms that make people sick. But overuse and misuse of antibiotics prompt some strains of bacteria to make a small change in their DNA and become antibiotic-resistant ""superbugs"", experts say.  There is no data on deaths caused by superbugs in Bangladesh, but professors at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) say about 70 percent of the deaths at ICUs are caused by AMR [antimicrobial resistance] infections. AMR is a situation when microorganisms like bacteria, virus and some parasites resist medicinal interventions. ""Problem is people don't know which drugs are antibiotics. Around 15 lakh people are taking antibiotics daily and most of them don't have prescriptions,"" Prof Sayedur Rahman, chairman of pharmacology department at the BSMMU, told The Daily Star. A recent study, carried out jointly by the Directorate General of Drug Administration (DGDA) and the WHO, shows that antibiotics consumption in Bangladesh has increased by 30.81 percent in the last two years. The DGDA and the WHO used data from the pharmaceutical companies, and the study report was released on November 27 last year. Earlier on April 25, the High Court ordered the DGDA to take steps to stop the over-the-counter sale of antibiotics.  The ruling came after a writ petition was filed by Advocate Sayedul Haque Suman over the matter. The writ was spurred by a report in UK's The Telegraph, which cited a report this newspaper ran under the headline ""A big cause for health concern"" in April last year. High-ups of the DGDA -- the apex regulatory body for pharmaceuticals -- claimed they had done their best. But in reality, they only issued a notice in May to all district commissioners and civil surgeons, asking them to take steps in line with the court directive. The notice was followed-up by a reminder a month later. That was the extent to which the DGDA acted. DGDA Director Ruhul Amin told The Daily Star, ""Our drug inspectors are regularly advocating this issue at meetings with stakeholders."" Queried further, he again mentioned that ""awareness was all important"" in this regard. People concerned, however, said the DGDA's action was ""just to save its skin"". Meanwhile, a laboratory analysis by the Department of Microbiology and Immunology (DMI) of BSMMU, conducted from 2010 to 2018, has found a sharp rise in the number of superbugs in the country. In 2010, superbugs and multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria were detected in 6.5 percent cases of all patients seen. But it increased to 11-14 percent in 2018, according to the study. Experts said it is the inappropriate and overuse of antibiotics which leads to the rise of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or superbugs, The AMR infections have become a global threat, with 10 million deaths predicted to be caused by it by 2050 if things go unchecked, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). But the country's authorities concerned seem to be taking the matter lightly. GROUND REALITY: PROFIT OVER PRESCRIPTION
 Recently, The Daily Star correspondents have visited drug stores in Farmgate, in front of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and Suhrawardy Medical College Hospital in the capital. They have also been to pharmaceutical stores in both urban and rural areas in Savar, Rangpur, Khulna, Sylhet, Chattogram, Mymensingh and Rajshahi. The scenario was similar everywhere. At half a dozen drug stores at a rural market in Rangpur's Pirgachha upazila, this correspondent last month found antibiotics being sold either without prescriptions or as suggested by medicine sellers. ""As antibiotics work better and are more profitable, we sometimes do suggest it. People usually don't buy full dose of antibiotics. Besides, they are also reluctant to visit doctors because it would cost them additional money,"" a medicine shop owner in the village market told The Daily Star. Visiting at least 25 stores in Khulna's Hazrat Market, Moilapota intersection, Natun Rasta intersection and in front of Khulna Medical College Hospital, The Daily Star correspondents found customers buying antibiotic drugs without any prescription. Jalal Ahmed, owner of Afroz Medical Hall at Moilapota intersection, said he was not aware of any formal instruction from the authorities on not selling the drugs without prescription. There are more than a hundred pharmaceutical stores on the Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital Road. A medicine seller there said they make a huge profit from antibiotics sale. ""We have not got any direction in this regard,"" he said. The Daily Star correspondents witnessed the same situation in Chowhatta and Amberkhana areas in the city. Our Mymensingh correspondent and Rajshahi University correspondents also found antibiotics being sold over the counter in the two districts. Usually people suffering from dysentery, diarrhoea, food poisoning, common cold, cough, fever, toothache, and ear and throat pain use self-prescribed antibiotic, shows a 2014 study conducted in Rajshahi and published in the journal of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information. According to the DGDA website, there are 118,901 licensed retail drug shops across the country. A 2015 study by the System for Improved Access to Pharmaceuticals and Services, however, revealed the existence of approximately an equal number of unlicensed retail drug stores in the country, shows WHO website. A majority (68 percent) of the clients visiting these drug shops came by self-referral and without a prescription, the study showed. For another study, the Institute of Epidemiology, Diseases Control and Research (IEDCR) analysed some 14,669 samples collected from nine public hospitals across the country from 2017 and 2019. It found Ceftriaxone, a watch group drug, to be the most used antibiotics, and that the drug's effectiveness has gone down by 10 to 92 percent in killing several bacteria. According to the WHO, antibiotics are classified into three groups -- ""access group"" used for a wide range of primary level infection, ""watch group"" used against higher resistance bacteria, and ""reserve group"" only to be used when all alternatives fail. Imipenam, another watch group drug, has been found to be 10 to 76 percent ineffective. If these don't work, it only leaves to a few other antibiotics. ""It indicates we are rapidly going to exhaust rest of the available antibiotics in our hand,"" said Dr Zakir Hossain Habib, principal scientific officer at the IEDCR, who led the study. DGDA INITIATIVES -- NOT ENOUGH? On the DGDA directive on stopping the sale of antibiotics without prescriptions, several deputy commissioners said the DGDA initiative had a very little to no impact on creating awareness on the matter. ""We have held a meeting with all stakeholders. However, we haven't conducted any mobile court drive yet,"" Md Asib Ahsan, DC of Rangpur, told The Daily Star, adding that they were focusing on raising awareness first. He also said the issue deserves more campaigning and the DGDA needs to do more planning. Asked, DGDA Director Ruhul Amin couldn't even say whether the sale and consumption of antibiotics without prescription was a punishable offence. A DGDA official, however, said any medicine seller could be punished under the existing law for selling antibiotics without proper prescription. Such punishment, however, has yet to be meted out. BSMMU's Prof Sayedur Rahman said the DGDA can impose a fine of up to Tk 40,000 for the offence. He said cases can be filed against the owner of the drug store and it also can be sealed off. Contacted, Health Minister Zahid Malek apparently defended the DGDA, saying, ""It has a shortage of manpower. It is tough for them to monitor drug stores across the country."" The DGDA has only 46 drug superintendents in its 54 district offices, said its sources. COORDINATION IS THE KEY Experts says the sale of antibiotics over the counter continues unabated mainly due to a lack of monitoring from the DGDA and coordination between the drug administration and the local administration. ""There are around 200 staffers, including 20 doctors, under the health ministry at each upazila. They can easily be involved in raising awareness on AMR [antimicrobial resistance],"" Prof Sayedur Rahman, who led the antibiotic DGDA-WHO antibiotic consumption study, told The Daily Star, adding that the DGDA cannot sit idly for the recruitment of manpower. He also said physicians often unnecessarily prescribe antibiotics ""due to a lack of facilities to carry out antibiotic sensitivity [ABS] test. Doctors in 55 districts do not have ABS test facility, he said. Dr Zakir Hossain Habib, principal scientific officer at the IEDCR, however, said the required tests could be done manually with the existing facilities as an alternative to the ABS tests. For that, the government must appoint enough lab technicians and ensure sufficient supply of reagents. Dr Muniruddin Ahmed, professor of clinical pharmacy and pharmacology at Dhaka University, suggested involvement of all local bodies in the fight against over-the-counter sale of antibiotics. He wants the DGDA to take the lead. Prof Sayedur Rahman suggested marking boxes of antibiotics red so that people can easily know they are prescription drugs.

VC says sorry for 'lacking' in his role; protest to continue Amid growing protests by students demanding justice for Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology's (Buet) slain student Abrar Fahad, the university authorities have banned student politics on the campus. This apart, Buet also suspended 19 of its students who have been named in the Abrar murder case. Buet Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Saiful Islam announced the decisions around 5:45pm yesterday, nearly four hours after the 2pm deadline the agitating students set for him to meet them, clarifying his stance on a 10-point demand. The meeting between Buet authorities led by the VC, and the protesters started at Buet auditorium around 5:30pm, on the fifth day of demonstrations that erupted after several now-expelled Buet Chhatra League leaders killed Abrar Fahad in the early hours on Monday. Earlier yesterday, several hundred students of the university gathered in front of Buet Shaheed Minar at 11am with placards, and chanted different slogans demanding capital punishment for Abrar's killers.  On Thursday afternoon, the students placing a charter of 10 demands threatened to lock down all the academic, and administrative buildings of the university, if the VC failed to meet them by 2pm on Friday.   The protesters, at that time, clarified that they demanded the banning of political party-affiliated student organizations on campus, not student politics as a whole. Several hours later, the VC agreed to sit with them to decide on their demands.  Abrar, a second year student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of Buet, was beaten to death at Sher-e-Bangla Hall. The killers-- all Buet students--beat him for his alleged involvement with Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, an unsubstantiated claim which is yet to be proven. VC says sorry for his role  During the meeting, the VC apologized to the students for ""lacking"" in the role he should have played immediately after the incident.  ""I did have some shortcomings. I beg apology,"" said the VC adding: ""I am extremely sorry as I could not appear on time."" VC Saiful went on saying that the Buet authorities will bear all the expenses needed to run the murder case, as well as to compensate the victim's family.  Promising to take necessary measures to stop ragging by the students, he assured that the university authorities will write to the government seeking speedy trial of the killers.  The VC has been drawing the protesters' wrath since he did not show up on the campus until after 5pm on Tuesday, nearly 40 hours after Abrar was reported dead.  His finally made a public appearance, and issued a statement around 5:30pm that day, after the students set a 5pm deadline.  However, sources at his office claimed that the VC failed to make public appearance due to illness.  Protesters also demanded his resignation.  Criticism over the matter did not just stop there. The Awami League-led 14-party alliance, too, yesterday lashed out at him. The alliance's spokesperson Mohammed Nasim at a meeting in Dhaka said: ""We're hurt over the delay by Buet VC in reaching there (Sher-e-Bangla Hall). This is so unfortunate, something we cannot expect from a VC.""  Protests to continue as campus still 'unsafe' Despite assurance from the authorities regarding meeting their demands, protesters announced to keep protesting on campus until the entire campus becomes safe for all students.  According to them, leaders and activists of some student fronts including Chhatra League are still residing at different dormitories of Buet.  For this reason, they did not even retreat from their decision of boycotting Buet admission test slated for October 14. The murder sparked protests not only in a number of higher educational institutions in Dhaka, but also in many universities, cities, and divisional headquarters across the country.  Abrar, a second year student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of the university, was beaten to death by some activists, and leaders of Bangladesh Chhatra League's Buet unit inside the university's Sher-e-Bangla Hall in the early hours of Monday. Abrar's father filed a murder case against 19 people-- all Buet students--with Chawkbazar police station on Monday evening.  Until yesterday evening, 18 accused were arrested. Of them, 17 have been placed on remand for different periods."

As the river route has not been developed for years of mismanagement, this river port remained inoperative. However, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared Chilmari as a river port during her official visit to Kurigram on September 7, 2016 Although three years have elapsed since the formal inauguration of Chilmari River Port in Kurigram, it is yet to see any activities, causing frustration to local people. Sources said a Shipping Protocol Treaty was signed between the governments of India and Bangladesh in 1972 to transport goods through rivers. During the British period, one could travel through rivers from Kolkata to Guwahati as far as Dhubri in Assam. As the river route has not been developed for years of mismanagement, this river port remained inoperative. However, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared Chilmari as a river port during her official visit to Kurigram on September 7, 2016. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) set up a pontoon at Ramna Shallowghat, Chilmari on September 23, 2017, which was inaugurated by then Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan. Besides, a project was taken to develop the river port. However, the Zilla Parishad does not want to hand over the responsibility of managing the ghats of this river port. The port was given out on lease without informing the BIWTA, resulting in a conflict between the two parties. When the conflict intensified and the matter went to the court, then Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan visited the river port in June, 2018 and assured all concerned of solving the problem. But neither the problem was solved or the river port became operational, alleged locals. According to sources at the Shipping Ministry, once Chilmari was a traditional business hub. The area was recognised as 'Chilmari River Port' from the early days when big ships carrying thousands of maunds of jute, paddy, rice and other goods started moving along this river port. During the British period, big warehouses of jute, mustard, paddy, peanuts and maize were set up at Chilmari around the river port. Renowned jute companies in the country came to Chilmari and established their offices to procure jute. Besides, businessmen and traders of various areas came and stayed at Chilmari day after day to buy goods. The commercial activities based on Chilmari came to a halt due to river erosion and navigability crisis. The present government has taken up the project to improve navigability by dredging rivers. This river port is the only route to establish regional connectivity among India, Bhutan and Nepal from the Payra Sea Port. If the river port can be developed, the entire Kurigram region as well as the national economy will see a good growth. ""We can't see any ray of hope as the river port is not being operational. So, we demand this river port be made operational as soon as possible,"" said Shahidul."

340,"Photographs That Reflect and Confront Cultural Icons
1988-01-29T05:00:00.000Z
JUDGED by its first month, 1988 promises to be an energetic, expansive and sometimes controversial year for photography. On a weekend's excursion to museums and galleries currently exhibiting photographs, one can sense a ferment that compensates for the often uninviting chill of winter streets and sidewalks.
If the shows now on view are any indication, the biggest issue to be faced this year hinges on how we look at photographs. Do they wear their meanings on their sleeves, or are they signs of half-hidden attitudes and biases? The sharpest delineation of this question can be found in the exhibition ''Picturing 'Greatness' '' at the Museum of Modern Art. Part of the museum's ''Contemporary Art in Context'' program, the show consists of 39 portrait photographs of artists, selected from the museum's photography collection by the artist Barbara Kruger.
Given Ms. Kruger's post-modernist reputation and the nature of her artworks - declarative, billboard-size photomontages that intend to upset the status quo - a collaboration between her and the museum's generally conservative department of photography would seem unlikely. But the result is a huge success. For the museum's audience, it offers a chance to see firsthand how a new generation of artists and critics is responding to photographs as cultural evidence. For the museum's photography department, it marks what one hopes is a new era of openness and experimentation.
''Picturing 'Greatness' '' is a show about the ways in which artists of this century have presented themselves to the camera, and the ways in which photographers have chosen to depict them. Although Ms. Kruger does not bother to sort out whether photographers or their subjects are more responsible for the images that are presented, her essential point is well taken: the idea of ''the artist'' is, in pictorial terms, a virtual cliche. The ''look'' of being an artist is predetermined by cultural precedent. The art-ists on view range from Claude Monet to Jackson Pollock, and in appearance they vary from ''a kind of well-tailored gentility,'' in Ms. Kruger's words, to ''a kooky middleman between God and public.'' Many of the pictures are well known, including the show's most obvious cliche, Edward Steichen's print of Rodin posed as a mirror of his sculpture ''The Thinker.'' But others are sufficiently individual as to seem fresh, including a 1935 image of Alexander Rodchenko, thought to be a self-portrait, and Irving Penn's 1947 portrait of John Marin, imperiously leaning on a umbrella.
But the intent of the exhibition is not to present these images as individual works of art. This is made obvious by the installation itself, which differs radically from usual museum practice. Ms. Kruger has hung the prints in groups, stacking some like totem poles, to point out certain motifs. In one group, all the artists are holding cigarettes; in another, they are all wielding brushes. And then there is the show's wall label, which dominates the center of the gallery. It greatly resembles one of Ms. Kruger's own artworks, with bands of red paint flanking type so big it can be read from outside the gallery.
What Ms. Kruger has done, in short, is to make obvious the curator's intention and intervention. She also has expanded the context of the photographs so that they are ''about'' more than just the history and esthetics of photography itself. For this we have to thank the artist and Susan Kismaric, the photography curator who invited her to put together the show.
''Picturing 'Greatness' '' remains at the Museum of Modern Art through March 29. ''The Logic of Display'' P. S. 1 46-01 21st Street Long Island City, Queens Through March 6
While less emphatic about revealing the hand of the curator than ''Picturing 'Greatness,' '' the group exhibition ''The Logic of Display'' at P. S. 1 suggests that the urge to link photography with larger cultural forces is a widespread, even international phenomenon. Consisting of work by 10 artists from four countries, the exhibition makes the point that photographic images are increasingly being used in hybrid works that resemble sculpture more than traditional photographs. But that's only part of the purpose of the show, which was organized by two P. S. 1 curators, Paul Laster and Renee Riccardo. The less obvious, more telling message is that artists are ''packaging'' their photographs in ways that refer to, and comment on, commercial precedents.
Barbara Bloom's ''Arena,'' for example, is a glass-fronted showcase that holds photographs and a shoe. The images depict a sports stadium and a shoe store that is designed like a stadium. On another wall, a group of French artists who call themselves Information Fiction Publicite show a series of four light boxes, arrayed from floor to ceiling, that look like miniaturized bus-shelter advertising panels. But in this case, the backlit ''ads'' are merely images of clouds.
The most intriguing piece in the show, however, may have more to do with architecture than packaging. By an artist known as B. Wurtz, it consists of an empty amplifier case, on which is mounted a cylindrical chair leg, and two photographs. The photos seem to show us industrial factory buildings, but close examination reveals them to be close-up, worm's-eye views of the assemblage on the floor.
Also at P. S. 1 is a fascinating exhibition of work by the Swiss artists Peter Fischli and David Weiss and an intriguing slide installation by Richard Baim. The Fischli and Weiss show, organized by Karen Marta for the List Visual Arts Center of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, features humorous photographs of their unlikely, Rube Goldberg-style constructions and a video projection of their masterpiece to date, a film called ''Der Lauf der Dinge'' (loosely, ''How Things Work''). Using elemental means - fire and fireworks, blasts of air, gravity and a variety of corrosive liquids - the artists manage to sustain a chain reaction of ever-more-absurd materials and events for 30 minutes.
Mr. Baim's installation, called ''World/Fair,'' uses the techniques of corporate slide presentation, including computer-controlled dissolves and lighting effects, to undercut the implicit promise of progress they contain. Images of ''modern'' society - highways, factories and buildings - merge and blend in sometimes revelatory, sometimes unfathomable ways. Their slow procession, seen over a monument bearing an optimistic message about a ''brave new world,'' gives the installation a seriousness and gravity unusual in today's art world. 'No Trumpets, No Swans' Pratt Manhattan Gallery Puck Building 295 Lafayette Street Through Feb. 24
A far more jaundiced view of contemporary art photography than the P. S. 1 shows - indeed, an oppositional one - can be found in the exhibition ''No Trumpets, No Swans,'' at the Pratt Manhattan Gallery. Organized by Philip Perkis, who teaches photography at Pratt Institute, with Eleanor Moretta, the gallery's exhibitions director, ''No Trumpets, No Swans'' aims to rehabilitate the practice of what's called ''street photography'' from what Mr. Perkis clearly feels is its currently unfashionable position in the art world.
Although situated geographically on the edge of SoHo, ''No Trumpets'' is situated against it esthetically. The eight photographers in the show seem less interested in issues of representation and packaging than in reporting on fleeting facts of the visible world. In an argumentative statement available at the gallery, the critics Marvin Hoshino and Roberta Hellman say that these pictures challenge ''the common notion that straight camera work is somehow limiting, that it's come to a dead end and is not contemporary.''
The evidence gathered here includes Helen Levitt images dating to 1942 and Garry Winogrand pictures from the 60's together with much recent photography, including Mr. Perkis's. The pictures indeed show that the pleasures of straightforward, uninflected photography remain as strong as ever. Photographs such as Elaine Mayes's image of a boy flattened against his skateboard, and Judy Linn's Coney Island view, in which a young woman's shoulder merges magically with the horizon behind her, seem marvelous no matter what one calls them. But it remains to be seen whether the incidental beauty of images like these is enough to displace the current trend toward more elaborated, skeptical uses of photography. (After closing in Manhattan, the show will reopen at the Rubelle and Norman Schafler Gallery, Pratt Institute, 200 Willoughby Avenue, in Brooklyn, March 4 to 31.) 'Marc Riboud: Lasting Moments, 1953-1988' I.C.P.-Midtown Gallery 77 West 45th Street Through March 12
The ''hidden hand'' tradition of ''No Trumpets, No Swans'' is by no means limited to the eight photographers represented in that show, of course. It can also be seen at the I.C.P.-Midtown Gallery, in an endearing retrospective of the work of the French photographer Marc Riboud. Mr. Riboud's output of the last 35 years serves as a reminder of Henri Cartier-Bresson's vast influence on postwar photography. While never a slavish imitator of Cartier-Bresson's style, Mr. Riboud does share the master's reliance on intuition and devotion to lyrical moments. What distinguishes his work is its obvious sympathy with peasants, laborers, refugees and common people generally.
Compared to Cartier-Bresson, whose work can be seen in the show ''Henri Cartier-Bresson in India,'' at the International Center of Photography (1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street, through Feb. 28), Mr. Riboud seems to function on the sidelines of world events. He portrays strife in Bangladesh through the faces of grieving young widows, the Vietnam antiwar movement by juxtaposing a flower and a bayonet. Although he has called himself a poor reporter because of this, his knack for recording history from the viewpoint of those most affected by it gives his pictures their unique and often compelling personality. Robert Rauschenberg Pace/MacGill Gallery 11 East 57th Street Through March 5
Robert Rauschenberg's new photographs, taken with a large-format Polaroid camera and displayed at the Pace/MacGill Gallery, are something else entirely from Marc Riboud's work. Rather than report on the world, they record the omnivorous vision of their maker. The photographs fall into two groups. Those in black and white, showing us bits of cars, bicycles and palm trees, are bleached and stained and sometimes grouped into grids of four. The color images are straightforward, almost documentary observations of fading signs, peeling plywood and other forms of material dereliction.
Photography is nothing new to Rauschenberg, who started taking pictures at Black Mountain College in 1949. The idea of claiming for art items that were bound for the junkyard is not new either - witness his show of ''Glut'' sculptures at Blum Helman Gallery (20 West 57th Street, through tomorrow). What is of interest, though, is the way these pictures make clear his penchant for decay.
There are, however, two problems here. One is that the pictures seem to have a touch of deja vu. The black-and-whites have the look of earlier Rauschenberg prints, perhaps mixed with a touch of the Starn Twins; the color is reminiscent of William Eggleston's work. The other is that the artist's perceptive facility is so great there seems to be no end to its expression. By using a camera - that mechanical producer of endless images - Rauschenberg doubles the odds of visual surfeit."

In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, a large number of people have opted for ordering groceries online from the safety of their homes. Customers want to avoid the danger of interacting with people and at the same time, stock up on necessities as people fear a drawn-out self-isolation period until the crisis passes. Home deliveries are considered a safe option. Waseem Alim, co-founder and CEO of Chaldal, an online grocery and delivery platform, says they have been serving 4,000 customers a day in Dhaka through their 350 delivery workers. Such platforms have seen a surge in business in the past weeks. Chaldal has been inundated with orders and has been operating at maximum capacity. Due to this, customers now need to wait for almost a week for their next available slot for delivery. Sabrina Fatema, a resident of Dhanmondi, said she was trying to order a disinfectant item on the site on March 21. The first available slot she found was March 28. Farhana Lubaba, a resident of the Kazipara area of Mirpur, said she had to wait four days to get her order from Shwapno. ""I was expecting that I wouldn't be getting my order anymore. I was surprised to get a phone call from a delivery worker on the fourth day,"" she said. Since more and more people are ordering groceries and other items online since the outbreak, delivery workers have been working tirelessly from morning till night. According to some delivery workers this correspondent interviewed, they would earlier make around 18 to 25 deliveries daily. In the past ten days, they have been doing between 30 and 40 home deliveries a day. ""The situation has changed massively. Now, customers are madly buying online to avoid public gathering at the supershops and bazaars,"" said Md Shaown Hazari, a Chaldal delivery worker. The rise in demand means Arif Hawlader, another Chaldal delivery worker, leaves for work at 7:00am and returns home at 10:00pm. The coronavirus outbreak has also forced delivery workers and customers to maintain cleanliness and hygiene standards in their interactions. Deen Islam Imran of Chaldal is wearing a mask while delivering orders, and sanitising his hands after handling cash. ""Our office has provided safety kits and has been monitoring whether we are strictly maintaining these standards,"" he said. According to Chaldal's CEO, the platform has taken precautions to prevent the risk of the virus passing on to their delivery workers. From March 16, they have formed an internal policy. ""Bike handles, bike seats, and steering wheels should be disinfected with hexisol or Savlon by the respective driver at the beginning of every shift. Deliverymen should maintain a distance of at least one metre from customers when delivering orders,"" mentioned the policy provided by the Chaldal CEO. Supershop Shwapno is also providing hand sanitisers, gloves, and masks for its delivery workers. Delivery and logistics businesses in general have also taken new policies to reduce risks of the virus spreading by giving customers the option of contactless delivery. Pathao, for example, is promoting contactless delivery by dropping off items at doors and asking users to pay digitally. ""We have also taken extra precautions for the safety of users and delivery agents and distributed over 5,000 safety kits to foodmen, couriers, and delivery agents,"" said Syeda Nabila Mahbub, director of marketing and public relations at Pathao. Recently, it also started Pathao Tong service, a shopping service where users could buy daily necessities and get those delivered to their doorsteps, to deliver groceries in Gulshan and Banani. However, contactless delivery is not a standard, as many customers choose to pay cash on delivery. ""It is not possible to avoid contact especially when we need to give change,"" said Arif. In spite of this, riders notice a visible change in customer behaviour. ""Many customers want to make sure that we are wearing masks. Some also offer us handwash or sanitiser before entering their house,"" said Deen. Promi Islam, a Dhanmondi resident, said she keeps a hand sanitiser and deodorant at her door. ""At first, I sanitise the parcel with the deodorant containing alcohol and then we offer hand sanitiser to the deliverymen after they touch our money,"" she said. But the question of the riders' safety still remains. According to the riders, their job involves interacting with a lot of customers every day. ""Most often, we need to enter their house to leave the products. My family worries about whether I end up making deliveries to a home where someone has the virus,"" said a Shwapno delivery worker in the Mirpur area. ""Contactless delivery can be a great way to reduce our risks of being infected, especially in the days to come as we don't know what is going next,"" he stated. ""We have been caring for the customers, and we hope, they too will assist us for the safety of both parties."""
346,"India's Bleakest Corner Is Where All Hope Ends
1989-09-11T05:00:00.000Z
In an era when it is common to talk of Asian economic miracles and a Pacific century, the Indian state of Rajasthan is a reminder that there are, in reality, two Asias. There are the economic tigers and would-be tigers from Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand, but also the struggling, crowded, volatile nations of South Asia, especially India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, where survival is difficult.
In many ways, Rajasthan reflects South Asia's problems.
Population is a major contributor to the widening gap between the two Asias. India Today, the country's leading news magazine, has estimated, based on current population trends, that within decades India will be the world's poorest country. With a current population of 810 million and a growth rate of 2.1 percent a year, the magazine estimates that by early in the next century India will have well over a billion people, with the world's largest numbers of illiterates and homeless - 600 million in each category - and 400 million unemployed.
Rajasthan, a northwestern state on the Pakistan border, has the country's fastest-growing population with an annual increase of 2.8 percent. Land and vegetation are visibly running out. Urban areas, including Jaipur, the 18th-century ''pink city'' that was once a model of town planning, are overrun by the poor. Where India's Troubles Are Coming Together
In ecology, nutrition, culture and politics, Rajasthan is a demographer's laboratory, and some of India's most creative research into the complex problems of population growth, human development and adjustment to a changing environment is being done here.
In a region with a distinctive culture, art portrays the plight of the Rajasthani countryside and recently inspired a collection of short poems, ''Footprints in the Sand,'' by Amit Jayaram. One of the poems says: The animals' feet leave their print on the desert's face. Hunger is so real, so very real, that it can make you walk around a barren tree looking for nourishment. Not once. Not twice. Not thrice. . . .
Formerly the domain of Hindu Rajput maharajahs whose courts and cultures had come under strong Islamic influence, Rajasthan, with 44 million people, is now statistically a part of the nation's largest demographic bloc: the Hindu, Hindi-speaking belt of northern states that also includes Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and parts of Haryana. The area dominates Indian politics, a source of irritation to parts of the country where social and economic advances have been greater.
In the Hindi belt, where 40 percent of Indians live, literacy and the status of women are lower than in other states. More and more Indians regard those factors as major causes of a national failure to curb population growth. Rajasthan Ranks Last In Almost Everything
Rajasthan has a literacy rate of 24 percent, the lowest of all the major states, according to the 1981 census (the next will be in 1991). Only 5 percent of rural Rajasthani women read or write, and fewer than 10 percent of girls from age 5 to 9 attend school. Between a ninth (in cities) and a third (in rural areas) of all Rajasthani workers are 14 years old or younger, often a reflection of their economic importance to families.
Child marriage is the norm, in defiance of national laws that set the legal age for women at 18 and for men at 21. Many Rajasthanis see this practice as a social necessity. A girl married before or at puberty is considered safe from extramarital sex and the stigma of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which could result in her murder at the hands of outraged relatives.
Thirty-year-old Kamla lives in the village of Kotri, northeast of Ajmer and a few miles from Sambhar Salt Lake. The land here is not as good as it is farther north, where irrigation projects have been started, or as bad as the deserts to the west. The soil is not unlike the rest of north India's scrub land.
Farming on a self-sustaining scale is not possible in Kotri, and families depend on sheep and goats. The dirt roads are choked by herds being led in search of food. Camels are harnessed to plows where arable fields exist. A camel can look after itself, the local people say, letting the men of Kotri concentrate on their wool-and meat-producing flocks.
Mrs. Kamla, the daughter of a Brahman who allowed her to learn to read and write, thinks for a few minutes when asked how Rajasthan's growing population has affected Kotri, a town with a few hundred families living in small houses of concrete or stone. Lacking Land, Many Are Forced to Leave
''There is less and less land,'' she says in Hindi, through an interpreter. ''Every year the water in the ground is more saline. Water is a big problem.
''More people have to migrate, and migrate farther and farther, to find enough food for the animals,'' she says.
The lengthening winter and spring migrations, sometimes involving treks of hundreds of miles to the neighboring states of Madhya Pradesh or Gujarat, uproot entire families. Birth control can seem pointless when a father needs extra shepherds to patrol the edges of the wandering flocks, Mrs. Kamla says.
There are other migrations, too. From villages like these, thousands of Rajasthani men and women go to cities as far away as New Delhi or Bombay in search of manual work, often on construction sites.
In Kotri, Mrs. Kamla, is trying to make changes. She is working through the Social Work and Research Center, a nongovernmental development organization in Tilonia, 40 miles to the south. She is a woman in one of India's most male-dominated states, where village women, approached by outsiders, cover their faces with shawls or bright-colored saris. But Mrs. Kamla's high caste gives her standing, and village men acknowledge her as a leader. A Different Concept Of Population Control
Mrs. Kamla is trying to promote population control in Kotri by persuading women to use family planning services available at Government clinics. The mother of two girls, she seems skeptical of experts who say Indians will continue to have children until they have had enough boys, usually two, to guarantee support in old age and a son to light their funeral pyres.
''The women here say they have so many children because there is no health care here,'' she says over tea, with guests sprawled on the floor in her small office. In India, family planning means sterilization, and in more than 90 percent of the cases, the operation is performed on women. Conditions are often unsanitary.
''Women in this village say they do not want to be sterilized after two children, boys or girls, because the nearest doctor is far away and the services there are not very good,'' she says. ''So they ask: 'What happens if one of the babies falls sick and dies? Or what if I become ill after the operation? Who will look after me?' ''
In Naul, a village east of Tilonia, another high-caste woman, Ratan, is also trying to promote family planning. Married off at puberty to an older man, she was widowed while still in her teens. Her parents then took the bold step of allowing her to reject another marriage, and she began doing community work, using a knowledge of traditional medicine learned from her husband.
Told about community work being done in rural Bangladesh, where villagers are trained in nutrition, Mrs. Ratan said most families here live on flat breads and lentils, and teaching them to prepare balanced diets would be meaningless, she explained, since there are almost no vegetables or fruits. In Jaipur, Fading Glory Of the Raj and Nature
When the Rajasthani capital of Jaipur was built by the Maharajah Sawai Jai Singh of Amber in the mid-18th century, it was an Asian wonder. There were broad avenues drawn on a grid, shady colonnaded walkways along wide pavements, and a unity of architecture in private, public and commercial buildings. There was a drainage system.
In 250 years, Jaipur, a city built to serve 500,000 people, has become home to 1.5 or 2 million - no one really knows - and its glory has all but disappeared behind the huts of squatters and sidewalk vendors.
As the population continues to expand with the influx of people from the countryside, who erect small houses on the desert around the city's perimeter, its services have been severely strained. Roads are potholed; its once-famous drainage pipes clogged.
The destruction of Jaipur's natural environment has also been rapid and drastic, says Professor G. S. Nathawat of the Indira Gandhi Center for Ecological, Environmental and Population Studies at Rajasthan University. He takes a visitor to hills near the campus to see the latest phase in the city's deterioration.
There, forests are being razed and quarries dug to provide the booming construction industry with granite. The hills are protected woodlands and the quarrying illegal. But the business is so profitable that local officials can be bribed to make exceptions.
Only one small part of the forest backdrop remains, a section that university students have claimed and fenced. It is the last piece of recreation land left to them in Jaipur's once-wooded hills."

It expects correction on his narrative, understanding about Bangladesh The Embassy of Bangladesh in Washington, DC has categorically rejected the remarks on Bangladesh made by US Senator Chuck Grassley, saying what the senator said was farthest from the truth. ""The Embassy clearly states that the remarks made by Senator Grassley are not only biased and motivated but also absolutely contradictory to the 2019 Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF),"" the Bangladesh embassy said in a statement, strongly protesting his remarks. It said the embassy is surprised to see that Senator Grassley had stated in his op-ed that citizens of Bangladesh live under an authoritarian regime and face persecution for faith and religious beliefs, reports UNB. Bangladesh is a secular democracy, where people from all faiths live in peace and harmony, the embassy said. The statement further said the embassy is extremely disappointed to see that instead of appreciating the democratic government of Bangladesh for sheltering more than 1.1 million Rohingyas from Myanmar, who were persecuted in their own country for their religion and ethnicity, Senator Grassley has opted for complete subjectivity to criticize the government [of Bangladesh] that actually saved their lives. An op-ed, titled ""Religious freedom under attack - US can promote and protect liberty globally,"" by Chuck Grassley, senator for Iowa, appeared on his official website (https://www.grassley.senate.gov/) on Tuesday. The embassy said it expects that Senator Grassley would correct his narrative and his understanding about Bangladesh based on facts and realities on the ground. A few examples of religious freedom and harmony in Bangladesh were also shared. These are as follows: Bangladesh is a country where festivals of major religious communities (Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists) are public holidays, the president of Bangladesh hosts reception for members of each religious community on the day of these festivals and prime minister of Bangladesh promotes a national slogan ""Religion unto individual, festivals unto all."" People from all faiths celebrate the festivals together, which is truly reflective of the spirit of secularism and non-communalism, added the embassy. Verses from the holy books of all major faiths are recited at the beginning of all important official programs, it said. The embassy said that Senator Grassley is welcome to visit Bangladesh and see for himself the values of democracy, freedom, openness, inclusiveness, and religious harmony that exists in Bangladesh."

350,"U.N. Critical of I.M.F. Austerity Plan
1989-09-06T05:00:00.000Z
Austerity measures imposed on the poorest countries by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for new loans, have produced no results, according to a United Nations report.
''I guess you could say the sacrifices have been in vain,'' said Roger Lawrence, an official of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, referring to the reductions in social spending and the drop in living standards the austerity measures have caused.
That is one of the conclusions of the conference's annual report, scheduled for release Wednesday. The Geneva-based body is the main United Nations agency promoting the economic interests of the developing countries. The agency has often criticized the ways that industrialized countries have responded to economic conditions in poor nations. Foreign Debt
The report says there is a troubling split in world economic performance. While healthy growth has continued, both in the industrialized countries and in several developing countries - mainly in eastern Asia - the economies of the developing countries of Africa and Latin America have stagnated or worsened. The report attributed much of their plight to their large foreign debts.
Recent initiatives, particularly by the United States and France, to forgive part of the debt are ''extremely welcome and positive,'' Mr. Lawrence said. However the conference argued that these measures would provide only about half the minimum debt reduction needed to spur economic growth.
The report examined the results of the adjustment programs adopted by the least developed countries to qualify for new I.M.F. loans. The United Nations has put 42 nations, with a combined population of more than 400 million, in this category. They all have very low per-capita income levels.
The report found that of the 12 least developed countries, which have applied such programs for most of the 1980's, the growth rates of only three - Bangladesh, Gambia and Mali -were above the average for all the least developed countries. ''The adjustment programs in the least developed countries have so far produced mixed results and achieved, at most, limited success,'' the report said. Detrimental Effects
The adjustment programs usually involve cutting public spending, devaluing the national currency to stimulate exports and reducing imports. By causing governments to reduce subsidies on food staples, such programs have provoked rioting, most recently in Venezuela.
The report said that often the main result of these programs had been a contraction of economic activity. Currency devaluation ''had little effect in stimulating exports in the least developed countries, but certainly created hardship, particularly to vulnerable groups,'' by raising prices, the report said.
What is needed, it continued, is increased debt relief, more flexible adjustment programs and better access to industrialized countries' import markets."

During his first visit to Dhaka, Steff met government officials and discussed intellectual property rights as well as other investment climate issues.  ""US and Bangladeshi business leaders are increasingly expanding their commercial ties and partnerships -- as evidenced by growing trade between our two nations and the strong participation of companies in our trade mission,"" he said.  On May 13, he met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Private Industry and Investment Advisor Salman F Rahman and Energy Advisor Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury--as well as Commerce Secretary Mofizul Islam--to discuss ways to expand economic ties.  Bangladesh, with its population and economic growth, offers US companies a market of incredible potential with tens of millions of increasingly affluent consumers.   Trade Winds Indo-Pacific is the US Department of Commerce's first major trade mission to Bangladesh in recent history. The trade mission began on May 6 in New Delhi and concluded on May 13 in Dhaka.   The Trade Winds event facilitated meetings between 12 representatives of US companies and more than 40 business-to-business meetings with Bangladeshi companies.   Trade Winds, now in its 11th year, has directly supported more than $3.4 billion in US exports in over 40 countries; in 2018, US exports of goods and services to the Indo-Pacific region were more than $476 billion.   In 2017, the mission brought 100 companies to Southeast Europe and accounted for more than $3 billion in US exports.   Trade Winds has helped US companies conduct over 4,000 pre-vetted, business-to-business meetings and over 6,000 government-to-business meetings around the world."

More than 600 disembarked near state capital Sittwe Myanmar shipped hundreds of recently released Rohingya inmates back to the country's restive western borderlands on Monday, after fears that its overcrowded prisons could become hotbeds for runaway coronavirus outbreaks. Men, women and children belonging to the stateless and long-persecuted Muslim minority were among nearly 25,000 prisoners freed last week by a presidential pardon to mark the country's April New Year celebrations. A Navy vessel transported the group from Yangon to western Rakhine state, where most Rohingya live under tight movement restrictions and in conditions Amnesty International has condemned as ""apartheid."" More than 600 disembarked near state capital Sittwe, while another 200 were taken further north to townships on the border with Bangladesh, state immigration department chief Soe Lwin told AFP. ""They will be quarantined,"" he added, without giving further details. Myanmar's biggest prisoner release in years came as coronavirus fears gripped the country, with calls for low-risk inmates to be released from what Human Rights Watch describes as Myanmar's ""horribly overcrowded and unsanitary"" jails. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that prison populations are particularly vulnerable to the spread of the disease. Myanmar has only 111 confirmed Covid-19 cases but experts fear the real number is many times higher because of the low numbers tested and the country's chronically underfunded healthcare system."

The prime minister is in the process of evaluating the first year of her running cabinet  A reshuffle in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's cabinet is likely to take place as soon as January, government high-ups have said.  The prime minister is now assessing the performances of all the cabinet members during the first year of the current government to this end, they added. ""Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already discussed this issue with President Abdul Hamid,"" a top official from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) told Dhaka Tribune, requesting not to be named. ""The cabinet reshuffle was scheduled a day or two before the Awami League National Council, but was put on hold. It is most likely to take place during the first week of January."" Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader, who just got re-elected as the general secretary of the ruling Awami League, has also hinted at the possibility of a reshuffle in the cabinet at the beginning of the new year.  ""There may be changes in the cabinet in the coming year,"" he told the media on Sunday. ""The ministers who did not perform as they were expected to in their respective offices may be reshuffled. Those who failed to do their job will be removed."" Quader, party chief Sheikh Hasina's second-in-command, further said the prime minister is aiming at separating the roles of Awami League leaders within the party and the government.  That is the reason why seven influential leaders of the party, who are also members of the cabinet, are not a part of the new, partially announced Central Working Committee of the ruling party.  If the prime minister is adamant about separating the party from the government, then some ministers, who are also central leaders of the Awami League, may be gradually dropped from the cabinet.  When contacted on Monday, Abdur Rahman, a newly-elected presidium member of Awami League, told Dhaka Tribune: ""Awami League President Sheikh Hasina is the only authorized person who can tell why some of the ministers are dropped and some retained in the new central committee. I strongly believe that her decision will strengthen our party as well as our government.""    According to speculations by some government high-ups, cabinet members like State Minister for Shipping Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Enamur Rahman, Deputy Minister for Water Resources AKM Enamul Hoque Shameem, and Deputy Minister for Education Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury Nowfel may get promoted during the reshuffle. Khalid, Enamul Hoque and Nowfel, who were organizing secretaries in the previous central committee of the Awami League, were dropped from the new committee.  The government sources further said some cabinet members' portfolios might be changed in the upcoming reshuffle, but the chances of cabinet members losing office is very slim as they have had only a year to work.  Requesting anonymity, a cabinet member recently told Dhaka Tribune that the Prime Minister's Office sought information on the cabinet members' performance over the past one year. ""The PMO issued a letter asking us how many days each of the cabinet members had spent abroad last year,"" the cabinet member said. ""We think the PMO is working on our ACR as January 7 is this cabinet's first anniversary."" Winning the December 30 general election last year, the new, 46-member strong cabinet, led by Awami League President Sheikh Hasina, was sworn in on January 7 this year, with Hasina as the prime minister for the third consecutive term.  Five months later, on May 19, State Minister Murad Hassan was moved to the Ministry of Information from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The prime minister also shuffled personnel at the Ministries of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives, and the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology. On July 13, the prime minister promoted State Minister for Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment Imran Ahmad to the rank of minister. On the same day, she appointed Fazilatun Nessa Indira as the state minister for women and children affairs. "

According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) of the district, at least 3500 hectares of land have been used for cultivating tobacco in six upazilas  Despite knowing of the adverse effects of tobacco, farmers have continued cultivating the crop across Nilphamari district as the produce yields them a good price compared to other crops like paddy and maize. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) of the district, at least 3500 hectares of land have been used for cultivating tobacco in six upazilas . However, a group of people who deal with tobacco in the district said the figure was almost 10,000 hectares. Agricultural officers have said they are discouraging farmers not to grow this crop as it is harmful for both health and soil. However, the farmers are not paying heed to them as tobacco cultivation brings them huge profits every year. They also added several tobacco companies, including multinational companies, were luring tobacco growers with seeds, fertilisers as well as technical support free of cost. This correspondent visited several villages- Itakhola, Kochukata, Tupamari, Panchapakur, Gorgarm , Charcharabari and Kanaikata Bamondanga - of Sadar upazila and observed that farmers, including women and children, were passing busy times in the tobacco fields. Farmer Nazrul Islam of Charcharabari village of Sadar upazila said tobacco companies had set up many purchasing centres and warehouses of tobacco in the district for the advantage of farmers . They are collecting produce from the fields directly. Even supervisors and officials of tobacco companies are regularly assisting them with various facilities. Farmer Arzina Begum of Kanaikata Bamondanga village of Kishoreganj upazila said she had cultivated tobacco on two bighas of land that cost her Tk 8,000. She added, ""Akij company provided me with fertilizer, seeds free of cost."" Another farmer, Mukta Akhtar, said: ""I have cultivated tobacco on two bighas of land, costing me Tk 10,000. I would sell the crops at Tk30,000-35,000. ""Had we cultivated rice, potatoes and green chillis, we would not be able to make much profit,"" she added. Some farmers of the district alleged that agriculture offices were not sincere in encouraging farmers to grow other crops. Farmers do not get advice from agriculture officials when their seed beds and crops get damaged. Nilphamari Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) Deputy Director Nikhil Chandra Biswas said: ""Profit in cultivating tobacco is more than the cost. For this reason, farmers, disregarding health risks, are cultivating tobacco in huge quantities. As a result, families of tobacco growers are getting exposed to various diseases and cropland is losing fertility gradually."" ""However, we are trying to create awareness among farmers,"" he added."

HC wants sentence copy, answers to five questions The government is set to withdraw Kurigram Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sultana Pervin, as evidence on the detention and torture of journalist Ariful Islam was found to be true.  The development came amid widespread criticism from various quarters regarding the detention and sentencing of Ariful in the early hours of Saturday, for reportedly possessing narcotics and alcohol. Ariful's family has called the allegations against him ""absurd."" The decision on the DC's withdrawal was disclosed on Sunday after Ariful, Kurigram correspondent of  Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune, was freed on bail around 12:30pm. Worryingly, Ariful was beaten so badly that he was taken directly to a local hospital following his release.   In another development on Sunday, the High Court ordered the state to submit to it a copy of Ariful's conviction which was delivered by a mobile court. Briefing the media at the Secretariat in Dhaka, State Minister for Public Administration, Farhad Hossain, said his ministry will soon withdraw DC Sultana, as an investigation into the incident found most of the allegations against her to be true.  ""Departmental action will also be taken against her [Sultana Pervin],"" he said, adding that not only the DC but all those involved with the incident will be brought to book. Earlier in the day, Ariful was granted bail by Additional District Magistrate Sujauddowla, upon giving an undertaking of Tk25,000. The journalist was released to the custody of Kurigram Press Club President Ahsan Habib Nilu.  Immediately after his release, Ariful was taken to Kurigram General Hospital and hospitalised around 1:30pm with numerous bruises on his body.  ""Ariful has injury marks on his body, especially on his hands, legs, back and head,"" confirmed Orthopaedic Senior Consultant Uttam Kumar Roy.  In addition to protests from journalists across the country regarding Ariful's conviction, The Editors' Council  on Sunday expressed grave concern over recent reports of indiscriminate attacks, abuse and torture of journalists.  At the hospital, Ariful told reporters that the authorities concerned had lied to him about his bail petition. ""An employee of the jail came to me on Saturday night and told me to sign a paper as my family had filed a bail petition,"" the journalist said. ""Today [Sunday], I came to know that my family did not do so."" 'They threatened my life' Arif said several people led by Senior Assistant Commissioner (Tax) Nazim Uddin broke into his home and started beating him.  ""They blindfolded me and tied up my hands and feet before shoving me into a car,"" Ariful said. ""They proceeded to take me to an isolated place and Nazim kept saying 'Say your prayers now, you are about to meet your maker.' ""I begged them to spare my life. I desperately told them that I have two children and my parents have passed away. Don't kill me or my children will become orphans too,"" said Ariful. Writ on Ariful's conviction The bench of Justice Md Ashraful Kamal and Justice Sardar Md Rashed Jahangir has sought a copy of Ariful's conviction upon hearing a writ petition seeking a court order to declare the conviction illegal. The court also fixed today to issue its order in this regard. Advocate Ishrat Hasan and Barrister Syed Sayedul Haque Suman stood for the writ while Deputy Attorney General Debashis Bhattacharyya represented the state. The court also asked the deputy attorney general to phone the Kurigram DC for all the information regarding Saturday's mobile court, to be sent by email before today's hearing. The bench wanted answers to the following queries:  1.   Was the drive conducted by a mobile court or a special taskforce? 2. There are some rules and regulations regarding entering anyone's house at night (from sunset to sunrise). In this case, were these rules followed and what measures were taken? 3. A huge force of 40 people went to the journalist's house to catch him. Did they go there to arrest a wanted terrorist? According to the journalist's wife, 40 to 50 people took part in the raid. Surely, they must have considered the matter to be very important. Why did they consider the matter to be very important? 4. Before conducting any drive, an executive magistrate of a mobile court needs to take notes on the information source. Who informed the mobile court? 5. According to the Mobile Court Act, an incident needs to take place in front of the executive magistrate to warrant action. In this case, what kind of incident took place? Humiliating people nothing new for Nazim Kurigram Senior Assistant Commissioner (Tax) Nazim was accused of humiliating several people in his previous workplaces.   On November 11, 2018, he was transferred from his post as assistant commissioner (land) of Cox's Bazar Sadar upazila to Rangamati's Langadu upazila after a video showing him humiliating an elderly man went viral on social media.  The mobile court raid Around 12:30am on Saturday, a mobile court set up at the Kurigram DC office jailed Ariful Islam for a year, after law enforcement led by two or three magistrates picked him up from his residence. The officials claimed to have recovered drugs and alcohol from the residence. Among the magistrates was Nazim, said Ariful's wife Mostarima Nitu. At least a dozen Ansar members accompanied the magistrates.  ""They did not search the house, nor did they recover any drugs,"" she said, claiming that Ariful is not even a smoker. Journalist Ariful had filed a report about a renovated pond in Kurigram town that was named after the deputy commissioner.

It is the most similar to Earth of any planet discovered by the Kepler space telescope, in terms of its size and estimated temperature Nasa has found an ""intriguing"" planet that could be home to life in old data from a retired space telescope, reports The Independent.  The Earth-sized exoplanet orbits around its star's habitable zone, meaning that the temperature is mild enough to allow a rocky planet to support liquid water. The distant world was discovered when scientists were picking through old observations that came from the Kepler space telescope, which stopped its work in 2018 but provided a vast trove of data from the stars before it did. The planet had previously been discarded by a computer algorithm that misidentified it. But as part of new research, scientists were able to have another look at the information in the Kepler data and see that it really was a previously undiscovered planet. In fact, it is the most similar to Earth of any planet discovered by the Kepler space telescope, in terms of its size and estimated temperature. While other exoplanets may be more similar in size or temperature, no world has been discovered that has quite such a combination of those two qualities, as well as lying in the habitable zone. The planet is 300 light-years from us, just a little larger than our Earth and receives about 75% of the light that we get from our own Sun. That means the temperature could be similar, too, allowing for the conditions required for life. Scientists are concerned, however, that its star is a red dwarf, unlike our own more stable Sun. Such stars are known for throwing out stellar flare-ups that could destroy any potential life before it takes hold on the planet. Scientists now hope to learn more about the planet, including any information about its atmosphere and to get more specific knowledge of its size and conditions."

Shuvo told the visiting journalists that he immersed himself in robotics related subjects from an early age dreaming of making robot one day Shuvo Karmakar is a tenth-grader from Kalupara village in Agoiljhara upazila of Barisal, attending Gaila Secondary High School. He spent about Tk 25,000 to make an artificial intelligence (AI) robot named ""Robin"", that can communicate in both English and Bangla.  The thought of creating Robin came after Shuvo saw robot Sofia.  He made sure the robot could speak Bangla unlike Sophia. The cost of making Robin was much less than Sophia, said Shuvo to local journalists. Shuvo told the visiting journalists that he immersed himself in robotics related subjects from an early age dreaming of making robot one day. So he gathered knowledge about robotics and programming from the internet. He learned that the word 'robot' derived from the Czech word 'robota,' that means forced labour, slave of man, or the machine that can work continuously and spontaneously and would be an alternative for various human activities.    When his friends played outside, he remained home in front of the computer, going from one website to another to learn robotics and programming.  He started to make Robin on May 25, 2018, and it took him about eight months to complete in January 2019, spending around Tk 25,000. The robot was named Robin after a superhero of a cartoon show in the USA.  To make Robin locally and affordably, Shuvo managed to acquire hardware from local shops in Dhaka and Barisal, and from online. After completion, he enriched Robin with several useful features like self-learning and using machine-learning algorithms to process information. It can also tell the names of its maker, and top leaders and officials of the country. A sensor in Robin can detect fire emergencies and send location information to the nearest fire service office via Google Maps. Robin is also a treasure of information for interacting with children to teach them the basics of different subjects. It can also  provide valuable insight to farmers about producing and caring for crops. Shuvo is now working on improving Robin by giving eyesight and movement on legs instead of working on wheels.   ""If I get enough support, I can improve Robin more to reach further heights in the field of robotics, by making a robot even better than Sofia,"" said Shuvo. Shuvo received an award from Dr Dipu Moni on July 5, 2019, and at the National Children's Prize held in 2018.  He was also honoured with an award from Science and Technology Affairs Minister Yeafesh Osman at The National Science and Technology Fair on June 26, 2018, and different prizes from upazila, district, and divisional shows and competitions. Businessman Santosh Karmakar and Dipti Karmakar, father and mother of Shuvo, said he is the older of their two children, and family members are happy and proud of Shuvo.

Tabith said he will take steps to ensure the rights and security of citizens BNP's Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) mayoral candidate, Tabith Awal, on Monday unveiled his manifesto, promising to make Dhaka North a ""world-class modern and smart megacity."" He outlined the promises while unveiling his 173-point manifesto, which was separated into 19 sections, a number of them being repetitive and overlapping, at a press conference held at Emmanuelle's Banquet in Gulshan. While talking to reporters, Tabith said: ""Use of technology has increased everywhere. I want to make Dhaka an 'intelligent city' which is a new trend around the world.  ""I want to use modern technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), to make DNCC a smart city.""  Mentioning BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's present situation, he said: ""Please assist me, support me and stand beside me. I want your empathy. I promise you, I will never betray you. I promise that my thoughts and plans will be modern and for the future, not something backdated.""  Responding to a question on whether he would, if elected, be able to implement his pledges while representing BNP, Tabith said that he would, as he would have the support of the city dwellers on his side. Tabith said that he would also focus on tackling the mosquito menace, curbing air pollution and working on better traffic management, among other things. In his manifesto, he also highlighted the importance of improving the public transport and the waste management system of DNCC, adding that he will reset the running holding taxes by mass hearing.  Tabith also said that, if elected, he will initially have ""rent controllers ""in all the wards of DNCC, so that the house rent rates are fixed through coordination between the house owners and the tenants; every two years a ""rent commission"" will fix the highest and lowest house rent rates in DNCC.  Tabith, in his manifesto, also promised to build at least ten public toilets in every ward of DNCC.  He said that, if elected, he will build three toilets at every main bus stop in Dhaka North for all, including physically challenged people. ""If I get elected as mayor, I will firstly take 60 days work plan for DNCC,"" he added.  Among others, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal President ASM Abdur Rab, Nagarik Oikya Convener Mahmudur Rahman Manna and Gonoshasthaya Kendra founder Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury, were also present during Tabith's manifesto unveiling."

At least 75 people, many of them homeless, have died of exposure to the cold in northern India and Bangladesh during the last three days, news reports said today.
Temperatures plummeted to near freezing, chilling people who have little in the way of clothing or shelter to cope with the brief winter in this normally hot, sunny region.
Forty-four people in Bangladesh have died since Wednesday, newspapers in Dhaka said.
In India during the same period, 20 people have died of the cold in Bihar state, 7 in Uttar Pradesh state and 4 in Gujarat, the Press Trust of India reported.
Although midday temperatures have reached the low 60's, many people are not equipped to cope with temperatures dropping to around 40 at night, even those with shelter.
Most of Bangladesh's people live in houses with mud floors and walls made of thin straw mats. In both countries, the homeless sleep on the ground, with the luckier ones wrapped in blankets."

LEAD: MEATLESS DAYS By Sara Suleri. 186 pp. Illinois: The University of Chicago Press. $17.95.
MEATLESS DAYS By Sara Suleri. 186 pp. Illinois: The University of Chicago Press. $17.95. 
In Pakistan, a common dinner-party conversation finds the guests fantasizing the deconstruction of the state. Ethnic tensions will send the province of Punjab back to India. The southernmost province, Sind, will become the independent Sindhudesh. The Pathans will join their tribesmen in Afghanistan to form Pukhtoonistan, and Pakistani and Iranian Baluchis will create Baluchistan. What's in a name? Pakistan, which in Urdu means ''land of the pure,'' is impure and troubled, a nation divided.
''Meatless Days,'' Sara Suleri's first book, is a parallel exercise in postcolonial partition. Ms. Suleri's territory, though, is the self. In nine autobiographical tales that move easily back and forth among Pakistan, Britain and the United States, Ms. Suleri examines the names that describe her: Pakistani, sister, teacher (of English, at Yale), narrator with two mother tongues, Easterner in passage to the West. In the process she forays lightly into Pakistani history, and deeply into the history of her family and friends.
At the intersection of the two is the author's father, Z. A. Suleri, a prominent political journalist who lobbied hard for Pakistan's formation. His single-minded focus on the drafting of his country's history alienated him from successive Pakistani regimes (which jailed him) and successive children (who left him). The author's mother, Surraya, nee Mair Jones, was a Welsh teacher of English who chose to live with her husband in Pakistan but was never able to apprehend the country's customs; a ''guest in her own name,'' she bore four children and became an observer of almost saintly abstraction. ''Honestly,'' she probably would have murmured, had she seen her students beating up the driver of the motorcycle cab that struck and killed her.
The Suleri women at home in Pakistan, however, make this book sing. Grandmother Dadi's spine is bent, but her will is not. Scuttling about the house ''in the posture of a shrimp,'' she lectures her granddaughters on the evils of the opposite sex ('' 'For men,' said Dadi, shaking the name off her fingertips like some unwanted water, 'live as though they were unsuckled things' ''), and delivers denunciations of Satan while lying atop the dining room table. Ms. Suleri's beautiful sister Ifat sees two men brush their car against the author on a Lahore street - enraged, Ifat forces their car off the road with her own, then rams them repeatedly to the encouraging cheers of onlookers.
Her half sister Nuz has a softer charm: reasoning correctly that ''no one will ever tow or touch anything that looks so forlorn,'' she parks her car by ''gaping'' it, pulling up anywhere she likes and opening trunk, hood and all four doors. Buying chicken for dinner, Nuz has the birds in her net bag before she remembers her housewifely duties: '' 'Are they fresh?' she squawked, clutching at them, 'Can you promise me they're fresh?' The chicken-monger looked at her with some perplexity. 'But Begum Sahib,' he said gently, 'they're alive.' ''
But maybe no good to eat. In ''Meatless Days,'' bad experiences with food often remind the Suleris to expect unpleasant surprises. Milk in the ''land of the pure'' turns out to be ''accidentally diluted'' with kerosene instead of water, and one week there's a dead crow in the drinking water. A bowlful of spicy tamarind sauce ends up on the author's lap rather than in her mouth, scorching ''passageways that as a rule I am only theoretically aware of owning.'' Dreaming that her dead mother is a vanload of frozen meat that must be fitted piece by piece into a coffin, Ms. Suleri steals a knuckle and hides it under her tongue. War with India sunders Bangladesh from Pakistan, Dadi is burned nearly to death in the kitchen, Ifat is killed by a hit-and-run driver and Ms. Suleri herself, working in the United States, finds that her boyfriend will share her bed but is too nervous to have a meal alone with her at home. Something is rotten in the state of nourishment.
Readers looking for pat exoticism should look elsewhere. Like the novelist Anita Desai, whose mother was also European, Ms. Suleri is at home with cultural and linguistic differences, and well able to steer clear of subcontinental cliches. ''Meatless Days,'' like Ihab Hassan's earlier ''Out of Egypt,'' subjects Eastern autobiography to critical method, talking of discourse and context, calling attention to grammar and tense, taking one step back for analysis with every two it takes toward description. At its least compelling, Ms. Suleri's prose doubles back on itself until it collapses in a heap of cerebral metaphors: ''I try to lay the subject down and change its clothes, but before I know it, it has sprinted off evilly in the direction of ocular evidence.''
More often the writing is beautifully constructed and yet a little cold; Sara Suleri expertly paces out the boundaries of her subject without giving the reader the pleasure of getting inside. ''Remember,'' she tells one of her brothers, ''that I've lived many years as an otherness machine.'' It would be nice to see that sentence in the simple past tense. GOOD FOR HYGIENE, BAD FOR CONSERVATION 
 The country was made in 1947, and shortly thereafter the government decided that two days out of each week would be designated as meatless days, in order to conserve the national supply of goats and cattle. Every Tuesday and Wednesday the butchers' shops would stay firmly closed, without a single carcass dangling from the huge metal hooks that lined the canopies under which the butchers squatted, selling meat, and without the open drains at the side of their narrow street ever running with a trace of blood. On days of normal trade, blood would briskly flow, carrying with it flotillas of chicken feathers, and little bits of sinew and entrail, or a bladder full and yellow that a butcher had just bounced deftly into the drain. On meatless days that world emptied into a skeletal remain: the hot sun came to scorch away all the odors and liquids of slaughter and shriveled on the chopping blocks the last curlicues of anything organic, making them look both vacant and precise.
As a principle of hygiene I suppose it was a good idea although it really had very little to do with conservation: the people who could afford to buy meat, after all, were those who could afford refrigeration. From ''Meatless Days.''"

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit India in the first week of October There appears to be a sudden increase in the engagements between Bangladesh and India in many areas of mutual interest. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit India in the first week of October, while the Indian External Affairs Minister is most likely to pay his maiden visit to Bangladesh on August 20-21. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan is now in India to hold meetings with his counterpart Amit Shah. Railways Minister Md Nurul Islam Sujan will conclude his visit to India today (Thursday). After more than eight years, the Water Resources Secretary-level talks will be held today (Thursday) in Dhaka.  These engagements are taking place in a short period of time and there is no scope for anything different, diplomats concerned told Dhaka Tribune. In such broad relations between Dhaka and New Delhi, engagements in different sectors are quite natural, they said.  Prime Minister Hasina will attend the India Economic Summit of the World Economic Forum, 'Innovating for India: Strengthening South Asia, Impacting the World,' to be held in New Delhi on October 3-4, according to multiple government sources. Although she is going to attend a multilateral event, there will be bilateral meetings on the sidelines with Indian leadership . Also Read- PM Hasina to visit India in October At those meetings, Hasina will discuss bilateral issues concerning the Bangladesh-India relationship, including the water sharing of common rivers. Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar is scheduled to arrive in the capital on August 20 on a two-day trip, his first visit since he was appointed following the formation of the new Indian government led by Narendra Modi.  As this visit will be his first, it is unlikely to have any substantial outcome. Both sides will just touch upon pending issues and talk about ways to find solutions, and will explore new areas of cooperation. The timeframe for the prime minister's visit will be finalised during his visit. Home minister Khan was due to hold bilateral meetings with his Indian counterpart Amit Shah, also president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, at 7:30pm (Bangladesh time) on Wednesday, said a Bangladesh High Commission official in Delhi. The meeting was scheduled to take place in New Delhi at 4:30pm (Bangladesh time), but was delayed due to the death of former Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, he said, adding that the meeting was due to end at around 9:30pm followed by dinner. According to the agenda, the meeting would discuss issues related to putting a halt to the killing of innocent Bangladeshis along the border by the Indian Border Security Force, the smuggling of drugs, human trafficking, and militancy and terrorism, as these are common problems for both neighbours, said a senior official. About the national register of citizens (NRC) in Assam, he said the agenda doesn't list the issue, but if the issue is raised, Bangladesh will put forward its arguments emphasising that it's an internal affair of India. ""We are prepared (regarding NRC),"" he added. A Bangladeshi delegation, led by Railways Minister Sujan, discussed the ongoing railway projects under an Indian line of credit, including the expedited supply of 10 broad gauge and 10 metre gauge locomotives under Indian grants, and other issues. The delegation visiting India from August 3 to August 8, has also gathered experience on Indian railway's catering, ticketing, and operation of trains.  The first Water Resources Secretary-level meeting in more than eight and a half years will take place on Thursday at state guest house Meghna. Both sides will discuss various issues concerning 54 common rivers spanning the two countries, according to a top Water Resources Ministry official. ""Since the issue of the Teesta water sharing agreement is now at the prime minister level, we will not discuss it in detail. But obviously, we will touch upon it,"" he said, adding: ""We will place emphasis on other common rivers which are important too."""

MIDNIGHT, a canal near Alligator Alley in the preserve adjacent to Everglades National Park in southern Florida. The chairman of the Tribal Council of the Seminoles, James E. Billie, perched high above the hull at the controls of the airboat, touched a switch and a beam of light sprang from the band encircling his wide brow. He pointed a visitor into a seat in the prow. An airplane engine and propeller contained in concentric steel circles eight feet in diameter formed an imposing backdrop.
''Hang on and don't let go,'' he warned. In seconds the boat was skimming across the tar-black channel at 45 miles an hour, past literally hundreds of gold-gleaming alligator eyes. Negotiating narrow sloughs, accelerating over sawgrass hummocks, gliding through shallow water, stopping on a dime: Mr. Billie's reputation as an ace pilot of both watercraft and aircraft was not exaggerated. Nor was his skill as a frog catcher.
Zooming alongside each tiny prey, discernible only by the emerald of its eyes, Mr. Billie plucked it from the canal with a flick of the wrist, unerringly pinioning it with a long four-pronged pole, a gig, the frogger's traditional tool.
Frog hunting is becoming rare in the Everglades, a vanishing wetland that represents the last bastion of the Florida panther (population less than 50) and other endangered species, along with the Seminole Indians (population 1,700), the Independent Seminole (50 to 75 people) and Miccosukee Indians (300).
''No one can really make a living catching frogs any more,'' Mr. Billie said. ''This is still the only way to get them, one at a time in the middle of the night. It takes too much time and energy and isn't well paid.'' The primary domestic source of edible frogs is the Everglades, but most of the legs consumed in America are imported.
Beginning in the 1940's real-estate developers, citrus growers, cattle ranchers and produce farmers encouraged the diking and draining of most of Florida's frog country, according to Foster Crippen, owner of the Frogleg Ranch, the major Florida supplier of frogs' legs. ''Compared to cattlemen - sales, profits, net worth - froggers are nothin','' he said.
''That's the truth. And compared to real estate, we're double nothin'.''
From November through February, when water levels are up in the Southeast, the Frogleg Ranch ships 500 to 2,000 pounds of legs a day, primarily to restaurants in Florida, though some also go to Louisiana, Illinois, Texas, New York, Michigan and California. Frogs' legs are sold in nine sizes, ranging from a hefty two pairs per pound to a minuscule 25, which, Mr. Crippen said, go to Detroit to be deep-fried, bones and all, for sandwiches. In the off-season he ships 100 to 300 pounds a day.
If these numbers sound substantial, consider that in the 1930's there were 23 frog farms in southern Florida.
''And I guess we'll be the last, since we're the only one left,'' said Mr. Crippen, who has been in the business for close to 25 years.
Dr. Dudley Culley, a professor of fisheries at the School of Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries at Louisiana State University and the author of numerous works on frog farming, said little chance of cultivation exists in the United States, mainly because pesticides have reduced the number of insects, frogs' primary food.
''Add to that the fact that they are extremely vulnerable to many diseases and that they require live food,'' Dr. Culley said. The situation, however, is not hopeless. Dr. Culley noted: ''Frog people are strange. We get hung up on frogs and can't stop.'' One such dauntless frog person is Bill Seefeldt, owner of Life Cycles Research Company. At his 10-acre ranch in Dade County, Fla., Mr. Seefeldt, a self-taught ''practical geneticist with endless curiosity, not a marketing man,'' raises fish, frogs, turtles, geese, plants, insects and more. Frogs, however, are his true love. ''My first pet in school was a tadpole,'' he explained.
''Because frogs in captivity present so many breeding problems,'' he continued, ''95 percent of eating frogs are caught in the wild - in Africa, India, Bangladesh, China or the United States.''
The Federal Government does not collect any statistics on domestic frog production or consumption. The only figures it collects are on imports. Most of the frog-eating world (West Germany and France are foremost consumers) prefers bullfrogs, but these don't last in the Everglades.
''They're territorial,'' Mr. Seefeldt explained. ''They just sit and croak in one spot even if it takes a year to find a mate, which makes them perfect edible targets. And they're poorly designed aerodynamically. They have these fat faces. Alligators and snakes nail 'em in a millisecond.'' Through unscientific tastings, Mr. Seefeldt has determined that many Americans love frog meat - it's the idea of the feet they can't stand. So over the last 15 years he has developed a species of meaty, farm-raised albino bullfrogs with small heads and long legs. Mr. Seefeldt plans to have them ready for market by 1990.
Diners who think of frogs' legs as a specialty of fine French restaurants may be surprised to find that in the Florida national park area they appear in many restaurants that are cozy, down-home, gas-station simple - or just plain ratty. Generally deep-fried, the mild-tasting meat may appear as the ''Everglades Special'' or ''Jumper Plate'' - as at the Coopertown Restaurant, where locals and tourists drop in. More a shack with a lunch counter and tables than a restaurant, the place was built in 1945 at the edge of Highway 41 (the Tamiami Trail), a hot, flat strip where turkey buzzards circle overhead.
Sally Kennon, the owner and cook, receives fresh frogs' legs early each day from her regular froggers. She coats the legs with eggs blended with what she calls her ''secret seasoning mix,'' dips them in bread crumbs, fries them until they turn crunchy, and serves them from 8 A.M. until dark at $6.95 a plate.Nearby, the Miccosukee Village
Restaurant, an airy coffee shop, features an Everglades Frog Legs Dinner ($10.95) in which the legs are coated in plain flour and fried.
By contrast, only a few luxurious restaurants in Miami Beach, Boca Raton and other south Florida cities serve frogs' legs, usually in the classic French style with garlic, or with a few contemporary twists. The Down Under in Fort Lauderdale, for example, for $18 offers a choice of frogs' legs with mushrooms and green peppercorns; with buttery basil sauce atop tomato linguine, or poached, boned, chilled and arrayed on a salad of barley, cucumbers and tomatoes with lemon and cilantro.
If the small size of the domestic frog harvest is a problem, importing frogs' legs is an unpredictable business at best, since sources, supplies and prices vary dramatically from season to season. Of the 1,389,734 pounds of fresh, chilled and frozen frogs' legs imported into the United States from January though May this year, 1,261,596 pounds came from Bangladesh. The remainder, in order of volume, came from reshippers in the Netherlands, and from India, Thailand, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.On July 7, however, The Journal of
Commerce reported that ''Bangladesh, which supplied 76 percent of the delicacy consumed in the United States last year, has joined India and China to ban frog leg exports for the next three years.'' The ban was instituted in May because the Bangladesh insect population had exploded after large numbers of frogs were killed for their legs. Insecticides are costly, as well as toxic to the remaining frogs. Moreover, as nations industrialize, few workers are willing to undertake the laborious job of hunting frogs in the dark for little money.
Dr. Culley of Louisiana State University said he had assisted in the recent establishment of a frog farm in Belem, Brazil that raised 700,000 bullfrogs in 1987. But since frogs' legs are popular among Brazilians, ''There isn't much incentive for the Brazilians to send the frogs out of the country,'' Dr. Culley said. He also noted that the market for frogs to be used in research is more profitable than that for frogs' legs.
Although frozen frogs' legs are still being shipped from warehouses in Bangladesh, they are in short supply.
Prices have risen, but may not go higher, since the demand in this country is not enough to support such an increase. Those who are fond of frogs' legs, it seems, must either stock up, visit Europe, Asia or the Everglades, or prepare for a dry spell. Fried Frogs' Legs (Adapted from the Miccosukee Village Restaurant) Preparation time: 5 minutes Cooking time: 10 minutes 1 cup vegetable oil 1 cup self-rising flour 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste 1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper, or to taste 1 cup milk 16 pairs frogs' legs, about 2 ounces each. 
1.Heat the oil in a wide skillet or electric skillet to 375 degrees. 
2.Blend together the flour, salt and red pepper in a shallow bowl. Place the milk in a large bowl. Rinse the frogs' legs in water and dry them. Dip into milk, then into flour to coat rather heavily. Place on wax paper. 
3.Slip eight pairs of frogs' legs into the hot oil. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Turn and fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes longer. 
4.Transfer to a baking sheet covered with paper towels. Set in a very low oven. Dip, coat and fry the remaining legs.

1.Soak the frogs' legs in milk 1 hour or more, refrigerated. 
2.Heat 1/2 tablespoon oil and 1 tablespoon butter in an 11-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat. Add mushrooms and toss over high heat until golden, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate; add salt and pepper. 
3.Drain and dry the legs thoroughly. Toss four pairs at a time in a paper bag with the flour and salt, until coated well. Tap off the excess. Repeat with the remaining legs. 
4.Add the remaining butter and oil to the pan and melt over moderate heat. Add the frogs' legs (they should fit easily in one layer; if not, divide into two batches). Brown on both sides over moderate heat, 5 to 8 minutes total. Transfer to a serving dish in a warm oven. 
5.Pour any fat from the pan. Add the peppercorns, wine and lemon juice to the pan. Bring to a boil, stirring. Boil until a bit syrupy, or reduced to about 2 tablespoons. Add the mushrooms and toss to heat through. Pour over the legs and serve hot. 
Yield: 2 servings. FINDING THEM 
FROGS' legs vary widely in size. For most recipes, allow four pairs of legs, 1 1/2 to 2 ounces each, per serving. Because of the size variation, cooking times may have to be adjusted. For deep-frying, the legs need to swim freely in the oil, which means making adjustments there too.
Although supplies of frogs' legs vary, the stores listed here, all in New York City, report that they often have them. If the legs are frozen, as is usually the case, defrost them in the refrigerator for about 48 hours before rinsing, drying and cooking.

Parents may be joking on social media about their childcare hell as more and more countries go into lockdown with the coronavirus.  But child protection professionals are not laughing. They have real worries about the risks with families locked up 24/7 together for an indefinite period. ""You will no doubt want to throw your children out the window at some point. That's normal,"" psychologist Moira Mikolajczak told AFP. ""What isn't normal, is to do that,"" she warned, as she urged parents to give themselves a break and ""not try to be Superman or Superwoman"". While governments across Europe from Ireland to Greece have been having schools send lessons and activity ideas by email to occupy bored children, social media is full of testimony from parents frazzled at having to be both teacher and playmate to their kids. Grassroots groups, however, are trying to step into the gap with the French feminist collective #NousToutes (""All of Us""), which campaigns against domestic violence, mobilizing with WhatsApp support groups and practical tips on how ""not to blow your top.""  ""Being locked down gives us the chance to spend lots and lots of time with our children,"" the group said, tongue ever so slightly in cheek. But when ""we have to work from home and we are all stuck together in a small space, tensions can escalate."" 'Step away!' Its WhatsApp groups already have 4,000 members dispensing support and tips on how to stay zen. First among them is ""step away when you feel the tension mount (even if that means locking the toilet door)."" Parents should also watch funny videos with their children, ""and program in 'off' times when you can be on your own... while someone else looks after the children.""  The main thing is to try to avoid ""words or gestures... that can hurt and wound... because we can behave in ways that we will regret immediately."" Mother-of-three Sarah, whose kids range in age from seven to just two months, is ""staying relaxed"" so far. ""Yesterday I took an hour for myself in my room, without a child hanging from me, and I did a meditation session via Instagram,"" the Parisian told AFP.  ""It's going OK, but it's worrying for the long haul,"" she said as France neared the end of its first week in total lockdown. If it is tough for the parents, it's no walk in the park for the children either - they too have been ordered home across large swathes of Europe and now in parts of the US. ""When we got into the living room when Mummy is working, there can be arguments,"" said 10-year-old Estheban. ""I am having to be a mother, a teacher, a cook, a cleaner and do my job as an executive in a bank from home at the same time,"" said Virginie, who has two sons aged 11 and six. While most parents will cope, said Mikolajczak, Professor of Emotion and Health Psychology at the University of Louvain in Belgium, some will not. ""We can predict increases in parental burnout,"" she said, and sometimes there could even be ""neglect and violence."" 'Relax the rules' Governments have the same worry, with the French children's ministry warning of a ""higher risk of mistreatment... and since it will be happening at home, it will be hard to spot."" ""Stay at home parents are more vulnerable to burnout,"" Mikolajczak said, an effect likely to be exacerbated by the fact they are there against their will. ""Western families are also not used to living on top of each other,"" she added. Added to which families can no longer turn ""to grandparents for help nor go out"" somewhere to blow off steam. Mikolajczak said structuring the children's day can really help with moments when they will play or work on their own.  And she urged parents to ""be flexible and not afraid to relax some rules"". ""Let it go,"" said Etienne, the father of two girls aged 10 and six, who has adopted the refrain from Disney's film ""Frozen"" to get him through the crisis. In these exceptional times you cannot juggle everything, he said. ""At the beginning when the schools closed, I put myself under pressure. I didn't know what to do. I had no time for myself nor the kids. ""Then the penny dropped. I stopped working and since then it's going a lot better,"" he said."

Sultana Pervin came under fire after approving a questionable mobile court raid at Ariful Islam's home The government has appointed a new deputy commissioner (DC) in Kurigram district, removing Sultana Pervin. She came under fire following the questionable arrest, incarceration, and torture of Dhaka Tribune journalist Ariful Islam by a mobile court raid she approved. A circular from the Ministry of Public Administration announcing Sultana's removal from the post and attachment to the ministry was issued on Monday. Another circular, issued on Monday, said Mohammad Rezaul Karim, deputy secretary of the ministry, will replace Sultana as the new Kurigram DC and district magistrate. The ministry has also withdrawn three executive magistrates from Kurigram connected to the incident, by issuing another circular. The officials are - Senior Assistant Commissioner Nazim Uddin, and assistant commissioners Rintu Bikash Chakma, and SM Rahatul Islam of Kurigram. All three orders were effective immediately, said the circulars. Meanwhile, State Minister for Public Administration, Farhad Hossain, told Dhaka Tribune: ""There are allegations against them [the four commissioners] and they have been made officers on special duty [OSD]. ""We will initiate divisional inquiry, and punitive action will be taken against them if they are found guilty after investigation,"" he added. However, the High Court on Monday asked state lawyer, Deputy Attorney General Debashis Bhattacharyya, to collect and submit all documents related to Ariful's conviction and bail by March 23. The bench of Justice Md Ashraful Kamal and Justice Sardar Md Rashed Jahangir issued the order on Monday. Supreme Court Bar Association President, advocate AM Amin Uddin, and advocate Ishrat Hasan with Barrister Syed Sayedul Haque Suman, stood for the writ. During the hearing, the court made a comment stating that a single person does not represent the whole country. The state will not take responsibility for someone's mistake. On Sunday, the High Court ordered the state to submit before it a copy of the conviction and one-year imprisonment sentence of the journalist, issued by a mobile court. During the hearing, the bench also asked the state to respond to some questions over the mobile court's judgment. Responding to a question about whether the drive was conducted by a mobile court or a special taskforce, the state lawyer informed the court that it was a special taskforce and there were 13 people including six from police, five from Ansar battalion, one from the department of narcotics, and one executive magistrate. The drive was conducted around 11:45pm of March 13, 2020, and they found 450ml of local liquor and 100gm of cannabis, with a price of approximately TK150 and Tk1,000 respectively, the DAG informed the court. The DAG told the court that everything was done by law. Advocate Amin Uddin said to the court that a mobile court cannot hand out punishment this way. Mobile courts are appreciated and operations of all mobile courts are not being questioned, he said. Drawing an example of an abuse of power, he said a mobile court had punished a teacher earlier by asking him to ""perform squats holding his ears"" at an examination hall for using a mobile phone. Over the Kurigram incident, the lawyer mentioned that this too was an abuse of power. The way the mobile court operated has proven a mala fide intent. ""One can hand out punishment if a journalist commits an offence, but not in this way."" The senior lawyer also appraised the role of the media in the country. The court asked the lawyer to bring in journalist Ariful as petitioner if possible and told the state lawyer that there is a gray area regarding how bail was granted to the journalist. Earlier on Sunday, advocate Ishrat Hasan filed the petition on behalf of online news portal Bangla Tribune's Executive Editor, Harun-Ur-Rashid. On March 14, Ariful Islam, Kurigram district correspondent of Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune , was sent to one-year in jail, soon after the mobile court, set up at the Kurigram DC's office, ended the trial proceedings. The mobile court in the dead of night jailed the journalist for a year, after law enforcement led by magistrates picked him up from his home in Kurigram town. The mobile court brought an allegation against the journalist that drugs and alcohol were recovered from his possession, which his family termed absurd. DC's comments contradictory with documents The Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sultana Parvin on March 14 told Dhaka Tribune that a task force was set up to apprehend the journalist as a routine drive against narcotics.  However, her comments in the documents, placed before the court by the state lawyer, contradict that statement. In the witness record, one of the witnesses, Md Arif, stated that Ariful was apprehended by mobile court and the task force while he was drinking liquor and smoking cannabis. Meanwhile countrywide processions were organized by journalists and civil society to seek justice and protest the abuse of power and torture of journalists. They were held in Comilla, Khulna, Natore, Nilphamari, Jhalakati, Joypurhat, Naogaon, Narsingdi, Thakurgaon, Rangpur, Netrokona, Sirajganj and Tangail, according to our correspondents. Our district correspondents Masud Alam, Comilla, Hedait Hossain Molla, Khulna, contributed to this report."

At least 38 people have so far been rescued from the rubble of the 80-room Xinjia hotel in coastal Quanzhou city Around 70 people were trapped after the collapse of a hotel used as a coronavirus quarantine facility in eastern China on Saturday evening, officials said.  At least 38 people have so far been rescued from the rubble of the 80-room Xinjia hotel in coastal Quanzhou city, said the local government. Footage circulating on microblogging platform Weibo showed rescue workers combing through the building's wreckage in the dark and reassuring a woman trapped under heavy debris as other wounded victims were carried into ambulances. The hotel's facade appeared to have crumbled into the ground, exposing the building's steel frame, and a crowd had gathered around the area as the evening wore on. Officials have yet to confirm whether anyone died in the accident. Quanzhou authorities said over 700 rescue workers had been deployed to the scene along with ambulances, excavators and cranes.  Representatives from Beijing are also en route to Quanzhou to assist in relief efforts, Xinhua news agency reported. Quanzhou has recorded 47 cases of the COVID-19 infection and the hotel, which opened just two years ago, was recently repurposed to house people who had been in recent contact with confirmed patients, the People's Daily state newspaper reported. China is no stranger to building collapses and deadly construction accidents, which are typically blamed on the country's rapid growth leading to corner-cutting by builders and the widespread flouting of safety rules. At least 20 people died in 2016 when a series of crudely-constructed multi-storey buildings packed with migrant workers collapsed in the eastern city of Wenzhou. Another 10 were killed last year in Shanghai after the collapse of a commercial building during renovations."

40% of expatriate employees stuck in China; Robots to be used in Padma bridge works  Chinese companies working in Bangladesh are worried about not being able to meet deadlines of the development projects, including several mega projects, that they are implementing in Bangladesh. Many of the projects are at risk of failing to maintain respective deadlines as around 40% of Chinese staff working in Bangladeshi projects have been stuck in China for more than a month. This includes staff who are currently at the coronavirus epidemic centre in China, none of whom are allowed to leave. According to the Chinese Enterprises Association in Bangladesh (CEAB), more than 15,000 Chinese staff members, under 400 companies, are involved in development programs in Bangladesh. CEAB Vice President Ke Changliang told the Dhaka Tribune that around 6000 Chinese staff could not return to Bangladesh because of the outbreak, resulting in slow progress in the development works. On February 2, Bangladesh suspended visa on arrival for Chinese citizens indefinitely amidst the coronavirus epidemic. The China government now wants the suspension to be withdrawn as the situation has almost been brought under control in China. Otherwise, meeting the deadlines for completion of development projects will be a challenge, suspects Chinese officials. Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming on Wednesday urged Bangladesh to withdraw the suspension as soon as possible. During a press briefing held at Padma Bridge Rail Link Project office in Dhaka's Keraniganj, Li said around 95% of the spreading of the virus is now happening from other countries as China has almost controlled the outbreak of the disease. ""Up to now, no Chinese national here and no Bangladesh national here or in China have been infected by the coronavirus,"" he added. According to CEAB, the total amount of investment in Bangladesh contributed by China is nearly $10 billion which created job opportunities for more than 100,000 people in Bangladesh. But these efforts have been negatively impacted due to the COVID-19 epidemic, a global health emergency. Bangladesh government may soon adopt stricter health and quarantine measures on equipment and materials imported from China. Moreover, the application of more rigorous public health regulations on Chinese employees working in Bangladesh, such as medical examination, will make it harder for them to obtain work permits. Ke Changliang said: ""All of these issues have caused certain distress to normal production speed and operation of Chinese enterprises in Bangladesh."" ""Despite the internal and external challenges, all Chinese companies, especially contractors like CREC, Power China, CCCC, and CCECC, are doing their best to maintain workflow to avoid the suspension of the projects,"" he said at the press briefing. Importing robots for Padma Bridge construction work Although 86% of the construction work is already done, completion of the Padma Bridge project by June 2021 has become a challenge as importing the materials from China remains almost closed since the coronavirus outbreak began. Despite the outbreak currently being under control,  business entities are not in full operation in China yet, creating a shortage of material. China Major Bridge Engineering Company (CMBE) executing Padma Bridge project and China Railway Group Limited (CREC) implementing Padma Bridge Rail Link Project are looking for alternative ways to tackle this situation. These include importing four robots from China and training the local people for specialized tasks. Liu Jianhua, director of Padma Bridge project said: ""We are trying to import four robots for strengthening the execution and to deal with the shortage of manpower."" Wang Kun, director of Padma Bridge Rail Link Project said: ""To ensure continuity of work, we are trying our best to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus."""

Parents dream of financial security, advancement  Unable to bear the cost of their children's education, many parents push them into work in the transport sector with dreams of financial security and advancement, employers, transport leaders and experts told Dhaka Tribune. While visiting the Amin Bazar, Gabtoli, Mohammadpur, Sutrapur, Jatrabari and Kachpur areas, it was seen that a significant number of children were employed on human haulers, as well as in automobile workshops and battery recharging shops. The employers claimed the children were employed as per the wishes of their parents.  Md Bulu, owner of Janani Engineering Workshop in Gabtoli, said although a number of children and teenagers were employed at the workshop, they were all well taken care of and trained in the necessary skills to succeed in the industry. ""Children who leave the workshop in search of better earnings often go astray and fall into drug addiction,"" he added. Meanwhile, a workshop owner in Amin Bazar and another in Sutrapur urged the government to set up a mechanism to measure and certify the skills of children trained in the workshops, to ease their progress in the industry. Challenges to addressing child labour in transport sector Experts said the informal nature of the transport sector made it difficult for the government to bring discipline to it. The Labour Act prohibits employing children under the age of 14 in hazardous work, but the act is not applicable for the informal sector. Save the Children Director (Child Rights Governance and Child Protection) Abdullah Al Mamun said listing the names of child labours would help monitor the rate of enrolment of children in the transport sector. He also said that among the 38 types of child labour categorized as hazardous, the transport sector offers some of the highest salaries. Education and Development Foundation (EDUCO) specialist (child labour) Afzal Kabir Khan said money was not the only reason many children were employed in the transport sector.   A number of parents push their children into child labour as they are unable to monitor them properly owing to their own jobs, he added. ""Many parents tell employers they cannot take care of their children as they both have jobs, and they wish for a successful person to take care of them so that they do not end up committing crimes and become addicted to drugs,"" Afzal said, mentioning that the parents harbour hopes of their children's quick advancement in life and starting their own business. During a presentation in April this year, INCIDIN Bangladesh Executive Director AKM Masud Ali said many boys were dropping out of school to join the workforce, as their parents were unable to bear the cost of education. The current state of child labour in Bangladesh Comparing data on child labour in the country in 2003 and 2013, from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and International Labour Organization (ILO) Bangladesh, Bangladesh Shishu Adhikar Forum (BSAF) said the number of child labourers decreased from 4.7 million to 1.7 million. However, the number of children employed in hazardous work only decreased from 1.3 million to 1.2 million over the same period.   Experts and transport workers said a number of initiatives to address child labour were taken after the first survey in 2003, but political turmoil from 2005-2008 hampered the initiatives.  The Awami League government once again prioritized child rights after coming to power in 2009, bringing significant improvement until 2013. However, the initiatives appear to have had little impact on the numbers of children in hazardous work, the experts added. Subsequently, the government made a list of 38 categories of hazardous work. Transport sector related work on the list includes truck, three-wheeler, and bus helpers, as well as automobile workshop and battery recharging shop workers. Although the categories have been made, the country is yet to collect data on how many children are employed in each category of hazardous work. BSAF said surveys show that about 25.4% of child labours work in transportation. Experts also said the number of underage bus helpers has decreased over time, and most child labourers are employed on three-wheelers and in workshops. Political willingness crucial to preventing child labour in transport sector EDUCO specialist Afzal Kabir Khan said the government has taken a number of initiatives to reduce child labour, but few of them were targeted at the transport sector. Save the Children's Abdullah Al Mamun said political willingness is crucial to preventing child labour in the transport sector, and some of the government's activities had raised questions over they had effectively rectified the convention related to minimum working age. The country has ratified 33 conventions related to child labour.  Mamun said the government has made education compulsory until grade 8, but a surprisingly large number of children still dropout before this point. A large number of them go into work in the transport sector. ""If the government can ensure that no one drops out before the age of 14 and implements courses on ICT training, the problem could have a good solution,"" he said, mentioning that children may be more eager to receive ICT training than traditional vocational training such as livestock rearing.  EDUCO specialist Afzal Kabir Khan said a special social safety net program is needed for child labourers.    Meanwhile, BSAF Director Abdus Sahid Mahmood pointed out that a lack of monitoring mechanisms and government willingness is making the child labour situation worse. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Chairman Kazi Reazul haque said monitoring child labour is a complex issue, and suggested the government form a Child Directorate to coordinate between government institutions and address child labour. The government reiterated its promise to eliminate child labour from the country by 2025 when adopting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). According to the law, a court can slap a maximum Tk5,000 fine on the employer and maximum Tk1,000 fine on parents for child employment.   The National Child Policy 2011 called for ensuring a child friendly environment at workplaces. Furthermore, it said that the cost of treatment from any accident at the workplace would be borne by the employers. "

A statement issued by the Chief Minister Office said the victims had attended the three-day religious congregation and contracted Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The state government said two had died while undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad, one each in Apollo Hospital and Global Hospital. Two other deaths were reported from Nizamabad and Gadwal.

Experts are hopeful, but cannot attest the long term effects of the project Bangladesh and India will both benefit from the opening of the Farakka barrage, as it will be favorable for ilish fish in general, said sector experts. India has redesigned a navigation lock at the Farakka barrage on the Ganges to ensure the smooth and safe migration of ilish during their three-month spawning season. This lock has now been redesigned to ensure the smooth and safe migration of ilish shoals during their mating season. A navigation lock is a device used to raise and lower boats and ships between stretches of water on a river. Inland Waterway Authority of India Vice-Chairman Pravir Pandey said the barrage gates will remain open for only eight metres between 1am and 5am each day, the preferred time when the ilish seek passage. The tentative completion date of the project is in June. Professor Monirul Islam of the Department of Fisheries at University of Dhaka said: ""It is important to note at which season India is going to open the barrage. In mating season it is forbidden to catch ilish in Bangladesh. If India opens the barrage at that time, then Bangladesh will suffer the consequences."" ""It seems to me that India is doing this project experimentally. If this works out and India gets more ilish, then perhaps they will realize the value of cooperating with Bangladesh, and that it is wrong to block river flow,"" he added. Also Read- India to open Farakka for illish migration He said there is still a possibility that India might block the barrage after the ilish are on their side, but it would not do them much good. Ilish is a fish of the sea; after releasing eggs in the river, they will return to the sea. If that is blocked, the fish will not release any more eggs. Sector experts have said factors such as pollution, unplanned river islands and water politics may contribute to lessening the ilish population. However, not all experts are skeptical. Dr Md Niamul Naser, an ilish researcher from Department of Zoology at University of Dhaka, is viewing this as a positive turn of events. He said: ""The illish need the flow of water. If there is proper current in the river, the fish will be able to go as far as Rajshahi."" ""Meghna has enough flow right now. If there is enough flow in Teesta, Surma and Kushiyara rivers, then there will be no issues. It is not as if it will be bad for Bangladesh if India gets ilish,"" he said. Department of Fisheries Deputy Director Dr Zillur, who is in charge of the Aquaculture Branch, said: ""We do not think Bangladesh will face any problems from this project. If the fish traverse the water bodies, then both countries will benefit from it."" ""However, I cannot attest to the long-term effects of this project. Ilish is a natural resource; no single country owns them. They should be able to migrate in the way that is natural for them."" When asked about the potential effects of India's project on Bangladesh, Department of Fisheries Director (Scientific Research and Fisheries Survey) Dr Monowar Hossain said: ""If the water flow is improved, then both countries will benefit from the project. Bangladesh will have no issues regarding ilish breeding."""

The amount was 3,448 tons in 2016, 3972 tons in 2017 and 5,080 tons in 2018 Ilish catch in Shariatpur has increased substantially over the last couple of years thanks to the government's efforts, including its ban on catching brood and mother Ilish. Last year (2019 calendar year) fishermen netted 5,240 tons of Ilish, a 61.72% rise from 3,240 tons in 2015, according to the local office of the Department of Fisheries (DoF). The amount was 3,448 tons in 2016, 3972 tons in 2017 and 5,080 tons in 2018, it said. Shariatpur Fisheries Officer Abdur Rouf said that they worked hard for protecting the brood and mother Ilish during the reproductive season following the instruction of the prime minister and the ministry concerned. The district administration helped them a lot, he said. This increase is the outcome of the government plan, he said and added that the procurement of Ilish there was increasing every year.  Local fishery officials said the drive against netting mother Ilish was the main reason behind the success. Last year 1,366 people were panelized in 293 such drives, they informed. According to the DoF, fishermen catch Ilish in  a 69-kilometre area (covering 15,840 hectares of land) of the Padma and the Meghna rivers in Shariatpur.  About 16,355 people are directly involved with Ilish catching, said the DoF. Sirajul Islam, 45, catches Ilish fish in the Padma river. He said that the increased catch of Ilish brought smiles to the fishermen there. ""I experienced huge catches of Ilish in the region when I was young. But the availability of the fish was declining gradually with the passage of time,"" Shirazul said. ""However, the decline in production saw a u-turn and started to rise in the last couple of years,"" he said and added that it became possible due to the strict policy of the government. The fisherman said that they were getting good prices in the market for their catches.  Manik Hossain, an Ilish trader, said the increased production of Ilish raised the income of traders and fishermen and helped them overcome existing financial crisis. The Ilish netting season starts from July and continues until October. The authorities oversee and protect netting of brood Ilish between November to June.  March and April are the banned months for catching any kind of fishes in  20 kilometres of Shariatpur region, as it is the reproductive period for the Ilish.  During the banned period, the government helps the fishermen by providing 20-30 kg of rice to each of them."

434,"A.T.&T. Plans 1.3% Rise In Long-Distance Rates
1989-11-17T05:00:00.000Z
Eight months after the Government approved a method for setting long-distance rates that was expected to lower consumers' telephone bills, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company said yesterday that it would raise prices on domestic long-distance service.
A.T.&T. said it planned to raise its rates for night and weekend calling an average of 1.3 percent on Nov. 29. The increase will raise about $34 million a year, it said, and cost customers 3 cents a month on an average residential telephone bill. Night and weekend calls are made between 11 P.M. and 8 A.M. weekdays, all day Saturday and until 5 P.M. Sunday.
Although the rate increase is relatively small, consumer advocates said it could spell an end to the trend toward declining long-distance rates and might also set a precedent for A.T.&T. to put sudden rate increases into effect. New Regulatory Format
A.T.&T. said the rate increase is allowed under the regulatory change approved by the Federal Communications Commission in March. That permitted the company to set its own prices for long-distance services within certain ceilings and floors prescribed by the agency.
The new regulatory format allows A.T.&T. to change its rates on 14 days' notice, instead of the 45 days required under the commission's previous form of regulation, which was known as the rate-of-return approach and limited A.T.&T.'s profit from its long-distance business.
The price caps allow A.T.&T. unlimited earnings from long-distance and give the company incentives to cut costs, the F.C.C. said; the floors prevent it from undercutting competitors.
The No. 2 and No. 3 long-distance companies, the MCI Communications Corporation and the U S Sprint Communications Company, respectively, are not subject to F.C.C. regulation and have generally offered long-distance service at rates slightly below those of A.T.& T. Rates Rising to Ceiling A.T.&T. said the price increase announced yesterday would bring night and weekend rates for residential consumers up to the ceiling of allowable rates. It said current long-distance rates were sharply lower than they would be under rate-of-return regulation.
A.T.&T. said yesterday that its rates for business customers were priced at about 95 percent of the maximum allowed by the commission.
David Wagenhauser, a spokesman for the Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a Washington consumer group, said the rate increase showed that A.T.& T. planned to keep rates for residential customers ''at the maximum'' while it offered business customers discounts.
''It's Wall Street and not Main Street U.S.A. that is seeing the benefits of price caps,'' Mr. Wagenhauser said. ''This is just a signal of who will bear the brunt of the new system.''
When the change in regulation took effect in June, residential long-distance rates dropped $97 million. They later fell an additional $48.8 million when the regional phone companies reduced the rates they charge long-distance carriers for connecting to their networks. F.T.C. Statement
''The commission is never happy to see a rate increase of any kind and we will review it and makes sure that it complies with the established rules of the price cap system,'' said Richard Firestone, chief of the F.C.C.'s common carrier bureau. ''People should understand that this rate increase is just part of the system, and we fully anticipate that there will be future decreases in rates over time.''
The F.C.C. has said the new price-cap system will reduce long-distance bills by $900 million in the next four years, with $700 million going to residential customers and $200 million to businesses.
A.T.&T. also said it planned both to raise and lower its rates for international calling, depending on the country called. Calls to Rumania, Suriname and Macao would increase 20 percent; calls to India would drop to $4.20 from $4.50 for the first minute and to $2.04 from $2.77 for each additional minute, and calls to Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal would drop to $4.45 from $4.90 for the first minute. The new international rates become effective Dec. 30."

Kuwait's cabinet also decided to extend a suspension of government and private agencies for two weeks The government of Kuwait imposed a nationwide curfew on Sunday starting from 14:00 GMT and running until 1:00 GMT to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, state news agency KUNA said, citing the cabinet. Kuwait, which went into virtual lockdown on Thursday, has taken some of the most drastic steps in the region to curb the virus' spread. The Gulf Arab country, which has reported 176 cases of the virus, said violators of the curfew could face up to three years in jail or fines of up to $32,157. The Kuwait National Guard will aid police in imposing the curfew. The decision was made due to ""some manifestations of non-compliance with precautionary measures,"" Deputy Prime Minister Anas al-Saleh said, according to KUNA. Kuwait's cabinet also decided to extend a suspension of government and private agencies for two weeks. It had already announced on Thursday an extension to a suspension of schools and universities until Aug. 4 - the first among its neighbours to impose such lengthy education closures to limit the spread of the sometimes deadly disease. After a late-night cabinet meeting on Saturday, the minister of trade and industry said the country's strategic food reserves were ""secure and plentiful"", KUNA said. He urged people not to stockpile food and said there was no need to panic. Last week, the cabinet approved a bill to increase the budget of ministries and governmental departments by 500 million dinars for the 2020/21 fiscal year due to the coronavirus outbreak. It also established a temporary fund for receiving financial contributions from institutions, companies, and individuals to support the government's efforts to fight the virus. The country's stock market has been battered by the virus outbreak as well as a historic plunge in oil prices. Its main index has lost nearly 30% of its value since the start of the year."

In a post on Bernie Sanders official Facebook page on Wednesday, an image showed 'healthcare is a human right' written in Bengali  As part of his on-going 2020 presidential campaign, Democratic Party heavyweight candidate Bernie Sanders posted a political message in Bengali language to drum up support from the Bangladeshi American community. In a post on Bernie Sanders official Facebook page on Wednesday, an image showed ""healthcare is a human right"" written in Bengali.  This is not the first time that the Sanders campaign made an effort to reach out to the Asian American communities, which were long ignored by most presidential candidates in the past.    Earlier, the Sanders campaign uploaded a video showing the plight of low-income earning Bangladeshi American families living in a community building run by a corrupt rental agency in Jamaica, a middle-class neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. New York remains a state where the majority of America's Bangladeshi community calls home. The Bangladeshi American community is also well-represented in neighbouring New Jersey, Maryland, DC, Florida, and, of course, California. It has a formidable presence in Michigan (especially in cities like Detroit and Hamtramck)."

'All the dairy farmers in the district will turn paupers if this situation continues' Hundreds of dairy farmers in Satkhira are counting huge losses as they are forced to dump over 50,000 litres milk every day for lack of demand at every level amid the virtual lockdown in the country after the coronavirus breakout. As the dairy farmers have no alternative source of income, particularly after this pandemic, farm owners in the district are even failing to arrange feed for their cattle. President of Tala Milk Production Samity Dibas Chandra Ghosh said around 1,000 dairy farms in the district, including 400 at Jiala Nalta village and 50 farms in Athari village in Tala upazila, produce over 50,000 litres of milk every day. ""All the dairy farmers in the district will turn paupers if this situation continues...the milk dumping must be stopped as soon as possible for their survival,"" he said. Local dairy farm owners said Milk Vita used to collect 8,000 litres milk while Akij Group 600 litres from them and they used to supply the rest of the milk to different sweet-making factories in Satkhira and Khulna. As soon as the pandemic broke out, all the sweetmeat shops and factories were either shut or cut production, forcing the dairy farm owners to sell milk at Tk10 per litres only, they added. Amid the deteriorating scenario, dairy farmers have sought government help just to survive.  Tala Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Iqbal Hossain said they have already brought it to the notice of the higher authorities concerned. Asked about the dire state of the dairy sector in the district, Deputy Commissioner SM Mostafa Kamal said they have decided to purchase milk through Milk Vita from the farm owners with the fund allotted by the Prime Minister for children's food. He also informed that he personally urged the Chairman of Milk Vita to collect milk from the district for producing food for babies and children. Meanwhile, the district administration has decided to keep the sweetmeat shops in the district open by maintaining social distancing, the DC said hoping that it will reduce the loss of the dairy farmers. Fisheries and Livestock Minister SM Rezaul Karim has recently assured that the government would provide all kinds of support to continue the production of fish, meat, milk and eggs during the coronavirus pandemic. He came up with the assurance in a video message prepared by the Ministry's Livestock and Dairy Development Project to create awareness among people. The minister urged all to keep milk, egg, fish and meat in their menu as that help boost the immunity of people."

Gender equality is a core principle of EU, though it is still not a reality, speakers say European Union (EU) Ambassador to Bangladesh Rensje Teerink  has praised Bangladesh for performing better than The Netherlands and Luxembourg in terms of Global Gender Gap Index. She made the comment while attending an International Women's Day program arranged by European Union at a city hotel in Dhaka on Sunday, reports BSS. Teerink said not only in Bangladesh but in many countries of the world, women are facing different types of social and economic challenges. ""There are so many taboos in The Netherlands. Only 34% women are actually financially independent there. If a married woman does any job, she has to face different types of criticism, including not spending time with their children and sending their kids to daycare centres"", she said. The ambassador said Bangladesh is doing well in the field of women empowerment. As women still face a lot of challenges here, these should be addressed, besides making the people aware about gender equality, she added. At the function speakers said gender equality is a core principle of the European Union, though it is still not a reality. While sharing the views, they said in business, politics and society, to reach full potential the use of talent and diversity is a must. They said women face too many hurdles and barriers on their way and added in Europe and beyond, women continue to be targets of gender-based violence, stereotypes and hate speech. Even if Europe is a good address for women, one in three women in the EU are subject to physical and sexual violence, they said. The speakers said even though more women graduate from universities, they earn on average 16% less than men do. Only 8% of CEO's of the EU's largest companies are women, they mentioned. The function was told that this is not what EU stands for. Everyone, regardless of his or her gender, should be able to live free from violence and pursue his or her chosen path in life. A change is needed and the moment is now. Everyone needs to remember: progress towards equality between women and men is neither inevitable nor irreversible, speakers at the program said. The EU adopted the EU's Gender Equality Strategy, setting out concrete actions for the next five years, including on pay transparency. The strategy is also the EU's contribution to the ""Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action"" - the first universal commitment and action plan to advance on equality between women and men. The EU will continue to support, promote and protect women's rights and women empowerment, while tackling gender-based violence, including in fragile, conflict and emergency situations."

To the Editor:
It is surprising you speak of a ''blockade'' of Nepal imposed by India (''India as International Bully,'' Topics item May 25), while on the same day you carry a report from your correspondent in Nepal categorically stating that ''India is allowing transit of essential goods.''
You speak of Nepal's rights to transit points as a landlocked country. According to international law, Nepal is entitled to one transit point. India has kept open four transit points on the India-Nepal border. No consignments are held up or awaiting clearance.
You write that Representative Durbin was ''disturbed'' after visiting the region and has asked Congress to urge India to reopen the border. We understand that Mr. Durbin visited Nepal, Bangladesh and India in January-February, almost two months before the treaties lapsed. Your report is to that extent not correct. The India-Nepal border is not closed. Only the transit trade crossings have been decreased in number.
It is highly unfair on your part to attribute the current trade and transit dispute between India and Nepal to Nepal's relations with third countries. When bilateral treaties lapse, they are renegotiated bilaterally. You may like to note that India has unilaterally offered to Nepal essential commodities for purchase - such as sugar, baby food, medicines, coal, etc. - which demonstrates a degree of magnanimity on the part of India, not the characteristics of a ''bully.'' Total availability of such products in Nepal will depend upon the volume and value for which contracts are signed by Nepal and the Nepalese parties, and not merely upon the number of transit points.
