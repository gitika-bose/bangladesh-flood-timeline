0,"Misery Rises With Rivers In Bangladesh
1988-09-06T05:00:00.000Z
Wad-ing through waist-deep water late last week in the Muhammadpur residential district of the capital, Iqbal Ahmed, his few belongings on his shoulder, headed for the school on the Mirpur Road, which was still unaffected by the devastating floods.
A few hours later, Mr. Ahmed, 45 years old, waded back 300 yards from the school to his home at the refugee camp where he was forced by the flood, to pick up his ill 5-year-old daughter.
At first he could not find her. Then, Mr. Ahmed, groping in the flooded shack where he lives with his family, discovered her lying dead in a pool of water into which she apparently fell in her sleep. There was some solace: at least Mr. Ahmed was able to bury his daughter, while bodies of many flood victims in Bangladesh are being put on makeshift rafts - there not being enough dry space for burial.
Emaciated, unfed and without sleep for 24 hours, Mr. Ahmed mumbled: ''What will I do now? I'll go mad.''
Such poignant uncertainty seems to have gripped much of this country as flood waters cover the land, leaving at least 550 people dead and 25 million homeless. And the toll could go much higher, officials fear. One-third of Bangladesh is reported to still be under water.
''The situation is beyond any description, any definition,'' Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman told reporters today.
Flooding during the monsoon season is an annual event in this nation and is highly beneficial to agriculture. But the 1987 floods, which killed 1,600 people, were described as the worst in 70 years, and President H. M. Ershad has called this year's devastation ''far worse than last year's.''
The Brahmaputra and the Ganges, two of the major rivers in Bangladesh, a nation whose geography is delineated by rivers and deltas, had fallen since Sunday night, but the situation remained grave. Heavy rain fell again this afternoon, and the Dhaka weather bureau predicted that rain ''may continue intermittently, further swelling rivers already flowing above their danger levels.'' Prices Soar
In the capital, prices of such necessities as rice, cooking oil, salt and kerosene shot up anywhere from 30 percent to 200 percent. Kerosene to light lamps was in the shortest supply, with electricity cut off in most areas.
Mr. Rahman, the Information Minister, said today that 21 million homes had been washed away and that more than 30 million of the country's 110 million people were directly affected. He added that the actual losses will be known only after the water recedes.
Mr. Rahman said three more districts have been flooded, raising the number affected to 50 out of 64 districts in the country.
Communications in most areas affected remained disrupted or nonexistent, making it all but impossible to obtain food, medicine and other relief goods. Lack of pure drinking water is reported to have caused an outbreak of diarrhea and other stomach ailments. A senior Health Ministry official, Taslim Ahmed, said the number of people suffering from dysentery is also rising. The Matter of Starvation
Although the Government denied that anyone had yet died of starvation, witnesses said a man died today at a relief center in the Kishalaya school, in the Zigatala district of the capital.
Officials said the United States, Britain, Japan, Australia, Canada, India, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia have responded to the Government's appeal for help.
The devastation has forced the authorities to abandon their efforts to rescue an estimated two million people marooned in remote areas. They are inaccessible because of the lack of small boats.
Road and rail communication in the flooded areas collapsed 10 days ago.
In some districts like Faridpur, Madaripur and Sariatpur in the south, helicopters carrying relief supplies cannot land for lack of dry space.
Relief Ministry officials acknowledged that their efforts are being severely hampered. ''We have food in our stock,'' President Ershad said, ''but the question is how to deliver it.'' It has similarly become all but impossible for the authorities to accurately assess the extent of damage and the loss of life.
Aerial photos showed village after village leveled by flood waters. Panic in Capital
In Dhaka itself, where flooding is unusual, a panic seemed to have spread among the estimated two million out of five million city dwellers affected.
Men, women and children by the thousands - with a few essentials on their heads and babies tightly held to mothers' breasts - are wading through water in search of shelter. Older people unable to walk are being piggybacked.
They are mostly the poor; others who are better off, were seen escaping by boats and rafts that now ply most of the streets of Dhaka.
The powerful are not immune. The state television network has showed pictures of President Ershad's official residence under knee-deep water. Airport Also Flooded
Dhaka, severed a week ago by road and rail link from the rest of Bangladesh, is cut off from the outside world, as well. The international airport was closed on Friday, its runway flooded.
All schools have been shut down in the affected areas, and inmates of hospitals and prisons evacuted.
Gas for cooking is in critically short supply, and the wells, now under water, have become contaminated with sewage.
For some, though, the picture is not altogether bleak. Boatmen are doing a brisk business. And some children, too young to fathom the magnitude of the disaster, are enthusiastic. They can be seen splashing and frolicking in the water."

Farmers are acutely at risk of contracting sewage-borne diseases Comilla City Corporation's unplanned drainage system is turning farmland into water bodies; as polluted water is flooding hundreds of hectares of farmland. However, the city corporation has undertaken several mega projects to improve  rural infrastructure and increase opportunities for urbanization. Among these projects, one of them was undertaken to ensure a better sewerage system. However, the newly-constructed drainage system--in nine wards of Comilla City Corporation, including wards 23 and 24-- has brought sewage onto arable farmland, into open fields, and near educational institutions; mostly harming farmers in the process. Diseases--such as: cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and diarrhea--are emerging from these unhealthy conditions. Various crops, dwellings, schools, and other institutions, are in danger of becoming water-logged. Farmers complain that due to the negligence of the city corporation officials, the drains empty onto farmland instead of into rivers or canals. They claim that if the sewerage system had been carefully planned, the farmers would not be suffering. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said the drainage line empties onto farmland for various reasons; including that some cases filed against construction of the line, by people who do not want drains over their land, have left the process incomplete. He said: ""We are trying to find a solution to this problem."" Visiting the area, this correspondent found that starting from the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) Comilla sector, the main drain pipe ends near Nandanpur Bishwaroad. Branches of drainpipes from other areas link to this main drain line, leading the sewage water away to places near farmlands, houses, and educational institutions in several areas, including: Gandhamati, Changini, Batabaria, and Rampur. The main drain line of the 23rd and 24th ward ends near Batabaria school, while Ghungaijhuri canal is only 2700 square feet away. If the drain had been extended by 2700 square feet--over the Changini-Nandanpur area to the canal--then the problems would not have existed. There are at least 30 government and non-government institutions in wards 23 and 24, including: the Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development (Bard), the BGB sector headquarters, Comilla University, a section of cantonment, a cadet college, Shalban Vihara, and the Buddhist Bihar Museum. Locals said if the unplanned sewerage system persists, these places will flood with polluted water. A farmer from Nandanpur, Abul Hashem said they are struggling to yield crops as contaminated water is flooding their arable farmland. They demand the pipeline be moved so that it ends at Ghungaijhuri canal, rather than on the farmland. Many people--including Md Ayub Ali, Md Lutfur Rahman, Zahid Hossain Mithu, and Md Abul Kalam--have complained that apart from harming the crops, farmers are also contracting skin diseases from the contaminated water. Dr Mosleh Uddin, president of Comilla Environment Movement, said: ""Due to the dirty and contaminated water of the drains, the farmers of those areas are [working] in extremely dangerous conditions. ""All the polluted water from the city is flowing onto agricultural land. As there is no way to dispose of the sewage--other than in the southern area of the city corporation--the area will be considered a recycling zone."" He said it is possible to protect the agricultural land--at least in those areas--by creating a recycling project. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said: ""The work to extend the drainpipes, for them to empty into canals, is going ahead according to the master plan. It will be completed in phases. He also said alongside it, there is a plan to extend the main drain line of Nandanpur towards Ghungaijhuri canal. The mayor said: ""A man named Abdul Jalil from ward 24 has filed cases against seven city corporation officials, including me. Construction of drains in various places is hindered due to these problems."""

Locals accused the administration of doing little to help them With the sudden  rise in water levels, land erosion by the Madhumati, and Nabaganga rivers has taken a serious turn at different places of Narail, forcing people to look for safer places. According to local sources, the erosion has taken a serious turn in Ghagha, Mollikpur, Shierbr, and Makrail areas along Madhumati's banks, and at 15 points including Kargati, Soto Kalia, and Suktogram, of Nabaganga banks. People  of the affected areas have accused the local Water Development Board (WDB) of its negligence as water from the rivers poured into houses in Kalia upazila. ""I have never seen Nabaganga rise so much in the last 35 years. My house was destroyed in a matter of seconds,"" said Ilias Ali, a resident of Sukragram. Many, who have lost their houses in river erosion, are living with their relatives, but some like Julmat Sheikh of Kalia upazila's Noragati village, have been staying under the open sky with their families as they have nowhere else to go. Locals accused the administration of doing little to help them. According to the locals, the WDB has failed to prevent recurring erosion because of their lackadaisical attitude.  Babra-Hachla Union Parishad Chairman Mojammel Hossain said the situation will be brought under control soon. The local contractors declined to perform the emergency work at the beginning of monsoon as WDB officials usually demand 10 percent bribe for such projects, alleged contractors. When contacted, WDB Executive Engineer Md Zulfikar Ali declined to comment over the issue. Meanwhile locals formed a human chain in the district yesterday protesting the  negligence of WDB. Among others, Monisha Ghosh, Profullo Barman, Liton Kumar Ghosh, Kalyani Barman, and Modon Ghosh of the affected areas spoke at the gathering. They urged the administration to take immediate steps to save the people from becoming victims of river erosion."

This made over 200 families of low-lying areas homeless, locals and Water Development Board officials said. Padma River erosion took an alarming turn in the last few days, rendering over 200 families homeless in the Rajeswhawar union of the Chandpur Sadar upazila. The affected people of Rajarchar, Mander Bazar, Khaskandi, Lagnimararchar, and Dewan Bazar areas of the union said onrush of flood waters from upstream and heavy rain in the last few days  swelled Padma-Meghna, flooding the areas on its banks. This made over 200 families of low-lying areas homeless, locals and Water Development Board officials said. A large number of flood victims took shelter on nearby highlands including  Bashgari, Majherchar, Goal Nagar and Rayerchar. Hajrat Ali Bepari , chairman of the Rajeswhawar union said about a thousand other families, living close to the river, are passing their days in anxiety and fear of being devoured by the Padma in the near future. He also said the  erosion along vast areas on the river bank earlier washed away scores of homesteads, schools in the area. The situation had been deteriorated due to constant erosion, he added.  Erosion-hit Kamal, 40, and Akkel Ali, 35, of the union said they had been passing sleepless nights in fear of erosion. ""Where will we go? We are all poor people,"" said Akkel Ali. Gourango, Abul Kalam and Laila of Mander Bazar alleged that unplanned dredging had sped up the erosion.  Executive Engineer of Chandpur Water Development Board Abu Raihan said, ""During the monsoon season the water stream in the river is very high. There are strong vortex current flows. This place is very risky within the union."" He said they have nothing to do as the union is situated in the char area.  "

Around 60 kilometres of flood control embankment in Patuakhali and Barguna got badly damaged due to the tidal surges caused by the impact of cyclone Fani. Moreover, thousands of people at different villages in those two districts have been suffering a lot as their dwelling houses and vast tracts of agricultural land remained inundated due to the impact of the recent cyclone. Besides, tidal water keeps entering those villages through the damaged portion of the flood control embankment since the cyclone hit the southern region. Of the damaged embankment, around 30 kilometre is under Patuakhali Water Development Board (WDB), 10.5 kilometre under Kalapara WDB in Patuakhali and 18.5 kilometre is in Barguna, according to Patuakhali and Barguna WDB offices. Patuakhali WDB Executive Engineer Mohammad Hasanuzzaman said of the 30 kilometre, about 5.5 kilometre was damaged fully and 24.5 kilometre partly. The most affected villages are Mehendiabad, Ranipur, Golkhali, Hazikhali and Charkhali, all along the Payra river in Mirzaganj upazila. ""We have already sent a letter to the higher authorities, seeking allocation of fund to repair the badly damaged portion in an emergency basis,"" he said. Meanwhile, in Kalapara, around 10.5 kilometre dyke was badly damaged and tidal water keeps entering through the damaged portion in different villages. Of the villages, Kamarpur, Nizampur, Puran Mohipur, Yousufpur, Monoharpur, Najibpur under Mohipur union and Chairpara, Nawapara, Chowdhuripara, Nayakata, Munshipara, Chandupara, Hasnapara, Poshurbunia under Lalua union are most vulnerable. Abul Talukder, a resident of Nayakata village, said the flood control embankment along on the Ramnabad river was badly damaged during the super cyclone Sidr and later repaired hurriedly. Feroza Begum of Charipara village said they often suffer from waterborne diseases as their houses and croplands remained inundated during the rainy season. ""We cannot even cook our food properly during the rainy season,"" she said. Lalua Union Parishad Chairman Shawkat Hossain said at least 16 villages under his union have been inundated after a portion of the flood control dyke along the Ramnabad river broke down. Kumar Sastik, acting executive engineer of Kalapara WDB, said they sent a fax to the higher authorities for allocation of fund. After getting allocation we will take step to repair the dyke, he said. In Barguna, due to lack of repair around 18 kilometre of the flood control dyke at 37 spots is under threats. The most vulnerable areas are Chotobaliatali, Noltona, Lakurtala, Dalvanga, Angerpara, Jangalia, Patakata, Gudighata, Gulishakhali, Chalitatali and Noli under Barguna Sadar upazila, Boloybinia, Deshantorkathi and Jhopkhali under Betagi upazila, Kakchira, Charlathimara, Ruhita, Jintala and Padma under Pathorghata upazila, Ramna, Shafipur, Chechan, Shinrabunia and Borotaleshwar under Bamna upazila and Poshorbunia, Poshimghotkhali and Purbochila under Amtali upazila. Barguna WDB Executive Engineer Dipak Ranjon Das said they have informed their higher authorities about the damaged embankment."

Fair price has brought smile to vegetable farmers in flood free areas of Sadar, Nageshwari, Bhurungamari and Rajarhat upazilas. They grow different types of vegetables like pointed gourd, pumpkin, aubergine and bottle gourd in Kharif-1 (March-July) season, said Bimal Kumar De, sub-assistant agricultural officer of Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in Kurigram. Nine upazilas in the district have been affected by flood early this month and the floodwater started receding from the areas in the last couple of days. But the growers in eight unions of the four upazilas still continued harvesting the vegetables as floodwater could not enter their fields situated in highland areas. The agricultural officer said around 4,038 hectares of land in the district have been brought under vegetable cultivation this year. As the flood has affected 3,739 hectares out of 4,038 hectares of fields, vegetable prices have shot up, he said.  Saidur Rahman of Kaley village in Belgachha union of Sadar upazila said ""I have been cultivating vegetable in Kharif-1 season for the last four years and earning good profit."" He has cultivated pointed gourd on 12 decimals of land spending Tk 6,000 this year, said the farmer. ""I've already sold pointed gourds at Tk 10,000,"" said Saidur, adding that he is expecting to earn Tk 16,000 more from sale of the vegetable. Grower Rezaul Islam of Sanwashi village in Halokhana union under Sadar upazila said he cultivated aubergine on 10 decimals of land and pointed gourd on 22 decimals of land this season. ""I have already sold the vegetables at Tk 31,000. I'm also expecting to earn Tk 43,000 more in the next two months,"" said Rezaul. They are getting good profits from the vegetable farming this season every year, he said. Another farmer Akbar Ali of Chhinaye Haat village in Chhinaye union of Rajarhat upazila said he cultivated aubergine on 40 decimals of land and pumpkin on 16 decimals of land spending Tk 19,000 in May this year. ""I'm expecting to earn Tk 42,000 from sale of the vegetables in the next two months,"" he said. Kurigram DAE Additional Deputy Director (Plant Protection) Sasty Chandra Roy said there are many vegetable growers in Rajarhat and Sadar upazilas and they are known as adapted farmers, who cultivate different types of vegetables during this period of the year, and get a good profit. In the rainy season, extra care is needed for pollination, he said."

1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z
Clustered on a riverbank, more than 8,000 residents of this town in Bangladesh, about 100 miles south of Dhaka,were forced today to take shelter any way they could.
In outlying areas, those displaced by the floods took refuge in treetops and on tin roofs - survival having become a matter of ingenuity and improvisation.
No relief had reached this town in Bhola district today, 10 days after the start of the extensive flooding that has taken at least 550 lives and left much of Bangladesh under water.
''How long will I survive with my family if this continues?'' asked one of those living on the embankment, Abdul Haq, 55, head of a family of nine. An Annual Event
The overall flood situation in this south Asian nation remained basically unchanged, though the levels of most rivers had dropped further after the devastation wrought by the monsoon, the wind-driven torrential rain that occurs annually in this part of the world. The monsoon is both devastating and beneficial: the death and destruction it brings is repetitive, yet agriculture -and particularly rice cultivation - depends on it.
During a two-hour helicopter trip to and from Bhola today, vast sheets of water stretched as far as the eye could see.
In the affected districts - Narayangang, Munshigang, Faridpur and Chandpur - the treetops and tin roofs still protruded above water. Some communities, and the district headquarters of Narayangang and Munshigang, 11 and 20 miles south of Dhaka respectively, measured the flooding at knee-deep levels. Boats were seen plying the roads along with rickshaws. Many Are Cut Offs
A helicopter pilot, flying over vast areas during the last few days, said he has seen many people trapped by flood waters asking for food.
Information Minister Mahbubur Rahman said that about 1,700 relief centers were in operation throughout the country. On one such place in Narayangang hung a sign reading ''Ershad Gruel Kitchen.''
In Nichkasia, Mr. Haq and about 200 other flood victims rushed toward three journalists today, having mistaken them for relief officials.
''They don't care about us,'' said Mohammad Musa, 60 years old. ''They show up only when such great disasters befall us.''
Naziur Rahman Mia, Minister of State for Local Government and Rural Development, said that more than 200,000 of of the district's 1.4 million people had been affected by the flooding and that about 70,000 had lost everything they owned.
''Now the main problem is erosion of the river,'' said Mr. Mia, who is from this district. ''Already, 22 square miles have been gobbled up by the Meghna, leaving thousands homeless.''
He said he would assess the damage and provide relief as it is needed. Surviving on Biscuits
Standing nearby was an 11-year-old girl, who gave her name as Fajilatunnesa, who said she had received a small package of biscuits four days ago, but nothing after that.
The Bhola area becomes nearly inaccessible in the rainy season. The five-mile road to the district headquarters is mostly unpaved and full of potholes and deep ruts. It took about half an hour to travel those five miles by jeep.
Health officials throughout the country continued to express concern both over hunger of flood victims and disease in places where there is little or no pure drinking water.
A daily newspaper, Ittefaq, reported large-scale outbreaks of diarrhea and other intestinal ailments. Health Minister Abdul Munim said 2,250 medical teams are now working in the flooded areas."

This year, around 98,688 families were directly affected by the floods, while 13.60 lakh families were affected partially. Moreover, 34,999 houses were damaged completely and 5.47 lakh were damaged partially. Reportedly, relief materials for the affected people were also inadequate, although the government might have made sufficient allotment. These people are still struggling to find a livelihood and rebuild their houses. And as the flood water recedes, river erosion has started taking its toll in many areas, destroying schools and homesteads of people. While the state minister for the ministry of disaster management and relief has termed TIB's allegations as baseless, the fact remains that many of the flood victims have been left with no relief at all. We think the government should move away from its denial mode and conduct investigations into the allegations made by the corruption watchdog. The institutional limitations in the government's planning of relief distribution, rehabilitation programmes, emergency response and overall preparedness for such a disaster should be addressed properly for better management of floods in the future. Also, stringent action should be taken against those, including the public representatives, involved in corruption."
87,"Water Recedes, Spirits Rise in Dhaka
1988-09-08T05:00:00.000Z
The sun was shining in Dhaka today, the water was receding, and for a moment at least, there was a more hopeful air in city neighborhoods.
In a few weeks, perhaps even a few days, it may not be so. Welfare agencies fear that the lowering tide from the devastating floods will leave epidemic diseases in the slate-gray mud.
But today, shops were open in the city center, which escaped the flooding. The international airport, an island of sorts on a waterlogged plain, began to function again after the annual monsoon rains left much of the nation under water and millions homeless.
Officials said today that the death toll from the floods had risen to more than 800. They said at least 150 people had died in less than 24 hours, most of those from diarrhea and dysentery caused by impure water and rotten food. The central Government's announced death toll is slightly more than half that, but is widely considered far too low. Unofficial tabulations in Dhaka newspapers run to more than 1,200, and communications with many outlying areas are still out.
Bicycle rickshaw pullers were doing a brisk business along roads where drivers feared to take their cars, areas that are still under water. Spirit of the Marketplace
Submerged streets were full of indefatigable entrepreneurs - fellows who will push your car for anything you can spare, children standing in water for a pittance to show a driver how deep it is, a pushcart vendor-turned-boatman who grinned with embarrassment each time he beached his leaky vessel on a curb or an unseen bush.
Boats themselves are a new business. Tiny skiffs that once cost less than $20 are being hustled in the wetter neighborhoods for as much as $50, a huge amount of money for the very poor.
Some families have no choice but to buy one anyway. A boat takes marooned people to the markets for food. It allows them to live at home - albeit often on their traditional flat rooftops, from which they can keep looters away. A boat also saves slogging barefoot through waters polluted with sewage and infested with snakes.
The better-off residents of Dhaka concede that, this time, it is to some extent a ''middle-class flood.'' The people of Bangladesh, most rural and poor, are used to the annual inundation of their land and homes. Indians Are Blamed
The flooding is worse this year because south Asia in general, and India in particular, have had a record monsoon rain. Hundreds of people have also died in eastern India.
A commonly heard explanation here is that ''the water comes from India.''
Every year there is concern about India's deforested hills and mountains and its uncompleted flood-control programs, which allow flood waters to tumble through Bangladesh on their way to the sea. This year, the complaint is heard more often because the water has washed into the capital.
Dhaka is a city that can empty its streets quickly in a crisis. Political tension seems to be a recurrent part of life here, since the days when Bangladesh was the eastern region of Pakistan.
Today, however, there was no such anxiety but , if anything, a sense of making the best of a terrible situation.
''Pani, pani,'' a man said with a rueful smile, shaking his head and using the Bengali word for water, as he hoisted a parcel wrapped in a bandanna into the air. Then he plunged in up to his neck on the way home from shopping.
Bangladeshis, the majority of whom are Moslems, have been augmenting official relief efforts with their own makeshift projects.
Tonight, as dusk fell on a sodden community in south Dhaka, a group of energetic young men arrived with two barrels of clean, fresh drinking water, which they began to distribute in a school and along a muddy highway median.
One of them, Nakim Mahmud Narullah, a law student at Dhaka University, said he and his three colleagues were volunteers for the Islamic Dawa Complex, a charitable organization. Islam ranks welfare high among the obligations of its adherents.
Asked why he and his friends were standing there in their immaculate clothes, giving drinks and water-purification tablets to the children of beggars, he replied:
''We are Moslems. It is our duty.''"
111,"IDEAS & TRENDS; Once More, the Earth Visits Disaster on the Plains of Bangladesh
1988-09-11T05:00:00.000Z
SPRAWLING across a vast delta where three of the world's great rivers meet, Bangladesh is the drainpipe of Central Asia. In bountiful times, the rich alluvial silt that covers most of the country yields as many as three rice crops a year. But when the drainpipe overflows, as it did two weeks ago, Bangladesh becomes a land reminiscent of Bruegel's visions of triumphant death.
In a 10-day period of torrential monsoon rain that ended last week, more than 22 inches fell in some regions, and rainfall throughout the country was twice as much as normal for such a period. When the rain finally let up, 50 of the country's 64 administrative districts lay under a sheet of water that covered roads to depths of up to eight feet.
Governments and relief organizations throughout the world hastened to send food and medicine, but as usual in such disasters, most of Bangladesh's 110 million inhabitants were isolated by the flood and beyond immediate help.
Hundreds died when the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna Rivers overflowed. When the bacteria-laden water began to subside last week, germinating intestinal diseases lingered, tainting wells, rice paddies and streams. Water-borne illness is a principal cause of Bangladesh's 12 percent infant mortality rate.
For the people of long-suffering Bengal, disaster never seems to end. Though this year's floods were particularly destructive in the region, some flooding occurs nearly every year, shifting land, dispossessing farmers and spreading disease.
Since the bloody birth of Bangladesh in 1971, some of the nation's leaders have blamed India, their one-time ally, for contributing to both floods and droughts. India and Bangladesh have often been at odds over the equitable division of water from the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and other rivers on which both countries depend. Bangladesh officials have accused India of disrupting the flow with its dams, and of worsening the silting problem by permitting extensive deforestation of regions drained by the rivers. Long, Slow Flooding
This year, although the overflowing of rivers originating in India, Nepal and Tibet apparently exacerbated matters, climatologists believe that the main cause of the disaster was rain in Bangladesh itself. Aside from the tea-growing hill country in the northeast, Bangladesh is as flat as a board and only a few feet above sea level. In hard rains, the shallow, sluggish rivers quickly overflow. Once inundated, the countryside takes weeks to drain.
The underlying problem is Bangladesh's yearly exposure to the southwest monsoon. As climatologists explain it, the monsoon affecting South Asia pivots around western China, where the sun warms the ground and the ground warms a rising column of air. This mass of rising air sucks in cooler air from the oceans, notably the Bay of Bengal, creating sea breezes in coastal areas.
As the moisture-filled air from the sea moves inland, it is warmed and pulled into the rising column. When the column reaches the cold air at high altitude, the moisture condenses. The rain is especially likely to begin over land that rises abruptly from a plain. This year, the rain was torrential where the Bangladesh highlands rise above the flat rice and jute fields.
No one knows why monsoon rains and the cyclonic storms that sometimes accompany them are destructive in some years and mild in others. But climatologists have a growing suspicion that ''active'' monsoons like the one Bangladesh has just been through are closely related to a phenomenon experts call the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.
Every few years, the surface water off the west coast of South America becomes warmer than usual, heating the air above it and disturbing circulation patterns in the atmosphere throughout the world. During a typical El Nino event, normally rainy regions are sometimes stricken by droughts, and normally parched areas are drenched. In 1982-83, the world experienced the most severe El Nino event on record, which damaged crops and fishing industries in regions as widely separated as New Zealand, California and Africa. Scientists believe it also perturbed carbon dioxide and ozone concentrations and may even have slightly slowed the Earth's rotation on its axis.
Oddly enough, however, the years when El Nino activity peaks seem to correspond to those in which the monsoon season in Bangladesh is mild, and vice versa. The most recent El Nino event ended last March, and some experts believe that this might have been taken as a sign that the monsoon in Bangladesh this summer would be severe.
No one yet knows what the connection between El Nino and the monsoon may be. Nor is anyone sure that being able to predict bad weather would really help Bangladesh much. The country's impoverished masses have nowhere to go, much as the many Bangladeshis who would like to emigrate to Pakistan or India. Flood control measures in a country that is mostly a big flood plain are limited.
''At any rate,'' a public health official in Dhaka once said, ''the monsoon helps to assure our supply of the one commodity in which we are rich: misfortune.''"

Following approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), Dhaka Wasa had initiated two projects to tackle the issue and improve the water logging situation The water logging situation in the capital has not changed over the years, even after promises from Dhaka Wasa about implementing a master-plan and commitment of the government to find a solution to this problem. People of the city were reminded of the unfulfilled pledges yesterday, after a downpour left numerous areas waterlogged and led to major gridlock on the streets until well after evening. Following approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), Dhaka Wasa had initiated two projects to tackle the issue and improve the water logging situation. But their progress is very slow to make any significant headway. On June 28, 2018, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, then LGRD minister, had blamed development projects around the city for its water logging problem. He had also expressed hope that the problem would end by 2019 -- which has not happened. As a result, the perennial waterlogging scenario in Dhaka is still unchanged. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) recorded 46mm rainfall in the city between 12pm and 6pm yesterday. Just within half-an-hour of thundershowers a little after 12pm, citizens were seen posting on social media videos of waterlogging in a number of areas. Dhaka Tribune correspondents during visits also found many streets and areas inundated. The areas that suffered most include Mirpur's Rokeya Sarani and Kazipara, Jahangir Gate, Green Road, parts of Indira Road, Tejgaon, Panthapath, Shukrabad, Kalabagan, Dhanmondi, Jhigatala, Shankar, Jatrabari, Bashundhara Residential Area, Motijheel, Gulistan, Paltan, Bijoynagar, Fakirapool, Karwan Bazar, Arambagh, some areas in Mohakhali and Gulshan, and many places of Old Dhaka. Talking to Dhaka Tribune, many said waterlogging was still occurring as the drains that are supposed to take the rainwater out are clogged with garbage. At the same time, heavy gridlock on major roads, which were inundated, made it extremely difficult for city dwellers to commute. Sufferings Many people were seen wading through the water to reach their destinations. Sarjin Sharif, a resident of Shankar area, told Dhaka Tribune: ""The road in front of my house is completely submerged. ""I need to go to work, but I cannot even get out of the house to find a vehicle."" Dhanmondi's Road No 27 also went under knee-deep water very quickly, leaving many including students suffering amid heavy rain. Nafisa Nazmul, a former student of Brac University, said: ""I cannot find transport to go to Panthapath from Mirpur 10. The roads are completely underwater."" East Jurain resident Awenim Rahman also told Dhaka Tribune that the main streets in his area were fine, as they were rebuilt and their heights increased recently. ""But the branch lanes, which are still low-lying, are completely inundated."" He said he also faced horrible traffic jam on his way to the office later in the afternoon. ""I found all the roads leading from Gulistan to Paltan, Shahbagh, Kakrail, Dainik Bangla, and Farmgate via Banglamotor and Karwan Bazar absolutely gridlocked,"" Awenim said expressing frustration. Independent University Bangladesh faculty member Kazi Mubinul Hasan said: ""I live in the Bashundhara Residential area. On a usual day, it takes me less than an hour to reach Shukrabad. But today [Tuesday], it took me nearly two hours."" Nilkhet and New Market areas, Elephant Road and Mirpur Road also saw major gridlock after the rain stopped a little after 3pm. The rain even left the roads leading from the main entrances to archways in the Bangladesh Secretariat, adjacent to Zero Point in Gulistan, under knee-deep water for at least three hours. Officers and outsiders both suffered while going from one building to another. Many were even seen entering the offices barefoot. Those turning up at the secretariat without cars were among the worst sufferers. Many said the secretariat had seen a similar problem on Sunday. More rains incoming BMD Meteorologist AKM Ruhul Quddus told Dhaka Tribune that they recorded 45.3mm of rainfall in the capital between noon and 3pm yesterday. Between 12pm and 6pm, a total of 46mm rainfall was recorded. Meanwhile, BMD also recorded the highest rainfall in Sylhet - 120mm. According to a Met Office weather bulletin, light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind over the country was likely again in the next 24 hours as of 9am today. ""There is a chance of light rain on Wednesday in Dhaka, Khulna and Chittagong regions, and in the rest of the country it will rainless,"" said Ruhul. The bulletin added that light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind is likely to occur at most places in Dhaka, Mymensingh, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, many places in Khulna and Barisal divisions, and a few places in Rangpur and Rajshahi divisions during the time. Moreover, it said, some places in Barisal, Chittagong, Mymensingh and Sylhet divisions may see moderately heavy to very heavy falls until this morning. Slow progress of master-plan Aiming to fix the perennial problem, the Ecnec last year had approved two projects -- ""Expansion of Drainage Networks and Development of Canals Project in Dhaka City"" and ""Land acquisition, excavation and re-excavation of Hazaribagh, Baishteki, Kurmitola, Manda and Begunbari canals."" But both, being implemented by Dhaka Wasa are advancing at a snail's pace. One of the projects has registered only 8.25% progress in the past one year, while the other just 1.5% over the span of 14 months. Regarding the extremely sluggish progress, urban development expert Prof Nazrul Islam said such projects, after being passed, advance slowly due to many issues. ""But in course of time, their progress gained pace. But these two projects seem to be progressing very slowly. Only the authorities implementing them can explain why,"" he said. Dhaka Wasa Managing Director Taqsem A Khan was unavailable for comment over phone. However, engineer Nuruzzaman, former member of Dhaka Wasa Board, told Dhaka Tribune: ""Wasa is trying to solve the waterlogging issue by implementing some projects. It is visible that once areas used to remain waterlogged for five to six hours, but this year the water cleared from roads in two to three hours. It is a significant improvement."""

Over a lakh people living in the upazilas fear that if an erosion occurs again in the locality, it will be difficult for them to settle and earn their livelihood Thousands of people in Shariatpur are living in constant fear of an upcoming erosion even as they struggle to cope with the ongoing lockdown in light of the deadly Covid-19 outbreak that challenges their livelihood. The flood control embankment construction project on the Padma river, flowing through Naria and Zajira upazilas of the district, has come to a halt with the recent outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic that has led to a nationwide lockdown. Over a lakh people living in the upazilas fear that if an erosion occurs again in the locality --which is highly likely as it happens every year-- it will be difficult for them to settle and earn their livelihood. The poverty-stricken locality had hardly any respite from the damage caused by the last erosion and yet there is now a threat of another. Over six thousand people --who lost their homestead and belongings in the last erosion-- settling in on others' land either through pity or rent are in a huge crisis. Roksana Begum, a resident of Naria upazila, lost everything to the river last year and now, when she and her husband both are jobless, the pandemic is making each day of their lives harder as the days go by. She said: ""We made a shed on a neighbour's land temporarily. We were hoping to get back to our normal life after the flood control embankment project was completed. But now erosion is coming towards us in one way and coronavirus has come in another. ""We have no money or anyone to help us. Either we will die of the disease or of poverty. It does not make much difference to us,"" Roksana added in sheer despair. Thousands of working class people, who lost everything in the regular erosion in the area like Roksana are facing the same difficulties. They are without work, income, food and scope for treatment.  Despite government-allocated ration goods, said another resident of the area seeking anonymity, people have been sleeping on hungry stomachs as they are not getting help or it would be correct to say that their goods are being looted by local representatives and political activists.  Mohadeb Das, a kitchen shopkeeper of Hindupara, said he used to own a large store. However, after the river devoured it, he was managing well with his single-shed kitchen shop by the riverside.  He said: ""I was waiting to see the embankment project completed. But now no one comes to my shop because of the disease and the river is closing in every day to consume my shop, my only means of livelihood again."" Rashida Begum, who rented her neighbour's house after losing her home in the erosion, said: ""We were well off, with our daily jobs and income. It was not much but enough for a couple like us. ""But due to the coronavirus, we lost our jobs and did not have any help or rations from the authority. We do not know what will we do,"" said Rashida, who has been suffering from acute poverty due to the outbreak of the pandemic. Denying the allegations, Kazi Abu Taher, Deputy Commissioner of Shariatpur, told Dhaka Tribune that there was not a single house in his locality which had not been given proper help and not a single person was there who was hungry or had been deprived of rations. According to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), the flood control embankment project, stretching for 8.9 kilometres, was initiated in 2018 and was expected to be completed in 2021 at a cost of Tk1,097 crore. However, 33% of work remaining for the project has now come to a halt as workers have left for their homes with the outbreak of the pandemic. Stating that the project would be completed in due time, BWDB Executive Engineer Ahsan Habib said: ""The project is still ongoing in fractionally. Even if it gets halted overall, we will speed up the construction work later to complete it in due time."""

1988-12-01T05:00:00.000Z
A cyclone battered coastal areas of Bangladesh and eastern India late Tuesday, killing at least 300 people and leaving a trail of devastation, officials and news reports said today.
Officials said the death toll was likely to rise dramatically as recovery efforts progressed and communications in the affected areas were fully restored.
Officials told the United News of India that more than 870 people, including 500 fishermen, had been killed. Other Bangladeshi officials said they feared the death toll would be in the thousands. Hundreds of thousands of people were reportedly left homeless and millions of tons of crops were said to have been destroyed. Winds to 120 Miles Per Hour
The cyclone struck Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, as it was continuing its recovery from the worst flooding in its history; the flooding in August and September covered three-fourths of the country and caused damages now estimated at more than $1 billion.
The storm, with winds of 60 to 120 miles per hour, whipped 10-foot-high tidal waves as it swept across the Bay of Bengal and through the southern and southeastern districts of Khulna, Satkhira, Bagerhat, Byrguna, Barisal, Patuakhali, Bhola, Chittagong and the town of Cox's Bazar. Electrical power and communications in those areas were cut off.
At least 275 fishermen were reported missing, and officials said they expected many more deaths as reports come in from the hundreds of tiny islands in the Bay of Bengal.
A relief ministry official said that about 80 percent of the crops and mud and thatch homes in the two hardest-hit districts, Khulna and Satkhira, had been destroyed. Warnings Were Broadcast
But he said that human casualties had been minimized by an efficient early warning system that helped people evacuate vulnerable areas. This official predicted the final death toll would be no more than ''a few thousand.''
Given the record of previous cyclones in Bangladesh - the most recent in 1985, which killed an estimated 10,000 people - that prediction seemed to a remarkably low figure. More than 300,000 people died in 1970 in the worst cyclone in Bangladesh's history."

 Pabna farmers are cultivating more land for the second season of onion eyeing the high price of the spice in the market, forgetting the loss they had suffered from their flood-hit crops in the September-October season. Deputy Director Md Azhar Ali of Pabna Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) told The Daily Star, ""In the last season, farmers cultivated 44,000 hectares of land and produced 6.5 lakh metric tons of onions. This season, we have targeted to cultivate 49,800-hectare for producing 7.5 lakh metric tons of onions."" If the weather remains dry and favourable, then this season's target will be the highest ever production in Pabna, according to officials of DAE. Deputy director Azhar informed that the total yearly demand for onion in the country is 24 lakh metric tons, and the nine upazilas of Pabna usually supplies 25 percent of it. Next year, they are hoping to supply 33 percent of the total demand of onion, he added. The deputy director noted that farmers, who could save their crop from flood during the last season, earned a lofty profit from the Mulkata variety selling it at the high market price. This motivated the other farmers to increase their cultivation for the current season. Since mid-September price of onion kept on rising from Tk 40/kg to the record high of Tk 250/kg, becoming somewhat steadier in the last two weeks selling between Tk 50 to Tk 100 per kg, as quoted on the website of the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. Sources at the DAE explained that Mulkata sown during September-October is harvested around December while the current variety sown now will be ready for harvest by March. This correspondent visited Santhia and Sujanagar upazilas, where most of the onions in the district are grown. An onion farmer of Sujanagar upazila Md Ishhaque Ali said, ""In last season, I cultivated 66 decimals of land but I did not get expected profit as most of the crop was damaged in sudden flood this year. I managed to save 20 mounds of onion and sold those for Tk 60,000. The handsome price of onion inspired me to cultivate again in more areas this season."" Ishaque is cultivating onions on 165 decimals of land by leasing 99 decimals, expecting to earn Tk five lakh to Tk six lakh from sale of the crop, he said. He, however, is concerned about winter rain damaging his crop again. ""If it rains during winter, we may face loss again,"" he said. Forgetting the loss that he had incurred in the last season, retired college teacher Dulal Hossain of Narinda village in Santhia upazila cultivated five bigha of land for onion expecting to earn Tk five lakh. He, too, is worried about the weather.  ""The recent dense fog disrupts onion cultivation. At the same time, we are worried about rain during winter,"" Dulal said. Farmers also urged the government to stop importing onions during harvesting time, so that they can get expected profit."

204,"BANGLADESH GETS PLEDGE OF MILLIONS FOR FLOOD RELIEF
1988-09-07T05:00:00.000Z
Donor nations have pledged millions of dollars in aid to Bangladesh, where the worst flooding in 70 years has left much of the country under water and as many as 28 million people homeless or stranded.
After an urgent international appeal for aid by the President of Bangladesh, Lieut. Gen. H.M. Ershad, the United States has initially pledged nearly $3.6 million in food, transportation and other emergency aid, the State Department spokesman, Charles E. Redman, said today.
''We continue to be in touch with Bangladesh authorities to see what other assistance we might be able to provide,'' he said. Japan Pledges $13 Million
Japan, which has now surpassed the United States as the world's largest foreign aid donor, has pledged $13 million in food and money for the lease of two helicopters and medical equipment. A Japanese medical team has already arrived in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Embassy in Washington said.
The flooding, brought on by brutal monsoon rains that began in June, has brought even more misery to one of the world's poorest countries and, with 110 million people in a land the size of Wisconsin, one of its most densely populated.
The most common estimate of the amount of land still under water is 75 percent, the figure used by the State Department and the Bangladesh Embassy here. CARE, which is represented in 80 percent of the country's 65 districts, said 75 to 90 percent of the county was under water. A Village in Trouble
One flooded village is Nichkasia, south of the capital, Dhaka, where no relief had been distributed by today and more than 8,000 people were forced to take shelter on a river embankment. A helicopter trip to the area showed water stretching as far as the eye could see, interrupted by treetops and tin roofs, some packed with victims of the flooding. [ Page A8. ] So far, relief officials have been unable to get to most flooded areas, and communications between the capital and outlying regions are spotty at best. The devastation will take weeks to assess. Most relief officials agree that only as the water levels decline will the problems in aiding a homeless population exposed to waterborne disease become evident.
''Bangladesh is one vast swamp and what you're confronted with is rebuilding a country,'' said Thomas Drahman, the Asia regional manager for CARE. ''I hate to sound hyperbolic, but this could be one of the largest natural disasters of the century.'' Casualty Figures Uncertain
There is no reliable estimate of what it will cost to feed, house and provide medical care to the population and rebuild roads, buildings and bridges, but $4.5 billion was the total estimate of damage for the flood last year, which was not nearly as severe.
Information is so unreliable that it has been impossible to estimate casualty figures. The official death count of more than 400, from drowning, house collapse and snake bites, is widely regarded as far too low.
Because so little is known about the condition of the country, some donors like the United States have been reluctant to pour in large amounts of money and aid until they can consult with relief officials on the most crucial needs.
According to the Agency for International Development, Australia has pledged $241,000, Pakistan $568,000, Britain $927,000 and various United Nations agencies $115,000.
Canada has pledged about $4 million for food aid and Denmark $275,000, according to the Bangladesh Embassy, which added that India and Saudi Arabia have each lent four helicopters and Kuwait has offered to send four jumbo jets filled with relief materials once the Dhaka airport fully reopens.
Why Japan has made such a generous initial pledge was unclear and embassy officials in Washington could not confirm the $13 million figure. But in recent months, Japan has emerged as a champion of the developing nations of Asia, by such actions as initiating its own plan for debtor nations at the Toronto summit meeting and sending money as well as personnel to United Nations peacekeeping operations in Iran and Afghanistan. Immediate Needs Listed
''Our immediate requirement is ready-to-eat high-protein dry food because people have no cooking oil, kerosene or firewood and cannot cook,'' said Tajul Islam, press attache at the Bangladesh Embassy. ''We also urgently need water purification tablets, medicine for the prevention of diarrhea and anti-snake venom.''
After that, officials in Bangladesh estimate, the country will need three million extra tons of food grains to make up for the lost harvests until January.
Although no deaths by starvation have been reported, private relief agency officials fear that a sizable percentage of the country's 110 million people will suffer malnutrition and even starvation because of the flood, as well as life-threatening waterborne diseases such as cholera.
Finally, the country will need construction materials for an unparalleled reconstruction effort, including homes, buildings, roads and bridges. Even Worse Conditions Feared
''It's a major disaster,'' said Rene Bafalis, a spokeswoman for A.I.D.'s Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance, which is coordinating United States Government aid efforts. ''We expect it to get worse before it gets better.''
Overall flood conditions in the country showed some signs of improvement today, Mr. Redman said, as water levels in two major northern river basins and in Dhaka showed declines. But he said that a number of tributaries feeding into major basins have risen in the last 24 hours, ''indicating that the situation could change rapidly.''
In addition, ''fuel and essential goods may become increasingly scarce,'' Mr. Redman said.
The nearly $3.6 million pledged in aid by the United States includes 10,000 tons of food valued at $2.5 million, more than 2,000 tons of corn and wheat seed valued at up to $1 million, $50,000 to CARE, $40,000 to Save the Children for food and water purification tablets and $25,000 to be used at the discretion of the United States Ambassador, Willard A. De Pree.
A.I.D. is also preparing to send disaster management experts to Dhaka to advise on further ways the United States can help the relief effort."

243,"Death Toll in India After Heavy Floods Is Reported at 1,000
1988-10-03T05:00:00.000Z
The death toll from floods that have submerged many areas in India's northwest was nearing 1,000 today, according to reports from the region. Hundreds of thousands of residents in four states have been evacuated to higher ground.
Most severely affected in more than a week of flooding has been Punjab State, where many acres of farmland have been inundated. A state government spokesman in Chandigarh said Saturday that at least 400 people had died in the state in nearly 9,000 affected villages and towns.
Local news organizations put the number of deaths in Punjab at about 600, with some areas still cut off and unable to report casualties. The districts of Ferozepore, Jullundur and Amritsar were among those hardest hit. Food Stocks Are Gone
Tens of thousands of farm animals have perished. Food stocks have been destroyed, prompting the Government to begin dropping relief supplies by air. [ A boat evacuating people from floodwaters in Pakistan's Punjab Province capsized and 35 people aboard were feared drowned, Reuters reported. It quoted the state-run Radio Pakistan as saying seven bodies had been recovered after the incident near Faisalabad. ] The states of Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir have reported hundreds more casualties as rivers swollen by record monsoon rains have poured into the fertile plains and valleys of the northwest. In Rajasthan, officials said they were on the alert for rising water in rivers and canals that pass through Punjab. Flooding Near the Capital
The Jumna River, which runs along the eastern edge of the capital, has also overflowed, disrupting the lives of many poor Indians who erect makeshift homes on its wide banks. But apart from the flooding of some city roads, the functioning of the capital has not been badly affected.
Today, flood waters were reported to be receding in Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. But the rivers are still high in Punjab, a politically sensitive state where four years of violence has already damaged the economy.
This weekend, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi named a Cabinet committee to open talks with the legal political opposition in the state, which Mr. Gandhi visited on Sept. 21. The talks, announced before the floods, are intended to consider solutions for the state's political and economic deterioration.
Violence, which has claimed at least 2,000 lives this year, began with a call for a separate homeland by Sikh militants, followed by an armed response by New Delhi. Terrorism is now no longer confined to the Sikh dispute, but has spread into general lawlessness, Punjabis say. Robberies and attacks occur daily.
Deforestation in the Himalayas and their foothills is easing the rush of water into India's northern states, experts say. The barren, eroded hills along the mountainous roof of India and nearby Nepal are also thought to have contributed to recent heavy flooding in northeastern India and in Bangladesh, where several large river systems enter the Bay of Bengal. Cooperation With Bangladesh
Bangladesh has been seeking international support in studying the river systems and making recommendations for joint projects to control the waters. Bangladesh's President, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, visited India on Thursday to raise his concerns with Prime Minister Gandhi.
The Indians told General Ershad that New Delhi wanted to keep the discussions confined to an Indian-Bangladesh commission, and not involve other nations at this point. India, where politicians are sensitive to what they see as infringements on national sovereignty, has long resisted the ''internationalization'' of the rivers issue.
India has proposed building a canal across Bangladeshi territory to link the Brahmaputra and Ganges systems to drain water from the former into the latter.
In Bangladesh, where the idea of an ''Indian'' canal has never been popular, a sense of desperation is growing, spurred by this year's devastating floods. The floods submerged nearly three-quarters of the country and left millions homeless.
General Ershad plans to go ahead with his plans to visit Nepal, Bhutan and China to discuss possible projects for managing the Himalayan rivers.
He is scheduled to go to Katmandu on Monday, less than a week after Indian officials made it clear that they did not want to involve Nepal in talks."

The Agency for International Development has urged President Reagan to send additional relief assistance immediately to Bangladesh, where floods that affected three-fourths of the country have claimed at least 1,000 lives, according to a report by the agency.
The report, which was requested by the President and presented this week to White House officials by Jay F. Morris, the A.I.D. deputy administrator, concludes that the United States should immediately provide an additional $20 million in 80,000 tons of food aid, between $1 million and $2 million in urgently needed medical supplies, oral rehydration salts and water purification tablets as well as other disaster and surveillance assistance.
The report also recommends that the aid agency develop a plan with other countries to rehabilitate Bangladesh and address the long-term causes of flooding in the region.
''It is a disaster of historic proportions, mind-numbing,'' said Mr. Morris, who returned last week from a six-day tour of the flood-ravaged country. ''I don't really know how to describe it except to say that it's certainly the largest flood I could ever imagine.'' During his visit, Mr. Morris met with officials, relief workers and flood victims and delivered a letter from President Reagan to President H. M. Ershad expressing concern and a promise ''to do what we can to help.''
As part of its relief effort, the United States has already speeded up the availability of about $150 million in aid to Bangladesh, including food aid, disaster relief supplies and local currency earnings.
The report stressed that the full effect of the flood and the ultimate needs of the people of Bangladesh will become known only over the next few months. It predicted the possibility of ''significant loss of life and degradation of human welfare over the next three to six months.''
Officials in Bangladesh say millions of people in the capital, Dhaka, have been exposed to disease by drinking contaminated water. #25 Million Homeless The flood has so far claimed 1,000 lives, according to official figures, but unofficial estimates put the dead at 2,000 or more. The Bangladeshi Government says that a fourth of the deaths were caused by diarrhea, and that the others were caused by drowning, building collapses and snake bites.
According to the A.I.D. report, 25 million people lost their homes in the flood, which inundated five million acres of rice land and damaged 43,000 miles of roads."

272,"Studies Seek Flood Control In Bangladesh
1989-07-06T05:00:00.000Z
As monsoon rains begin to fall again on Bangladesh, the World Bank is mobilizing an international force of scientists and aid officials to draft a comprehensive, long-term plan to save this vulnerable nation from perennial catastrophe.
With the height of the flood season still a few weeks away, 58 villages were destroyed in late June by rising water and erosion of banks along six rivers. At least 9,000 families lost their homes, the Government says.
After record-breaking floods last September, in which three of the world's mightiest rivers inundated two-thirds of Bangladesh and left more than 2,000 people dead and millions homeless, four major flood prevention studies were begun.
In the last few weeks, all four reports - by the United States, France, Japan and the United Nations Development Program - were completed and turned over to the Government of President H. M. Ershad, diplomats and officials of international agencies said in interviews. Consideration at Summit
Some proposals are so sweeping as to envisage a multibillion-dollar rebuilding of Bangladesh's river embankments, or the construction of huge dikes or polders to keep away both the rivers and the unpredictable sea.
The reports will now be discussed in international forums, including the group of seven leading industrialized nations at a summit meeting in Paris in mid-July.
At about the same time, the World Bank will convene a meeting in Washington of scientific experts and officials from donor nations, Francis van Gigch, chief of the World Bank's Bangladesh office, said in an interview.
While Bangladesh waits for international action, the Government has been building embankments around low-lying areas of Dhaka to protect the capital and its airport. Last September, the airport was closed for nearly a week during the flood, delaying the arrival of relief supplies. A Fatal Convergence
Diplomats and Bangladeshi officials say that last year's flood, caused by a fatal convergence of rising water in all three major river systems, the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna, dealt a heavy blow to an already fragile development process.
Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest and most densely populated nations, suffered millions of dollars in losses to buildings, roads and other essential structures. Untold numbers of farm animals were lost.
The findings of the four studies are in agreement on several points, but differ in recommending courses of action. All agree, for example, that projects must be confined to Bangladesh, not the larger region.
Nations in South Asia say it is unrealistic to expect that India, which controls substantial river water, can be brought into a regional discussion. New Delhi has said repeatedly that it will discuss the issue only on a one-to-one basis with its neighbors.
In the case of Bangladesh, this has led to a stalemate over an Indian proposal to build a huge canal across Bangladeshi territory to link the Brahmaputra and Ganges Rivers. But the reports on the whole say that better coordination in issuing flood warnings should be possible. Disagreement on Embankments
All reports agree that some annual flooding is not only inevitable but beneficial to the agricultural lands of Bangladesh that feed 110 million people. They say that the damages of these ''normal'' floods could be minimized by better warning systems and emergency services inside the country.
Where the reports diverge, and enter into political territory, is on the question of embankments.
The United Nations Development Program and the French studies advocate the building of more and higher banks along the rivers, a course favored by President Ershad.
The American study - prepared for the United States Agency for International Development by the Irrigation Support Project for Asia and the Near East - questions the value of embankments designed for worst-case floods.
It puts emphasis on more effective utilization of ground water in dry seasons, lowering the aquifers by pumping through tube wells, and on drainage during rainy periods."

Flooding also forced 3,000 people in the western Rakhine state to relocate, the disaster management department said Days of heavy monsoon rain and dangerously high river levels in Myanmar have forced more than 18,000 people from their homes and flooded at least one camp for people displaced by recent fighting, authorities and a politician said on Monday. Four towns along the Ayeyarwady and Chindwin rivers were in danger of being inundated as the rivers rose, the Department of Disaster Management said. ""We are working together with local authorities helping the people and providing food,"" said the department's director, Phyu Lai Lai Htun.

The northern state of Kachin was the worst affected, with 14,000 people forced from their homes near the banks of the Ayeyarwady river. Media published photographs showing submerged houses, vehicles and roads in Myitkyina, the state's capital. Flooding also forced 3,000 people in the western Rakhine state to relocate, the disaster management department said. They included some of the thousands displaced by fighting between the military and the Arakan Army insurgent group since late last year, according to Tun Aung Kyaw, secretary of the Arakan National Party, who visited a camp for several hundred displaced people near the ancient city of Mrauk-U. ""The whole camp is flooded and people are desperately in need of immediate shelter and food,"" he told Reuters by telephone. Myanmar has restricted access to the conflict zone for most international aid agencies. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a Facebook post it was helping the government respond to the flooding, while the Myanmar Red Cross, aid groups and private donors were also aiding the victims. ""We are working closely with authorities and stand ready to support the government's response,"" Knut Ostby, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator, said on Twitter."

The second severe storm in a week to hit Britain brought high winds of more than 140km an hour and more than a month's worth of rain in 48 hours in some places, leading officials to issue rare ""danger to life"" warnings. The storm also pummelled much of France, with some 20,000 people still without electricity on Monday after suffering power cuts in the northwest of the country and rail traffic disrupted. ""This is not yet over,"" warned James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, which is responsible for flood protection in England. ""We still have many flood warnings in force and we may still see significant flooding in the middle of this week from larger rivers,"" he told BBC radio. Bevan said more than 400 homes in England had been flooded while at least 1,000 agency staff were working around the clock alongside emergency officials ""to protect and support those communities which have been hit."" Major incidents declared More than 600 warnings and alerts - a record number - were issued on Sunday, extending from the River Tweed on the border of England and Scotland, to Cornwall in southwest England. After a day of torrential rain, major flooding incidents were later declared in south Wales and parts of western England. Some five ""severe"" warnings - denoting lives could be endangered by the flooding - remained active Monday on two rivers in Worcestershire and Herefordshire in west central England. Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue service on Sunday airlifted to hospital one man pulled from the River Teme, who was in a stable condition on Monday. But emergency responders suspended the search overnight for a missing woman also swept away by the floodwater near the town of flood-prone town of Tenbury, according to police. ""The search has continued this morning, including the use of the police helicopter,"" said Chief Superintendent Tom Harding, from West Mercia Police. ""Sadly, however, due to the circumstances of the length of time in the water and other conditions we believe that this will now be a recovery rather than rescue operation."" Two rivers in south Wales burst their banks, prompting rescue workers to launch operations in several places to evacuate people and their pets trapped in their homes. Police said a man in his 60s died after entering the River Tawe, north of the Welsh city of Swansea but later clarified that the death was not ""linked to the adverse weather."" On Saturday, the coastguard said the bodies of two men were pulled from rough seas off the south coast of England as the storm barrelled in. One is thought to have been the subject of a search triggered when a tanker reported that one of its crew was unaccounted for. 'More extreme' In northern England, the defence ministry deployed troops in West Yorkshire, which suffered badly from flooding caused by last weekend's Storm Ciara. There are fears rivers there could burst their banks later on Monday. Newly appointed environment secretary George Eustice said the government had done ""everything that we can do with a significant sum of money"" to combat increased flooding. ""We'll never be able to protect every single household just because of the nature of climate change and the fact that these weather events are becoming more extreme."" France was also affected by the storm, especially northwestern Brittany where the Finistere and Morbihan regions were temporarily placed on orange alert for rain and flooding, according to the national weather service Meteo-France. Electricity provider Enedis said it had deployed 450 staff to restore power to 30,000 homes in Brittany. Power cuts also hit parts of northern and central France. The storm interrupted two high-speed TGV train services, one stopped by a fallen tree and the other by a power failure, the national rail company SNCF said."

In an appeal to the General Assembly, the Foreign Minister of Bangladesh said today that a permanent solution to the country's annual flood disasters must be reached through regional cooperation with international support.
The remarks of the Bangladeshi minister, Humayun Rasheed Choudhury, were seen as an implicit criticism of India, which has thus far resisted any ''internationalization'' of the issue.
After last month's devastating flood, which was the worst in the country's history, the President of Bangladesh, Lieut. Gen. H. M. Ershad, reached individual agreements with India and other neighboring countries for cooperation. But he has thus far failed to win sufficient support for a regional response to the flooding.
''What we want is a regional water authority, including the five concerned countries, to regulate and harness water resources for the benefit of all,'' Mr. Choudhury said in an interview before his address. This would mean no diversion of water, construction of dams or other such projects, without common consent, he said. Looking to Dutch and Germans
He said such a regional agency would need international support both in technology and financing because of the magnitude of the problem. Specifically, it would look for technological help from the Netherlands and West Germany, ''which have cooperated successfully in taming the Rhine,'' he said.
Bangladesh and India have been at odds for some time over the control of the waters of the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and other common rivers. Bangladesh accuses India of permitting rampant deforestation that has resulted in flooding, and building dams that divert badly needed water from Bangladesh in the dry season. Specifically, these officials are concerned over an Indian proposal to build a canal across Bangladesh to drain water from the Brahmaputra to the Ganges system.
The Bangladeshi official said his Government has tried to generate enthusiasm for regional cooperation. Ershad and Gandhi Meet
He noted that General Ershad and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India agreed late last month to set up a joint task force to study the flood management and water flow of the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers. Subsequently, the President visited Nepal, and it was agreed to set up a joint study team on the problem. He will also visit Bhutan this week and later China to take up the same issue.
Referring to the recent catastrophic flood, Mr. Choudhury said 1,250,000 houses were destroyed, leaving about eight million people homeless. More than 2,000 deaths have been attributed to the flooding.
The Foreign Minister said the country's ''highest priority needs'' are now wheat and construction materials.
Emphasizing the need for a permanent solution to the problem, he said, ''The primary imperative will be in harnessing regional cooperation among all our concerned neighbors with a view to arriving at coherent and well-coordinated policies and plans to our mutual benefit.''"

With two jerrycans in hand, Muklesha Khatun waited impatiently for about four hours for the water trucks to arrive, and finally took home her allotted daily quota, two gallons.
''I have to make do with these two pots for my entire family of five,'' Mrs. Khatun said, ''but in a way I'm thankful to Allah that we're still getting it.''
Mrs. Khatun, 45 years old, is one of about 30,000 residents of the overcrowded, low-lying neighborhood of Mugdapara here in the capital who have been at the mercy of such erratic water deliveries since Bangladesh was inundated with widespread flooding late last month. It is estimated that at least a third of the capital's five million people have been without regular water supplies because of the flooding.
With reservoir tanks and pumping stations submerged in many areas, hundreds of thousands of people are now dependent on drinking water brought from outside. The water and sewerage authority and political and volunteer organizations have mounted a major operation to bring drinking water to the affected areas, but, as Mrs. Khatun's experience shows, their efforts sometimes fall short.
Much of the country is still under water. The Government says that 935 people have died in the flooding, but its count is generally considered too low, and Dhaka newspapers put the toll at more than 1,800. The Health Ministry says that about 220,000 people are suffering from gastrointestinal diseases like diarrhea and dysentery as a result of the flooding, and that 185 people have died from such diseases. [ Railroad service from Dhaka to Chittagong, the main port, and Sylhet, the business center, has been restored after repairs to a railroad bridge outside the capital, Reuters reported. The bridge was washed away two weeks ago in the flooding. ] Getting water to Mugdapara, Mrs. Khatun's neighborhood, is an arduous and time-consuming exercise.
Volunteers of the Family Planning Association of Bangladesh must first negotiate by rickshaw through waterlogged roads to reach the municipal pumping station, where their drums are filled. The drums are taken by pickup truck for a distance, but transferred again to rickshaws for delivery through streets where the water is still too deep. A stretch of mud has to be covered by men who carry the drums on their heads. Finally, when the drums reach the neighborhood, they are loaded onto boats that set off down serpentine lanes and bylanes to the community center, where the family planning association has set up its distribution camp.
''It's a killing job,'' said Kazi Anisur Rahman, secretary general of the association. ''We spend nearly two hours to deliver five drums to this area less than three miles from our headquarters.'' Land for Dead and Living
The wan smile never left Nuruddin Mia's face as he wearily maneuvered his boat past submerged trees and houses under a blazing sun, on his way to Paschimgaon, a village of about 5,000 people 12 miles southwest of Dhaka.
For 30 years, Mr. Mia, who is from the village, has been ferrying people to and from the village of Demraghat three miles away. His route is the Balu River, which in the flooding has become a huge lake stretching as far as the eye can see.
''Never, ever have I heard or seen such a flood and horror in my life,'' said Mr. Mia, who is 46. ''There's not a single house in this area that has escaped its wrath.''
His own house has been inundated by waist-deep water and looks as if it might crumble at any moment.
Mr. Mia and his 18-year-old son, Sohrab Hossain, spend nights in the boat. The other five members of his family sleep on the tin roof of the house, exposed to the elements. ''My own nephew, born 20 days ago, died of cold, and there is no doctor here who could be consulted with,'' he said.
He said the family had a hard time finding a dry spot where the body could be buried. ''Ultimately we took him to an adjoining area where a small parcel of land was found and we buried him there,'' he said.
The parcel holding the burial site is also haven for at least 200 people, mostly women and children huddling together with cattle, ducks and chickens.
''This flood has leveled everybody -rich and poor, high and low,'' said Janab Ali Matbar, 65, the village headman. 'Living Like Animals'
In another neighborhood, 30 minutes ride by boat, an incomplete two-story rural health center converted into a relief camp houses more than 300 men, women and children. Of the four toilets in the building, two in the ground floor are under water, so many of those taking refuge in the building relieve themselves in the surrounding flood water. Many people were seen bathing and washing in the contaminated water.
''You can't really call it life,'' said Rafiqul Islam Khandker, 40, who is in charge of the camp and who is also the headmaster of the local high school. ''They're living like animals.'' Still, many of those in the center appeared grateful to have found a place where one meal is provided daily, since they are extremely poor even in their normal circumstances.
Mr. Khandker said that there have been surprisingly few cases of diarrhea, dysentery and flu, diseases normally inevitable in such conditions.
''There's no death yet due to these diseases,'' Mr. Khandker said.
Azimul Baki, a rural health assistant, interjected: ''If there is any, we simply have to put the dead on a makeshift raft for lack of dry space for burial.''"

Locals fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands An embankment of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) has collapsed in Kola village of Satkhira's Assasuni upazila, flooding over 1,500 bighas of land, fish enclosures on Friday. Four villages of Pratapnagar and Shriula unions went underwater as the 120 ft BWDB embankment of Zone-2 suddenly collapsed, locals said. Many local residents have started volunteering to repair the embankment with whatever materials currently available. They fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands. On a field visit, thousands of villagers were seen to have volunteered to construct a temporary embankment while the district administration is said to have been busy controlling the coronavirus outbreak in the area. Moreover, the Kopotakkho River embankment collapsed earlier on April 8, flooding 1,000 bighas of farmlands and fish enclosures in three low-lying villages of the same area, waterlogging around 50 families in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishti Nandan villages under Pratapnagar union.  Locals say the 100-ft dam was already in a risky state, so it naturally could not sustain the strong pressure of tidal current and collapsed into the bottom of the Kopotakkho River. Contacted,  Pratapnagar Union Parishad Chairman Jakir Hossain held the water development board responsible in this regard, saying it was their negligence that led to the collapse of the embankment every year. ""Despite repeated complaints and appeals seeking sustainable protection of the embankment, the water development board failed to acknowledge the urgency of the issue.  ""Now, due to this recklessness, farmlands and fish enclosures on around 2,500 bigha of land have been flooded in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishtinandan villages. Moreover, almost 50 families have become waterlogged after two back-to-back incidents of flooding.""  Md Arifuzzaman, of the local water development board, after visiting the site said he had arranged sandbags for the temporary emergency repair of the damaged embankment to minimize the extent of damage and protect the remaining lands.  ""The higher authorities will be notified promptly so that the necessary steps may be taken to permanently repair embankment."""

The river has already devoured at least 28 dwellings, in areas under the union, in the last two days. According to villagers, the disaster occurred due to continuous sand lifting by unscrupulous traders.  The authorities dumped geo-bags but failed to prevent the erosion that left at least 28 families homeless. Although law prohibits sand lifting within a six-kilometre radius of a bridge, a syndicate of influential traders, having political connections, continued lifting sand near the bridge with powerful dredgers, the villagers said. Over 20,000 people in the union are under the threat of erosion, and are passing their days in panic. When Gorilabari village was visited yesterday, the villagers expressed grave concerns.

Bangladesh television reported tonight that more than 350 people had been killed in the Khulna area.
Officials were especially concerned about casualties in Dublarchar Island in the Bay of Bengal, about 300 miles southwest of Dhaka, where it is estimated that 1,000 people, mostly fishermen, may have been carried away by a tidal surge. A naval ship sent to the area has so far recovered 102 bodies."

The flood waters of Pachil village in Sirajganj's Shahzadpur upazila have started to recede. But that does not matter to Ahed Ali. The furious Jamuna has devoured his home, even the land on which his humble abode stood.  For over a month, Ahed, along with his family of five, and other flood victims, have taken shelter on a nearby field. They all have to pay a small sum of rent to occupy that space as well. ""The water started gushing in by the first week of July. There was no scope to stay back. Now, everything has been washed away. There is no land to rebuild my home and no money to start afresh either,"" he said. Anji Khatun, of nearby Dadaspanchi village, returned from the shelter to see that her home has been damaged. She had no choice but to borrow Tk 20,000 at a high rate of interest from a local money lender to repair her home. ""My daughters and I took shelter in the flood protection embankment for three weeks. Nobody is coming forward to help us, not even the government."" Anji was lucky that she found someone to borrow money from. But Maleka Begum of Potajia Nishipara village in the same upazila, not so much. No one is willing to lend money to her. Tying up some bamboo sticks with rope, she has repaired her home. The wind or rain can blow away the repairs at any time, she said, as she continues to live perilously. ""My husband is a poor day labourer. He had no work in the last one month. We have no place to live, no food to eat even."" All the victims said they lost everything in the last three weeks, but they did not get any help for rehabilitation. Md Chand Ali of Potajia village said, ""During the flood, we were given seven to eight kilograms of rice as relief material."" It was enough to last a week for a family of five. ""We are in dire need of assistance to rebuild our homes."" Over 3,079 families of 408 villages in five upazilas of Sirajganj were displaced by the recent flood. A total of 15,434 people have been hit hard, while 313,997 people were partially affected, according to Sirajganj Relief and Rehabilitation Office. A total of 6,505 houses were entirely damaged, while 44,013 were partially damaged. ""We have reported these figures to the ministry of relief and rehabilitation. They have allotted 1,570 bundles of corrugated iron sheets to rehabilitate the flood victims. The allotment is likely to reach Sirajganj soon,"" Sirajganj Deputy Commissioner (DC) Dr Faruk Ahmed told the Daily Star recently. Not just home, roads, culverts, croplands, ponds and many educational institutions have been battered by the flood. Officials concerned at the district administration have pinned losses at Tk 200 crore this year. Total actual losses cannot be ascertained yet, as many areas are still under water. ""Although the water level was dropped below the danger level now, flooding has not left yet. There are many areas in Belkuchi, Kazipur, Chowhali and Shahzadpur that are still water logged,"" said Md Rafikul Islam, Sirajganj divisional engineer of Water Development Board. The flood water is likely to remain till the end of September, which will add to the misery of the people in these areas, he added. A total of 21,000 hectares of croplands were inundated and crops on 14,000 hectares were completely damaged, said Md Habibul Haque, deputy director of Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in Sirajganj. He assumes the damage to agriculture to be worth Tk 134 crore. ""The agriculture sector has suffered the most due to the flood. We have submitted the flood loss report to the ministry, seeking rehabilitation funds."" ""We are currently taking preparations for 30-acre seed beds and 56 floating seed beds in the district to assist the victim farmers after the water recedes,"" he said. Meanwhile, the district has lost eight primary schools to river erosion. There is no existence left of those institutions, said Md. Eusuf Reza, Sirajganj primary education officer. At the same time, 162 primary schools were partially damaged, he added. ""We could not calculate the total loss yet, but we are estimating it at around Tk 1.85 crore."" All academic activities are stalled since July. ""We hope to resume studies after we complete the repair works after Eid,"" he added. Sirajganj District Educational Officer Md Shafiulla said 65 high schools and colleges have also been damaged. He expects repair work to start soon. Fish cultivation took a hit in Chalanbeel areas of Sirajganj. A total of 116.75 hectares of fishing areas were affected, washing away 110.73 tonnes of fish and 1.27 crore fish fry worth Tk 4.17 crore, said Md Shahed Ali, Sirajganj district fishery officer. ""We are expecting rehabilitation funds for the worst-hit fish farmers."" The flood has destroyed 134 acres of hybrid grass fields. The loss can be estimated at Tk 75 lakh, said Akhteruzaman Vuia, district livestock officer. The flood claimed the lives of 4 cows and 3,885 chicken. Although the flood did not hurt the animals directly, the cattle farmers face massive losses for fodder crisis. Besides, a total of 55.34 kilometres of roads were totally damaged, while 180 km partially, said Md Mizanur Rahman, executive engineer of Sirajganj LGED. Twenty-nine culverts were also damaged. Several roads are still inundated, so the actual loss is still unknown, he said. Sirajganj is one of the biggest handloom and power loom producing areas in the country. Samen Ali of Saydabad Modhhyapara in Sirajganj Sadar upazila said, ""I set up a handloom factory by borrowing money from a local NGO a couple of years ago. But the recent flood destroyed my factory, taking away the lone source of income for my family."" ""I don't know how I will repay the loan instalments now."" Like him, most weavers in five upazilas are facing a crisis. Total damage to the sector is yet to be determined. As the flood water recedes, Jamuna river is devouring houses and crop lands at several points of Sirajganj Sadar, Chowhali, Shahzadpur, Kazipur and Belkuchi upazila, said Sirajganj divisional WDB engineer Rafikul Islam. This is casual river erosion, he added. ""According to the characteristics of Jamuna, the river banks erode both then the water level rises and drops. We have nothing to do at this moment. At the end of the flood, we can take steps to save damage for the next time."" Sirajganj district administration has complied a flood loss report from different departments. But the fund allotment for rehabilitation is yet to be allotted. ""We will start rehabilitation work after getting the funds,"" DC Dr Faruk said."

Surging waters broke through embankments surrounding an island in Bangladesh's Noakhali district, destroying more than 500 homes A powerful cyclone pounded eastern India and Bangladesh on Wednesday, killing at least 14 people and destroying thousands of homes, officials said, leaving authorities struggling to mount relief efforts amid a surging coronavirus outbreak. The populous Indian state of West Bengal took the brunt of Cyclone Amphan, which barrelled out of the Bay of Bengal with gusting winds of up to 185 km per hour (115 mph) and a storm surge of around five metres. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said at least 10 people had died in the state, and two districts been completely battered by one of the strongest storms to hit the region in several years. ""Area after area has been devastated. Communications are disrupted,"" Banerjee said, adding that although 500,000 people had been evacuated, state authorities had not entirely anticipated the ferocity of the storm. With rains continuing, she said the hardest hits areas were not immediately accessible. Federal authorities said they could only make a proper assessment of the destruction on Thursday morning. ""We are facing greater damage and devastation than the Covid-19,"" Banerjee said, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has so far killed 250 people in the state. In West Bengal's capital city, Kolkata, strong winds upturned cars and felled trees and electricity poles. Parts of the city were plunged into darkness. An official in the adjoining Hooghly district said thousands of mud homes were damaged by raging winds. In neighbouring Bangladesh, at least four people were killed, officials said, with power supplies cut off in some districts. Authorities there had shifted around 2.4 million people to more than 15,000 storm shelters this week. Bangladeshi officials also said they had moved hundreds of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, living on a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, to shelter. But officials said they feared that standing crops could be damaged and large tracts of fertile land in the densely-populated country washed away.  ""Fortunately, the harvesting of the rice crop has almost been completed. Still it could leave a trail of destruction,"" said Mizanur Rahman Khan, a senior official in the Bangladesh agriculture ministry. Cyclones frequently batter parts of eastern India and Bangladesh between April and December, often forcing the evacuations of tens of thousands and causing widespread damage. Surge and high tide Surging waters broke through embankments surrounding an island in Bangladesh's Noakhali district, destroying more than 500 homes, local official Rezaul Karim said. ""We could avoid casualties as people were moved to cyclone centres earlier,"" Karim said. Embankments were also breached in West Bengal's Sundarban delta, where weather authorities had said the surge whipped up by the cyclone could inundate up to 15 km inland. The ecologically-fragile region straddling the Indian-Bangladesh border is best known for thick mangrove forests that are a critical tiger habitat, and is home to around 4 million people in India. On the Sundarbans' Ghoramara island, resident Sanjib Sagar said several embankments surrounding settlements had been damaged, and some flooding had started. ""A lot of houses have been damaged,"" he told Reuters by phone. Anamitra Anurag Danda, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation think-tank who has extensively studied the Sundarbans, said that embankments across the area may have been breached. ""The cyclone surge coincided with the new moon high tides. It is devastation in the coastal belt,"" he said."

Major flooding threatened several thousand homes on Monday in the Australian state of Queensland, forcing more than 1,100 people to be evacuated, after authorities opened up dam gates after days of torrential rains filled reservoirs to overflowing. Emergency services tackled thousands of calls from people overnight around the city of Townsville, where evacuation centres were filling up. Crocodiles were even spotted in suburban streets, pictures on social media showed. ""Once in a century event happening here. I have never seen the likes of this before,"" Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said in an interview on Australian Broadcasting Corp TV, in a state often hit by cyclones and flooding. Palaszczuk said there could be thousands of homes affected by the flooding. A record 1.16 metres (3.8 ft) of rain has fallen across the Townsville area over the past seven days, with another 100 millimetres expected to be dumped over the area on Monday, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Major flood warnings have been posted for several rivers. The weather bureau warned of ""dangerous and high velocity flows"" along the Ross River after the flood gates were opened fully at the Ross River dam on Sunday, releasing about 1,900 cubic metres of water a second. Even after the release, as of Monday morning, the dam was still at 229 percent capacity, holding about 532,000 gigalitres of water, or roughly as much as Sydney Harbour. ""We're hoping to see an easing trend from tomorrow,"" bureau spokeswoman Jess Gardner said, adding that the rains could move further south, towards Mackay, a major coal exporting area. Townsville, a major port for northern Australia, is the country's top exporter of copper, zinc, lead and sugar. The Port of Townsville remains open, but cargo loadings have faced interruptions due to heavy rain, a port spokeswoman said. She did not have details on specific shipments held up. Global miner Glencore Plc, which exports copper, zinc and lead from Townsville said as of late last week there had been no impact on its operations."

Hundreds of thousands more people in West Bengal state have also been given orders to flee At least two people died Friday as Cyclone Fani, the biggest in years, slammed into eastern India, sending coconut trees flying and cutting off power, water and telecommunications. The monster weather system made landfall at the holy city of Puri in the morning, with winds gusting at up to 200km per hour. In recent days authorities in Odisha state, where 10,000 people perished in a 1999 cyclone, evacuated more than a million people as they worried about a possible 5ft storm surge sweeping far inland. One man died of a heart attack in one of several thousand shelters set up, while another was killed by a falling tree on Friday, authorities said. Media reports put the death toll at up to six, but officials could not confirm this. Authorities in Bangladesh, where Fani was headed, said that 14 villages were inundated as flood dams broke due to a tidal surge.  Disaster management spokesman Mohammad Jahir told AFP that 400,000 people from Bangladeshi coastal villages have been taken to shelters. Hundreds of thousands more people in India's West Bengal state have also been given orders to flee. Local airports have been shut, while train lines and roads were closed. ""It just went dark and then suddenly we could barely see five metres in front of us,"" said one resident in Puri. ""There were the roadside food carts, store signs all flying by in the air,"" the man told AFP from a hotel where he took shelter. ""The wind is deafening."" Another witness said he saw a small car being blown along a street by the winds and then turned over. After pounding Puri and Odisha state capital Bhubaneswar and heading north-eastwards, losing strength as it goes, authorities were battling to remove fallen trees from roads and to restore phone and internet services. On Saturday Fani was expected in West Bangal's capital Kolkata, a city home to 4.5 million people. ""We are monitoring the situation 24x7 and doing all it takes. Be alert, take care and stay safe for the next two days,"" West Bengal's chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted. The winds were felt as far away as Mount Everest, with tents blown away at Camp 2 at 21,000ft and Nepali authorities cautioning helicopters against flying. Meanwhile a baby was born near Bhubaneswar just as the cyclone passed through. ""We are calling her Lady Fani as she was born when the hospital was hit,"" a spokesperson for the hospital told the Press Trust of India. Cyclone Fani makes landfall in eastern India: Met Office https://t.co/XGL0Ldd19a 'Total destruction' Meteorologists have warned of the ""total destruction"" of thatched houses, the uprooting of power and communication poles, the ""flooding of escape routes"" and damage to crops in some areas. Some 3,000 shelters in schools and government buildings were set up to accommodate more than a million people in Odisha, with families including women and babies huddled on the floor. Ports have been closed but the Indian Navy has sent six warships to the region while India's biggest oil and gas producer ONGC evacuated almost 500 workers from offshore rigs. Measures were also being taken to protect the 850-year-old Jagannath temple in Puri, a Hindu holy town normally thronging with pilgrims. AFP correspondents in the resort said it was a near ghost town with trees already torn down and water levels rising even before Fani's awesome arrival. Electricity and water supplies were already cut for much of the city of 200,000 people. Metal shutters covered store fronts and sand blew up the streets from the nearby beach. Only a few police vehicles and tractors trying to pull trees or push aside collapsed walls could be seen. Media reports said hundreds of trees were uprooted at the nearby Chilika Lake just south of Puri in the first violent winds. ""We will just stay for the day until the cyclone has passed. We are not scared but we feel safer here,"" said Krishna Chandra Sahu, 43, sheltering with seven members of his family in a hotel. "
448,"Flood-Ravaged Bangladesh Seeks Plan to Control Rivers
1988-09-09T05:00:00.000Z
The Government of Bangladesh, reacting to what may be the worst flood of the country's history, called today for an international panel of experts to devise plans to control the rivers of South Asia.
At a news conference here tonight, Bangladesh's Minister of Information, Mahbubur Rahman, announced that the Foreign Minister, Humayun Rashid Chowdhury, had called for the prompt convening of an international panel so that a plan for the river systems could be discussed in December at a summit meeting of nations in the region.
Earlier today, in an interview in a badly stricken area near the northern outpost of Ghatail, close to the Indian border, Mr. Rahman said that his country would seek to draw Nepal, Bhutan and India into substantive talks on the river systems.
He added that ''involving China may also be ultimately necessary,'' because of the proximity of Tibet.
It is in areas like Ghatail that the toll of the flooding, which began late last month, is most starkly revealed. Officials there think it will be three to six months before something resembling a normal existence returns. 'A Terrible Human Tragedy'
Brig. Gen. Subed Ali Bhuya and his infantry brigade there are feeding and housing nearly 30,000 people, 12,000 head of cattle and innumerable chickens and goats. ''Their houses were washed away,'' the general said today of the people who have converged on his garrison since Aug. 30, leading cattle and carrying what they could salvage of their homes. ''It was a terrible human tragedy.''
The flooding this year is unlike the expected annual inundation that comes with the monsoon season. It has been a sudden flood ''out of season,'' destroying the barriers and embankments that this impoverished country has managed to construct.
Bangladesh is on the receiving end of mighty river systems - among them the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Jamuna and Meghna - that descend from the Himalayas. From ancient times, it has been destined to suffer major floods with great regularity.
Adding to the problem in modern times, the great mountains of South Asia have become increasingly denuded and eroded in many places, and the cascade of earth and water each year grows more devastating to Bangladesh, which sprawls over delta after delta at the rivers' mouths.
If an international effort were to be mounted to control the rivers, the task would be mammoth, not only because of the technical challenges involved but also because of regional politics. India Called Key to Effort
No effective plan can be drawn up without the active support of the regional power, India. Although Bangladesh has sought to involve other neighbors, especially Nepal, where deforestation has also contributed to problems downriver, India continues to insist that the rivers are a matter for direct negotiation between New Delhi and Dhaka. But joint commissions have produced no comprehensive improvement.
In addition, relations between China and India have been cool since they fought a border war in the 1960's, and diplomats think India would be unlikely to welcome Chinese involvement in such talks.
The Government of Bangladesh today was decribing the floods as ''an unprecedented human tragedy.'' [ The Indian Government announced that it was sending two transport aircraft to drop food supplies to flood victims in Bangladesh.
An Indian spokesman said the craft are to carry about 30 tons of foodgrains on Friday and that four Indian helicopters already are assisting in relief work. ] No Place to Land a Helicopter In Ghatail, which is in one of the most severely affected parts of the country, nearly 100 percent of the farmland was under water today.
''There is no place to land even a helicopter,'' General Bhuya said of the outlying villages in this area in the Tangail district, nearly 100 miles north of Dhaka. Reporters were brought to the general's headquarters by a Bangladesh Air Force helicopter.
All of the district's 384,309 people have been dislocated, General Bhuya said. At least 247,670 houses have been damaged or destroyed.
The situation is as bad or worse across three-fourths of Bangladesh's land area and for most of the country's 110 million people. Unlike Ghatail, many other areas have no military base where refuge can be sought.
Amala Hussain, waiting with her seven children for a meal of rice taken from the rations of the men at the Ghatail garrison, said today that throughout her life of hardship as the wife of a landless tenant farmer she had ''never seen anything like this.''
At the garrison, medical treatment is administered by army doctors and there is clean water to drink, but when flood victims return home they will have no medicine to fight disease or snake bites. The national death toll from all causes during the flooding now stands at about 510."
