Most of these were built with the help of different sponsors. City corporation authorities are opposing these boxes as they do not get advertisement fees,\" he claimed."

      "text": "\nMost housing schemes in and around the capital under the Detailed Area Plan have gone haywire and entirely failed to meet conditions of the Private Housing Land Development Act 2004. \nAccording to a source in Rajuk, only 25 housing schemes of only 13 companies got Rajuk final approval while six temporary approval. The final approval for those six schemes remain pending. \nA large number of other such schemes of land developers have failed to obtain Rajuk approval while the government mulls over reviewing the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) for giving a further controversial approval to those unapproved schemes.  \nOn condition of anonymity, a Rajuk official alleged that the Capital Development Authority and the Ministry of Housing and Public Works had been mulling over a plan to give such approval to the mushrooming housing projects in wetlands under DAP without taking into consideration the environmental protection. \nThe official also said a review committee on DAP at the ministerial meetings recently focused on relaxation of using wetlands and few water bodies for the housing projects. \nThe State Minister for Housing and Public Works advocate Abdul Mannan Khan told the Dhaka Tribune the final decision was yet to be made on whether to review the DAP. \nHe said the DAP review issue will be tabled in the upcoming interministerial meeting to reach the final decision. \nAsked whether the review was for the interest of land developers and going to be conflicted with the 2004 private land development act, he said he was unable to say anything in advance because the decision would solely be made at the next meeting.  \nIt was also learnt that more 400 appeals from housing developers had been lodged with Rajuk for changing their land use plans within DAP area only to advance their housing schemes. \nFrom 1984 to date, only 25 schemes of 13 housing companies got Rajuk approval. \nThe 25 are 30.44-acre Pallabi Residential Project (Phase-1), 32.9-acre Arambagh Cooperative Housing Society (Mirpur Land Project), 3.54-acre Kallyanpur Land Project, 1310-acre Bonosree Residential Project, 197.21-acre Metropolitan Project, 232.27-acre Pallabi Residential Project (Phase-2), 3.74-acre Baghbari Shishmahal Land Project, 1.33-acre KM Das Lane Residential Project, 3.32-acre Rayerbazar Project, 2.22-acre Postogola Residential Project, 9.59-acre Postogola Riverview Land Project, 3.03-acre Basabo Residential Project and 58.64-acre Niketon Residential Project. \nAll the housing schemes belonged to the Eastern Housing Ltd.  \nMoreover, the 12-acre Baitul Aman Cooperative Housing Project, 45.81-acre Mohammadpur Housing Pisciculture and Farming Cooperative Society Housing, 1.49-acre Adarsha Sayaneer Housing Cooperative Ltd's Sayaneer Project, 40.95-acre Sikder Real Estate Project, 10.15-acre Abdur Rafique Housing  Ltd's Mohammadpur Project, 18.71-acre Sunibir Greho Nirman Coopetative Housing Project, five-acre Metropolitan Christian Cooperative Housing Project, 6.13-acre Cap Hason Housing Project, 305-acre East West Property Development Pvt Ltd Bashundhara Project (Phase-1) 4.63-acre Janata Housing Cooperative Society Project, 4.53-acre Mukti Housing Project, 4.53-acre Mollika Residential Project under Sheltech Pvt Ltd and 2.8-acre Probal Housing Project have also got Rajuk approval. \nIn 2012, as per the directives of the housing ministry, Rajuk gave final approval to a number of six schemes of six companies including Bashundhara-Baridhara Project (Phase-2) of East West Property Pvt Ltd, Ashiyan City, 137.2145-acre United City Residential Project (Phase-1) of Neptune Land Development Ltd, 172.63-acre Notundhara Residential Project of BDDL, 148.73-acre Green Model Town Residential Project (Phase-1) under Amin Mohammad Lands Development and 75.17-acre Swarnali Abashan Project (Phase- 1) of Swadesh Properties. \nThe six had been illegally developed destroying wetlands, flood plains, cropland and rural homesteads in violation of the Private Housing Development Act 2004 and the conditions of DAP. \nThe six housing schemes are among the 77 housing development projects declared illegal by the High Court in June, 2011. \nThe HC also had directed the government to take action against the project authorities who grabbed those land over the past decades by filling up low-lying wetland, water bodies and rural homesteads. \nMoreover, the six housing projects failed to meet conditions of standard housing facilities. \nThe optimum utility services and basic amenities including market, hospital, drugstores, educational institutions, playground, graveyard etc. within the vicinities - major conditions of the housing act - lacked those schemes. \nMoreover, these schemes do not conform to their layouts and Geographic Information System (GIS) database, which are also violation of the private housing act. \nRajuk authorities said they gave temporary approval to the six companies which were being evaluated and letters were issued to the companies to revise their housing plans. \nSheikh Abdul Mannan, Rajuk member, planning, told the Dhaka Tribune \"We have just given temporary approval to the six housing projects. The projects' authorities are trying to fulfill the private housing conditions of 2004.\" \n\"When they are able to meet the conditions, they will get Rajuk final approval,\" he added. \nIn reply to a query, Abdul Mannan said not only those six housing schemes, but also other such schemes would get Rajuk approval provided they fulfilled the Private Housing Land Development Act."

The society's President Firoz M Hassan inaugurated the recycling management system at a programme - Value for Waste Project - held at Baridhara Lakeside Rajuk Park, in presence of other leaders of the society, locals, media and cultural personalities. \"Applying the recycling system that is a barrel composting method, it would be possible that 40 to 48 percent of kitchen wastes will turn into high quality compost of organic fertilzer. Thus, a huge amount of wastes would not be required to be dumped at the landfills,\" said Firoz M Hassan at the inauguration. At the same time, the society also inaugurated a tree plantation programme which expects to plant some 500 saplings on the lakeside park. \"The system is affordable, environment-friendly and would be able to create a financial source which is important for the country,\" he added. Earlier in January, the new waste recycling project was introduced in the community based waste recycling system this year, funded by Swisscontact and Pran-RFL. Firoz also claimed though the recycling system has been inaugurated recently, it had started in January of this year and the initiatives had been introduced in September-October, 2013. The inauguration ceremony was also addressed by Badiur Rahman, former president of Baridhara Society, English daily the News Today Editor Riaz Uddin Ahmed, Ekattor Television Director Syed Ishtiaque Reza, Singer Samina Chowdhury, among others. The new recycling system asks kitchen wastes to be separated in four categories using containers of four different colours - green, yellow, red and blue - to recycle them properly."

      "text": "Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said military dictator General Ziaur Rahman wanted to erase the name of Awami League after the brutal assassination of Bangabandhu as he (Zia) considered the party his main enemy. She said General Zia was appointed army chief by Khandakar Moshtaque and he was made the president and army chief simultaneously as he forced the then president Justice ASM Sayem to step down at gunpoint. \"After becoming president, General Zia wanted to destroy the signs and spirit of the War of Liberation side by side with erasing the name of Awami League,\" she said, adding the anti-liberation forces emerged during his misrule. Sheikh Hasina, also the Awami League president, told leaders of Awami League and its associate bodies who came to her Ganobhaban residence here this morning on the occasion of her 33rd Homecoming Day. Senior Awami League leaders including Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Begum Matia Chowdhury, Obaidul Quader, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Advocate Sahara Khatun, Syed Ashraful Islam and PM's Advisor HT Imam were present, among others. On this day in 1981, Sheikh Hasina returned home after six years in exile following the brutal assassination of the architect of independent Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members on August 15 in 1975. Sheikh Hasina and her younger sister Sheikh Rehana escaped the carnage as they were in Germany at that time. The Prime Minister said General Zia grabbed the state power by violating the constitution. \"The country witnessed frequent coups during his rule and he killed sector commanders of the War of Liberation one after another,\" she said. Earlier, the leaders of Bangladesh Awami League and its associate bodies greeted the Prime Minister by presenting bouquets and chanting slogans on the occasion of the Homecoming Day.  In an emotion-charged voice, the Prime Minister said after the assassination of Bangabandhu, four national leaders were brutally killed and numerous leaders and workers of the party were thrown into jail to eliminate Awami League. Recalling her Homecoming Day on May 17 in 1981, Sheikh Hasina said she returned home on a rainy and stormy day when thousands of people braving the inclement weather assembled at the airport to welcome her. \"When I returned home I didn't have any asset except the courage and inspiration of the Awami League leaders and workers,\" she said. \"When I returned home, there was a flood of millions of people and there was love for me. But my most beloved persons whose love I expected most were not there,\" she said referring to the killing of Bangabandhu and others who were assassinated on the fateful night of August 15. While recalling her tragic and terrible days, the Prime Minister became emotional and tears rolled down her cheek. Sheikh Hasina said General Zia ran the country by imposing curfew at night. \"Rehana and I were not allowed to enter our historic Dhanmondi 32 residence. We were even barred to hold milad at our house,\" she said. The Prime Minister said they used to spend time on the bank of Dhanmondi Lake. \"The sufferers could only say what frightful days we passed at that time,\" she said. After my coming back home, my number one thought was to put the country back on the path of democracy along with materializing the dream of Bangabandhu and strengthening the party. \"I could not think where we would stay and what we would eat,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said when she returned home she saw that the country went against the War of Liberation and the anti-liberation forces were running Bangladesh under the patronization of General Zia. "

      "text": "According to local sources, Max Group of Company Ltd is lifting sand from the river in Korfa, Charfukra, Joybangla ferry ghat and Charkalna ferry ghat in Sadar upazila violating the government rule. The company took responsibility from Bangladesh Railway to repair the Kashiani-Bhatiapara-Gopalganj route. The company started to repair the route with the sand of four sand quarries of Kashiani upazila after taking lease from deputy commissioner office. The sources said the company people did not follow the government rule while they were lifting sand from the river. They had crossed the limit and lifted sand from another place of the river beyond their lease, added the sources. Locals alleged that the Water Development Board (WDB) has built town protection embankment which is now at risk due to random sand lifting.  Executive Engineer of WDB Mohiuddin submitted a memorandum on August 18, to the deputy commissioner protesting illegal sand lifting by the company men. Max Group Surveyor Monwar Hossain was told to lift sand following the government rule. But the company did not follow the advice, said Mohiuddin. Locals also submitted memorandum to the DC protesting the illegal sand lifting.  Dabiruddin of Charkalna area said the company people were lifting sand in their area which was not taken as lease by DC office. Osman Ali of Charfukra area said flood protection dam in Shankarpasha and Fukra areas got damaged due to unplanned sand lifting from the river bed. Houses, schools, colleges, madrasas and many other establishments in the area were on the verge of extinction due to sand lifting, said locals.  Locals and the company people got locked into clashes several times over the issue, said sources. Seeking anonymity, some people in the area said ruling party men were involved with the company men. When the local people protested the illegal sand lifting the ruling party musclemen including police personnel harassed them.  Selim Khan, a resident of Fukra area, of the upzila, said: \"I have lost my cropland near the river due to illegal sand lifting. When I started protesting, police picked up me and tortured brutally.\" Later, I got released in-exchange of money, he added. Firoz Khan, another resident of the area, said: \"I am going to loss six acres of land for illegal sand lifting.\" Kamrul Hasan, assistant commissioner of Kashiani upazila, said : \"We have alerted Max Company project manager several times, but they did not pay heed to our appeal.\" Abdul Ohab, manager of the company, said they would take steps if there was their fault.  DC Moklessur Rahman said he could not say anything in this regard as he had taken charge only few days before. "

Despite the pouring, Dhaka's citizens went to say their Eid prayers in the morning and sacrificed their animals.\nAs rainwater built up on the roads of Dhaka and flooded many areas of the capital it got mixed with the blood to create an unusual and gory scene; it appeared as though there were red rivers running across the city.\nCitizens have strongly criticised the two city corporations in charge of cleaning the sacrificial waste for this situation.\n[caption id=\"attachment_16064\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"342\"] Photo collected from Facebook[/caption]\nMany said the incident showed how the city corporations had failed to keep the city's drainage systems functional and had paid no attention to the matter before Eid.\nThe two city corporations designated 1,000 spots - 496 in the north and 504 in the south - for slaughtering animals.\nHowever from around 7.30am in the morning, many people were seen slaughtering animals in the streets and their convenient places in several areas including Mohammadpur, Mirpur, Shyamoli, Uttara, Dhanmondi, Niketon.\nThe roads soon filled up with blood and waste.\n \n[caption id=\"attachment_16057\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1024\"] Rainwater mixes with blood from animal sacrifice in Malibagh, Dhaka/Photo: Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\n \nCity dwellers say lack of campaigning was the main reason behind the situation. Also, the places were far away from their homes, some said.\n\"Last year the city corporations launched a mass campaign to encourage people to use the designated spots and that caught our eyes. I went to a spot in Mohammadpur last year, but this year, I don't even know where the spots actually are,\" said Tareq Ahmed, a resident of Shyamoli.\n[caption id=\"attachment_16063\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"488\"] The blood flood spilled on to the main streets at the Shantinagar intersection/Photo: Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nIn Malibagh, Baily Road, Shantinagar, Bijoynagar, Paltan, Motijheel, Jatrabari, Bakshi Bazar and Kathalbagan area, Dhaka Tribune reporters found people are sacrificing their animals in front of their homes or other places nearby.\nDhaka South City Corporation's Deputy Chief waste management official Khandker Millatul Islam said that water logging in the capital was an old problem.\n\"We are still working to solve this issue,\" he admitted.\n\"We have already ordered Maniknagar Wasa pump to start working, so we are hoping that very soon the water-logging problem will be solved,\" he added.\n[video poster=\"https://media.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2015/01/default-image2-1.jpg\" width=\"568\" height=\"320\" mp4=\"https://media.dhakatribune.com/uploads/2016/09/47d232d2-7c35-4ba9-9a53-7aedd5e2a67f_1_.mp4\"][/video]\nThis video from Malibagh shows a scene of standing rainwater mixed with blood.

      "text": "I readily recall my first visit to Wari Bateshwar. Accompanied by the excellent Professor Sufi Rahman and his friend, a geologist, we walked from our vehicle across rice fields that were obviously part of the very wide and evident moat to the gap in the mud rampart. It was impossible to tell the period of moat and rampart through which we passed, onto open farm land, although they bore a remarkable resemblance to Iron Age encampments in the UK. We were greeted by kids bearing their latest surface finds, a bead or two, amongst them; finds encouraged by the professor in his work of community engagement, such as I had rarely experienced in the UK. I wondered if, introduced to such tangible evidence of heritage from such an early age, their obvious engagement and interest could endure. Such involvement, and the finds were perhaps unsurprising on an already widely acknowledged archaeological site, carefully managed under the \"community archaeology\" philosophy I came to admire at various archaeological sites I subsequently visited in Bangladesh. But it was, I suppose, the bracelet proudly shown me, later in the visit, by the wife of a local farmer, comprising of beads, readily identified to me as dating probably from the late centuries BCE, that truly stirred my imagination. They comprised, for the most part, agates, but also an identifiable amethyst and jade. What jeweller, I wondered, crafted these beads of semi-precious stones? Who were the women, perhaps even the men, for whom the wearing of the beads represented such a show of status and wealth? At that point, I could not imagine. But, above all, who were the craftsmen, and women, perhaps, who cut them so finely? Subsequent travels in Bangladesh revealed to me such a huge array of  buildings from late centuries BCE onward, and evidence of other craft skills such as sculpture, that I became entirely enraptured by the evidence of history, heritage, and culture; it would be fair to say I fell completely in love. Since then, taking advantage of the massive library of the world wide web, I have never ceased to research, and write, of that history and heritage, and the culture that evolved from it. Jahangirnagar University, I was told, had \"tens of thousands\" of such beads from the site, and other sites around Bangladesh. Nothing could have convinced me, more surely, not only of the very rich history of Bangladesh that already intrigued me, but also seeing the beads proudly worn by a local woman, of the flesh and blood of that history. In the years since, I have researched and written hundreds of thousands of words about the amazing peoples of these lands, and, certainly weekly, developed ever newer insights into the nation's history as yet mostly untold. Academic writers, of course, are usually tasked with evidence and with references for \"peer group\" revue. Sadly, Bangladesh, as a nation, seems lacking in much speculative history, the foundations of such study, as western nations enjoyed for centuries. Who has never unwrapped a seasonal gift, and found within the wrapping the key to something that can bring excitement and pleasure for a lifetime? For some, these days it is the laptop, the tablet, the smart phone, that first opens to a youth a world of information, communication, and entertainment. Such a pity, perhaps, that it often appears to be the minutiae of the life, loves, and passions of those who strive for fortunes through fame that seems to engross so many of those young people today, rather than seeking to explore their own, incredible, world leading, past, which can offer such potential for a richer present. An unparalleled heritage to bequeath their own descendants. \"Too much information,\" is a phrase, too, that describes the limitation of the use of intelligence and insight, to follow clues, to speculate, discover, and confirm realities. Often, however, it requires only the self to wrap and gift that incredible past to the present. My own lifelong fascination with history, and the doors it opens to understanding both heritage and a true cultural appreciation, commenced, unforgettably, at a tender age, long pre-teen, in a remote, rural corner of Berkshire, the original Berkshire, in Britain, called Silchester. Was that, I wonder, my first \"moment of Zen?\" Certainly it has produced, since, in my life, multitudinous such episodes of reflection, far from confined to, although certainly highlighted by, such as the famous \"Rock Garden\" in Kyoto, Japan, that opened whole new thought, many of which found expression in Bangladesh, as such as Paharpur, Mainamati, and Jahagadal.  How often, over the years, I have held in the palm of my hand an enormous diversity of small objects, and sought for the what, why, when, where, who, how; it has led me, almost like the fabled time machine, through many periods, places, and peoples. At the time of my childhood, the BBC -- in those days more a part of real life than now -- carried a children's program, How things began, dramatising history and prehistory in short, apparent eye witness accounts. Such a challenge to the young imagination. Perhaps I never grew up because, of course, I no longer need the BBC to inspire me to take advantage of the extraordinary online opportunities to research around such objects. And, of course, not only objects ... whole towns, cities, nations, even peoples. On the day of which I write, as a family we walked past a small, ancient church. Revelling, on the way, in the name, Julius Caesar, on one grave stone, through a gap in what seemed a massive stone-built wall, comprising, in large part, chunks of flint stones, which were common enough in the geology of the area. Such treasures as the string of beads in the possession of a farmer's wife at Wari Bateshwar; coins of the Sultanate -- not the gold, but the heritage -- the entirety of the tangible history and heritage of Bangladesh, are but pieces of evidence in an exciting story of who we are, where we come from, and how that past continues to influence our today A stony track led across fields of stubble from recent harvest and, to my delight, almost buried in the soil, I found a piece of glazed pot. It was red in colour, with dry mud clinging to it. A piece of flower pot, I thought, familiar from the family greenhouse, one that adjoined the end of our family home. A greenhouse which, I already understood, had been the coach house of the fine, late Victorian mansion that housed the new \"Secondary Modern\" school, as legislated for in our 1944 Education Act, of which my father had become the founding father. As any child might, I rushed to show my mother this treasure of domesticity. She took it, and told me that the last person to handle this fragment of pot -- which she identified as Samian ware, explaining it as a piece of a very valuable family treasure of domestic pottery in Roman times -- was almost certainly someone who lived nearly two thousand years before. Comparing it to her Coalport tea service inherited from her parents, she assured me that the bowl of which this was a fragment had, certainly, been treasured then, as much as her mother's Coalport was by us. Years later, travelling through North Bengal, my interest, bordering on obsession, in the heritage and culture of Bangladesh, was similarly piqued. We were driving on a road across those very flat flood plains, and noticed a hill beside the road. We stopped, to climb the hill, and found the soil rich in terracotta fragments, and shards of pottery. I picked a piece of the nearly complete base of a pot. It was already clear that the hill covered an unrecorded site of yet another Buddhist Vihara. The piece of pottery was subsequently identified as 7th century in origin. Such pieces can be the beginning of the myriad threads that lead any of us, not merely, as in Bangladesh, to ancestors, and the stories that eventuate in the present day, but even as I have found threads that weave into my own, and my nation's history. A history that, even today, is memorialised in mansions and palaces, often financed by the peoples of Bangladesh. Such treasures as the string of beads in the possession of a farmer's wife at Wari Bateshwar; coins of the Sultanate -- not the gold, but the heritage -- the entirety of the tangible history and heritage of Bangladesh, are but pieces of evidence in an exciting story of who we are, where we come from, and how that past continues to influence our today, as it will our futures, all of us. Today, my own garden, beneath a 19th century \"lazy bed,\" a method of cultivation lies an unexplained bed of flat stones; nearby, a large piece of flint stone, not native to the area, and what is probably part of a stone axe three thousand years old, offers clues to those who lived on this piece of land, long ago. The people who once were in a line of human society that will, hopefully, survive long after I am gone. I wonder what my activities have contributed to my children's and my grandchildren's generations, and beyond? A heritage that continues, at least in Britain, to literally enrich the present and almost certainly, future generations. The world of the wealthier, better educated peoples, continue to beat a path to Britain to share in the exploration of a past. A past, in fact, a little richer, and certainly less lengthy, than that which Bangladesh has to offer to its people, today, and potentially, to millions of those who, like me, continue to search the past to enrich the present, and revel in it.

      "text": "Lying on the fringes of the famous Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove swamp forest, but also close to the shores of the delta of three of Asia's most famous rivers, Brahmaputra, Meghna, and, above all, the Ganges, it is difficult to know how to balance the advantages and disadvantages that led to the growth of what is now known as \"one of the 15 lost cities of the world,\" according to Forbes Magazine. Archaeological and some documentary and circumstantial evidence suggest that the city that we know today for its rich Islamic heritage, created in the 15th century, had far more ancient foundations. It would be rather strange if it had not. The mangrove swamp was well-known to ancient travellers and merchants from across the world since very early times, located, as it is, on the edge of the entry to the great international trading centre for which we have evidence from, at latest, the middle of the last millennium BCE. And we have many reasons to suppose that such habitable lands on the fringes, in proximity to the Bay of Bengal, would probably have been occupied long before our recorded history. Indeed, the evidence of an early Buddhist settlement in the locale is compelling, though we may well doubt if it survived by the time of the early 15th century arrival, thereabouts of the warrior Turk, Khan Jahan Ali. Clearly a well organised, charismatic soldier and devout Muslim, it is unclear what motivated his arrival in these lands that are now Bangladesh. However, as a soldier of the declining, brutal, Tuqhlaq regime in Delhi, it might be unsurprising that he should have sought pastures new; especially pastures that were both wealthy, and troubled. Not that he would have found much to comfort him in the times of the Ilyas Shahi Dynasty, then the short lived Raja Ganesha family, and the restoration of the Ilyas Shahi that ruled in Bengal independently throughout his lifetime. It is believed, however, that he left the service of the Delhi regime, following the sacking of that city by the infamous Mongol, Tamerlane, in the last years of the 14th century. After serving the succession of Nawabs of Bengal, he received the grant of these remote lands beside the waters of the Ganges delta, on the fringe of the mangrove swamp, and removed himself with an apparently large number of probably, similarly displaced, and evidently loyal followers, to build the new city that we now know as Bagerhat. And, as a forerunner of many other such cities around the rapidly changing world, it became, it seems, in very few decades of work, a very modern urban centre. For a few centuries subsequently, it may have been abandoned, but once the clearing of vegetation that had engulfed it was cleared, it emerged as one of the most startling, small Islamic cities in the world. One might almost say, a \"time capsule\" of such traditional, medieval Islamic civilisation. It was the brick road -- shown to me by graduates of Jahangirnagar University, who I was glad to have working with me at the time -- that first struck me as the very epitome of modern urban development. Clearly brick-making skills, probably made by slave labour, though supervised and trained by Khan Jahan's entourage, were one of the earliest innovations, which, combined with very evident architectural skills, bear testimony to a group also rich in engineering and non-military skills. No new community is built, today, without first laying out the road system. And, in a sense, it shares with such notable sites as Fatepur Sikri, a former, short-lived capital city of the Mughal Dynasty in today's India, amongst others around the world, a short, but substantial life. A life that has in the past half century been slowly uncovered by human endeavour from the forces of nature. The durability of both many places of worship, and well-built \"barrack blocks,\" suggest that although it seems that most accommodation was probably built of wood, this was a settlement built to endure. It is, however, clearly the array of mosques which are the most lasting mark of this \"lost\" city. Why, we might well ask, were so many needed? Especially if we accept a premise that other faith groups probably lived within the settlement?  Some sense of the original community can still be found in the area of the tomb of Khan Jahan, on the banks of the large tank known as Thakur Dighi, which, in the traces of animist cultural traditions commonly seen at such sites across Bangladesh, retains crocodiles in the waters, carefully conserved. It is not only the simplicity of the fine buildings of the tomb, with the close proximity of that of his best friend, Ali Taheerer, which appeal; it is also the row of shops and teashops that line the approach road. In one of those shops, things such as Chakra stones, and East India Company coinage are on sale amongst more usual tourist trinkets, revealing a cultural diversity, perhaps, of which Khan Jahan, like most of his contemporaries, it seems, would probably have approved ... unlike some of the more vociferous in today's calling? It is, of course, however, the \"Sixty Dome\" mosque, which draws most eyes; misnamed, of course, since the 60 pillars produce some 77 domes! Curiously, whilst the external prospect is not especially lovely, the magnificence and similarity of the pillared interior to that of many Gothic contemporary edifices in Europe is particularly striking. But the totality, built from brick in the slightly earlier Tughlaq tradition of that somewhat brutal regime elsewhere in India, may not be the loveliest of mosques, it is the most famous, becoming listed a UNESCO world heritage site. Single dome mosques characterise most of those built in the original development of the \"new city,\" and, as originating in a pre-Mughal period can easily be compared, if not exactly in beauty, certainly in dignity, with those of the Mughal era with which Bangladesh abounds. Both the nine dome mosque, that stands on the western side of Thakur Dighi, and the splendid 10 dome mosque in nearby Krishnanagar, are masterful reflections of  simplicity of design, and excellence of build of the sparsely decorated modesty of all these original masterpieces. The district today is said to contain over 300 mosques, which, apparently somewhat superfluous to the relatively sparsely inhabited area, may also raise questions about the number of original mosques for what would seem to have been a not especially numerous, original Muslim population. Not that evidence of other buildings of great age is not plentiful, although today, most are represented more by mounds that are actual remnants. The site of Khan Jahan's residence and private mosque has been identified, and some barracks and barrack mosques have been largely uncovered. It is arguable that more extensive excavation and clearance will eventually reveal a great deal more about the ancient history of the area within and around today's town. And it will almost certainly prove to have been, like the rest of Bangladesh, a rich, as well as ancient history. It is just, perhaps, that so remote from  Dhaka, today's demands on the area continue to be more aqua and agricultural than commercial or industrial... at least for now! And this fairly recently rediscovered, fascinating, urban development probably represents more of a potential tourist attraction than simply economic. What preceded the urban development may, yet, throw more light on the heritage of this corner of the country. The tantalising evidence of both Hindu and Buddhist earlier times, and its obvious proximity to those ancient routes of sea trade could prove, as in so many sites in Bangladesh, slowly emerging from the rich alluvial deposits of millennia of seasonal flood waters, to suggest a prospect of even further enrichment of the historic heritage of, not just the beauty of Bangladesh, but also the fascination of that heritage. From the soils of Bangladesh are slowly emerging a number of, hitherto lost, great, and potentially very significant cities: Wari Bateshwar, Bhitagarh, and Egarosindur amongst the least obvious. None can offer, yet, quite the level of tangible evidence of a rich past as Bagerhat; but then the Bagerhat we see today has a visible history of only about six centuries, whilst the others have had a thousand years and more in which to become hidden, and are certainly never likely to enjoy quite the visible and tangible appeal of this fine, ancient, and modern City of Mosques.

      "headline": "In Mali, waning fortunes of Fulani herders play into Islamist hands",
      "authors": "Thomson Reuters Foundation",
      "text": "The Fulani graze their cows on the greenery that springs up after the river recedes from its flood plains. As it gets munched the farmers plant their crops, now fertilised by cow dung, so long as they do not block access to the nomads' routes. But as climate change shrinks the river, population growth swells its users and more land gets cultivated, the Fulani are being pushed deeper into poverty. Conflicts with their sedentary neighbours are growing. Throw in radical Islam, abusive security forces, a feeling of political exclusion and a flood of guns from lawless deserts to the north, and conditions are ripe for a rebellion that could destabilise not just Mali but much of West Africa. \"The Fulani feel marginalised everywhere. In Mali, in Guinea, in Central Africa,\" said Abdoul Aziz Diallo, who runs Tabital Pulaaku, a Fulani association spanning 15 countries. \"In Mali, they're being infiltrated by the jihadists from the north and there is a very real danger from new Fulani militias that have emerged and are stoking inter-ethnic strife.\" The road west out of Mopti, a city of muddy streets and a grand clay mosque on the Niger's banks in central Mali, crosses flooded rice fields and land where cows graze on wild grass. Fulani herdsmen in robes and straw hats negotiate livestock sales with Bambara farmers. In May, however, armed Bambara and Fulani groups clashed in Tenenkou, west Mopti, and about 20 people were killed. Such clashes are frequent and might be brushed off as local incidents. But Islamist militants are exploiting Fulani anger to spread jihad from the thinly populated north to its centre. \"The Fulani complained that farmers took all the land,\" said Lala Walet, a Mopti NGO worker promoting livestock commerce. \"So the jihadists came and said 'OK, join our group and we will help you fight to get it back'.\" Jihadists have beheaded or slit the throat of scores of local officials in central and south Mali in the past year. In August 2015, 13 people were killed in a siege of the Byblos Hotel in Sevare, a town separated from Mopti by a tangle of creeks. In July, gunmen killed 17 Malian soldiers in an attack on an army base in the town of Nampala, claimed both by northern jihadists Ansar Dine and a new Fulani militia, the National Alliance to Safeguard the Peuhl Identity and Restore Justice. The latter said on Saturday it would lay down arms and rejoin a government peace process - one that has so far failed to quell the violence in the much more unstable north. Bringing the Fulani into the peace process will be essential to prevent further such attacks, and if efforts to woo youths away from jihad are to have any hope of succeeding. A 2012 Tuareg revolt in northern Mali was hijacked by Islamists, prompting former colonial master France to intervene to push them back. The French action prevented the possible takeover of the capital Bamako by Islamists, a prospect that alarmed Western governments trying to push back the global spread of radical militancy. The subsequent peace deal focused on soothing Tuareg grievances even though many Islamists were Fulanis. That was a mistake, said Mohamed Attayoub, head of the political wing of Ganda-Iso, a Fulani vigilante group. \"We participated in the talks, but when it came to the deal, we were excluded from every organ of the state,\" he said. Security Minister Colonel Salif Traore denied this, telling Reuters that everyone was able to participate. Ali Nouhoum Diallo, an ex-head of both Mali's parliament and the regional bloc ECOWAS, in September created a nationwide vigilante group to help Fulani defend themselves. He said security forces were harassing herders and arresting youths for simply reading the Koran outside. Sitting in his Bamako house, Nouhoum Diallo dismissed the suggestion the Fulanis would rebel for an ethnic homeland, as the Tuaregs did. \"It is impossible for the Fulani to claim independence, because we are spread out everywhere,\" he said. It was the failure of the state to protect them that was banding them together, he said. Security Minister Traore denied organised repression of the Fulani but he admitted profiling may happen. \"We cannot stigmatise people of certain ethnic groups for something they haven't done,\" he said. Still, the crackdown has deepened mistrust and a sense of persecution. Millennia of wandering has left 20 million Fulani scattered across 20 nations, from Senegal's west coast to as far east as Eritrea. Many feel sidelined in Africa's modern states. The sense of exclusion and the shift in the Islamist battlefield southwards to Mali's more populated, richer areas is a headache for President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. That was highlighted in November 2015, when gunmen killed dozens at the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako. Several Islamist groups claimed the raid but the government gave most credence to the Mopti-based Macina Liberation Front (MLF), a Fulani jihadist group allied to Ansar Dine. The MLF's figurehead, Amadou Koufa, is a fiery cleric whose sermons call on Fulanis to rebuild historic empires like Massina, which once stretched over the Mopti region. Hamma Cisse, an imam who was at the same Koranic school as Koufa, remembers a quarrelsome boy who wrote love songs and became bitter and disillusioned. \"The Fulani felt frustrated,\" he said. \"The pupils in the French schools were considered superior, they always got the jobs. Amadou felt it as a real injustice.\" Koufa moved to Mauritania and came back preaching radical Islam. \"He preached everywhere, village by village,\" Cisse said. \"He was standing up for the Fulani, against poverty, against abuses by the water and forest authorities. One thing I'm sure of - people aren't following him out of religious conviction.\""

      "text": "Shaharul Islam Md Abu Hena, relief and rehabilitation officer of Bogra district, said: \"Local representatives of the district had disbursed VGF cards among the solvent people instead of helpless and these people used to sell the delivered rice to traders with low prices.\" Ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the government has been distributing rice among VGF card holders. The government has already distributed nearly 1,123 tonnes and 620kg of rices among 212,364 card holders in 12 upzilas and 12 municipalities of the district, said the district relief and rehabilitation officer. \"Instead of this, government had distributed around 509 tonnes of rice among the flood-affected people of the district,\" said Abu Hena. The district relief and rehabilitation officer said to give illegal advantages to relatives and to get supports from the voters, local representatives usually distributed cards among the solvent people, who are not eager to eat the relief rice as the quality of this rice is not good enough, so they sell it to local traders by Tk12 to 14 per kg. He requested to the local representatives to distribute cards among the helpless who really need the card to run their daily lives though local representatives ignored the allegation. During his recent visit to different upazilas of the district this reporter has found that traders of the district were waiting around the rice distribution camps to buy the rice at lower price. After taking the rice, card holders went to the traders and had sold it immediately. To stop this tendency of selling the relief rice, Upazila Nirbahi Officer of Dhunat upazila has conducted several drives in the upazila and sized a huge amount of rice.  Though the upazila officer has warned the traders to stop buying rice from the card holders, people are still selling rice to traders. Some card holders who used to sale the rice to the local traders with very low prices told the Dhaka Tribune wishing anonymity: \"The quality of government rice is very bad and it is quite impossible to eat it.\" \"So we have compelled to sell the rice to buy the good one, they added.\" "

The newly appointed lecturer Abu Saif Mohammed Touhidul Alam, a non-thesis candidate who attained CGPA 3.54 in honours and 3.81 in masters programme while thesis group candidates along with better CGPA were disregarded by the authorities as Md Saidur Rahman, the chairman of the department reportedly favored him, source said.  Meanwhile, several newspapers and online portals have published news regarding the affiliation of Touhidul Alam with Islami Chhatra Shibir during his student life. Touhidul, however, rejected the allegation.  He said: \"The allegation is absolutely false rather somebody is conspiring against me imposing such tag.\"  However, JU Pro VC Prof Abul Hossain said they did not find any involvement of Touhidul with Chhatra Shibir activities.  The selection board of the recruitment presided by JU Vice-Chancellor Prof Farzana Islam recommended Touhidul Alam among a total of 14 candidates to be appointed as a temporary lecturer, source said.  Chairman of the department Md Saidur Rahman said the authorities had appointed him following the recommendation of the selection board.  He said: \"If there is any rule that one has to score highest to be appointed then there would no necessity of the selection board in the recruitment process.\" Several candidates of this recruitment asking anonymity said they had been discriminated, as their merits and results were not valued properly while the selection board ignored a son of a freedom fighter who scored CGPA 3.81 in honours and 3.87 in masters programme.  JU VC Prof Farzana Islam was not available for her comment regarding the matter despite several attempts."

Once expired, the cylinders must be replaced and disposed of to avoid leakage or other hazards - especially at the consumer end.\nHowever, the Dhaka Tribune found out that at least 200,000 of the 450,000 LPG cylinders imported by LP Gas Ltd are more than 20 years old.\nThese cylinders are supposed to be scrapped; instead they are available for use around the country, posing great safety risks for users.\nDue to the lack of proper LPG policy and guideline by the government, there is no practice of periodically replacing expired cylinders in Bangladesh, experts said.\nMoreover, the cylinders that enter Bangladesh are not properly checked for safety by the authorities concerned, which makes it easier for suppliers to flood the market with substandard cylinders.\nLack of awareness among the consumers make the matter worse, they added.\nFazlur Rahman, general manager of LP Gas Ltd, told the Dhaka Tribune that there is no mention of 15-year lifespan of a LPG cylinder in the amended LPG Rule 2004.\nAlthough concern over this issue has been voiced several times, it came to light again after around 200 LPG cylinders exploded and caused a massive fire in an LPG depot in Bogra, owned by Padma oil distribution company, on Saturday.\nInvestigating the explosion, officials of LP Gas Ltd found that the gas pressure inside the cylinders were way beyond their capacity, which caused a leak and led to an explosion, an official of the company told the Dhaka Tribune.\nPetrobangla has been notified about the high gas pressure in the cylinders several times, but no steps have been taken to resolve the issue, he said, requesting not to be named.\nHowever, Rajshahi Divisional LP Gas Distributors' Association blames the distribution authorities for the accident.\nAhsanul Rashid Dablu, general secretary of the organisation, said the cylinders distributed by Padma as well as Meghna and Jamuna - all state-owned distribution companies that operate under the BPC - are very old and extremely unsafe to use.\n\"The authorities concerned have been asked to replace these cylinders repeatedly, but they have yet to take any action,\" he told our Bogra correspondent on Saturday.\nEarlier, the association staged a protest against the widespread availability of expired cylinders on August 1 demanding immediate steps to stop the distribution of \"date-expired and risky\" LPG cylinders in 16 northern districts.\nAhsan requested the chief inspector of the Department of Explosives to look into the matter.\nWhen contacted, Chief Inspector of Explosives Md Shamsul Alam said there were roughly around five million LPG cylinders - both privately and government issued - currently in use in Bangladesh.\n\"Including the headquarters, the department has five offices in Dhaka, Khulna, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Sylhet and has a total of 107 employees. It is not possible to inspect such a huge number of cylinders with this workforce.\"\nAsked about the Bogra incident, he said Assistant Chief Inspector of Explosives in Rajshahi Md Asadul Islam is due to submit a probe report in this regard, which will be forwarded to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division.\n\n\n\n\n"

How ironic, in the age of information.\nI wonder, in those ancient times, how often writers were asked, \"Where is Gangaridai?\" compared with how often I am asked today, \"Where is Bangladesh?\"\nThere can, indeed, be little doubt that the educated, and especially, the traders and merchants, were familiar with not only Gangaridai, but also its location, and that of lands beyond. Deep into the Ganges basin, and north towards an inland city, called Thina, and the great difficulties in reaching it.\n\nHowever, the great Roman geographer late in the last century BCE, Strabo, writing in his famous work Geographia, comments: \"Concerning those who sail from Egypt, even to the Ganges, they are but private citizens with no knowledge of the history of places they visit.\" The earliest known example of academic snobbery.\nIt was a much valued destination, of that there can be little doubt.\nPoets, historians, and businessmen of the half millennium, known as the \"classical period\" of European history, wrote about its location and both its trade and, it seems, especially the military prowess of its people.\nProwess that always, inevitably throughout human history, has involved wealth.\nEven with all the aids, technology, and progress of modern archaeology, and advances that have facilitated a better appreciation of such significant places and events in pre-history, we continue to be unable to take any definitive view on periods and locations of the emerging -- we might say -- embryonic, modern, commercially-based civilisation, that certainly emerged in these lands of Bangladesh over two millennia ago.\nEven the duration of the Kingdom of Gangaridai, if kingdom it was, is hazy. Was it a kingdom?\nArchaeological development of appreciation of the very early Harappan civilisation further west suggests an absence of mansions and palaces in urban sites, which to some archaeologists suggests that some form of true democracy was an early form of governance.\nAround histories of Vanga, Magadha, and Mauryan periods swirl such questions; perhaps only Megasthenes' commentary of the Aleaxandrian invasion goes some way towards offering a definite period within the history of Gangaridai.\nModern politics also thickens the swirling mists of time that have left us with dateable sites and artefacts, but no certainties.\nGangaridai, we are told, were a people dwelling on the east side of the Ganges. Knowing as we do, the mobility of river courses in the Gangetic plains, even that fails to locate with certainty.\nNaturally, India, recognising the inevitability of archaeological and historical definition of the existence and significance, of Gangaridai internationally, have laid claim to a capital city close to Calcutta. Since that is a fringe of the delta, it seems an improbable claim.\nWithin the lands of the delta, one modern claim is made for a location of the capital at Gopalganj; others suggest the site, with its 5km rampart on the banks of the Old Brahmaputra at Wari Bateshwar; or even Egarosindur, a largely unexplored site at Kishoreganj.\nOf Gangaridai however, we have early writers to thank for our certainty that it not only existed, but was, in its time, internationally significant, as a major crossroads of international trade and commerce.\nMegathenes was a traveller, born in modern Turkey, who arrived in the city of Pataliputra (modern Patna), capital of both Magadha and later, Mauryan Empires.\nThose who believe that Chandragupta, the first of the Mauryan Emperors, built the east/west Grand Trunk Road may well be as confused as historians seem to be about times and places, since Megasthenes is said to have arrived at Pataliputra along the \"great\" highway.\nSurely the Grand Trunk Road is said to have been constructed by Chandragupta? Or, perhaps, simply following the footprints of Alexander?\nHowever, it appears that he arrived there shortly after the failure of Alexander and his army to cross the Ganges, a crossing that -- it may be reasonable to suppose, across a wide river, perhaps in flood -- beyond which it was intended to seize the wealth of the flourishing trading centre with the lands of Gangaridai.\nEvery army sought financial rewards for their endeavours, and Alexander's was, certainly, no exception.\nWhilst most of the great writers of Alexander's endeavour, over the subsequent seven or eight hundred years, write of his eventual failure, his military achievements before his death at the age of 32 still resonate down the centuries.\n\nFocusing on military issues, there are also mercantile and geographical commentaries that confirm the importance for perhaps as much as nearly a millennium, of Gangaridai, to a wider world.\nThe world map, produced in the late 3rd century BCE by Eratosthenes, is remarkable for the evidently detailed knowledge of the Ganges and its major tributaries, such as Jamuna.\nSuch maps reveal very evident sources of information, and familiarity with such destinations.\nSimilarly, Strabo also shows great familiarity with the delta and its components in both his commentaries and cartography.\nThe publication of mid 1st century CE, Periplus of the Erythaean Sea, a merchants guide to trade, not only provides detailed instructions for approaching the delta, but also prime items for trade.\nAnd, of course, Ptolemy, the great mid 2nd century CE cartographer, whose detailed sources for his remarkably accurate maps of the known world made his own map of the deltaic lands, with remarkable accuracy; including the mark of a settlement called Ramcu, exactly where Ramu stands, today.\nBut it is the military historians that throw the most revealing light onto to sheer strength, in population numbers, military resources, and evidently, wealth that we may reasonably suppose derived from manufacturing and trade of the deltaic lands.\nThe earliest writer, describing the military strength of Gangaridai, was of course Megasthenes, writing with the benefit of his experience of the geography; and, certainly familiarity around Patna, of those who could recall the circumstances of Alexander's advance.\nHe describes a River Ganges, that faced Alexander's army, at least eight miles wide and 20 at its maximum, and an estimated 100 feet deep.\nThe forces assembled to resist any attempt by Alexander to make a crossing, comprised, he wrote of 1,000 horses (interesting, considering horses were not native, and over subsequent centuries, until recent times, originated in Bhutan), 700 elephants, and 60,000 infantry (\"in apparatus of war\").\nDiodorus Siculus, a Roman historian, writing in the second half of the last century BCE, may well have derived some of his information from Megasthenes.\nHowever, his estimate of assembled forces were far greater. \"An army of 20,000 horses, 200,000 infantry, 2,000 chariots, and 4,000 elephants trained and equipped for war.\"\nAll subsequent historians agree that the forces of Gangaridai had by far the largest number of war elephants in India.\nA very clear comment on the wealth and prowess of the military might of the \"kingdom.\"\nMore of them also increase the estimate of numbers; Quintus Curtius Rufus, Plutarch, and Pliny the Elder, as, like most Romans, great admirers of Alexander, may well have considered that only unbelievable geographic and military hurdles could possibly have daunted Alexander and his army.\nThey, and others, such as the 3rd century Dionysius Periegetes, add geographic descriptions to their writing of what was for centuries regarded as the edge of the known world.\nEven Ptolemy's usually accurate mapping fails at mapping territories beyond east and south-east of the lands of Bangladesh.\nFor them, it seems, Alexander did in fact march to the ends of the known world, only to be confronted by unsurpassable obstacles to further advance.\nIndeed might the old song go, \"Some talk of Alexander,\" it was unquestionably the ill-fated attempt by Alexander to conquer the peoples and lands that are now Bangladesh to add to his, hitherto, unparalleled adventure in international conquest, that opened the ancient, early worldwide awareness of these lands of Bangladesh.\nTo the successful rebuff by nature, and the power and courage of the peoples themselves, we owe such knowledge that has put early times in the lands of Bangladesh into the ancient history of world civilisation, and well as on some of the earliest maps of the world.\n\n\n\n\n"

2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nAncient records of early Buddhism, recovered from Tibet, identify five great centres of learning in the Buddhist firmament of the period of the Pala Empire, which might have been at the time, amongst the greatest centres of learning in the world, up to a thousand years after the birth of Prince Gautama, the Buddha, \"The Enlightened One.\"\nOf the five, two are amongst the over four hundred lesser Buddhist sites, in the lands that are now Bangladesh; Somapura Mahavihara and Jaggadala.\nAnd, of those two, Somapura, or Paharpur as we know the site today, is certainly still the best explored and most famous, as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nThere seems to be little room to doubt that, as early as the last centuries before the Common Era, the concentration of early Buddhist sites in Bangladesh represent a major source of early learning.\nThere are even scholars of Christian teaching who, detecting Buddhist influences in the teachings of Christ in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, suggest that the precocious child found debating with elders in the Temple, who only emerges as a great teacher himself some 20 years later, may in fact, under the influence of Joseph of Arimathea -- a merchant associated with Christ in biblical tradition -- have organised for the young Christ to travel to what were, in their time, the greatest centres of learning of their age, the great Vihara of the Ganges basin.\nAnd Paharpur would have been of course the most accessible from the great centre of trade in the Ganges Delta, had Christ made the journey, as at the time many did, by sea.\nWhatever the truth of that speculation, what is more incontrovertible is that, from the earliest times of the rise of Buddhist belief, Paharpur was \"in the thick of it.\"\nExcavation has revealed that, unsurprisingly, beneath the undoubted construction of remains of the period of the great Pala Empire (which had its roots in proximity to Paharpur, and, who knows, may have derived in part from its presence?), lie traces of buildings of the Mauryan period in the early years of Buddhism.\nWe also know from onsite evidence that it continued to flourish during the \"Golden Age of India\" under the second century liberal Hindu, Gupta Dynasty (also with their own roots in close proximity to Paharpur!).\nNo doubt the expertise of Buddhists contributed to the astonishing transformation of social, economic, and technical strengths of Indian society that flowered in that period.\nThat Paharpur was one of the most significant centres of learning in the various Buddhist schools there can be little doubt; the sheer scale of its estate and constructions bear testimony to its significance.\nWe may, perhaps, attribute that fact to its greater proximity to the great international routes of communication by sea, and by the famous first of the great Silk Roads, the Southern Silk Road, Brahmaputra, Teesta, and Lohit River routes into the Himalayan states and beyond, into China.\nIt is already clear that, in its time, Paharpur was culturally important, not simply to the Buddhist tradition, but to the range of Dharmic beliefs\nWhat is also certain is that the ruins today of this great centre of meditation, teaching, and learning are the largest in the Indian sub-continent, and that the design has been closely replicated in Burma, Java, and Cambodia, with two temples in central Java bearing closest resemblance to Paharpur's distinctive design, rather than any others in the sub-continent.\nSuch imitation seems to speak volumes for the influence of Paharpur over the propagation of the faith groups beyond its origins in the Ganges basin.\nThe decline, in about the 12th century -- either under the Brahmanic regime of the last Hindu dynasty, the short lived Sena, or perhaps as likely, in the face of the advent of the Afghan Sultanate forces that, having raided into India for a century or two, finally shifted their base as far into north India as they could reach --  seems to have been fairly abrupt.\nBut that the schools, the Vihara, lasted in their influence for about a millennium and a half, enduring across the eastern world even today, not only speaks volumes for their power and influence, but also of the wealth in the lands in which they grew.\nThey developed, it is probably fair to say, out of centuries, even millennia of social, cultural, and economic evolution in these lands along the edges of the great Ganges river.\nArchaeology, both in India and in Bangladesh, is only slowly making sense of the evidence of both on and in ground work, alongside the circumstantial and documentary, even empirical evidence for which, in today's Islamic and Christian world there may not be a great deal of incentive.\nAnd the rise in India of the return of more aggressive Hinduism probably doesn't help, either!\nHowever, despite its continuing strength in important nations like Japan, and its re-emergence in China, the study and appreciation of the significance in world cultural and economic history, has probably not yet reached its time.\nIt is, however, already clear that, in its time, Paharpur was culturally important, not simply to the Buddhist tradition, but to the range of Dharmic beliefs.\nPaharpur stands in by far the largest compound, and is easily the largest Buddhist site in Indian subcontinent\nThese are those that evolved around the lands that, as the deltaic lands of the Ganges are now largely the lands of Bangladesh.\nThe Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist belief groups of that Dharmic tradition, which were probably both influenced by each other, and by the more primitive beliefs of traders from across the world, and also propagated through the linkages of communication, grew in all likelyhood from the more primitive Animist and Shamanic traditions of earliest traceable beliefs.\n\nThat the Sanskrit language developed hereabouts was also, in all probability, due to this as a very ancient centre of trade, requiring more than a verbal tradition of communication to support trade.\nBut the ability of such common and written form of communication certainly also facilitated the wider communication of beliefs, as well as facilitating travel, social, and cultural interchange.\nIt remains somewhat difficult to make complete sense of the human developments of these lands with such a demonstrably rich heritage of culture and philosophy.\nNot the least of these difficulties, of course, in the case of the lands in and around those of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.\nAnd the rest of the 700 or so rivers, tributaries, and distributaries of the Ganges, especially is the simple depth of the annual deposits of flood borne alluvium.\nAnd today, politics also plays its own part in revelation, and even suppression.\nIronic, indeed, that the lands that so clearly gave birth to beliefs to which over 5% of the world's population today still adhere, should be ruled by adherents of different beliefs!\nAll of which would probably have seemed absurd to the denizens of Paharpur, throughout much of its life.\nIt may well not be without significance that Paharpur stands in by far the largest compound, and is easily the largest Buddhist site in the Indian sub-continent.\nClose to the origins of Buddhism, just across today's border and the ancient capital of the Mauryan Empire, it was even closer to the roots of both Gupta and Pala Empires, in which it conspicuously flourished.\nDespite the somewhat half-hearted endeavours of today's Indians to \"talk up\" Vihara on their own lands for the sake of tourist income, there may well be every reason to suppose that, in fact, Paharpur, Somapara Mahavihara, was in fact, from early times, the most influential and powerful in the complexities of the Buddhist faith, of the great five.\nPaharpur, a historic root for Bangladesh to cherish, and to take pride in.\n \n

      "text": "July 2016 was the hottest month the planet has been since we started keeping records in 1880. The month was not only 0.84degC hotter than the 20th century monthly average (when we combine both sea surface and land surface temperature), but also 0.11degC  hotter than July last year. This should be a warning for world leaders to do more to reduce greenhouse gases emissions, and do it fast. In fact, based on data collected by NASA, global average temperatures in the last nine months have consistently broken temperature records for that specific month (ie this January was the hottest January ever recorded, this February the hottest February, March the hottest March, etc.). This means we may be on our way to experiencing the warmest year on record. Already, the first half of the year 2016 was an average 1.3degC warmer than the pre-industrial levels. The one caveat is that because of La Nina -- the recurring oceanic and atmospheric pattern across the Pacific Ocean which lowers sea surface temperatures -- the last few months of this will likely be cooler. While these differences in temperature may seem only slight, at a planetary level they are actually quite significant. Scientists are already observing the impacts of this \"slight\" warming in the form of glaciers melting in  nearby Nepal, sea-levels rising on the southern coast of the United States, and seasons generally becoming more unpredictable worldwide, which is partly why many Bengalis no longer say there are six seasons in the year as they traditionally used to. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report further predicts that global warming will also bring forth more frequent cyclones, foster the spread of diseases such as malaria, and lead to more extreme weather events such as droughts and heavy rainfall. As the Dhaka Tribune reported earlier this week, we have already crossed the symbolic milestone of 400 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere, which many saw as the point of no return for human-induced climate change.   At this stage, if countries do nothing to reduce the rate of emissions, scientists predict the concentration of CO2 would increase threefold by the end of the century, causing the planet to warm about 4degC above pre-industrial levels. For Bangladesh -- based on research findings of the \"High End Climate Impact and Extremes\" project conducted at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology -- the regional temperature increase under these same conditions could be between 3.7degC and 5.7degC. And even if we moderately reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there could still be a global temperature rise above 2degC. This is at odds with the goal of recent UN climate change treaty, the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep planetary temperatures well below 2degC with an ambitious goal of 1.5degC. However, a recent crescendo of devastating impacts -- heatwaves, deadly flooding, storm surges fuelled by rising seas -- has pushed world leaders, particularly in the Global South, and leading scientists to make the ambitious goal of 1.5degC the only goal. This will only be possible if countries commit to drastically reducing their emissions immediately. The challenge with the Paris Agreement is that -- although it recently legally came into force -- it is not legally binding  like the earlier UN climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol. Unless we are able to keep these temperatures to these goals, countries like Bangladesh will need a lot of support helping their populations adapt to new climate conditions. While the UN climate body has created the Green Climate Fund, which intends to provide at least USD 100 billion per year by 2020 for climate action, accessing the fund is both challenging and lengthy process. Yet, given how fast temperatures are increasing, the sooner countries at high risk get access to adaptation funding, the better.

      "text": "Naval boats battled rebels on Lake Tanganyika in the east of Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday as heavy fighting spread close to the lakeside city of Uvira, sources in the area said. Fighting between the Mai-Mai Yakutumba militia and Congo government forces broke out at the weekend on the outskirts of Uvira, close to the Burundi border. Unrest has mounted since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down when his mandate expired last December. \"Since 0300 GMT there has been an exchange of gunfire between the army and the Mai-Mai in Uvira,\" said Lubungula Dem's M'Sato, a member of a peacebuilding advocacy group in Uvira, the second largest city in South Kivu province. Congo's navy also repelled an attack by Mai-Mai rebels in boats on the lake, military spokesman Louis-Claude Tshimwanga said, adding that government ships had sunk one of the rebel's boats and that government forces remained in control of Uvira. Lake Tanganyika is hundreds of kilometres long and also borders Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. \"The rebels tried to attack (the city) from the lake. They have motorised pirogues,\" said a witness in Uvira, who asked not to be named, adding that he saw six rebel boats. \"The (navy) caught one but the others escaped.\" The Mai-Mai Yakutumba, formed in 2007 by local militiamen opposed to integration in Congo's national army, has well-established gold smuggling networks on the lake. In an audio statement this week that was shared on social media, its leader William Yakutumba said his forces were rebelling against Kabila's mismanagement of the country's natural resources and failure to quit power when his constitutional mandate expired. Congo's mineral-rich eastern borderlands are a tinderbox of ethnic tensions and for more than two decades have been racked by violence, often spilling across the country's borders. The region is the world's biggest source of coltan, used in mobile phones and other electronic products. Congo's UN peacekeeping mission, MONUSCO, said it had deployed troops around Uvira on Wednesday to protect civilians and that the deputy commander of its forces was on the ground to supervise the situation. \"I urge the armed groups to immediately cease this hostility including all forms of violence against constituted authority and innocent civilians,\" mission head Maman Sidikou said in a statement."

      "text": "The Earth is getting warmer; the Antarctic ice is melting. Scientists expect that by the end of this century, many low-lying districts of Bangladesh will be permanently inundated; the agricultural lands in these districts will be lost. In \"The Unfolding Tragedy of Climate Change in Bangladesh\" (published on the Scientific American website) Robert Glennon writes: \"A three-foot rise in sea level would submerge almost 20% of the entire country and displace more than 30 million people. Some scientists project a five-to-six foot rise by 2100, which would displace perhaps 50 million people ... Already, the intruding sea has contaminated groundwater, which supplies drinking water for coastal regions, and degraded farmland, rendering it less fertile and eventually barren.\" When millions of people lose their homes and their farms, they will move to cities in search of work. As cities expand to accommodate millions of migrants, they will swallow up even more agricultural land. At some point, Bangladesh will become permanently dependent on imported food; self-sufficiency in rice production is no longer a realistic long-term goal. A more realistic long-term goal would be to create enough industrial jobs to ensure that the poor are employed, and can afford to buy imported rice. This is possible, but will require careful planning. The crux of the problem is that Dhaka and Chittagong, the traditional destinations for migrants from the countryside, cannot accommodate millions of more migrants. The slums which house the working class in Dhaka are unliveable; many of them occupy low-lying areas of the cities which periodically flood with rainwater and raw sewage. Chittagong has already expanded to risky hillsides, whose residents live with the danger of fatal landslides. We simply cannot allow the unplanned growth of these two cities to continue. We need to create at least 20 industrial cities which will eventually house and employ a total population of 50 million SEZs show the way Fortunately, the government has already taken the first step, which will create alternative destinations for migrants: Several Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have been created in different districts. As factories and mills are set up in these SEZs, they will tend to grow into industrial cities; the government should encourage this growth by investing in the towns and villages near each SEZ. The employees of each SEZ will need government schools, universities, hospitals, magistrate courts, and of course infrastructure like roads, sewage, railways, and power distribution. If the government makes all these investments, a well-planned industrial city can grow around each SEZ. As climate change and population growth will probably create 50 million migrants, we need to create at least 20 industrial cities which will eventually house and employ a total population of 50 million people. The infrastructure required for 20 industrial towns will probably require the government to invest about $20 billion. Fortunately, the government can finance this by taxing fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal). Burning fossil fuels is what caused the crisis of rising sea levels, so it makes sense that fossil fuels should be taxed to raise money for adaptation to rising sea levels. Creating industrial cities is not just a matter of building infrastructure; private capital will be required to set up factories in the new cities. The private sector will probably require about $20bn to set up 10,000 factories (at an average investment of $2m per factory). Let the taka float The best way to ensure that these investments are made is to allow private banks in Bangladesh to borrow money from abroad (where interest rates are very low), so they can lend to industrial companies at low interest rates. In the past, the private sector in Bangladesh has been forced to borrow money at high interest rates; other countries which have convertible, floating currencies are easily able to attract large amounts of capital from abroad. It is time to make the taka a freely floating currency, and to make it convertible for capital account transactions (transfers of assets). Foreign financial institutions will then have the confidence to lend large amounts of money to Bangladeshi banks. Only private banks should be allowed to borrow money from abroad; massive fraud and loan default have illustrated that the state-owned banks are thoroughly corrupt, and should not be allowed to expand their lending business. State-owned banks should only be allowed to lend their deposits to private banks. Once industrial cities have been created, and foreign capital has been attracted to Bangladesh to finance new factories, Bangladeshis who lose their land to rising sea levels will naturally move to the new industrial cities to find employment. Bangladesh will have successfully transformed into an industrial economy; preventing hunger will then be a simple matter of adjusting the minimum wage to ensure that the average working family can afford imported rice.

RAB caught them red-handed while loading the sacks on a truck. \"They were planning to smuggle the rice from Barisal Local Supply Depot (LSD) to Fulbaria, Khulna,\" said RAB Deputy Assistant Director Amjad Hossain. He said the drive was conducted based on a tip-off. The detained are Deputy Assistant Food Inspector Abdur Rahim, LSD security guards Md Shamsuddin and Md Arif, and the helper of the seized vehicle Md Kabir Khan. The RAB DAD said the Barisal LSD go-down in-charge Abdullah Al Mamun had fled during the raid. Kabir said rice trader Abdus Sattar had rented the truck to carry the rice to Khulna. However, during an interrogation, other detainees claimed the rice was being loaded for supplying it to the Barisal Range Reserve Force (RRF) of police. The district's Regional Controller of Food Amzad Hossain acknowledged that 20 tonnes (400 sacks) of rice were scheduled to be shipped to Barisal RRF that morning, but the seized rice was being loaded with no legal documents. However, when the RRF ration in-charge Monir Hossain went to Barisal LSD on Monday morning, he was informed by Abdullah that the supplies would be sent in the afternoon. Disciplinary measures will be taken by senior authorities after the interrogation and investigation."

      "text": "\nCNN: Bangladeshi 'floating schools' reinvent education\n\n\n\n\nTribune Desk\n\n\n\n\n Published at 06:35 pm September 23rd, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 01:51 am September 24th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSolar-powered floating schools in northern part of Bangladesh have been recognised among the most innovative education arrangements in the world, according to a CNN report.\nDuring monsoon season in Bangladesh, one-third of the country is flooded, making school attendance next to impossible. This leaves children dropping-out of school and deprived of knowledge.\nIn order to tackle such discrepancy, non-profit organisation Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha, came up with a way to bring education to the children most affected: by creating solar-panelled floating schools. The schools contain a laptop, hundreds of books and electronic resources powered by energy generated from the solar panels.\n\nEach morning, the elementary schools travel to different communities, picking up children along the way. The boats then docks and teach up to 30 children at a time.\nThe boat schools also train adult villagers on children's and women's rights, nutrition, hygiene and other practical issues. Farmers are also trained to adapt to the impact of climate change. Since the boat is solar powered, the floating school continues to operate under solar lamps, even after dark.\n\nAlso Read- How one architect transformed education in flood-ravaged Bangladesh\n\nAn architect, Mohammed Rezwan founded Shidhulai in 1998, with about $500. In 2003, the NGO received a $50,000 grant from the Global Fund for Children in the United States, and then $100,000 from the Levi's Foundation, part of the clothing company that has factories in Bangladesh.\nLater in 2005, a $1 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation allowed Shidhulai to build more boats, buy computers, install solar power and create a central library. In 2014, the organisation won the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE), created by the Qatar Foundation, receiving $20,000 prize.\nWhile some first world countries have brought virtual reality into classrooms to study subjects like science, art and history, other schools are taking their classrooms into the forests or other natural settings. Taking up to their challenge, Bangladesh is under the limelight for its sustainable innovation for reinventing education to third world countries.\nSince its recognition, Shidhulai's floating schools model has been replicated in other flood-prone countries, including Nigeria, Cambodia, Philippines, Vietnam and Zambia, therefore, redefining education for all.\n\n\n\n\n"

However, such a ban seems far from possible, at least for now, since there are strong lobbyists behind the industry.\n\"What is unexpected is that the minister wants to shut down only bidi factories and not those producing cigarettes. If the industry is suddenly shut down, about two million bidi workers will become unemployed and will stage tough protests,\" Bangladesh Bidi Shilpa Malik Samity President Bijoy Krishan Dey told the Dhaka Tribune.\nIn the 2016-2017 proposed national budget, prices of the lowest segment of cigarettes were increased by 28% to Tk23. Taxes on medium and high-segment cigarettes remained unchanged, but the supplementary duty was hiked from 61% and 63% to 62% to 64%, respectively.\nMany argue that the decision is tantamount to favouring the import industry over a local industry.\nWhen questioned about this, former NBR chairman Abdul Majid said: \"If the government decides to shut down bidi for health then all smoking products including foreign cigarettes should be banned.\n\"If the finance minister takes this decision, he also has to propose an alternative source of income for the people involved in this industry.\"\nThe Bangladesh Bidi Shilpa Malik Samity President Bijoy said: \"We pay a 16% VAT. This will affect our revenue generation immensely. He needs to consider what a huge financial support the industry is for our economic sector.\"\nExecutive Director of Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh (PRI) Dr Ahsan H Mansur, however, disagreed.\n\"It is a good decision on the part of the government to ban bidi products. There will be no impact on revenues if the ban is put in place,\" said Ahsan, adding: \"We get only Tk4 or Tk5 crore as revenue from bidi products. But the government ends up losing more money in health sector expenditure than the revenue being earned through this industry.\"\nDr Md Mafizur Rahman, associate professor of National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital (NICR&H), weighed in, saying: \"Bidi and cigarettes are both harmful. Our research shows that all tobacco related products are detrimental to health.\n\"According to previous data, some 62%-70% patients who have been afflicted by cancer in their mouths and lungs have been smokers,\" he added.\nMafizur further explained: \"We cannot tell whether bidi is more harmful than cigarettes, but we can say that both are noxious.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

It was hard on the people, particularly those living in northern districts that are heavily dependent on agriculture.\nBasanti Bala, now 75, was the woman in the image that jolted the world.\nThe powerful image of the deaf-mute woman became the centre of attention after daily Ittefaq, then the most influential newspaper in Bangladesh, printed it on their front page.\nBasanti's family survived on one meal every two to three days like many others in Kurigram, one of the worst flood and famine-hit districts.\nHer family of poor anglers could not afford clothes for her. When the Ittefaq photographer found her, she was wearing a fishing net as her only sari had worn out.\nThat photograph became the face of the 1974 famine, attributed to a combination of failed food supply mechanism, which was yet to recover from the havoc wreaked by the Pakistan army, flooding and hoarding by profit-monger rice traders.\nBangladesh has since risen to the status of a lower-middle income country from being an ultra-poor country. The living standard has improved and the nation's per capita income has increased nearly 11 times to $1,600 from $150.\nBut these changes have hardly touched Basanti's life - the only improvement for her is that she does not have to wear fishing nets anymore. At 75, the childless widow is still fully dependent on her relatives for survival.\nHer husband, who also had hearing and speech impairment, died several years ago, leaving her with nothing. Now she lives with in a tiny hut on a small piece of land alongside the homestead of a relative, a poor day labourer.\n\"I live from hand to mouth. But still, I try to help her [Basanti] as much as I can,\" said Niruu Bala. \"If I stop helping her, the poor old woman will surely die.\"\nAsked if she got assistance from the government's safety net programmes and the NGOs, the relative said: \"Yes. But those are inadequate. She does not have any skill or training. So, she cannot even take small loans.\"\nMutakabbirul, who works at the local office of iNGO Practical Action, said very few people are aware of the jolt Basanti's picture had created in 1974.\n\"I knew very little about the 1974 famine, until I learned about Basanti after coming here for work,\" said Mutakabbirul, who introduced this reporter to Basanti.\n\n\nA local NGO has recently started working with Basanti, training her on growing sweet pumpkins | Abu Siddique\nIn March 1974, agro-based ultra-poor communities were already suffering due to a sharp rise in rice prices, triggered by widespread hoarding. When a severe flood hit some of the northern districts, things got totally out of the government's hand which was still struggling to rebuild the country.\nThe situation started to ease after international aid and food relief arrived in October. By December 1974, the famine was officially over. And with that, things went back to square one for women like Basanti and she was lost in oblivion.\nA local NGO has recently started working with Basanti, training her on growing sweet pumpkins.\nKhalid Hossain, who works for an international donor agency, said there were many organisations that worked with people with disabilities but they never got in touch with women like Basanti who live in remote villages.\n\"Even the government has not done much for them.\n\"So, whatever money they get from NGOs or government's social safety nets, they spend it on food. If they had some kind of training, they could have the money or taken micro loans to turn their lives around,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n"

Numerous pros have been pointed out along with the cons.\nThe West is realising its \"not so favourable\" impacts and are stitching the path to mitigate the concerns, especially in the younger generation.\nHere in our culture, its spectacular rise in popularity suggests that it fulfils the needs of our budding society.\nHowever, much to the dismay of many, the truth is not far from the reality that social media's intrusion is crafting a \"perception error\" in the way we look at our daily lives.\nBelow, I have tried to outline a few of the rising concerns derived from published journals, conducted research, and from my own experiences over the years.\nThe need for social media may be great but it should be borne with a subsequent precaution in the way it is exercised.\nPrivate or public?\nSocial media is a powerful tool used to manoeuvre the thought process of the users -- it speaks before even we have spoken.\nFacebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and so forth, make us capable of throwing away our privacy along with social morality from its users.\nIt's one thing when we use them for personal matters, and completely another when mass information comes into the fore.\nDeconstructing the private\nWhen social media is used to create awareness on humanitarian issues such as the ethnic cleansing of the Royingya, flood victims in Kurigram, or even traffic alerts in the labyrinthine streets of Dhaka city, it shows some of its potential in doing good for people.\nBut when most of its users harness the power of such platforms to show off gross levels of excess -- be it a needlessly expensive Louis Vuitton bag or a needlessly expensive meal -- the impact of social media on the human psyche starts to show its uglier side.\nNot only do these fuel envy among peers -- who are probably moping about having an empty life for not owning a Chihuahua -- but cultural commentators argue that such posts on Facebook are signs of vanity, loneliness, and engagement to escape the boredom of one's own mundane life.\nBut I would be fooling myself if I said I never experienced similar feelings, since I am an active user of digital media. But I often ponder whether we are actually growing with the advancement of the technology.\nThe need to deconstruct our private lives just to get digital appreciation in the public gaze is the saddest part of our lives brought about by this technology. What used to be \"sharing\" turned out to be a desperate attempt to present a perfect, idealised version of ourselves to the world.\nNot to mention the addiction generated in young people to seek validation. It is almost more satisfying to get \"likes\" on one of your selfies taken under a banyan tree with a cousin's friend from Alaska, than having someone actually appreciate you.\nNone the wiser\nNot that long ago, we believed in communicating through words but that has changed since the advent of emoticons. This new language of communication make scholars wonder whether young people are losing the necessary interpersonal and social skills required to compete in the real world.\nFacebook has created a world of fantasy in the minds of young people, where they can be whatever they want, whoever they want, and everyone is none the wiser.\nWhat used to be 'sharing' turned out to be a desperate attempt to present a perfect, idealised version of ourselves to the world\nMany speculate that young people use Facebook as a source of information to avoid using more challenging sources, such as newspapers, articles, or journal reports.\nThe flip-side of the coin is that social media transcends all physical boundaries. It is indeed the easiest platform for, well, social networking. For businesses, it's the most essential and crucial tool for studying and reaching customers.\nWhatever the depth of information may be, it thus provides the quickest information for its users. Not to mention, it can be used to create awareness in the shortest possible time.\nBut concerns arise when such platforms are misused without proper knowledge, thus creating problems for society instead.\nA torrent of overwhelming data from research exists on the challenges of digital media, and they can be interepreted in different ways but one thing remains certain: The eventual outcome depends on the user's ability to comprehend the many facades of social media's reality.\nMahzabeen Faruque is a freelance contributor.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Cabinet has approved the recognition of The Republic of Kosovo as a sovereign and independent country. With this approval, Bangladesh has become the 114th country to recognise Kosovo's independence. Cabinet Secretary Mohammad Shafiul Alam briefed the reporters after the regular Cabinet meeting at the Secretariat on Monday. In 1945, Yugoslavia became a communist country under the command of Marshal Josip Broz Tito. He dealt with independence-minded residents by creating six republics - Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. Kosovo was given autonomous status, but kept firmly under control. This was evident when the Yugoslav army was sent into the province to quell a riot staged by Albanian students over poor living conditions in 1981. Subsequently, in 1989, Kosovo was stripped of its autonomy by the Yugoslav government of Slobodan Milosevic. This did not stop the country's ethnic Albanian leaders from declaring independence the following year. The Milosevic government dissolved the provincial government and fired more than 100,000 ethnic Albanian workers. Soon after, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia declared independence from Yugoslavia, and in 1992, war broke out in the Balkans. Nato launched air strikes against Serbia in 1999, and Albanian refugees poured out of Kosovo relating stories of Serbian atrocities.  After years of strained relations between its majority Albanian population and Serb inhabitants, the country unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008. It has been recognised by the United States and major European Union countries, but Serbia, backed by its powerful ally Russia, refused to do so, as did most of the ethnic Serbs in the country. Until 2008, the province had been administered by the UN. Reconciliation between the Albanian majority, most of whom support independence, and the Serb minority seemed unattainable. Finally, in 2013, Kosovo and Serbia reached a landmark agreement which granted a high degree of autonomy to Serb-majority areas in the north and both sides agreed not to bar one another from seeking EU membership."

Perceptions of climatic changes and people's cooperative attitudes toward flood protection in Bangladesh\", the study revealed that climatic change in Bangladesh has become so pronounced, people are now able to detect the seasonal change.\nThe study said such a seasonal shift must be taken seriously as it fundamentally affects agriculture and the daily life of the people of Bangladesh, where the current practices of farming and economic activities have been adapted to six distinguishable seasons.\n\"Under the circumstances, the susceptible condition of the country's six seasons is a warning for Bangladesh. Our attempts for survival have already led to the loss of numerous kinds of crops, while many species of animals have gone extinct,\" Pavel said.\n[caption id=\"attachment_232904\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Monsoon season, which inspired many a great poem in Bangla, these days becomes a headache for city denizens when drainage systems fail to drain out all the rainwater Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nHe said the global temperature has increased by 0.6 degree Celsius since the middle of the 18th century and the sea level has risen by about 10-25 centimetres.\nAt the same time, the density of ice in the Arctic region has also reduced by around 40%.\n\"Changes in climate would have strong impacts on the biodiversity of the world, with an estimated one million diverse species at risk of extinction from changes in reproductive periods, the growth of species and changing ecological conditions,\" Pavel said.\nChanges noticed\nBazlur Rashid, a meteorologist of Bangladesh Meteorological Department, said they have noticed a significant change in the country's weather pattern over the past few years.\n\"In recent years, the overall duration of winter has decreased and the monsoon is moving further and further away, and lasting far longer,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. \"This year, we experienced excessive rainfall which continued until October, and it could trigger a stronger winter than last year.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_232905\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Autumn, the season of Durga Puja, is also the nightmare for people with pollen allergy Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nBazlur said seasonal changes were occurring all over the world, including in Bangladesh, as the temperature of Earth continues to increase under the effect of global warming caused by excessive carbon emissions.\n\"In the next 100 years, the overall temperature in Bangladesh could increase by 1.2 degrees Celsius, while globally it could go up by an average of 2 degrees Celsius,\" he added.\nAcknowledging the shift in seasons in the country, the meteorologist said the department needed to conduct more research on this matter to identify the changes and come up with measures to tackle their impacts.\n[caption id=\"attachment_232907\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] General medium textbooks tells us Late Autumn is the season of harvesting, but with the development of high-tech breeds of crops, now harvesting has become a year-round activity for farmers Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nProf Towhida Rashid, chairman of the department of meteorology at Dhaka University, said some shifts are already visible in the country's weather pattern.\n\"The temperature in Bangladesh has also gone up along with the rest of the world (and) it has affected the country's weather pattern,\" she said. \"Winter has become brief and monsoon has been shifting and lasting longer.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_232909\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Winter, the season of fresh vegetables and festivities across the country Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nWhen asked about the reason behind the visible seasonal changes, the professor said changes in the weather pattern often took place after a certain period -  typically spanning 20-30 years - in a certain region, but that man-made causes are the main contributors for the ongoing rapid global warming.\nShe said: \"Apart from excessive carbon emissions, pollution is one of the key actors for global warming. We are currently experiencing severe dust pollution in Dhaka.\n[caption id=\"attachment_232910\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Spring, used to be considered the best among all seasons, now just prepares Bangladeshis for summer exhaustion Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\n\"If the aerosphere is densely polluted with dust, Earth cannot release the heat it receives from The Sun and eventually its surface remains warmer.\"\nThe professor added that a set of complex studies and more research are required to determine whether any season has gone missing.\n\n\n\n\n"

There have been at least two large scale Rohingya migrations since that year. The largest number, counting up to three hundred thousand refugees, was reached in the year 1992. However, small scale migration or infiltration of Rohingyas never ceased. Now the flood gates of refugees are open once again, it seems like the Rohingya exodus from Rakhine State will continue in the foreseeable future, at least till the Myanmar authorities relent.\nHowever, the question is will Myanmar relent and stop this exodus?\nRohingya migration into Bangladesh and other neighboring countries including India and Thailand has been going on for the last five decades, for reasons that are well documented. The Rohingya were denied citizenship because they do not fall within the defined ethnicities of Myanmar, nor are they descendants of ancestors who settled in the country before 1823, at the beginning of British occupation of Arakan State. The Rohingya claim that they are descendants of people who had settled in the country since ninth century. But Their claim falls on deaf ears as the Rohingya are not one of the thirteen recognized national races.\nThe festering citizenship issue is further complicated by their religion (Muslim) and their language (a dialect derived from Bengali). This has prevented the Rohingyas from blending with the Arakanese, who are mainly Buddhists by religion. This difference also made the Rohingyas somewhat politically ambitious since the independence of Myanmar (then Burma) from the British. The Rohingyas formed clandestine political groups, hoping to establish a state of their own, when Myanmar was fighting guerrilla groups along the Chinese and the Thai border, including in the Arakan State.\nThe frequent clashes between the Burmese army and the guerrilla groups had led to the first eviction of the Rohingyas by the government in 1978, although technically on grounds of them being non-citizens.\nThe first repatriation of the Rohingya refugees in 1979 was possible for three reasons. First, Bangladesh chose not to escalate the crisis to the international level, but dealt with the issue on a bilateral level. Second, the Myanmar government responded positively to resolve the problem by not only agreeing to accept all refugees, but also by ensuring security for them. Third, the clandestine political organization of the Rohingyas did not obstruct to the repatriation.\nUnfortunately the Rohingya issue has grown much larger in scale and complexity in recent times. While at one level, the issue can be viewed as a humanitarian crisis, the reason why the international community is anxiously watching the events unfold. At another level, the issue is intermixed with terrorism. Ironically, what was originally a state sponsored terror against a helpless minority, has now gone full circle to a terror group attacking the state. Myanmar authorities now cite the recent attack by the secretive Rohingya political group as the main cause of Rohingya sufferings.\nAs the situation stands now, the Myanmar authorities are not likely to relent. The attack by the so called Rohingya guerrillas has added more fuel to the fire, that was ignited by the Buddhist monks during violence against Arakan Muslims in 2012. It is ironic that a state that was shared by two communities for hundreds of years (Buddhists account for 52%, and Muslims for 42%), would suddenly be split primarily on religious grounds.\nThis tragic turn of events cannot stop until Myanmar itself brings the situation under control. As the history of Burma tells us, the country cannot be forced by outside powers to heed to their demands. Muslim countries of the world can express solidarity with the Rohingyas and offer financial help, but they cannot offer them security in their homeland. Only Myanmar can do that.\nTo do that, Bangladesh will have to deal its hands deftly, and with caution. First and foremost, it is necessary to continue our dialogue with Myanmar at all levels, including at the borders and the central. Second, Bangladesh should seek support from India in this dialogue, as a third party which is equally concerned at the Rohingya exodus.\nThere are more than a million Rohingyas living in Arakan. If all of them leaves, will India be spared?\nThe best thing going on for Bangladesh now, is that the international community is viewing our plight with understanding and compassion. The crisis needs to be portrayed as a humanitarian support, that Bangladesh is extending to the nationals of a foreign country who have fled their homes for civil unrest. But we will also need to categorically point out to Myanmar and the outside world, that we cannot offer a permanent home to the Rohingyas.\nThey belong to their country. Myanmar will need to change their citizenship laws, to facilitate the return of the Rohingyas to their true home.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "authors": "Selina Mohsin",
      "text": "We use the term \"globalisation\" in different contexts, referring to the worldwide movement of goods, capital, information, technology, services, cultures, and ideas. Technological advances such as the recent development and spread of mobile phones and internet generate greater interdependence of economic, social, and cultural activities. Globalisation is not an unmixed blessing. It has to be faced with adequate expertise and resources, but it is here and will remain.        It has been good for Bangladesh: Surplus labour sends remittances from richer countries; foreign capital and technology feed a thriving RMG industry exporting to distant markets and help diversification into pharmaceuticals, leather industries, and in other areas. Access to global science and innovative technology has helped to raise agricultural productivity and fight disease. The Bangladeshi diaspora assists in widening contacts, markets, and ideas. Similarly, many other developed and developing economies have benefitted from globalisation, leading to huge expansions in trade, higher productivity, reduced levels of poverty, and in some cases, to spectacular increases in wealth. China has been the most striking example, its exports financing recovery from decades of exploitation and war to regain its ancient \"middle kingdom\" prosperity and power. Yet in much of the \"developed world,\" especially in the US and Europe, globalisation, in its many aspects and in the wake of the 2007-8 financial crisis, the country has been increasingly attacked. Some see it as unfair foreign low wage competition and as challenging jobs and cultural norms through increased immigration. Financial experts point to dangers from the enormous expansion of money supply by central banks and the nearly instantaneous transfers of trillions of capital around the globe. Not only might this bring another even worse financial crisis, it can hinder social stability by combining an elite plutocracy with stagnation or decline in majority living standards. The rise of the populists Populist resentments have led to the Brexit referendum in the UK and to Donald Trump, becoming theUS president. Competitive nationalism and protectionism, particularly as promoted by Trump, pose new threats to free trade. Institutions for international cooperation, such as the UN, World Bank, IMF, and WTO have lost US leadership. Are negative aspects of globalisation taking over from its positive aspects? Nor has globalisation been universally welcomed in the developing economies. Whether from freer trade, faster diffusion of information and technology, or from capital flows, globalisation promotes rapid economic and social change. In all countries, whether rich or poor, this is disturbing; especially for conservative societies. It threatens all governments and economies slow to adapt to changes or ill-equipped to exercise a measure of control over it. For example, for countries possessing commodities in demand, such as oil or minerals, globalisation in transport and trade initially brought a massive financial boost. We must essentially meet these challenges from our own resources. But we must also continue to utilise the benefits of globalisation Yet, the new flood of wealth often led to massive corruption by ruling elites, with the mass of the population kept quiescent by heavy subsidies for energy, imported foodstuffs, and consumer items. When world demand and prices collapsed, their over-dependence on a single revenue source meant catastrophe; either immediate, as in Venezuela, or threatened by fast depleting reserves, as in Algeria. Even the poorest developing economies, held back by exploitation, by subsistence agriculture, by minimal health and education services, or even by civil war, have still experienced aspects of globalisation, particularly the information revolution. The spread of mobile phones, followed by internet access, has been almost universal, opening a new world of information access, and new potential and opportunities for economic growth. Yet, in the short term, it can dangerously raise aspirations and demands before new jobs can match population growth. Such new demands, especially in conditions of weak governance or poor quality leadership, lead to desperate and often tragic attempts to migrate or even to civil conflict which makes conditions worse. Yet, whether welcoming or blaming globalisation, it must be remembered that this is a very general term needing astute handling. Policy analysis and action must focus on specific elements to be effective. Besides capital flows or the information and transport revolutions, there are many other factors with global impact. These include still rapid population growth, as in Sub-Saharan Africa, or aging and declining populations, as in Europe or Japan, technological and scientific development is dissolving traditional jobs but creating others, making constant training and re-skilling imperative. Then there is climate change, or problems such as diseases spread by mass travel. A connected world We live in a world pulled together and interconnected in so many different ways. Yet we are still marked and divided by history and by rival power combinations. We still treasure national, religious, linguistic, and cultural differences which give us identity. We also live in a world of information, transportation, and migration revolutions which can cause a fear of change, or break down barriers and stereotyped prejudices. These are challenges, but are also opportunities, which we can face as individuals, families, communities, and countries, as world citizens. International organisations and collaborative work in all areas, such as regulation of capital flows, trade, science, and medicine will be more vital than ever. Travel and social media contacts can help us reach across traditional barriers to help us appreciate our common humanity. This article opened with the assertion that globalisation had, in different ways, been good to Bangladesh. Much progress has been made. There are hopes and plans to achieve middle income status. Yet, we are aware of the daunting scale of the challenges we still face daily. Even in Dhaka and Chittagong, our main centres of wealth creation, rising vehicle ownership paralyses traffic, population increases still swamp housing provision, basic utilities are still inadequate, and every heavy monsoon can become a nightmare liable to spread disease. We must essentially meet these challenges from our own resources. But we must also continue to utilise the benefits of globalisation: Accessing foreign investment, technology and markets, cooperating in regional development. We need to combat corruption and inefficiency, maintain and strengthen a democratic system under the rule of law. Most of all, we desperately need to improve our education, and training systems at all levels. It can be done. Selina Mohsin is a former ambassador."

      "text": "The head of Myanmar's most powerful ethnic rebel group has warned that fighting in the country's restive borderlands has reached a critical point, threatening to derail the government's wobbling push for peace. Bao Youxiang, chairman of the Wa, told dozens of armed ethnic leaders they must forge a \"new path to peace\" as the government's efforts to expand a ceasefire signed with some groups in 2015 have faltered, according to a leaked version of a speech seen by a news agency. Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been pushing to expand the deal, known as the NCA, since her party took power a year ago in a bid to end the decades-long conflicts rumbling across the country's borderlands. But clashes between the army and ethnic minority fighters along the China border have intensified, displacing an estimated 20,000 people and threatening the second round of peace talks slated for next month. \"The ethnic fighting happening today is heavier than ever,\" Bao told ethnic leaders gathered in Pangkham, the de facto capital of the UWSA's territories, on Wednesday, according to the transcript. \"War in northern Kachin state and northern Shan state along the Myanmar-China border is getting worse day by day. The NCA being discussed between some ethnic organisations and Myanmar's government has brought no solution. \"The many conflicts along Myanmar's road to peace... mean the dawn can't be seen.\" Also read: Myanmar's Kachin armed groups want 'terrorist' label removed The United Wa State Army, also known as the Wa, is the most powerful of the country's ethnic rebel factions with an estimated 25,000 heavily armed troops and strong ties to China. Its delegates stormed out of the first round of Suu Kyi's peace talks last August over a spat about their accreditation. The group is also accused of producing and trafficking huge amounts of methamphetamine and heroin from their own mini-state on the Chinese border, and buying weapons with the proceeds. Around 40 delegates from eight ethnic rebel armies gathered in Pangkham this week ahead of Suu Kyi's next round of peace talks, which were delayed until next month after one group threatened to boycott. Among the attendees of the USWA-led meeting were members of the Northern Alliance, a collection of four ethnic armed groups that has been locked in bitter conflict with the army since November. The UN's rights envoy Yanghee Lee warned last month that the humanitarian situation in Kachin state, a focal point of recent fighting, was now worse than at any point in the past few years.

      "text": "\nBhasan Char: As unpredictable as the sea\n\n\n\n\nShahed Shafiq\n\n\n\n\n Published at 12:57 am October 20th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 01:42 am October 21st, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nBhashan Char rose up in the Bay of Bengal around 25 years ago. Over years, the island emerged and submerged in the estuary of the Meghna River and the Bay of Bengal. Erosion is a regular phenomenon in the island.\nBoatmen and sailors who have used this waterway for years say several square kilometres of the landmass have been eroded away by the river and the sea.\nAccording to data collected by the Forest Department, at least 5,000-7,000 acres of forest on Bhashan Char have disappeared into the river estuary since the formation of the island. The erosion continues to this day.\n\nAlso Read Part 2: The island that rises and falls with tide\n\nReports show that the island's landmass increases by up to 50,000 acres during the low tide. At high tide, only 13,000 acres are visible, of which barely 5,000 acres are habitable.\nThe Forest Department believes that further research is needed to determine whether more of the island will emerge from the sea in the future, or if the current landmass will gradually erode away.\nThe department also stated that 16,000 acres of mangrove trees have been planted on Bhashan Char between 2000 and last year.\nAsked about how 16,000 acres of the island could be forested when it has only 13,000 acres of land, Forest Officer Md Tohidul Islam said: \"Many areas have disappeared into the sea due to erosion, and it still continues.\"\nDuring our visit to Bhashan Char, we found that the southern and southeastern regions of the island were suffering from frequent erosion.\nThe Forest Department data confirmed that as much as half a kilometre of the island was disappearing into the sea every year due to erosion.\nIn search of more information, we spoke with Alam, 58, a fisherman by trade and a resident of Panchayat village in Hatiya.\nAlam used to go fishing in a canal between Jaliyar Char and Dubar Char 10 years ago.\n\"We could cross the canal on foot during the low tide, and by swimming during the high tide,\" he told the Bangla Tribune. \"But rampant erosion broke the canal apart in the last 10 years. There is no fish there anymore, and the forest area is also disappearing into the sea.\"\nDuring our inspection, we found that the oldest parts of the island were gradually eroding, but new landmass was emerging on the northern and western sides.\nEven the local administration are concerned over the stability of this island.\nNalchira Range Beat Officer Md Nahid Hasan recently compiled a report on Bhashan Char following the directive of the higher authorities.\nThe report states that the island, primarily formed of sand and clay soil, initially emerged as a river island of Meghna. Its high point is at the centre.\nDue to the topography of the island, it gets inundated during the high tide, and more landmass emerges during the low tide. Farming and agriculture would be quite difficult in Bhashan Char due to regular contamination of soil by the sea water, as well as the soft, muddy nature of the soil, the report said.\n\"We are aware that erosion is a continuous phenomenon in Bhashan Char. It will take more time for the island to become more stable,\" Hatiya Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Khandaker Md Rezaul Karim said.\n\"If the government moves ahead with the plan to rehabilitate the Rohingya in Bhashan Char, it will first implement necessary measures to control erosion. Currently, around 5,000 acres of the landmass is habitable.\"\nForest Officer Md Tohidul Islam said: \"During my visit to Bhashan Char, I saw that the southeastern side of the island is suffering erosion, but new landmass is also emerging on the western side. It takes around 40-50 years for an island to reach stability.\n\"When a new island emerges, we conduct an inspection there. We plant trees as soon as grasses start growing there. Trees help the ground accumulate alluvium, and forestation gradually strengthens the soil. That is how an island becomes habitable.\"\nThe Bangla Tribune has learned that Bangladesh Navy officials had showed Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal a presentation on Bhashan Char during his visit to the island on September 28.\nThe presentation showcased several technological solutions for preventing erosion there.\nAccording to the local administration, Bhashan Char is 8km long and 4km wide. Around 500 acres of land has been proposed for use in the Rohingya rehabilitation programme.\nSpeaking on the matter, Noakhali Deputy Commissioner Md Mahbub Alam Talukder said: \"The erosion can be prevented using modern technology. A land survey is currently underway there. I cannot provide more details on the matter, because I lack the technical expertise.\"\nThe deputy commissioner added that no island was habitable for the people without implementing a few development measures.\nTo make Bhashan Char habitable, several essential infrastructure such as embankments, roads, cyclone shelters, educational institutions, fresh water sources and police camps must be built there.\n\"There are plans to begin construction of a 13km embankment around Bhasan Char next month. The whole island will be brought under the protection of the embankment after the Rohingya are relocated there,\" Mahbub Alam Talukder said.\nThe article was first published on Bangla Tribune.\n\n\n\n\n"

We discussed the matter.\"\nAccording to sources, Chief Justice Surendra Kumar Sinha went to Bangabhaban that morning to exchange greetings with the Hindu community on Janmashtami. Obaidul Quader met the Chief Justice at his residence on Saturday to discuss the verdict.\nWhile addressing a rally at Dhaka's Palashi intersection after the meeting, Obaidul Quader said there is no reason to worry over Supreme Court's observation in its judgement scraping 16th constitutional amendment, reports BSS.\n\"There might be concern among us, but there is no need to worry. I have met Chief Justice with the permission of the president of my party Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. I have let the chief justice know the position of my party over the judgment. Today, I met President M Abdul Hamid following advice of my party president,\" he said.\nFakhrul: Govt out to stage drama over 16th Amendment verdict\nBNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Monday alleged that the government is trying to stage a drama over the Supreme Court's verdict that revoked the 16th constitutional amendment.\n\"The government is out to make a drama over the 16th amendment verdict as it has exposed that Awami League has no legitimacy to stay in power. It has also clearly manifested that the party has no moral ground to run the government,\" he said.\nFakhrul came up with the remarks while talking to journalists during his visit to different flood-affected areas in the district, reports our district correspondent Zakir Mostafiz.\n\nAlso Read- Ruling alliance to tackle 16th Amendment verdict politically, legally\n\nThe BNP leader said their party is considering the apex court's verdict as a historical and significant document as it has revealed the truth and the ruling party's real colour.\nHe said it is Awami League's old habit to oppose the court verdict which goes against its interests.\n\"We strongly condemn the Awami League's efforts to stir a controversy over the Supreme Court's 16th amendment judgment,\" Fakhrul said.\nHe hoped that good sense will prevail upon the government to hold a fair election under a non-party supportive government through talks with political parties.\nHanif: Quader met CJ to resolve crisis\nAwami League Joint General Secretary Mahbubul Alam Hanif on Monday said his party's General Secretary Obaidul Quader went to Chief Justice's residence to resolve the ongoing crisis and there is no scope of any debate over it.\n\"The judiciary is independent, the government and the Awami League want the judiciary work independently. We want the crisis which has been created after the verdict to be resolved soon and for this reason Obaidul Quader went to CJ's residence.....there is no scope of debate over it,\" he said.\nHanif came up with this remark a day after BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir expressed concern over Obaidul Quader's meeting with the Chief Justice at the latter's residence.\n\"We've got surprised by the visit as they were attacking the Chief Justice with aggressive and indecent words, \" said Fakhrul at a programme on Sunday and urged his party colleagues to remain alert as the government has been hatching a new plot to obliterate democracy.\nHanif was addressing a seminar titled \"Tumi E Bangladesh\" organised by Shotirtho Shojon at the National Press Club.\nTerming the observation in the Supreme Court verdict that annulled the 16th Amendment as objectionable, Hanif said: \"Expunge the statement given in the name of observation immediately. It is the demand of people. People of the country are not ready to accept the observation, they have been angry and shocked at it.\"\nCiting the observation as a conspiracy against the government, Health Minister Mohammed Nasim said new conspiracy started again with the verdict against the government.....the main target is to stop Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as she is driving the country towards development.\"\nPart of the story was first published on Bangla Tribune\n\n\n\n\n"

Even they were building their tents in two to three kilometre deep of the forest from the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Road and fetch their firewood from the deep and fresh forest.\"\n\"This huge number of Rohingya is almost burning 50,000kg of firewood for cooking every day. They are mainly relying on the forest around the area of their camps. As a result, the forests are being destroyed every day,\" forest department officials told UNB.\nDeputy Director of Environment Department of Cox's Bazar Saiful Arshad said \"There is no shortage of relief to Ukhiya-Teknaf and Naikhangchhari Rohingya camps but there is a severe crisis of firewood which is going on as the number of the Rohingya people stands at 110,000 [new and old entrants] and is increasing every day.\"\nJane Alam, a Rohingya living in the Balukhali camp, said: \"We cannot collect firewood due to rain earlier. Now we are collecting and burning firewood to the stove in the morning and evening which is being collected from the forest. There is no alternative to this cutting forest to collect firewood for cooking.\"\nUNB also found that the trees and horticultural trees of the forest are burning in these stoves. Even they are regularly picking up the root of the trees which can cause mudslides.\nSome children were busy with the cutting of the root of the trees for their firewood, and many of them were collecting dry firewood from the deep forest.\n'No Man's Land' of Tambru (Ghumdhum Border area), Boro Chhakhola Para of Naikhangchhari, Phultoli and Ashartoli all presented the same the same picture.\nCox's Bazar Divisional Forest Officer (South) Mohammad Ali Kabir said, \"We have to think about the availability of firewood for the Rohingya people as nature will take its revenge.\"\nMentioning the tragic incident of three Rohingya deaths in an attack by wild elephants in the hills of Ukhiya, DFO Kabir said, \"Everyone will have to think about it. Efforts should be taken to restore the damage to the hills and forests. Some individuals and organisations have distributed some kerosene stoves as the relief. But it is a little less than the requirement,\" he added.\nPresident of Cox's Bazar Forest and Environment Conservation Council Dipak Sharma Dipu said \"It is not an easy matter to provide the firewood for the huge number of Rohingya entrants as there is a lot of demand of firewood which is increasing day by day. They are regularly meeting their needs of the firewood by cutting forests and social forestry trees.'\nHe also said \"The government and the administration should plan to provide firewood for Rohingyas including the relief. Otherwise, the way they start damaging forests, there will be an environmental disaster very soon.\"\nIgnoring the environmental disaster, Environment and Forest Minister Anwar Hossain Manju on October 25 said that 1000 acre more land will be allocated if it needed after his visit to the Kutupalong Rohingya camp in Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya Upazila. \"Some partial damage to the environment needed to be accepted and compromised for the sake of the Rohingya refugees.\"\nEarlier, the relief and disaster management minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya also said on Thursday (5 October) had announced the allocation of 1,000 acres forest as the Kutupalong refugee camp in Ukhiya of Cox's Bazar will be expanded increased from 3,000 acres to build 1, 50,000 sheds by the government in total to accommodate the Rohingya people there.\nHowever, the highest rate of death for environmental pollution ion happens in Bangladesh, according to a new report published on 20 October in the Lancet, a journal produced by The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health.\nAccording to the report of the Refugee Relief and Rehabilitation Commission of Cox's Bazar, some 604,000 Myanmar citizens were listed as of October 24 and the influx of the Myanmar nationals into Bangladesh from Rakhine State continues.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "The history of civilisation is the history of rivers. The remarkable and most influential civilisations in human history like Sindh, Iraqi, Chinese, European, and Egyptian were built on the banks of the Sindh, Euphrates, Yangtze, Danube, and Nile rivers. The culture, traditions, and values of the denizens of any civilisation and society fundamentally used to depend on the direct effects of the respective rivers. Along with this process, social practice, belief, livelihoods, the agricultural system, urbanisation, and industrialisation of the countries have been developed, based on the rivers, all over the world. Being located in the Indian sub-continent, Bangladesh is branded as a riverine country. Most of the rivers of Bangladesh originate from the Himalayan valleys traversing India, Nepal, and Bhutan and have merged into the Bay of Bengal, flowing through the country. The thousands of years of culture of the country's area owe it to the surrounding rivers. Bangladesh is also recognised as the \"sap of Asia\" to some extent, as it has many trans-boundary rivers flowing through the country. Livelihoods have always benefitted from the curving rivers and the urbanisation of Bangladesh has also been river-centric. Major cities like Dhaka, Rajshahi, Barisal, Sylhet, Khulna, and Narayanganj have been built taking advantage of the rivers around them. Though many numbers of rivers had existed before, now we have only about a hundred rivers still running. The rivers are degrading due to many reasons. Many rivers in the northern and south-western part of Bangladesh have already died, and some have seen their water flow reduced considerably. There have been many reasons as to why our rivers are so threatened. Rivers from other parts of the country have lost the navigability, which is responsible for flood and river erosion, as well as becoming threat to livelihoods. If this situation continues, then in the near future, it will be difficult for the country people to get the advantages of the rivers. To protect the existing rivers and to ensure the sustainability of the water from the rivers, some measurements need to be taken as soon as possible. People should be made aware of the negative consequences of destroying rivers and the kinds of activities which are harmful to them. Finally, Bangladesh needs to be prepared to win \"river diplomacy.\" There are many trans-boundary rivers in Bangladesh, and most of the rivers enter through India. India utilises its geographical advantages and the Indian River Commission is building dams by the side of almost every river. If the country wins in 'river diplomacy,' it will be possible to protect the rivers and water bodies. We must do everything to protect the rivers, which are vital to our life, nature, livelihood, and culture This is having adverse effects on the water management system of Bangladesh. The water flow, supply, and management of any country depends on the trans-boundary rivers management system. In this case, Bangladesh has not been able to bring fruitful results in the last few decades. The water flow, supply, and management system depends on four river systems: The Ganges, Jamuna, Borak-Meghna, and Karnaphuli. Water is being withdrawn from the very beginning, starting from the Himalayan valleys, resulting in Bangladesh always receiving a small amount of water from the trans-boundary rivers. The water flow is not only needed, but also keeps the rivers alive. But the amount of water in the rivers is reducing day by day. As such, it is great that the National River Conservation Commission (NRCC) has been formed in our country. This commission has a big role to play in protecting our rivers and in conducting negotiations with other countries. Many of the rivers have been badly encroached, and the government is planning and implementing many laws against this encroachment of rivers. They are working with the environmental activists in this regard, which is commendable. These hands should be dealt strongly and assertively. Finally, if the country wins in \"river diplomacy,\" then it will be possible to protect the rivers and water bodies. We must do everything to protect the rivers, which are vital to our life, nature, livelihood, and culture. Md Ashik Sarder is a development practitioner and researcher.

They will also lead their countries in the JWG.\nRepresentatives from relevant ministries, including Home and Disaster Management, also attended the meeting.\nAfterwards, Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali expressed his satisfaction over the progress of the talks and said the next step of the repatriation process will start soon.\n\nAlso Read- Myanmar plans to take back 300 Rohingyas per day\n\nUnder the instrument signed on November 23, only the Rohingyas who have fled to Bangladesh after October 2016, will be sent back.\nRohingyas who have been living since before the October 2016 Rohingya crisis will be sent back later.\nAccording to the terms, the repatriation will require proof of residency in Myanmar.\nThey will have to produce copies of documents issued in Myanmar which indicate they are residents of Myanmar. This extends to, but is not limited to, citizenship identity cards, national registration cards, temporary registration cards, business ownership documents, school attendance, etc.\nAny refugee documentation issued by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) will also be subject to similar verification. The government of Myanmar gets the last say in any dispute.\nMyanmar has also agreed to not prosecute or penalize any of the repatriated for illegal exodus and return, unless they are found to be specifically involved in terrorist or criminal activities.\nAnd after the repatriation, both governments will not provide residency or citizenship to any illegal immigrants.\nAH Mahmodd Ali on Tuesday noted the agreement is legally binding, but greatly depends on the sincerity of both governments to implement it successfully.\nIn preparation for Tuesday's agreement, an inter-ministerial meeting was held at the foreign ministry on Sunday, where the formation of the joint working group and its structure were discussed.\nAn estimated 655,000 Rohingyas have entered Bangladesh fleeing the violence in Myanmar's Rakhine State since August 25, raising the total Rohingya population in Cox's Bazar to 867,000, said the UN migration agency on Sunday.\nIt said the new arrivals are living in spontaneous settlements increasing the need for humanitarian assistance, including shelter, food, clean water, and sanitation.\nThe article was first published on Bangla Tribune \n\n\n\n\n"

Even her uterus is missing, making it difficult to say if she was raped.\"\nHowever, Ehsan Shah, Shariatpur additional superintendent of police (ASP), says the body parts may have simply decomposed.\n\"The dead body is seven days old and it was submerged in muddy water. Most of the body parts except for the bones had decomposed. That's why the vital organs are missing,\" he told the Bangla Tribune.\nOC Monjurul said police were looking into the matter.\nOn July 15, Liza went out of her house riding a bicycle and did not return.\n\n\n\n\n"

In these upazilas, implementing partners intend to improve hygiene behaviour among the people by promoting sustainable WASH services.\nThe project also aims to strengthen the existing formal and informal structures to establish clear channels of accountability. It will promote better resource management in the local government, communities and health facilities, alongside service delivery to highly marginalised and poverty-stricken people living in hard-to-reach areas.\n\"Climate change poses many challenges towards accessing water, sanitation and hygiene services in the coastal belt of our country,\" said WaterAid Bangladesh Country Director Dr Md Khairul Islam, who delivered the concluding remarks at the ceremony.\n\"The water and sanitation infrastructures in marginal and hard-to-reach areas are fragile, and there is a huge gap between need and actual availability of these services.\"\nKhairul added that the programme aims to create opportunities to deal with the challenges as well as to bring about a positive and sustainable impact on the lives of many across the most vulnerable areas of Bangladesh.\nMd Mahbub-ur Rahman, deputy chief executive officer and country head of commercial banking of HSBC, was present at the event as the special guest, while WaterAid's Fundraising and Learning Director Dr Imrul Kayes Muniruzzaman gave the introductory speech.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "\nParliament passes law allowing child marriage in 'special cases'\n\n\n\n\nTribune Desk\n\n\n\n\n Published at 10:21 pm February 27th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 02:20 pm March 8th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe government has passed a controversial law allowing marriages of underage girls and boys in 'special cases', ignoring repeated calls of the rights groups.\nThe 'Child Marriage Restraint Bill 2017' puts boys below 21 years of age and girls below 18 years in the underage category. Any marriage involving one or both parties below the legal age will be considered 'child marriage', reports UNB.\nHowever, marriages involving underage brides or grooms will not be considered an offence if they take place with the consent of the court and the guardians in \"special contexts\" serving the \"best interest\" of the underage female, the law says.\nBangladesh has one of the highest child marriage rates in the world - the highest in Asia. Over half (52%) of Bangladeshi girls get married before 18 and almost one-fifth (18%) are married off before 15.\nParliament passed the bill by a voice vote on Monday after State Minister for Women and Children's Affairs Meher Afroze Chumki tabled it.\nOn December 8 last year, Chumki placed the bill in Parliament with a provision for underage marriages in 'special cases'. With the passage of the bill in the House, the existing Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 will be abolished.\n\nAlso Read- 'Child Marriage Restraint Act contradicts itself'\n\nThe Cabinet on November 24 approved the bill that drew criticism from various quarters, especially rights groups. Critics say the law will only \"encourage\" child marriages rather than curb the practice. The Human Rights Watch in December criticised Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for going back on her promise to end child marriages.\nHasina had hit back at the critics, saying the law was framed \"considering the reality of our society\".\nShe criticised those who questioned the 'special provision'. \"They are far away from reality,\" she had said. \"A law can never be rigid, there must have an alternative in special cases particularly in case of unexpected pregnancy of any girl under 18. Otherwise, it may be disastrous for the society.\"\nHer son and ICT Affairs Adviser Sajeeb Wazed Joy, too, defended the government's decision, noting that several US states permit marriages of girls as young as 12.\nPunishment for child marriages \nAccording to the bill placed by State Minister Chumki, the Mobile Court Act 2009 can be exercised in case of child marriage as defined in the law.\nLocal government representatives, including upazila nirbahi officer, executive magistrate, upazila women affairs official, upazila social service officer, upazila primary or secondary education officer, officer-in-charge of the police station concerned can take necessary measures and legal actions to stop child marriage upon receiving written or verbal complaint.\nThe court can stop child marriage. The punishment for breaching the law is maximum six months' imprisonment or not more than Tk10,000 fine or both.\nApart from special cases, if a man or a woman marries any child, they can face maximum two years imprisonment or not more than Tk100,000 fine or both.\nSection 7 (2) of the law says, any underage boy and girl will have to undergo a detention of 30 days or pay Tk50,000 as fine or both for child marriage.\n\nAlso Read- Child marriage: When lawmaker breaks the law\n\nGuardians concerned or others associated with child marriage can get six months to two years' jail terms or Tk50,000 fine or both. Punishment for officiating such marriage is six months to two years' jail or Tk50,000 fine or both.\nBesides, the licence of a marriage registrar can be revoked for registering child marriage. He may also be sentenced to maximum two years imprisonment or fined Tk50,000 or both.\nBirth certificates, national identity cards, passports and academic examination certificates will be considered as legal documents for verifying the age of the bride and the groom.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Iain Mcleod was not the most memorable of British conservatives being credited with the rapid collapse of Britain's African empire while serving as secretary of state for the colonies (a now-defunct ministry). This didn't really matter to Iain. He understood that imperialism was over, and any attempt to hold on to it would only damage Great Britain. History proved him right. But my point is neither about the politician-journalist nor about decolonisation. It's about something he wrote in late 1965 while serving as the editor of The Spectator (a British conservative magazine) about a government that intrudes into the privacy of ordinary citizens through invasive means and enacts draconian solutions to run-of-the-mill problems. More specifically, Iain was talking about the plans to restrict the speed limit to 112km/h. While we Bangladeshis have seen enough deaths on roads to desire such measures, Iain, being the citizen of a more systematic country, found them \"illogical, patronising, and paternalistic.\" To him, it seemed a path only the \"nanny state\" (a state which views its citizens \"inherently incapable\" of driving at 130km/h) would take. What other things would the nanny state do? Flood the cell phones of its citizens with messages one after another about how all boilers should be run by expert and legal (read: \"licensed\") boiler operators, or that sustainable development is only possible if we are always prepared for (natural) disasters, undertake various awareness campaigns over issues that the public ought to understand quite well by now (if the masses still don't realise why killing infant hilsha fish is a bad thing, I fear they never will). On a side note, the police helpline initiative sounds quite good actually; and so do the messages about how child marriage must be prevented at any cost. The rest of it is still irremediable. It's been about time -- if the public hasn't learned yet, let it go. Wait, don't let it go, just enact the existing laws. Is that too much to ask? Banning Facebook and policing book fairs are the most luminous examples. Once you get to the Digital Security Act 2016, it stops getting even remotely funny Seems like, in Bangladesh, it is. Someone somewhere up the ladder thinks it's a brilliant idea to send messages. That a privileged Dhaka city teenager has nothing whatsoever to do with infant hilsha fish and that a pharmacy store-owner in a distant Rangpur haat bazaar doesn't really care about jute seems to be lost in transition. Some of the people who do catch infant hilsha fish and drive recklessly don't even know how to read cell phone messages. A few of them don't even own mobile phones. But who cares about results. People are indeed becoming aware, not all of them but some, over and over again, and again, and again, and again. Then there's the question of nationalised culture and religion. State-regulated khutbas and mongol shovajatras (good thing the former was cancelled). It seems as though past failures of command economy and command politics have been forgotten and now we have its replacements with command culture and command religion. This point requires deep analysis on its own right. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. You dig a bit deeper and a newer set of draconian measures come into our view. Banning Facebook and policing book fairs are the most luminous examples, and then there was the rumour going on that list of visitors of porn sites will be publicly disclosed. Once you get to the Digital Security Act 2016, it stops getting even remotely funny. Phrases like \"subject to any reasonable restrictions\" raise many questions, namely as to whose reason it would be and what would be the extent of such restrictions. The government has intentionally left it all very ambiguous. Except the clause which allows the Directorate General of the Digital Security Agency (agencies that China and North Korea have too) to bypass court orders. That part is crystal clear. Now, this sort of legislation is derived both out of a morbid and often violent desire to control and direct the population, and an innate but equally destructive belief that the public does not possess the necessary wisdom to survive out in the tough world. And it also needs controlled democracy, which allows them freedom over a certain spectrum. Anyone and everyone who disagrees is an enemy of the state, and must be crushed at any cost. A wide variety of leaders across the spectrum ascribed to this ideology. Some of them were revolutionaries (Fidel Castro), others were nationalists (Mahathir Mohammad or Lee Kuan Yew), and a considerable bunch represented the military junta (General Ziaul Haq or Augusto Pinochet). A few countries did achieve considerable development this way. At the cost of a suppressed democracy, that is. Yes, Malaysia has developed at an amazing rate, but we should keep in mind that Anwar Ibrahim, the Malaysian politician and leader of the opposition party, is still in jail. The case of Singapore is even better, except for the people who opposed Lee Kuan Yew and were sued into oblivion using taxpayer money. The two countries are still examples of progress. But they are also examples of suppressed democracy. There are states in the world which have taken a lot more time to achieve the same things, but have done so without sending the opposition to jail on absurd charges. Bottom line: Economic development shouldn't come at the expense of civil rights. There's a reason they call it sustainable development. Josip Tito's Yugoslavia seemed to have it all going well, but it all collapsed within a few years of his death. But the case of Bangladesh is even more complex, it's not just economic development that the government is promising, but also security against the real threat of terrorism. While we keep hearing about how bad the threat is, we are seldom told the cost of this protection. We are not told because we wouldn't understand, because somebody somewhere prioritises our safety over our choices, without understanding either. One only needs to remember the Rampal issue and subtle comments from government officials implying that the public was misunderstanding the environmental question -- to understand that the public will forever be considered as naive, ignorant, and uninformed, and the government will forever be the parent, the leader, the decider. Struck between its inability to be politically aroused and an inability of the political opposition to provide the least amount of stimulus, the Bangladeshi masses will, for the unforeseeable future, play obedient children to unreasonably stern parents. That is to say, they will suffer. Fardin Hasin is a freelance contributor."

      "text": "\nEid plays reviewed\n\n\n\n\nArafat Shanto\n\n\n\n\n Published at 10:23 pm September 10th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 12:09 pm September 11th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSheola\nCast: Mostofa Monwar, Sporshia, Sohel Mondol\nDirector: Jaheen Faruque Amin\n\nIn a time of intense tensions heating up, such stories to calm the air are really needed. Yet, not talking about Jaheen Amin's new fiction might create new tensions. This short might not claim a spot to the list of dramas where the soul purpose of the short is to entertain the masses, regardless, watching this can simply be eye-candy. The producer focused on promoting simplicity. The story was inspired and taken from real life, which adds an ever-lasting feel to your platter as the audience. The attire, the struggles of the poverty-stricken and current incidents are elements that construct a good drama and rectifies a producer's ambition. The investigating officer acted well enough to compliment the whole short and the act added a good zing.\nBoro Chele\nCast:  Apurbo, Mehazabien Chowdhury\nDirector: Mizanur Rahman Aryan\n\nAfter Adnan Al Rajeev came up with Bikal Belar Pakhi last Eid, the tendency to portray the struggle of the middle class is in the spotlight. Even though the portrayal is nothing new, this phenomenon is something that has been happening quite often, yet the task is being done with care now. The narrative of his works might seem more likely to promote patriarchy, yet it should be noted that producer Ariyan Rahman is trying his hardest to come up with the best. The drama is celebrated with the presence of Apurbo and Mehazabien. It deals with the existence of a middle class individual who struggles to have his ends met. Surely, it had loopholes where questions were raised. One thing to be acknowledged was the fantasy where the father dies leaving nothing behind, and Apurbo plays the role of a jobless youngster who, to go with flow of the story, had to pull the family expenses on his own. Regardless of the little 'negatives' per se, audiences could relate to this, hence it was celebrated in many platforms of social media.\nThe Gentleman\nCast: Mosharraf Karim, Aparna Ghose\nDirector:  Hasan Morshed\n\nBangla dramas titled in English vocab can be a subject to be debated on. Say, a serial of Calcutta gets the label from the pure Bangla dictionary, like \"Posto,\" \"Maccher Jhol,\" \"Prakton\" and so on. Regardless of the name, Mosharraf Karim did a fine job without trying to overcast the act of comedy. Mosharraf Karim and Aparna Ghosh being the centre of the drama, many complained about how they tried to exasperate the whole act. Yet it might seem like Mosharraf Karim tried hard to pull the entire scene by himself. Audiences can relate to the realism. If you are big on him, it is definitely a must-watch.\nPunchclip\nCast:  Iresh Zaker, Mithila, Urmila\nDirector:  Redoan Rony\n\nRedoan Roni stays busy nowadays. He has been trying to come up with the best of stories. Given that it is not impossible to construct a good short with artists like Iresh Zaker, Mithila, Urmila Shrabonti Kar. The drama deals with the love-triangles of a wedded couple. The short is quiet on a white board but the presentation is spot on. The drama strolls on a slow tempo. But the presentation won't dampen to your excitement. Eid is all about trying to come up with good sitcoms and the producer did succeed in that sense.\nDas Cabin\nCast: Azad Abul Kalam, Iresh Zaker, Sharlin Farzana\nDirector: Masud Hasan Ujjal\n\nDas Cabin was hugely celebrated this Eid. The vibe of nostalgia was cast to an extent where Anjun Dutta's song \"Das Cabin\" failed. Masud Hasan Ujjal can rightfully claim his spot on the list of great directors after this. You can definitely relate to the fiction if you are passionate about the political catastrophe. The drama centres on a trio of individuals who are rebellious, socialists and the ones who belong to the middle class, struggling for their existence. Rolling the dice on the Das Cabin, the director beautifully painted the picture of people who do not belong to a structured class. The fight to follow was simplified amazingly throughout the 40 minutes of the duration. Sharlin and Azad Abul Kalam's performance are to be remembered for decades for this.\n \nTranslated by Syeda Ashfah Toaha Duti\n\n\n\n\n"

The central bank will announce its next agricultural and rural credit policy and programme for the ongoing fiscal year on July 27.\nDefault loans from eight state-owned banks stood at Tk5,101 crore in FY'17 while it was Tk4,013 crore a year ago\nPublic banks outperformed\nThe central bank data showed that private and foreign commercial banks outperformed public banks in terms of agricultural and non-agricultural credit disbursements in the last fiscal year.\nThe private and foreign commercial banks laid out agricultural credit of Tk11,300 crore, which was 37% over the target of Tk8,260 crore for FY'17.\nIn contrast, the eight state-owned and specialised banks disbursed Tk9,698-crore in agricultural credit, only 5% above the target of Tk9,290 crore. Of these banks, Agrani Bank disbursed Tk631 crore against a target of Tk660 crore, while BDBL lent Tk5.4 crore against Tk50 crore.\nAmong the private commercial banks, Farmers Bank, Modhumoti Bank, Union Bank, South Bangla Agriculture and Commerce Bank fell behind the target during the last fiscal year in disbursing farm and non-farm credit.\nAmong the foreign banks, National Bank of Pakistan did not disburse a single loan.\nDefault loan rises by 27%\nDefault loans in the agriculture sector kept pace with the credit disbursement in FY'17.\nThe defaulted loans in the last fiscal year stood at Tk5,241 crore, up by 27% compared to the Tk4,124.37 crore seen in FY'16.\nAccording to the BB data, default loans from eight state-owned banks stood at Tk5,101 crore in FY'17 while it was Tk4,013 crore a year ago. In the meantime, such loans from both private and foreign commercial banks rose to Tk140 crore.\nExperts said loans defaulted in FY'17 mainly rose as a large number of farmers in the flood-hit areas of the country failed to pay their instalments against their bank loans due to crop losses.\nThe central bank authorities, however, have asked the banks to take effective measures to realise default loans and especially those which are classified, according to a BB official.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "The government is planning to allocate additional funds in the revised budget to support more than 620,000 Rohingya refugees that could stay in Bangladesh for an indefinite period of time. An official from the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance confirmed the matter to the Dhaka Tribune. \"We will prepare funds for several projects aimed at supporting the Rohingya refugee population, despite the recent repatriation agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar, the official said. The official added that different ministries and divisions have already spent Tk60 crore as of last week of November. The insider said most of the funds were spent on providing refugees with sanitation, shelter, healthcare facilities and on special ID cards distributed to Rohingya living in the camps, amid concerns that the asylum seekers will spread throughout the country. \"We have already started building a fund from government exchequers and from foreign and domestic NGOs, to add it to the revised outlay of the current fiscal year budget,\" said the official. A recent letter issued by Cox's Bazar Deputy Commissioner Ali Hossain revealed that a total of 42 NGOs have announced to pledge Tk200 crore for food, shelter, healthcare and sanitation as part of several programmes, under four cluster projects in Ukhiya and Teknaf. According to sources from the Finance Division, it has also disbursed Tk10 Crore for developing roads and another helipad at the Bhasan Char island, as part of the government's plan to relocate the displaced Rohingya there. On the other hand, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently contacted ten government agencies and divisions, including the Prime Minister's Office, Cabinet Division, Bangladesh Armed Forces, and the Finance Division, asking them to disclose the funds spent on supporting the Rohingya so far. \"A large portion of the fund might be allotted from the revised budget for future infrastructure development to support the displaced Rohingya. However, the total figure is yet to be finalised, as negotiations between the governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar are still underway,\" acting finance secretary Mohammad Muslim Chowdhury told the Dhaka Tribune. Commenting on the issue last month, Finance Minister AMA Muhith stated: \"The Rohingya refugee crisis will not put a significant pressure on the current fiscal year budget. I hope that the development partners will lend their support to Bangladesh in resolving the crisis.\" The minister also added that some ministries and divisions have asked for funds up to Tk10 crore ($1.2 million) for supporting the Rohingya people, but the national budget has not been affected much due to donations from other countries and humanitarian agencies. According to the United Nations, more than 620,000 Rohingya arrived in Bangladesh since August 25, following a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar military. The Ministry of Home Affairs had sent the proposal for Bhasan Char's development to the Planning Ministry in the wake of the ongoing refugee crisis, despite Finance Minister AMA Muhith's unfavorable attitude towards the project. According to the Finance Division, the development of Bhasan Char will cost Bangladesh around Tk2,300 crore."

I was studying for my HSC exams back then. He said he was a broadcast manager at Ekushey Television.\n\"I was a fool, I fell in love with him, we ran away and got married. He had told me his family owned vast estates in his village in Sirajganj.\"\nWhen the newlywed bride accompanied Halim, alias Nayeem, to Gandail union in Kazipara upazila in Sirajganj, she found his words to be utter lies.\n\nAlso Read- Who is Nayeem Ashraf?\n\nHalim's father was a humble farmer, his mother a day labour, and their possessions a small hut - very little to call their own.\n\"I was shocked by my surroundings. It was nothing like what I had expected. But I was blinded, and hoped that he could turn things around. After all, he was a BSc graduate from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology,\" she said.\nShe found his educational qualifications to be falsified. She said one of her aunts went to AUST and inquired about Halim. She found he was not a graduate. He never went to Ahsanulalh. He only had a diploma to his name.\n\"Whenever I tried to talk to him, he would respond in the most foul and abusive language imaginable. My skin crawled at his loathsome words.\"\nHalim's uncle Moazzem Hossain said: \"We do not know what he got the diploma in, or where he got it from. But he never went to AUST.\"\nThe girl's family convinced her to divorce Nayeem after two years. In 2011, the divorce was finalised.\nBy that time, Halim lost his job at Ekushey Television. He was fired for sexually harassing his colleagues.\n\n\n\n\n"

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will formally inaugurate it when she returns home\nObaidul also noted that so far 47.5% of the project has been completed. That, however, is about 7% behind the original schedule.\n\nSpeaking at the briefing, Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) Director Shafiqul Islam said: \"The span has been placed upon a temporary bearing. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will formally inaugurate it when she returns home.\"\nAccording to PMBP sources, the first span of the superstructure reached the construction yard from China on August 8 last year. It was set to be installed at the Mawa point of Munshiganj by December.\nBut strong current at that part of the river delayed the process, forcing the authorities to revise the plan and begin installation of the spans from Janjira point instead.\nIt was also reported that the original design would be changed for proper construction of the bridge because of disputed soil level of the riverbed and strong current.\nSecretary Anwarul Islam, however, refuted that claim during on Saturday's briefing, saying: \"The reports about changes being made in the design are incorrect. The bridge is being built following the original plan.\"\n\nAlso Read- Padma Bridge at a glance\n\nOnce completed, the Padma Bridge will stand over the 42 pillars, including two transition pillars on the two landward ends. These pillars will bear the load of 41 spans, each 150m in length, to connect the 6.15-kilometre-long bridge.\nIt will be a two-level steel truss bridge, with a single-track railway on the lower deck level and a four-lane highway for motor vehicles on the upper deck.\nProject officials said the piling works to mount seven more pillars at Janjira point has already finished. They are currently working on the installation of 16 other pillars.\nThe construction work for the main structure of the bridge had kicked-off in December 2015.\nThe estimated total project cost, revised thrice since the approval of the project in 2007, now stands at Tk28,793 crores. More than Tk13,000 crores of that have already been spent.\nAround 3,000 people, including 800 foreign nationals, are currently involved in Padma Bridge's construction work.\nApart from connecting Bangladesh's south-west to the northern and eastern regions, the bridge will also function as part of the proposed Asian Highway route.\nThe government says that the country's GDP growth will see a 1.2 percent increase after the bridge becomes operational.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "A total of 26 studies were carried out by local experts and at least 80 projects have been selected for implementation The National Economic Council (NEC) approved the much-anticipated Delta Plan 2100 yesterday as part of the government's efforts to secure the future of water resources and mitigate against the likely effects of climate change including natural disasters.  The approval came in a meeting held at the NEC conference room in the Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area of Dhaka with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair, reports BSS. \"We firmly believe that our most important resources are the water resources,\" Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal told reporters after the meeting. \"If we could properly utilize these resources, then we will certainly not lag behind in agriculture and Bangladesh will grow economically. Through the implementation of the plan, the country could boost the GDP growth by another 1.5% by 2030.\" The planning minister said that after studying the example of the Netherlands, PM Sheikh Hasina had directed the authorities concerned to frame such a plan to tap the maximum potential of Bangladesh as a deltaic region. \"The Netherlands has benefitted greatly by adopting such a plan as the country was able to reclaim around 6,000 square kilometres of land in addition to their mainland,\" he said. The Dutch government and the World Bank have both helped the General Economics Division (GED) to prepare the plan over the past 3.5 years.  A total of 26 studies were carried out by local experts and at least 80 projects have been selected for implementation. Of them, 65 would be infrastructure projects while 15 others would aim to enhance institutional capacity, efficiency and research. Three-phase plan  The planning minister said the government will need to raise $37 billion by 2030 to implement the plan over three phases: a short-term plan by 2030, a mid-term plan by 2050, and a long-term plan by 2100. At present, however, the government spends only 0.8% of GDP on delta management projects and programs. This figure will need to be more than tripled - to 2.5% of GDP - if the 80 projects of the plan are to be implemented. To reach this total, Bangladesh is likely to get $2 billion assistance from Green Climate Fund every year. The remaining costs will be met by other development partners, foreign direct investment, and the private sector - which is expected to contribute 20%. The State Minister for Finance and Planning MA Mannan, Planning Commission GED Member Prof Shamsul Alam, and other secretaries concerned were also present at Tuesday's briefing. Prof Shamsul Alam said the plan highlighted six hotspots: coastal areas; Barind Tract and drought-prone region; haor (backswamp) and flash flood prone areas; Chittagong Hill Tracts region; river region and estuaries; and the urban region. To execute the Delta Plan 2100, a high-level Delta Governance Council will be formed to make decisions and issue directives. This will be led by the prime minister, with the planning minister serving as vice-president.  Additionally, a project or operations selection committee led by GED member will be constituted. The secretaries of the ministries related to the Delta Plan will be committee members, who will select and monitor the projects and programs.  Also, on Tuesday, Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal informed that work is underway to frame another plan for the year 2021-2041 to transform Bangladesh from a developing into a developed nation."

      "text": "'The government will renovate all the canals, swamps, rivers, drains and ponds across the country' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said initiatives have already been taken to construct underground rail lines, elevated ring roads and waterways around the capital, to ensure better transport services. The Prime minister was speaking at a program on Saturday after inaugurating the Badda U-loop (North U-loop) under Hatirjheel Integrated Development Project, reports UNB. She said: \"We've already started a feasibility study to construct the rail lines and there is a plan to construct elevated ring roads around the capital city to ease communication.\" Sheikh Hasina said the government will go for dredging the four rivers, surrounding the capital so that city dwellers could get a better commuting service through waterways. \"We'll dredge the rivers to restore their navigability,\" she added. She further said; \"Small bridges over these rivers that are hindering the plying of water vessels will be removed through constructing new bridges which will not create obstacles. We're taking plans for that too.\" While speaking about the Hatirjheel project, the prime minister said the government will create a link canal with the project for linking it with rivers. \"If we excavate the canal, the water of the Hatijheel project will remain better. Another plan to that end is also underway,\" she said. The Badda U-loop Focus Bangla The prime minister also mentioned the previous government's constructed box culverts over the canal and that the decision was just a blunder. She said: \"As a result, the water logging in Dhaka is increasing day by day... constructing box culverts is not a solution.\" She said if the Awami League is elected in next election, it will demolish the box culverts to open the canals, not in only in Dhaka city, but also across the country. \"We'll construct elevated roads over the canals, if needed. The canals will remain open...it'll be helpful to remove the rainwater quickly,\" she said. The Prime Minister said: \"The government will renovate all the canals, swamps, rivers, drains and ponds across the country. We've already taken projects in hand for these.\" She also said: \"The aim of these projects is to make the country more environment-friendly, so the people of the country could get an atmosphere to live healthier lives. The prime minister mentioned that traffic jam is not a unique matter in big cities, and the government has taken numerous steps to reduce traffic congestions in capital Dhaka. She reiterated that the government will introduce high speed bullet trains from Dhaka to Chittagong, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Barisal-Paira and Kolkata. The Prime Minister said: The government has been able to carry out marked development across the country, as people have voted in favour of Awami League for two consecutive times. \"As we have been in power for two consecutive terms, we've been able to complete our development projects,\" she said. Housing and Public Works Minister Engineer Mosharraf Hossain, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, Local MP AKM Rahmat Ullah, Army Chief General Aziz Ahmed and Hatirjheel Integrated Development Project Director Maj Gen Abu Sayeed Mohammad Masud also spoke at the program."

According to the Water Development Board control room, within between 6pm Saturday and 6am Sunday, Dharla River's flow rose by 18 centimetres at the Setu Point, and Teesta's flow increased by 14cm at Kaunia Point. Both rivers are still below the danger point, but Water Development Board Executive Engineer Md Shafiqul Islam said the water will continue to rise for the next two days in these two as well as the Dudhkumar River. Meanwhile, the water flow has dropped in the Brahmaputra River. This correspondent spoke to several public representatives in the Dharla and Teesta delta, who said water had not reached any habitation in the region. However, heavy rain since Sunday morning was causing alarm among people. Engineer Shafiqul Islam said heavy rain on the Indian side was sending water down the Teesta, the Dharla and the Dudhkumar and this was likely to continue for the next 48 hours. Shafiqul said the waters had not yet reached the danger level, and they were likely to drop again after 48 hours unless there is more heavy rain. He said in response to a question that the dams and embankments damaged by last year's flood had been repaired and were risk-free now."

On Saturday morning, the Padma Bridge's fourth span began its journey to Janjira point from Mawa construction yard. It was carried to Janjira point by one of the world's largest floating cranes.  Like the other spans, the fourth span is also 150-metre long. After the installation of the fourth span, around 600 meters of the much-hyped Padma Bridge became visible. The first span of the Padma Bridge was installed atop pillars no 37 and 38 at the Janjira point of Shariatpur on October 7, 2017. This was followed by installation of the second span on pillars 38 and 39 on January 23. The construction work on the country's largest bridge started in December in 2015. The 6.15-km bridge will have a total of 41 spans, each 150 meters long. According to the engineers concerned, a total of 41 spans will be installed on 42 concrete pillars."

She spoke about WINGS and how a support group for women can be of great help to one another. Nilu Murshed, Abinta Kabir's grandmother, is a very ardent board member of WINGS and helps in the projects of WINGS by giving scholarships to underprivileged university students of the law department headed by Dr Shahnaz Huda, professor at Department of Law, Dhaka University from Abinta Kabir Foundation. Tootli Rahman and all the other speakers who knew Abinta very well spoke about her interactions with them. The speakers were artists Rokeya Sultana and Kanak Chanpa Chakma, Najma Matin, artist Gulshan and Mahua Khair. Sultan M Mineuddin, coordinator of Abinta Kabir Foundation spoke about all the projects of the foundation in detail. Later, the principal of Abinta Kabir Foundation School spoke a few words about the school. A short documentary film titled Purple Butterflies was screened during the memorial which talked about Abinta's dreams regarding the school. Tootli Rahman presented Nilu Murshed with a cheque from WINGS as a donation towards the Abinta Kabir Foundation School. Nilu Murshed thanked WINGS for the donation and ended the event talking about Abinta's dreams and how they are trying to achieve them through this initiative."

      "authors": "Anando Mostofa",
      "text": "Conditions in crowded camps in Cox's Bazar have deteriorated for nearly 700,000 Rohingya as aid workers race to strengthen shelters ahead of monsoon season, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said. Steve McAndrew, head of its emergency operations in the coastal area, said its clinics were scaling up to combat possible outbreaks of cholera and other water-borne diseases feared with the rains that could arrive this month. Desperation has grown among the Muslim Rohingya, who fled a military crackdown last August in Myanmar's Rakhine state and many see scant chance of returning, he said in an interview on Monday. \"It's hot, it's hard to find water and food, and the conditions are getting worse. And they are going to continue to get worse as the rainy season comes and then we have a monsoon season and cyclone season,\" McAndrew told Reuters at IFRC headquarters in Geneva. \"The situation is getting worse, and it's open-ended and there is no end in sight,\" he said. The UN refugee agency UNHCR said last week conditions in Myanmar were not ready for a safe return of the Rohingya. Rohingya are fleeing a \"horrendous\" situation, McAndrew said, while declining to apportion blame. \"People are losing their families, their villages are being destroyed. A lot of the people are saying they don't even want to know what's going on back home anymore. They seem to have just decided they will not go home.\" His agency is reinforcing the flimsy bamboo and plastic structures in which the Rohingya live in Cox's Bazar so they can withstand the rains, and a new site is being prepared for those most at risk, McAndrew said. \"We believe we can move around 25,000 families about the first of May...We have satellite maps of the potential flood zones and the gullies where we know they are going to get flooded out. \"We're drilling wells, we're putting in latrines, we're working with the UN and other agencies preparing this site around the clock,\" he said. McAndrew, who headed the IFRC's operation in Haiti when cholera erupted there in late 2010, said of Cox's Bazar: \"We're highly concerned about outbreaks in the upcoming rainy season, especially cholera and other water-borne diseases.\" The agency was pre-positioning medical supplies and preparing its clinics to treat cholera, which thrives in unsanitary conditions. IFRC's appeal of $34.92 million is only 55% funded, McAndrew said. \"It's just not enough in front of the scale of the needs.\""

      "text": "About 3.8 million deaths from illness every year are attributable to use of solid fuels and kerosene for cooking, according to the World Health Organisation Fatema lives in the Unchiprang refugee camp at Teknaf. To cook her meals, she uses an oven made of mud and fire wood collected from the forestland or bought from the market. To cook each meal, she has to burn 10-12 pieces of fire wood that are about 1.5-2 feet in length. \"It is common for us to have breathing problem because using solid fuels and kerosene for cooking create a lot of smoke inside the house,\" Fatema says. \"I have no other option but to continue using them.\" Fatema is one of the estimated three billion people who use solid fuels and kerosene for cooking that produce high levels of household air pollution. About 3.8 million deaths from illness every year are attributable to it, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Of these 3.8 million deaths, 27% are due to pneumonia, 18% from stroke, 27% from ischaemic heart disease, 20% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 8% from lung cancer. The cramped Rohingya shelters are also susceptible to fire. Until August 14 this year, an estimated 80 refugees have been affected by 12 incidents of fire, according to Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ISCG). Lack of options The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) say four out of five Rohingyas rely on firewood for cooking and heating - a major cause of deforestation in surrounding areas. About a year ago, both side of Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Highway was full of greenery. After the Rohingya influx, 4,318 acres of forestland have been used to construct makeshift settlements for refugees, the Forest Department's Cox's Bazar (South) Division said. The relief material being distributed among the Rohingyas do not include firewood, forcing the refugees to cut down trees from government forests. An ISCG report estimated that the refugees need about 700 tons of firewood every day and that they have no alternative fuel. \"When cooking with solid fuels, inefficient stoves create a huge amount of black smoke which produces small carbon particles that penetrate deep into the lungs,\" Environment Department Director Ziaul Haque said. Indoor smoke can be higher than acceptable levels for small particles, especially in the Rohingya refugee camp where every household cooks inside the house, he said. Everyone living inside the shelter is vulnerable. \"Long-term exposure of these carbon particles increases the risk of lung cancer,\" he added. Women, children most vulnerable The WHO described household air pollution as \"the world's single greatest environmental health risk,\" saying that it accounts for 7.7% of global mortality. It said household air pollution causes non-communicable diseases including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Exposure to household air pollution almost doubles the risk for childhood pneumonia and is responsible for 45% of all pneumonia deaths in children less than 5 years, the WHO said. Over half of the Rohingyas who fled to Bangladesh in the last one year are children. Sixty percent of women and children living in the refugee camps and host communities are vulnerable to respiratory diseases. Cox's Bazar Surgeon Abdus Salam said: \"Indoor air pollution can affect health and here in the camps, people are highly dependent on inefficient stoves. The smoke from firewood is increasing health risks. Respiratory infections, breathing problems are common among the camp's residents.\" Md Kamal Hossain, the district's deputy commissioner, said steps are being taken to address the issue. He told the Dhaka Tribune that they have supplied 11,000 LPG gas cylinders in the camps. \"An estimated 200,000 households need to replace their cooking facilities,\" he said. \"It will take time.\""

      "text": "According to the report, the water quality of Bangladesh is poor even though 98% of people have access to water from technologically advanced water sources Bangladesh can reduce poverty and boost growth by taking immediate measures to upgrade the quality of water and sanitation, a World Bank report said on Thursday. The report found that despite demonstrating remarkable progress in improving access to water and sanitation, a total of 41% of all improved water sources in Bangladesh have been contaminated with E. coli bacteria.  The findings in the report also suggested a high prevalence of fecal contamination. in drinking water, which, it said, affects the rich and the poor, and the rural and the urban population equally.  \"Poor water quality and sanitation can hold back a country's potential because unsafe water and poor sanitation are linked to nutritional disadvantages in early-childhood,\" said Sereen Juma, the World Bank's acting country director for Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal.  \"Bangladesh has made great strides in expanding access to water and can build on that progress by focusing on improving the quality of water and sanitation.\" Titled \"Promising Progress: A Diagnostic of Water Supply, Sanitation, Hygiene (WASH), and Poverty in Bangladesh\", the report was launched at a Dhaka hotel on Thursday. The study, which is part of the World Bank's WASH Poverty Diagnostics initiative in 18 countries including Bangladesh, said the poorest quintile of the population suffers three times more from water and sanitation related gastrointestinal diseases. Bacteria AKM Ibrahim, chief engineer of the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE), attributed the bacteria contamination of water mainly to household management of water reservoirs. \"They mostly remain filthy, even for months,\" he said. \"The use of quality materials for piped-water supply and expanding an improved workforce can help fight the problem.\" The presence of E. Coli bacteria have been found in 80% of private piped-water taps sampled across the country, a similar rate to water retrieved from ponds, according to the report.  Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a bacteria that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. Most E.coli strains are harmless, but some can cause serious food poisoning.  Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) is a bacterium that can cause severe food-borne disease. In most cases, the illness is self-limiting, but it may lead to a life-threatening disease including haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), especially in young children and the elderly. Arsenic Furthermore, the report found 13% of Bangladesh's water sources contain arsenic levels above a safe threshold. Chittagong and Sylhet divisions suffer most from arsenic contamination, which occurs naturally, the report stated.  The World Bank further observed that during a natural disaster, about a third of households in the country's high-risk areas switch to contaminated and unimproved water sources. The report findings claimed the coastal areas are increasingly suffering from salinity-intrusion, leaving the poor more affected.   In addition, about 50 million people in Bangladesh still use shared and rudimentary toilets, with just 28% toilets equipped with soap and water.  According to the report, the water quality of Bangladesh is poor even though 98% of people have access to water from technologically advanced water sources. Urban slums have poor access to clean water and safe sanitation, whereas large-city slums have five times less access to improved sanitation and have the highest rates of childhood undernutrition in the country. However, there was no specific mention of women's sanitation in the report.  Toilets deficit \"There is scope for Bangladesh to improve access to sanitation beyond the household level to public places, schools, health facilities, and workplaces,\" the report's co-author, George Joseph, said.  \"Only about half of manufacturing enterprises in Bangladesh have toilets. Only half of the primary schools have separate toilets for girls, and one in four adolescent girls miss school during menstruation. A safe water and sanitation environment will encourage more women to participate in the workforce.\" WaterAid Bangladesh's Country Director Dr Khairul Islam said a large number of toilets, especially in public places or facilities, are either in a dilapidated condition or dysfunctional.  \"The awareness of using sanitary pads for schoolgirls is so weak and the scenario is even worse in the rural areas,\" Khairul said. Muhammad Nazrul Islam, the state minister for water resources and the chief guest of the report launching program, said the government is mainly focused on resolving the problems relating to drainage system, irrigation and flood control. \"The government, nevertheless, is optimistic that the proposed Delta Plan-2100 will greatly help sort out the water-related issues in the country,\" he said. Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman, executive chairman of Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC), said despite Bangladesh transforming from a rural to an urbanised country, sanitation system in the cities did not develop much in line with the changes. \"The overall urban drainage system, sanitation and water treatment are still in a poor state,\" he observed. \"The poor people living in the cities are the most affected group since a big chunk of them resides in low-lying areas and in places lacking proper access to sanitation.\" Zillur called for a coordinated and long-term plan to be designed to address this issue.  \"The government has to consider the WASH-cycle a value chain,\" he said. \"Terminals across the country need special attention when it comes to quality sanitation since hundreds of thousands of people throng there every day.\"  Thursday's event was moderated by Mark John Ellery, the World Bank's senior water and sanitation expert, and featured speeches from Prof Dr Md Abul Hashem Khan, the line director at Directorate General of Health Services; and Takuya Kamata, the World Bank's practice manager.

      "text": "\nDollar price accelerates: Import pressure or manipulation?\n\n\n\n\nGolam Mowla\n\n\n\n\n Published at 10:57 pm March 14th, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nDespite the rise in remittance inflow and export earnings, the US dollar keeps rising in cost.\nIn February, remittances rose by 22.14% compared to the same period last year. Export earnings in the first eight months of the current 2017-18 fiscal (July-February) also increased by 7.38%. Currently the foreign currency reserve in Bangladesh Bank (BB) stands at over $31 billion. Despite these positive factors the price of the dollar against taka (Bangladeshi currency) keeps increasing.\nBangladesh Bank cannot make the currency exchange market normal even after releasing dollars every day. Many question whether the dollar price is being manipulated. Experts think the price is shooting up due to the increase in import expenses.\nAccording to BB data, in less than a year taka's value against the dollar was reduced to Tk4. In July last year, a dollar sold at Tk 80.66, while in March 12, it was selling at Tk85. In some banks the rate was Tk85.\nThe central bank has directed all concerned not to charge more than Tk83. Despite that scores of private banks gave Bangladesh Bank wrong information regarding dollar rate.\nBangladesh has been experiencing a volatile situation in the dollar market since June last year. Authorities have failed to contain the price even after releasing dollars due to syndicates, which is why taka's value is dropping regularly.\nAllegations are that a number of banks are behind the destabilization of the currency market. A probe conducted by Bangladesh Bank also found that several banks were selling dollars to clients at a higher price than what they were reporting to the central bank.\nThe banks charge Tk2 more for selling dollar from business persons than the rate they declare for the settlement of letter of credit, according to Bangladesh Bank. As a result, the import cost has risen and the foreign currency market has also become unstable. The price of the dollar against taka keeps increasing. This factor is beneficial for remittance and export earnings, but import costs are also increasing.\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh Bank has issued show cause against 26 banks in two phases on charges of manipulation in the foreign currency exchange market.\nThe central bank is releasing record number of dollars in the market. So far it has sold $2 billion during the current fiscal. Despite that the dollar is becoming costlier.\nEarlier in November, Bangladesh Bank decided to take stern action against the banks over manipulation and destabilizing the market, at a high level meeting chaired by its Governor Fazle Kabir. Following the decision, show cause was issued against 17 banks in the first phase and later 9 more banks faced a similar blow.\nDebasish Chakraborty, spokesperson and executive director at Bangladesh Bank, said: \"We have taken necessary moves to keep the foreign currency market normal. We have either purchased dollar from the market or sold it out. This is a part of our regular activities.\"\nHe further said: \"Bangladesh Bank keeps the market stable through purchase and selling of dollars from the market as a strategy to keep back the value of taka.\" Bangladesh Bank always keeps an eye on the market, the BB official added.\nLeaders of the Bangladesh Foreign Exchange Dealers' Association (BAFEDA) held an emergency meeting on November 29 to contain the market. The meeting urged the banks to keep the dollar price lower than Tk83 at import level in order to bring stability in the foreign currency exchange market. The association held another meeting recently since the banks did not keep its request.\nDuring a recent meeting with senior officials of authorized dealer banks, Bangladesh Bank expressed concern over the high rate of the dollar.\nAccording to the central bank, interbank dollar rate was Tk80.66 at the end of July last year. In February, the rate rose to Tk82.90. Currently the rate per dollar is Tk85.25 in the market. Over the last eight months (July-February) of the current fiscal, the value of taka against dollar dropped by 3.77%.\nMany suspect that people are transferring money abroad by purchasing dollars anticipating unstable situation in the country centering on the upcoming national elections.\nZaid Bakht, research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) and chairman of Agrani Bank, said: \"Though many tend to remove money abroad ahead of the national elections, dollar price is increasing due to a rise in import expenses.\"\nHe said cost is increasing for the import of equipment being used in a number of ongoing major projects such as Padma Bridge and metro rail. Import of food grain has accelerated due to last year's flood that hampered production. \"But since export earnings have not risen, demand for dollar has increased. That's why dollar price against taka is increasing gradually.\"\nAccording to Bangladesh Bank data, in the first six months of the current fiscal, import expenses have increased by 25.78% compared to the same period of the last fiscal. Between July and December, import of food (rice and wheat) rose by 212%, equipment for setting up industries increased by 35%, fuel by 28% and raw materials for industries rose by over 15%.\nIn the first six months of the current fiscal, the amount of letter of credit (LC) has exceeded $40 billion and it might cross $60 billion at the end of the fiscal.\nAs of March 8, Bangladesh Bank's foreign currency reserves stood at over $31.93 billion. To meet the demand, the central bank has sold more than $2 billion to the banks to date of the current fiscal.\nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

NESCO collective bargaining agent Kamal Chandra Singh said the officials were given the order from the Sirajganj NESCO office on Sunday. NESCO officer Jahangir Hossen Jewel, also a local Awami Leader, said he joined his new office on Monday on receiving the order, along with many other officials. According to sources, a probe body formed concerning the electrocution incident on August 2 found that the deaths were caused by the negligence of certain clients and officials of Northern Electricity Supply Company. The NESCO probe body submitted its report to its Rajshahi zone chief engineer Rezaul Karim on August 27, said the committee chief and NESCO's Pabna regional superintendent engineer Abul Hossain. The probe body found that company executive engineer, Abu Hena Mustafa Kamal, assistant engineer Shahnewaj, deputy assistant engineer Banee Amin, and meter reader Nurul Huda, did not disconnect the power supply despite the connections being illegal and unsafe. The report recommended those responsible be punished. On September 3 and 4, Zakiul Islam, managing director of the NESCO, ordered Rezaul Karim to suspend the 14 officials. Eight people, including three schoolchildren, were electrocuted after they came in contact with power lines in the village of Kadai in the Sirajganj Sadar upazila, on July 31. The incident occurred when a shop made of corrugated iron sheets was being relocated from an area of low-lying land to a relatively higher place, and the area was covered in flood waters following a downpour.

      "headline": "Fishermen catch ilish despite ban in Shariatpur",
      "authors": "Kazi Nazrul Islam, Shariatpur",
      "text": "Over 1,200 arrested in last 18 days Fishermen in Shariatpur have defied the government's ban and caught mother ilish. Even law enforcement - including the coast guard, police, fisheries officials and executive magistrates - has been attacked, while conducting drives against the fishermen. The seasonal fishermen involved are protected by influential local people. In the last 18 days, around 1,200 fishermen have been arrested with 14 metric tons of mother ilish; and six million meters of \"current jal,\" a banned nylon fibre net, has been seized. Of the fishermen, 850  have been sentenced to prison. However, locals are saying that due to a lack of skilled and trained personnel, the government has failed to prevent the catching of mother ilish this year. The government has imposed a 22-day ban on catching, selling, and transporting ilish. A 7,000km breeding ground is off-limits to guarantee the safe spawning of this popular fish during its peak breeding period. The ban started on October 7 and will last until October 28--as this is the peak time period for mother ilish to lay their eggs. Any breach of the ban will result in one to two years of imprisonment and a maximum fine of Tk5,000. The government has imposed this ban on Ilish fishing every year, since 2003, to protect mother ilish.  Ilish production in Bangladesh has increased by 66% over the last nine years. The Shariatpur District Fisheries Department has said around 70km of water bodies have been identified as breeding grounds or sanctuaries for mother ilish. They said this vast area has been difficult for them to monitor, due to a lack of experienced staff. The department mentioned that since the start of the drives against illegal ilish catching, some influential people from Zajira upazila have been hiring fishermen from other areas to illegally catch   it.  Every day, more than a hundred speed boats, and over a thousand boats, full of fishermen are catching ilish. The catching area extends from Zajira Palerchar to Nariar Naoapara, and from Wapda area to Gosairhat upazila's Shaatpara area along the Padma River. The fish are sold in neighbouring areas in local fish markets and in retail at around 50 locations in neighbouring villages--at very low rates. The local administration is helpless in controlling the situation. The detained fishermen say they know it is illegal to catch mother ilish but they are still doing it to earn their living. They also complain that most of the fishermen do not receive government-provided rice afforded to those qualifying for four-month vulnerable group feeding (VGF) assistance. They also claim that they have to repay loans taken from NGOs and money lenders, for which they are risking everything--even knowing the consequences. Shariatpur District Fisheries Official Bishwajit Boiragi said: \"The total numbers of listed fishermen in the area are 32,324 and out of them, 16,355 get the VGF assistance at the moment. The ones who catch ilish during the ban, are not from this number--rather, they are outsiders.\" He also said: \"During the last few days while the drives were conducted against these illegal fishermen: the UNO, executive magistrates, police, and coast guard members were attacked. This is  because the fishermen working illegally  have the backing of some dishonest and influential people. Bishwajit further said they are trying to get modern boats and experienced men to tackle the problem to prevent it from happening in the future. "

      "text": "Local sources said erosion by major rivers has intensified in many areas, causing immense sufferings to the people The overall flood situation remained unchanged but river erosion has taken a serious turn in different parts of the country on Wednesday. Local sources said erosion by major rivers has intensified in many areas, causing immense sufferings to the people. A large number of houses, structures, trees and crops on vast tracts of land were washed away by floodwaters and strong current of rivers in different flood-hit areas. Erosion by the rivers Padma, Jamuna and Brahmaputra continued in different places of Shariatpur, Gaibandha, Bogra, Jamalpur and Rajbari districts. The erosion took a serious turn in the places along the riverside areas in the last couple of weeks. Shariatpur Our correspondent Kazi Nazrul Islam reported that the Padma River is in a rising trend and speedy current is engulfing houses and establishments rapidly in the Naria upazila. A private hospital named Life Care was engulfed by the river on Wednesday morning. The erosion swallowed houses, schools, dams, roads, business establishments, mosques, in the last few days while positive initiatives by the authorities concerned were not visible to prevent the erosion, locals alleged. The residents of river bank are going through days of fear of further erosion while several more houses are still at greater risk.  Victims have to live under the open sky as their dwellings were washed away by floodwaters. They face huge losses as their croplands have also been washed away. Now, they are seeking assistance to erect their houses. The government has distributed relief among the flood victims in the affected areas, but these are not adequate, said the victims, adding that they are seeking financial assistance to build their dwellings. Kabir Bin Anwar, Secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources, visited the flood-hit area on September 15 and declared that immediate steps will be taken over the issue. But there is no visible scene of his announcement, alleged locals. Meanwhile, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved a proposal to award a contract to Bangladesh Navy-run Khulna Shipyard to protect the Zajira and Naria upazilas in Shariatpur from river erosion at a cost of Tk1077.58 crore. The committee at a meeting, with Finance Minister AMA Muhith in the chair, gave the go-ahead to the proposal placed by Water Resources Ministry, reports UNB. Briefing newsmen the Cabinet Division additional secretary Nasima Begum said under the proposal, the Khulna Shipyard will implement the project of the Water Development Board to protect 8.90km of riverbank of the Padma at the Zajira and Naria upazilas of the Shariatpur district. The contract work includes 9.75km dredging, 0.089km end-termination and construction of 8 RCC concrete ferry terminals. The approval of the cabinet body came at a time when thousands have been rendered homeless in scourge of the Padma erosion in Shariatpur's two upazilas over the past three months. Jamalpur  A portion of the flood-control dam in the Uliapara area collapsed under the pressure of gushing waters of the Jamuna River, submerging hundreds of villages in the Islampur upazila of Jamalpur, reported Bishwajit Deb, our correspondent. The onrush of hill water from across the border for last few days deteriorated the flood situation in the upazila further, leaving thousands of people virtually marooned.  Seasonal crops on vast tracts of land were inundated by the floodwaters, said Upazila Agriculture Officer Shakhawat Hossain. Geo bags have been dumped into the area to protect the dam, said Water Board Sources. Gaibandha According to reports of our Gaibanda correspondent Md Tajul Islam, river bank erosion has taken a serious turn at different points along the Brahmaputra River bank in the Sundarganj upazila in the district creating immense sufferings to the victims of the erosion. Local sources said at least 500 families of the upazila became homeless in last few days and the erosion also devoured many academic and religious institutions including arable land. Besides, the inhabitants, who are living on the bank of the river, are terrified and anxious as the river might devour their homesteads and agriculture land any time. The river-eroded landless people who have taken shelter on the flood control embankment and other safer places are living in hardship; their sufferings knew no bounds. The Water Development Board Executive Engineer Mahbubur Rahman said emergency based measures have been taken to protect the dam and the victims.  Bogra  Nazmul Huda Nasim, our Bogra correspondent, said erosion of Jamuna and Bangali rivers has taken serious turn Bahuldanga, Manikdair, Dangorgacha, Gonokpara, Bheramara, Godagari, Malopara, Nizberubari, Paikpara, Machirpara and Bashhata villages in Sariakandi upazila. Water Development Board Executive Engineer Hasan Masud said the rivers crossed the 17cm danger level in the evening. Steps will be taken soon to stop the erosion, he added. Rajbari Erosion in the Padma River has taken an alarming turn in Rajbari, as it has already forced thousands of families, under the Sadar upazila, to leave their houses, while, with the fall in water level, villages within the district are becoming more vulnerable, said Kazi Tanvir, our correspondent. According to Water Development Board sources, the water level had started receding and the strong current started to erode the river bank, croplands, houses and other infrastructures. Some families, who had been living in makeshift houses on the embankment for the last few days, said they had been going through the days miserably and claimed that they were yet to receive any relief or assistance from the government.

      "text": "Congressman Jim Banks of Indiana State introduced the resolution in the House of Representatives on November 20 A resolution has been placed in the US Congress, calling on the Bangladesh government to stop radical organizations including Jamaat-e-Islami, Islami Chhatra Shibir, and Hefazat-e-Islam, who pose an on-going threat to the country's stability and secular democracy. Congressman Jim Banks of Indiana State introduced the resolution, titled \"Expressing concern about the threat posed to democracy and the democratic process by theocratic groups operating in Bangladesh,\" in the House of Representatives on November 20, according to the US Congress official website, reports BSS. The House Resolution 1156 has been referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the website says. The resolution called on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the State Department to halt all partnerships and funding arrangements with groups affiliated with radical organizations, including Jamaat, Shibir, and Hefazat, reports UNB. The resolution said religious minorities were targeted by the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and Islami Chhatra Shibir, during previous elections, as a result of which 495 Hindu homes were damaged, 585 shops were attacked or looted, and 169 temples were vandalized between November 2013 and January 2014. It also said Jamaat-e-Islami activists have been involved in recent attacks on religious minorities in Bangladesh. Mentioning that national elections are expected to take place in Bangladesh on December 30, 2018, the resolution called on the Bangladesh government to heed the Bangladesh Election Commission's request to ensure security for minorities and maintain communal harmony for a peaceful election. The resolution acknowledged the victims of the 1971 War of Independence and the spirit of secular democracy on which Bangladesh was founded. The nation of Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971 and established a secular democratic state, the resolution mentioned, noting that \"this freedom was won at the cost of approximately 3,000,000 deaths, more than 10,000,000 displaced, and 200,000 women raped, many at the hands of Islamist militants led by Jamaat-e-Islami.\" The resolution said repeated attacks on religious minorities, expanding religious intolerance, and growing destabilization caused by radical groups, including Jamaat, Shibir, and Hefazat; undermine economic and strategic interests of the US in Bangladesh. Meanwhile in a statement, Philadelphia-based think tank Middle East Forum (MEF) has welcomed the resolution, saying \"Jamaat-e-Islami is an influential and dangerous Islamist group with a long history of violence.\" In October, the Bangladesh Election Commission revoked the registration of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, a major ally of the BNP-led 20-party alliance, in compliance with a High Court order. In August, 2013, the High Court declared Jamaat's registration illegal following a writ petition filed in 2009 by Bangladesh Tariqat Federation's Secretary General Rezaul Haque Chandpuri and 24 others. In the petition, they said Jamaat was a religion-based political party and it did not believe in the independence and sovereignty of Bangladesh."

      "text": "After a week of fierce downpours, rainfall eased on Monday and flood levels have fallen in many districts   Receding flood waters have left Indian troops and rescuers the grim task of hunting for bodies left by the worst monsoon in a century. The death toll in Kerala state rose above 400 on Monday. With nearly three quarters of a million people packed into relief camps in the southern state, known for its tourist beaches and hill resorts, authorities also fear outbreaks of disease. After a week of fierce downpours, rainfall eased on Monday and flood levels have fallen in many districts. Army helicopters and boats kept up missions to find trapped survivors and drop food and water in isolated villages. Officials said 22,000 people were rescued on Sunday. At least 30 bodies were also found taking the death toll above 200 since the torrential rain started falling on August 8 and more than 400 since the monsoon started in June. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the priority now was to provide clean drinking water and restore power supplies to the state of 33 million people. \"The total number of people taking refuge at the 5,645 relief camps has risen to 724,649,\" Pinarayi told reporters on Sunday. He said health officers would be deployed in each village to check the spread of communicable diseases. Thousands of army, navy and air force personnel have fanned out to help those stranded in remote and hilly areas. Dozens of helicopters have been dropping tons of food, medicine and water over areas cut off due to damaged roads and bridges. In worst hit areas such as Thrissur and Chengannur, rescuers are searching inundated houses where they have found the bodies of those trapped by the fast rising floodwaters. \"They didn't think that it would rise this high -- 10 to 15 feet at some places -- when the initial warnings were issued,\" said Ashraf Ali K.M, who is leading the search in the small town of Mala in Thrissur. Fishermen have sailed inland from Kerala's coast to join the search, as volunteers set up soup kitchens and an international appeal was made for financial help. Minister Pinarayi praised the fishermen for joining the rescue mission. The state government said each boat would get 3,000 rupees ($43) for each day of their work and that authorities would pay for any damage to them. The floods have caused an estimated $3 billion in damage but the bill is likely to rise as the scale of devastation becomes clearer. "

      "text": "Development work has stalled despite various plans and projects to save the beach having been taken up by politicians since 2004 A two-kilometre area of the scenic Kuakata sea beach, the second largest tourist spot in the country, has been eroding away over the last few months. The embankment, with its various species of trees as well as gardens, an eco-park and houses, is on the verge of extinction as the monsoon rains speed up erosion. \"Just two weeks ago, part of a coconut garden of the beach was washed away by a tidal surge,\" said Patuakhali Deputy Commissioner Dr Md Mansur Ahmed, also president of the Kuakata Sea Beach Management Committee. Some green parks and farms are now under threat from erosion and natural disaster, he said, adding that \"necessary measures to save the beach should be taken as soon as possible.\" Locals have expressed their worry over the worsening situation. Development work has stalled despite various plans and projects to save the beach having been taken up by politicians since 2004, they said.  Md Abul Khayer, executive engineer of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) in Kolapara, said a project proposal involving Tk212 crore was sent to the Planning Commission in January this year for final approval, but the commission has only recently sent it back. \"As a result, the development works have stopped. But, the repair and development works of the dam have started,\" he added. Motaleb Sharif, general secretary of Kuakata Hotel-Motel Owners Association, said they were worried over the uncertain future of the much-sought \"Kuakata save and development\" project, as it would have led to the overall development of the tourist spot.  Local MP Alhaj Mahbubur Rahman said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has instructed the authorities concerned to take necessary measures for the development of Kuakata. \"There is nothing to worry about,\" he added."

However, he did not disclose details regarding the case. On Tuesday, the Election Commission filed a petition with the Appellate Division against a High Court order that cleared the way for Dulu to contest the 11th parliamentary election.  The High Court order came after Dulu filed a writ petition against the returning officer's disqualification of his candidacy on Monday. Dulu, who filed his nomination papers for Natore 2 constituency, had his candidacy rejected for his conviction in a criminal case. The 11th general election is slated to be held on December 30. "

      "text": "In India, a private consultation can cost $15, a huge sum for millions living on less than $2 a day India on Sunday launched the world's biggest health insurance scheme which Prime Minister Narendra Modi said would cover some 500 million poor people. The program, dubbed \"Modicare,\" promises health cover worth $6,900 to every poor family to treat serious ailments. The scheme is expected to cost the central and 29 state governments $1.6 billion per year in total. Funding will be increased gradually according to demand. Modi handed medical cards out at the launch in Ranchi, capital of the eastern state of Jharkhand, calling it a historic day for India. He called the scheme \"a big step towards providing good quality and accessible healthcare to the poor of India. Over 100 million families will benefit.\" India's overburdened public health system is plagued by a shortage of hospitals and doctors and most people use private clinics and hospitals if they can afford to.  But a private consultation can cost $15, a huge sum for millions living on less than $2 a day. More than 60% of the average family's spending goes on medicines and healthcare, the government estimates. Experts have praised the latest programme but say it should have included primary day-to-day healthcare instead of just secondary and tertiary care for more serious and long term treatment. \"Modicare does not extend to primary healthcare, which, we believe, is the weakest link in the provision of public health in India,\" Rajiv Lall and Vivek Dehejia of the IDFC Institute think-tank said in a column for the Mint newspaper. \"The crucial point is that poorly delivered primary care inevitably increases the burden on health and finance at the secondary and tertiary levels down the line,\" they said."

Categorized as a very severe cyclonic storm, Titli hit the Odisha coast near Gopalpur, at a speed of 140-150 kph on Thursday morning, reports NDTV.  People in coastal areas of Odisha and northern Andhra Pradesh are preparing to face the full onslaught of the cyclone.  People in five coastal districts of Odisha have been asked to evacuate once the storm intensified.  In Bangladesh, Titli is likely to move Northwestwards and has started crossing the coast , said a special bulletin of the Met office. Maximum sustained wind speeds within 74 km of the cyclone's centre are about 120 kph--rising to 140 kph in gusts/squalls. The sea will remain very rough near the system centre. Maritime ports of: Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Mongla, and Payra have been advised to keep local warning signal no 4 hoisted.

      "text": "Khulna University Fisheries and Marine Resources Technology Discipline (FMRT) signed a deal  with the Keya Group to perform joint research aimed at developing the promising industry of crab farming in Bangladesh In a bid to lower the risk of virus infection in prawn farming enclosures, crab farming is being separated and modernized in the Khulna region. Under this initiative, 300 crab farmers have already been trained in modern techniques. Speaking with the Dhaka Tribune,Sushilon Deputy Director Md Rafikul Haque said: \"The project to modernize crab farming was launched in August of 2016, and concluded on June 30 this year. \"The project, which had a funding of Tk1 crore, helped 350 farmers become self-dependent in Batiaghata upazila and Khulna sadar, Mongla and Rampal upazila of Bagerhat, and Shyamnagar upazila of Satkhira.\" Those who were trained have established themselves as entrepreneurs in the region, he added. Rafikul also said: \"Among the 350 entrepreneurs, 300 are crab farmers, 20 are in the furniture business, and 30 are involved in the ecotourism sector. Their average income has increased two to three times since training.\" Meanwhile, Senior Assistant Director of District Fisheries, Amal Kanti Roy said: \"In this region prawn and crab were being farmed in the same enclosures. This farming method negatively impacts the biological environment of enclosures, which in turn could affect the prawns. \"Under the circumstances, we had to change the farming method for both prawn and crab. Crab farming season usually begins in September and ends in February. Crab export is an emerging sector in Bangladesh, and there is a lot of opportunity in this field.\" Discussing the matter, a crab farmer in Batiaghata upazila, Ratan Sarkar said: \"We used to farm both prawn and crab in the same enclosures. As a result, prawn harvests were being affected by virus infections and crab harvests were impacted too. \"After the training, we modernized and separated the farming method, and the profits have become significantly larger. We can sell crabs 15-20 days after the spawns are released in the enclosures.\"  Echoing the same opinion, Upazila Fisheries Officer Ripon Kanti Ghosh told this correspondent: \"The salinity level in the water cannot be made adequate for both prawn and crab inside enclosures. We are putting an emphasis on farming locally sourced crabs in separate enclosures.\" Owner of crab export firm Sumaiya Sea Food, Md Musa Sheikh said: \"Crabs sourced from the Sundarbans have a huge demand in the international market, as they are much tastier. Farmers, who were trained under this project, are already making hefty profits. The government is planning to establish hatcheries to further develop crab farming in the region.\" On May 22 this year, Khulna University Fisheries and Marine Resources Technology Discipline (FMRT)  signed a deal on Wednesday with the Keya Group, a business conglomerate, to perform joint research aimed at developing the promising industry of crab farming in Bangladesh. Head of FMRT, Professor Dr Ghausiatur Reza Banu, signed the agreement with Keya Group's Senior Project Team Leader, Gias Uddin Talukder, at an event held in the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Academic Building around 3:30pm. Prof Dr Golam Sarwar and Prof Md Yusuf Ali of FMRT will conduct the research and the project will be funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. Findings from the research may be used to explore opportunities in crab farming and marketing. The research will also benefit people engaged in the industry. Data collected from the research could also be used as a scientific foundation and reference for setting high level government policies on the preservation of crabs and management of this industry. The researchers will also make an effort to reduce the dependency of crab farmers on nature. They will also focus on a sustainable method for farming crabs in hatcheries and the effective marketing of the product."

      "text": "Arriving in Brussels, the leaders of Spain, Greece, Finland and Luxembourg all expressed support for Merkel's push to curtail \"secondary migration\" of refugees who arrive at the EU's southern border before heading north to Germany European leaders promised to help Chancellor Angela Merkel tackle a crisis in the bloc's migration policies on Thursday, offering the weakened German leader vital support before a high-stakes EU summit. Arriving in Brussels, the leaders of Spain, Greece, Finland and Luxembourg all expressed support for Merkel's push to curtail \"secondary migration\" of refugees who arrive at the EU's southern border before heading north to Germany. Europe's longest serving leader has come under acute political pressure from her hardline allies in Bavaria, who are threatening to close their border to migrants if she can't work out a deal with Germany's European partners. That could trigger the collapse of Merkel's three-month-old government and cause the EU's control-free Schengen travel zone to unravel. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters that European solidarity on migration was vital, \"especially with Germany which is now suffering a political crisis.\" Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel added: \"There are so many people who arrived in different countries and then made their way to Germany. I understand when Germany says 'Why do we have to deal with everything?'\" Greece's Alexis Tsipras and Finland's Juha Sipila also promised to work with Germany on the issue. Earlier, speaking in the German parliament, Merkel called on European leaders to forge a common approach to migration, calling it a \"make or break\" issue for Europe, where right-wing, anti-immigrant parties are gaining strength. \"Europe faces many challenges, but that of migration could become the make-or-break one for the EU,\" said Merkel, whose 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees divided Europe and continues to haunt her at home. \"Now as then, I think that was the right thing to do,\" she told the Bundestag. Deeply divided According to draft conclusions circulated before the two-day summit, the leaders will agree measures to strengthen Europe's external borders, spend more on fighting illegal immigration and step up cooperation to prevent refugees and migrants from moving within the bloc. But leaders remain deeply divided over how to handle asylum seekers, with eastern European countries such as Poland and Hungary refusing to accept quotas of refugees while Italy and Greece struggle to cope with arrivals by sea. A deal among all 28 EU states is unrealistic, so Merkel is pushing for a \"coalition of the willing\" on migration. She hopes that will appease the Christian Social Union (CSU), which has hardened its line before of an autumn election in its home region of Bavaria, the main German entry point for migrants.  "

Several houses on the river bank in Dewanpara got flooded on Saturday.  Meanwhile, the approach road of a bridge on the Debraipach Bazar-Islampur road collapsed. It is feared that the bridge might collapse at any time. Locals have moved their belongings and domestic animals to safe places fearing a collapse. Islampur Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Mizanur Rahman said he visited the area and has informed the Water Development Board authorities of the matter.    He said sand sacks should be dumped as soon as possible to prevent the bridge collapse.  "

The body of Al Amin, 27, was found in Meghnarchar, near the Haimchar area of Chandpur district on Monday. Nine others remain missing in Zajira and Naria upazilas of Shariatpur. On August 7, a large part of Sadhur Bazar, located near the Padma River, suddenly collapsed around 2pm. The sudden erosion initially washed away 29 people around a week ago, but 19 among them were rescued later, confirmed by Naria Upazila Nirbahi Officer Sanjida Yasmin and Naria police station OC Aslamuddin. The missing people are Shahjahan Bepari, 70, Mujibur Rahman Chhoiyal, 45, Gopi Bachhar, 55, Nasir Boyati, 18, Mosharrof Chokdar, 46, Nasir Hawladar, 35, Kamal Uddin Chhoiyal, 62, Antu Mogdom, 15, Abdur Rashid Hawladar, 36. The wife of a missing person named Mujibur Chhoiyal, Rabeya Begum said: \"My husband was a businessman. He was in the area during the sudden erosion. He has been missing since then.\" At least 1,000 people have lost their homes and belongings in the erosion. Many educational institutes along with Upazila Parishad and Upazila Health Complex are at the risk of being washed away by the erosion. Naria's municipality Mayor Md Shahidul Islam Babu Rari claimed that about 80% of the houses, in ward 2 and 4 of his municipality have been consumed by the erosion. He also said that it happened because of the negligence of the Water Development Board. Police and fire service personnel are still searching for the missing people. Commenting in the matter, DWDB Shariatpur Executive Engineer Md Shafiqul Islam said: \"Bangladesh Navy Institute Khulna ship yard has submitted tender for the construction of a stable defense dam surrounding an area of 8.9 km.\" He also said that the construction work will commence after the cabinet has assessed and approved the tender. The government had allocated Tk1,097 crore to build an embankment from Zajira's Kundarchar to Naria's Sureshwar on January 2 this year. However, Water Development Board sources told the Dhaka Tribune that construction of the proposed embankment will not start until the next dry season. Last year on September 11 at 5am in the morning, three launches anchored in the same area fell victim to the erosion and 16 people went missing. After a few days, two of the dead bodies were found."

      "authors": "Anwar Hussain, Chittagong",
      "text": "Dissolved oxygen falls sharply, ammonia exceedingly higher Hundreds of dead fish of different species, and other aquatic animals have been found floating in the river Halda for the last couple of days. The dead fish are posing a serious threat to the aquatic biodiversity of Bangladesh's largest natural breeding ground for carp. According to the Department of Fisheries lab, the level of dissolved oxygen (DO) went below 1mg per litre on an average against the required level of at least 5mg per litre. According to the District Fisheries Office, the level of dissolved oxygen was found low in the two feeder canals of the river. In some points, the level of ammonia was found to be 0.5-1.5ppm against the tolerable limit of 0.01ppm. The high concentration of ammonia in water makes it difficult for aquatic organisms to sufficiently excrete the toxicant, leading to toxic build-up in internal tissues and blood, which leads to their death. Humans need air to breathe, and the aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to respire. It is necessary for the survival of fish, invertebrates, bacteria, and underwater plants. Dissolved oxygen is also needed for the decomposition of organic matter. Locals said the water of Halda River turned pitch-black on June 20, spreading the rotten stench of dead fish. Following the matter, the locals formed a human chain at Madunaghat area on June 23, demanding that the river be saved from industrial pollution.    Scores of dead fish surface as pollution imperils Halda River CollectedAccording to Halda River Research Laboratory of Chittagong University, as many as 20 species of fish, including Mola carplet (Amblypharyngodon mola), five species of prawn, Mozambique Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), Aer (Sperata aor), Rohu (Labeo rohita) Catla (Catla catla), Mrigel carp (Cirrhinus mrigala), Kalbaus (Labeo calbasu) Kuchiya (an eel-type fish), were found floating in the river. A Mrigal fish, weighing over 15kg, was also found floating in the river. Officials of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI), Halda River Research Laboratory of Chittagong University, Department of Fisheries (DoF) and Department of Environment (DoE) have already visited different spots of the river and its feeder canals.   The BFRI and the DoE also collected water samples for lab tests from different points of the river to find out the causes behind the death of such a large amount of fish. While talking to the Dhaka Tribune, noted Halda river researcher Prof Dr Manzoorul Kibria said the levels of dissolved oxygen fell sharply and the ammonia went up hundred times the tolerance level due to pollution.   \"Untreated effluents discharged from different industrial units from oxygen to Kulgaon areas, domestic waste and poultry bird excreta are responsible for the death of a huge number of fish species,\" Kibria said. \"Bamonshahi canal was blocked by Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) a few years ago. It should be opened without delay.\"  \"The DoE should a keep a vigil so that the industrial units keep the ETPs operative round the clock. A commission for conserving the Halda should also be formed\" Kibria, also president of Halda River Protection Committee, demanded.    Stating that Tk800 crore is earned from the fish of the river every year, he said: \"The river supplies water to around 6,500,000 people every day.  \"It is the living gene bank of pure Indian major carp. A huge number of people, including fry collectors and hatchers live on the spawns produced in the river. They will lose their livelihood if we cannot stop the rampant pollution.\"  Chittagong DoE Azadur Rahman Mollick told the Dhaka Tribune that the level of dissolved oxygen required for aquatic animals was not up to the mark.   \"We have collected water samples from different points for tests. Primarily, it seems that domestic wastes, which got mixed with other wastes after the recent flood in Chittagong, are to blame for the falling level of dissolved oxygen in the river.\" Also Read - Halda wears festive mood as brood fish spawn  \"We have collected water samples from nine points of the river and tested them in the lab in different parameters. In most cases, the level of dissolved oxygen was below 1mg per litre,\" Md Kamrul Hassan, senior chemist of DoE, Chittagong (Laboratory), said. \"Two teams of the DoE have visited different spots of the Halda. Based on the field visit, we have already compiled a report which has been sent to the higher authorities of the department,\" Sangjucta Das Gupta, DoE assistant director (Technical) of Chittagong Metro, said. The DoE official added: \"While developing a housing project located in Kulgaon area, Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) blocked Bamonshahi canal a few years ago. The household wastes used to find its way into the Karnaphuli through the canal. But both industrial and domestic waste are now being channeled to the Halda through Khandakia canal due to the diversion.\" \"The production at the industrial units adjoining the river remained suspended during the Eid-ul-Fitr vacation. So, there is no chance of industrial pollution behind the recent deaths of fish in the river,\" the DoE official said. Chittagong District Fisheries Officer Mominul Haque said they had inspected different points of the river for three consecutive days and witnessed different species of fish like major carps, prawns, eels, Tilapia, Rohu, and Aer floating in the river. \"To avoid such death of fish, the industrial units adjoining the river must install Effluent Treatment Plants and keep them operative round the clock,\" suggested the fisheries officer.      Originating in Khagrachari's Ramgarh upazila, the 107km-long river passes through Hathazari and Raozan upazilas before merging into the Karnaphuli River.   During April and May every year, different species of carp fish start migrating to the spawning ground of the Halda from rivers like Karnaphuli, Matamuhuri, and Sangu. "

      "text": "15 people had died due to the erosion in the past year alone Around 50 people and 15 homesteads were washed into the Jamuna River in Sirajganj district on Thursday night after 400 metres of a flood protection embankment collapsed only a year after it was built.  \"We are suffering a crisis due to the Jamuna River flood prevention embankment erosion,\" Chauhali UNO (Acting) Anisur Rahman said. \"There is panic among local people due to the continuous erosion.\" The acting UNO said that at least 15 people had died due to the erosion in the past year alone. \"Their bodies floated ashore on embankment,\" he said. According to Sirajganj Water Development Board and Tangail Water Development Board, a 7-km flood protection embankment was constructed in 2017 to protect the Simhanti area of Chowhali Sadar upazila and Tangail from the erosion of the Jamuna River. On Thursday night, however, the western part of the flood protection embankment in Chowhali upazila collapsed, dumping around 50 people into the water who then had to swim to the riverbank to save their lives. On Friday morning, Anisur Rahman sent a report regarding the intensity and impacts of breakdown of flood protection embankment in the area in the past one year  Tangail Water Development Board Executive Engineer Masudur Rahman said that after hearing about the matter, sandbags have been dumped to protect the embankment. Locals were also being moved from their houses."

      "text": "\nNo freedom fighters list before national polls\n\n\n\n\nAmanur Rahman Roney\n\n\n\n\n Published at 03:34 pm April 3rd, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe work on preparing a list of freedom fighters will not take place during the remainder of the incumbent government's tenure ahead of the national polls and the Freedom Fighters' Central Command Council election.\nA new list will be made after the general election, said officials of the Liberation War Affairs Ministry and the Jatio Muktijoddha Council (Jamuka).\nOn the other hand, the ministry has said that people accused of irregularities will not be part of the local scrutiny committees. New committees will be formed in areas where allegations of irregularities have been raised.\nAn official of the ministry said that the government took initiative to prepare the list to provide facilities to the freedom fighters that were dropped from the previous lists and those who were never included in them.\n\"We received about 170,000 applications online and later forwarded them to local committees for scrutiny. These committees recommended including more than 25,000 applicants in the list,\" the official said.\nBut later, the ministry started receiving complaints against many of these applications. Intelligence reports also found irregularities in the recommendations of the local committees. The process to prepare the list was halted on March 11.\nIn the last 47 years, the list of freedom fighters has been amended six times. During the same period, changes have been brought 11 times to the process to define freedom fighters and their age.\nThe National Freedom Fighters Council said a gazette was published on January 12 last year on forming 480 committees for scrutinizing freedom fighters. These committees started work on January 21 that year. Of them, 365 committees recommended 25,000 names for inclusion in the list.\nLiberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque has said that at least 100 of these committees provided faulty reports.\n\"Most of them did not follow the guidelines we recommended for including freedom fighters in the list. Only 10% of the recommendations are correct. That's why we have suspended activities of these committees,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, a large number of freedom fighters have been thronging the Jatio Muktijoddha Council (Jamuka) with applications and appeals. One of them is Nawaz Ali, a resident of Brahmanbaria's Bijoynagar upazila.\n\"I fought in Sector 3. My father Modhu Mia was killed by the razakars. Once I received a grant of Tk20,000 from the prime minister as a freedom fighter. But the local union commander did not recommend my name due to a family feud. That is why I have come to file an appeal,\" he said.\nResumption of FF list work to take time\nJamuka officials have said that the prime minister ordered preparation of the list to ensure that freedom fighters in need receive some facilities. But the process has been obstructed because of irregularities.\nComplaints began to flood in from various parts of the country as soon as work to prepare the list started. Local freedom fighters in Kurigram held a rally protesting the irregularities on December 21. They alleged that the local committee had made recommendations in exchange for money.\nThe work of the scrutiny committees was suspended on March 11 mainly because of these allegations. Ministry sources say the government is not rushing to prepare a list because of the upcoming national polls and the central freedom fighters command election.\nThe committees that have been accused of irregularities will be scrapped and work will resume with new committees in their places. The work will take time and the government is unwilling to take risks by hastily drawing up a list.\nJamuka Director General Mizanur Rahman said they have stopped the work on the list based on specific allegations.\n\"The committees ignored our request to provide information about freedom fighters in the categories we suggested. More clarity is needed. A decision will be taken later following a meeting,\" he said.\nMizanur said that an increase in facilities provided to the freedom fighters have enticed many people to be included the list. \"Numerous people were included in the freedom fighter list during the previous [BNP-led] alliance government even though they did not take part in the Liberation War,\" he said.\nLiberation War Affairs Minister Mozammel declined to comment when asked about the resumption of preparing the list.\n\"The committee will decide on it after holding a meeting. We wanted to include the freedom fighters who were left out. We assumed that 10,000 to 15,000 freedom fighters would be included in the list. But the work could not be done with clarity,\" he added.\nThe minister further said: \"We have information on the accused people. We will drop them when we form new local committees who will do the scrutiny.\"\nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

      "headline": "Indian state elections could halt Modi's winning streak",
      "authors": "Reuters, New Delhi",
      "text": "Congress is tipped to win in the western state of Rajasthan, scrape through in the central state of Chhattisgarh and is locked in a photo finish with the BJP in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are among India's biggest states Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is staring at election losses in big heartland states, polls show, suggesting that farm distress and a lack of jobs for growing numbers of young people could prove stumbling blocks for his re-election bid in May. India counts votes on Tuesday from five states that chose new assemblies over the past month, but exit polls show Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could lose the three most important races, while it has little presence in two smaller states dominated by regional parties. The loss would be the biggest for Modi's Hindu nationalists since they swept to power in 2014 general elections, followed by wins over the past four years in 22 of India's 29 states, on promises of thousands of jobs and a doubling in farm income. Politicians view state polls, though they are usually decided by regional issues, as a pointer to the mood of the BJP's traditional voting base, ahead of a general election that must be held by May. \"The results will set the tone for the 2019 election,\" said Sachin Pilot, a leader of the main opposition Congress party. Congress is tipped to win in the western state of Rajasthan, scrape through in the central state of Chhattisgarh and is locked in a photo finish with the BJP in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are among India's biggest states. \"The BJP has made a lot of tall claims about income, jobs etc,\" Pilot added. \"They came out with 28 slogans, 'Swachh Bharat' ('Clean India'), 'Make in India' and such, but how many were implemented?\" Modi remains the frontrunner for the general election, however, trailed in personal ratings by his main challenger, Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Modi promised to clean up India and turn it into a top tourist destination as well as lift the share of manufacturing in its economy to a quarter of gross domestic product, following the example of China. But it has grown only slightly, to 17%, with nearly all the ambitious clean-up programmes for cities and the river Ganges, as well as the Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic industrial base, largely unfulfilled. Anger over weak farm prices, slow growth in rural wages and small businesses hit by a new nationwide goods and service tax has also boiled over, provoking protests by tens of thousands of farmers in Delhi and Mumbai. Although the BJP might drop a few seats because of anti-incumbency sentiment, it was not losing everything, as some surveys forecast, said party spokesman GVL Narasimha Rao. \"They have underassessed the BJP,\" he added. \"They have done it previously too.\" Surveys often prove wrong, partly because it is tough to forecast the outcome of elections involving India's millions of voters. Hindu first Still, a poor performance could prompt the BJP to push its brand of Hindu nationalism harder, politicians and analysts say. \"The BJP campaign will focus on nationalism, Hindutva and corruption,\" said Shekhar Gupta, a political analyst, using a term that refers to the party's Hindu-first plank. Hindus make up about 80 percent of India's population of 1.3 billion, while Muslims are about 14%. Already hardline groups associated with the party have reignited their campaign for a temple to the god-king Rama at a site where Hindu zealots razed a 16th-century mosque in 1992. Thousands of Hindu monks and activists linked to the BJP gathered in New Delhi on Sunday in a show of force to back the temple. Hindu fringe groups have stepped up a campaign against the slaughter of cows, which many in India consider sacred, as vigilante groups target Muslims in the livestock trade. Modi is expected to try to recover political ground with giveaways in the next few months for small businesses and farmers, who make up a big chunk of voters. \"The state elections will be seen as a litmus test of Modi's popularity,\" said Simon Finch, fund manager at London-based Ashburton Investments. \"However, we would expect any blemishes to be met with a continuation of the populist measures increasingly evident during the past four years.\" If the BJP did well, that would be a further catalyst for the market, said Mike Sell, head of Asian investments at asset management firm Alquity, who sees Modi's economic measures, such as a unified goods and services tax, eventually paying off. \"Even if they did badly, they wouldn't make us do anything negative and we will use any weakness as a buying opportunity.\"  "

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "The BRI is a multi-billion-dollar initiative launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping Bangladesh holds an important \"geopolitical strategic position\" in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) that offers \"great potential\" to strengthen economic and trade cooperation between Bangladesh and China, says a Chinese expert. \"We should strengthen cooperation between the two governments, and at the same time focus on strengthening inter-party exchanges,\" said Prof Li Tao, executive director of the Institute of South Asian Studies at Sichuan University in China. The BRI is a multi-billion-dollar initiative launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping. This mega initiative emerged when President Xi came to power in 2013, reports UNB. During Xi's historic visit to Dhaka in 2016, Bangladesh formally joined the \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" a drive which has already drawn the close attention of the world. Sharing her thoughts on development of Bangladesh-China relationship under the BRI, Prof Li Tao said the two countries can accelerate the feasibility study on Bangladesh-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and then start the negotiation accordingly. \"The FTA between Bangladesh and China can effectively reduce the trade deficit. This is very important,\" she said emphasising the importance of actively promoting the feasibility studies to that end. Bangladesh and China will complete the exchange of letters for zero-tariff treatment to 97% of tariff items exported from Bangladesh to China within a short time, to further boost the export of Bangladeshi goods to Chinese market, according to Chinese Embassy in Dhaka. Earlier, Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Zhang Zuo said both Bangladesh and China have highly prosperous markets that attract businesspeople from all over the world. \"Faced with opportunities and challenges, we should join hands to become good partners of mutual benefits.\" Ambassador Zuo said Bangladesh and China should maintain communication and consultation, adhere to the basic principles of free trade, make necessary reforms to the World Trade Organization while fully taking into consideration the interests of all parties, and safeguard the developing interests and policy space of developing countries.  Prof Li Tao, who attended Cosmos Dialogue in Dhaka on Bangladesh China relations on Saturday, also shed light on how to deal with big powers and importance of Bangladesh's political stability and policy continuity. She also laid emphasis on overcoming administrative efficiency, social stability and investment in infrastructure and energy sector for faster growth of Bangladesh. \"We need to enhance cooperation in infrastructure sector,\" she said focusing on close cooperation in big infrastructure projects like airports in Bangladesh. Prof Li Tao also said China's investment in Bangladesh should promote the \"localization\" of projects, dock local labour and employment needs, truly benefit both sides, and earnestly increase local incomes. She also laid emphasis on strengthening exchanges in the personnel, media cooperation, cooperation in higher education and mutual recognition of academic qualifications. Appreciating Bangladesh-China longstanding friendly relations, the Chinese expert said similar development concepts of the two countries is the core of cooperation. In 2017, bilateral trade value between the two countries reached $16 billion, 5.8% higher than last year, with China remaining the number one 1 trade partner to Bangladesh, data shows. In the first 9 months of this year, the bilateral trade value stands at $13.9 billion, with a growth rate of 19.3% year on year, according to the Chinese Embassy."

      "text": "Of the total 1,502 hectares of forests area, about 793 hectares have been encroached The UN and other development partners must prioritize conservation of the environment that sustained heavy damage following the latest Rohingya influx, Bangladesh's forest minister said on Monday. Anisul Islam Mahmud told a high-level discussion  in Dhaka that although Bangladesh showed its hospitality by sheltering the Rohingyas, the influx has had a significant environmental impact on Cox's Bazar. \"The government has already extended its support and additional investment to restore the environment,\" he said while speaking as the chief guest at the launch of a UNDP report on the Environmental Impact of the Rohingya Influx. The report highlights the critical impacts of the influx of more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees on the environment of Cox's Bazar and recommends measures for mitigation, restoration and conservation.  Currently, the crisis affected population is almost 1.5 million, putting massive pressure on the already dilapidated environment of the district. \"A total of 4,300 acres of hills and forests have been cut down for temporary shelters, facilities and firewood in Ukhiya and Teknaf, threatening the biodiversity,\" the report said. \"Some of the key impacts will likely become irreversible if measures are not taken immediately.\" From 1,502 hectares of forest area, about 793 hectares have been encroached. Around 3,000 to 4,000 acres (1,200-1,600 hectares) of hilly land in the Teknaf-Ukhiya-Himchari watershed have been cleared of vegetation. The report identifies the collection of nearly 6,800 tons of fuel wood each month by the Rohingyas and use of 60 culms of bamboo on average to construct each Rohingya temporary shelter as the key causes for the encroachment.  Also, indiscriminate hill cutting for building Rohingya shelters is causing the hilly terrain to lose its natural setting, causing a potential risk of landslides. The report also identified thousands of shallow tube wells as threats to the aquifers. In addition, air pollution has risen due to increased vehicular movement and smoke from firewood while polythene bags and plastic bottles are all piling up in various parts of the area due to the lack of a recycling system. The study also addressed related gender-based issues and health risks due to the Rohingya influx. Sudipto Mukerjee, Country Director of UNDP Bangladesh, said the emergency is putting immense pressure on scarce natural resources, resulting in degraded natural forests, barren hills and an emerging water crisis. \"This situation demands immediate investments in restoring the environment and ecosystem as part of the Government of Bangladesh's response in Cox's Bazar,\" he said. \"Sensing the urgency for measures to prevent further degradation and to support early restoration, we, at UNDP, undertook this report with the aim that it would help development actors to program early and sustained response and funding. \"The UN system has stepped up with solutions like alternative fuel, solid waste management, and replantation, but the current investment is not adequate.\" The report recommends sustainable solutions and long-term effort for restoration and conservation.

The 12-year-old died around 6:45am on Wednesday, Muktamoni's father Ibrahim Hossain told the Dhaka Tribune.  Earlier on May 20, Ibrahim said the physical condition of his daughter was critical. Her namaz-e-janaza was held after the zuhr prayers. Later, she was buried beside her grandfather Azhar Ali's grave. \"She has been buried at our family graveyard,\" Ibrahim said. Muktamoni drew the nation's attention with an abnormally large right arm. On August 12, 2017 doctors at DMCH removed a 3kg tumour from her arm after a biopsy showed the growth to be in the artery of her hand. The girl later underwent three more consecutive surgeries on her right arm on August 29, September 5, and October 8, 2017. Muktamoni's mother Asma Khatun has become paralysed with grief Dhaka Tribune Muktamoni's father: There was no lacking in my daughter's treatment Muktamoni's father Ibrahim Hossain said he bears no grudges towards the doctors, or anyone, for his daughter's death.  Instead, he thanked the physicians and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for undertaking the responsibility of treating his 12-year-old daughter. \"Everyone tried their best for Muktamoni,\" Ibrahim Hossain said.  He added: \"There was no lacking in her treatment. I thank the prime minister and all those who came forward to help my daughter.\"Breaking into tears, Ibrahim also thanked the journalists of Satkhira and Dhaka for aiding Muktamoni from his home in Kamar Basha village in the south of Satkhira Sadar upazila. Her namaz-e-janaza was held after the zuhr prayers Dhaka Tribune \"Muktamoni stopped eating and talking since yesterday [Tuesday],\" said Ibrahim. \"But since she did the same thing twice before, we thought she would recover. But I did not think she would leave us.\" He talked about how Muktamoni agreed to go to the Sadar Upazila Hospital for blood tests on Tuesday, and later asked to drink water in the morning on Wednesday. When Ibrahim tried to comfort her, he realized that she had stopped breathing. Muktamoni's twin sister Hiramoni said: \"I wanted to go to school with my sister. But it will never happen now, as Allah has taken her from us.\" Muktamoni's mother Asma Khatun has become paralysed with grief. She only wants her daughter to call her \"mother\" once again.

      "text": "Group's demands include official recognition as an indigenous community The Dinajpur 6 constituency, comprised of Hakimpur, Birampur, Nawabganj and Ghoraghat, is home to more than 100,000 members of a small ethnic community.  Among those people, around 52,000 are voters, and the Awami League considers them their vote bank.  The community has reiterated their trust in the ruling party, but made a few demands, such as a special quota for the ethnic people, establishing education curricula in their mother tongue and increasing their quality of life. The ethnic community in this region suffers from a multitude of issues, including land disputes, unemployment and lack of official recognition as an indigenous community. Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, local leader of the ethnic community Michael Tudu said: \"There are around 50,000 voters in our community, but we suffer from many issues.  \"I am urging that effective measures be taken to meet our demands following the 11th general election.\"  Demands made by ethnic community Addressing these issues, another ethnic community leader Kerobin Hembrom said: \"The roads need improvement, but I want to thank the local lawmaker and the government for ensuring us a steady supply of electricity. \"I urge the local lawmaker to represent our demands to the government regarding the existing land disputes plaguing our community and ensure our rights as members of the ethnic community.\" 15th amendment Commenting on the 15th amendment of the constitution, Hembrom said: \"Following that amendment, we are no longer being recognized as indigenous people. This change further complicates our land ownership issues.  \"We identify ourselves as Bangladeshi, but we are not Bangali, we are members of the indigenous community. Our land is at serious risk of being seized by culprits.\" The 15th amendment was passed by the Awami League government on June 30, 2011, making some significant changes including scrapping the system of the caretaker government of Bangladesh, and incorporating article 23A regarding the restoration of culture of different ethnic sects, tribes, minor races and communities.  However, the constitution did not recognize them as \"indigenous people.\" Ethnic community members Victoria Tudu and Prodip Mardi pointed out they are ready to vote for the boat again, but they hope that their demands will be met as soon as possible. They added that the ethnic community is quite backwards in terms of education and employment, and if the government does not extend its support, the community will fall further behind.  Dinajpur 6 incumbent lawmaker and Awami League candidate contesting in the next parliamentary election Shibli Sadiq said: \"I and the government have always stood beside the ethnic community living in this region. \"We have made a serious effort to develop their quality of life. If elected again, I will launch a project to build a school for the ethnic children, where they will be educated in their mother tongue.\" He added that the unemployment issue suffered by the ethnic community will also be resolved by building a handicraft product factory in the region, and creating other employment opportunities."

      "text": "The concert was two hours long and each band performed for one hour each. How two bands finished sound check and performed their complete list of 'live' songs with a few requests thrown in the mix, is beyond me. The credit must go to the break night coordinator Archi Ananya, one of the leading organizers of IUB Ascension 2018 Cryptic Fate and Nemesis are two most popular bands of Bangladesh. It is very hard to find a person, among the current generation of Bangladeshis, who has not heard \"Cholo Bangladesh\" by Cryptic Fate or \"Kobe\" by Nemesis.  These two chart topping numbers of Bangladeshi music were played on the same amphitheatre of Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB) last Friday. The occasion was the ceremonial \"break night\" of IUB Ascension 2018, the biggest debate fest of South Asia this year. The break night is traditionally arranged to entertain the debaters for few hours, before the names of the teams going to knockout rounds are announced.  The concert was two hours long and each band performed for one hour each. How two bands finished sound check and performed their complete list of \"live\" songs with a few requests thrown in the mix, is beyond me. The credit must go to the break night coordinator Archi Ananya, one of the leading organizers of IUB Ascension 2018.  Let us attempt to grab a sense of the ambience. The amphitheatre's stage is big enough for both band and their equipments. Three wide steps lead to the central courtyard surrounding the stage. The head bangers naturally positioned themselves on the centre court. Some of the crowd sat on the steps. Behind the steps four replicas of space ships seen on \"Star Wars\" were hanging in midair.  The rest of the crowd was either standing next to the spaceships or the open balcony on the left of central courtyard.      Nemesis took the stage at exactly 7:00pm and finished sound check within 15 minutes. Their show lasted for 45 minutes in which they played some old hits like \"Obocheton,\" along with songs from their newest album \"Gonojowar.\" They finished their performance by 8pm with \"Kobe,\" that was requested off them from the very beginning by the crowd. Upon hearing the start of \"kobe\" the noise they made was deafening. Almost everyone present sang along with Nemesis and when they got off the stage, they were promptly flooded by debaters, adjudicators, volunteers and organizers, all with requests for selfies and autographs.  Nemesis began the break night of IUB Ascension 2018 However, the flood of selfie-and-autograph seekers were in a dilemma as Cryptic Fate began their sound-check soon after. The heavy metal band began the show with the heavy metal number \"Bhoboghurey.\" Then they played \"Bhore'r Opekkha\" with an assortment of old hits. There was one song that they have not played live anywhere else that I cannot remember the title off, as I was busy head-banging throughout their performance. As soon as they began the starting riffs of \"Cholo Bangladesh\" the cheers was probably heard all around Bashundhara residential area. I painfully realized the concert was about to end, but I sang along to it with as much pitch my voice can muster. So did everyone else. As soon as Cryptic Fate left the stage the audience was surprised to hear that there is one more performance in store, a mesmerizing fire-show that is fast becoming a trademark of IUB Ascension. The fire show had five spinners, and lit everyone's faces from time to time with fire breathing. Memories of fire-benders from the cartoon series \"Avatar\" were invoked. The rockstars have departed by then. The melancholy of an empty concert stage was slowly enveloping the amphitheatre. But the space ships remained hanging in midair. Shadman Faiyaz breathed fire to entertain people of IUB Ascension 2018"

They were speaking at a workshop titled \"Our Cities 2050\" at house building research institute (HBRI) auditorium on Sunday. The Urban Development Directorate, under the Ministry of Housing and Public Works arranged the day long program as part of observing World Cities Day which was on October 31. Eighteen research papers on urban planning were presented in the workshop in six separate sections at a time and 19 organizations from the government, NGOs and universities took part. Jahangirnagar University Department of Urban and Regional Planning Professor Dr Shafiq-Ur Rahman while presenting his paper said: \"We are taking and implementing various big projects like the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and so on. Along with these big projects we have to think about linkage projects also. We have to think how people will come to BRT and MRT stoppages and how will they go back to home from there without interruption.\" He proposed a rickshaw and bicycle ride sharing mechanism in this regards. Another professor from the same discipline Dr Akhter Mahmud has said: \"We are building one or two cities and allowing them to expand to an unlimited boundary. We should think about other cities and take plans in this regard, as well. Health, education and employment opportunities should be decentralized so that pressure on Dhaka decreases. \"We have many policies on decentralization which only exists in books but no real implementation is seen anywhere. We should implement decentralization policies if we want a proper urban development.\" Also at the workshop, Brac's Urban Development Program Head Hasina Mushrofa presented their achievements on urban development issues."

Many low-lying and char areas have already been inundated, worsening the district's overall flood situation, reports UNB. The internal road communication has been snapped due to flooding in many char areas, living people of many areas stranded for several days, said villagers. According to sources at Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) office in Kurigram, water level of Brahmaputra River was flowing only 1.46 cm below the danger level at Chilmari point and 2 cm below in Noonkhawa point. Dharla was flowing only 0.99 cm under the danger level at Bridge point, while in Teesta the water was flowing 1.6 cm below the danger level on Sunday morning. Water above danger level at 5 river stations Meanwhile, water is still flowing above the danger level at five out of 94 river stations monitored by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) across the country, reports BSS. Water levels marked rise at 53 river stations, fall at 38 stations and remained steady at one station, said a FFWC press release on Sunday. The water of Surma River is flowing 58 cm above the danger level at Kanaighat station while water of Kushiara River is flowing 19 cm, 27 cm and 20 cm above the danger level at Amalshid, Sheola and Sherpur-Sylhet stations, respectively. The water of Old Surma River is also flowing 36 cm above the danger level at Derai station, it said. The major rivers of the North-Eastern region - Surma and Kushiara - may continue rising in the next 24 hours and the existing flood situation in Sylhet district may slightly deteriorate. According to information of Bangladesh and Indian Meteorological Departments, there is chance of heavy to very heavy rainfall in northern and north-eastern region of Bangladesh and adjoining Indian regions in the next 24 to 48 hours. The water level of Brahmaputra, Teesta, Dharala and Ghaghot rivers in the country's northern region may also rise.  The Brahmaputra-Jamuna and the Ganges-Padma rivers are in falling trend while the Jamuna and Ganges rivers may continue falling trend. The Padma River is now only 12 meters away from the locality of Dangi village in Sadar upazila, Faridpur, threatening to inundate the entire village anytime UNB River erosion takes serious turn in Faridpur The devastating erosion by the mighty River Padma has taken a serious turn in the district's Char Bhadrasan upazila threatening the river-protection dam, reports UNB. The people of the upazila living beside the dam are passing days in fear of erosion. The river was only 12 meters away from the locality of Dangi village in Sadar upazila, locals said, adding that the river could inundate the entire village anytime. BWDB has spent around Tk4 crore for the development of the dam by building a concrete road on it. Moreover, some 26,130 sacks filled with sand were put beside the river bank in the affected areas in three phases. Wasel Uddin Sikdar, a resident of Dangi village, said river erosion worsened in the last seven days. \"It will not be possible to protect the main road of the upazila if necessary steps are not taken immediately.\" Char Bhadrasan Sadar Union Parishad Chairman Md Azad Khan said they have written to the higher authority describing the overall situation and were awaiting response. He said many establishments, including school, houses, madrasa and mosque, adjacent to the river bank will disappear in the river very soon if necessary measures to protect the dam were not taken immediately. BWDB Engineer Sultan Mahmud said a proposal under the sustainable dam protection project was sent to the concerned authority for saving around 2.5 kilometres of road. \"The repairing works will start soon after the approval of the project,\" he added."

This fruit perishes within a few days of ripening--and can no-longer be sold.  Guava is eaten raw and is rich in vitamin C and other nutrients. It is most popularly known as Bengal's apple. The fruit can be also used to make jam, jelly, and juice.  According to stakeholders, farmers and traders would be able to make a large profit if a cold storage or jam factory were established in the guava-rich district of Barisal.  Guava growers in Jhalakathi incur losses as there are no storage arrangements for the tropical fruit | Dhaka Tribune The district administration and Department of Agriculture Extension said a feasibility study is being conducted to build a cold storage facility in a village of sadar upazila. There are many guava orchards in Barisal's Banaripara, Pirojpur's Swarupkathi, and Jhalakathi sadar upazila. The fruit has been produced in the region for about 300 years.  Most of the guava orchards are located in Jhalakathi sadar upazila and the government has recognized guava as the prime commodity of the district. Guava is produced on 1,236 acres of land across 20 villages of Kirtipasha union of the district's sadar upazila.   There are 15-20 floating guava markets in orchard areas. Of these markets, Bhimruli market, under Jhalakathi sadar upazila, is the largest.  Guava growers in Jhalakathi incur losses as there are no storage arrangements for the tropical fruit | Dhaka Tribune This floating market has now become a tourist spot. Thousands of local and foreign tourists visit Bhimruli market to enjoy the scenery.  But no infrastructure has developed there for the tourists.  Jhalakathi Deputy Commissioner Md Hamidul Haque said they have already received funds from the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism and work will soon begin to construct rest houses and other facilities for tourists.

Malik's manager and agent, Ameem Haq, said the former Pakistan captain was \"over the moon\" to become a father.

Mirza, who is a three-time Grand Slam doubles winner, announced her pregnancy in April, prompting speculation her tennis career was over. She had been sidelined since last October with a knee injury. The 31-year-old, who became the first Indian to win a WTA tournament singles title in 2005, has said the baby's surname would be Mirza-Malik. All-rounder Malik, 36, has been Pakistan's key player in the limited-overs format after he retired from Test cricket in 2015. "

      "text": "Total 20 projects involving Tk32,525 crore approved The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved 20 development projects involving Tk32,525 crore including one to boost the country's urea production on Tuesday. The approval was given at the 146th Ecnec meeting held at the National Economic Council (NEC) conference room in the capital with Ecnec Chairperson and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair, reports UNB. Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal after the meeting said: \"On Tuesday, we placed 20 projects at the meeting and Ecnec approved all of them.\" \"The total estimated cost of the 20 projects is Tk32,524.90 crore. Of the cost, Tk15,494.37 crore will come from government funds, while Tk11,656.27 crore from the funds of the organizations concerned and Tk5,374.26 crore as foreign assistance,\" he said. Of the 20 projects, 14 are new and the rest are revised ones. About the GDP growth, the Planning Minister expressed hope that it may reach around 8.25% in the current fiscal year. Under the Tk10,461-crore Ghorashal Urea Fertiliser Project, a new urea factory will be set up in Ghorashal with a production capacity of 9,24,000 tons per year. Currently, two factories in Ghorashal and Palash are annually producing 3,15,000 tons. About the project, the minister said the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) will, by June 2022 , implement the setting up of a granular urea factory adjacent to the existing Ghorshal  and Palash Urea Fertilizer factories in Narsingdi with a daily production capacity of 2,800 tons. Of the project cost, Tk1,844.19 crore will come from the government fund while the rest Tk8,616.72 crore from bidders. The new urea factory will be set up aiming to meet the growing demand of fertilizer and thus ensure food security in the country. According to the project factsheet, now the daily production capacity of two existing Ghorashal and Palash fertilizer factories has come down to 1,050 tons as most of the machinery of the two factories has become dilapidated.  The countrywide annual demand of urea is in between 2.6 to 3 million tons, but six fertilizer factories run under the BCIC can produce roughly 9,00,000 to 1 million tons. The Ecnec also cleared a project involving Tk2,861.31 crore for transporting fuel from Chittagong to Dhaka by installing pipeline. Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) will implement the 'Fuel Transportation via Pipeline from Chittagong to Dhaka Project' by December 2020 aiming to save time and cost, and reduce system loss in the fuel transportation. The 18 other projects include: - Cross-Border Road Network Improvement Project (Bangladesh) (1st revised) at an estimated cost of Tk3,684.55 crore - Rural Connectivity Improvement Project (LGED Part) at Tk3,667.42 crore  - Construction, Renovation and Development of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Killa at Tk1,957.49 crore - Establishment of New Campus for Jagannath University: Land Acquisition and Development at Tk1,920.94 crore - Flood Control, Road Cum Embankment Protection and Drainage for the Bangladesh Economic Zone at Mirsarai in Chittagong (1st revised) Project at Tk1,657.43 crore - Emergency Assistance Project-BREB portion (Electrification for the Forcibly Displaced Myanmar nationals taking shelter in Cox's Bazar) estimated at Tk104.44 crore - Bangladesh: Emergency Assistance Project (LGED) portion with Tk297.30 crore - Ground Level Heightening, Wave Protection, and Embankment Protection Works of Mithamain Army Establishment in the Mithamain upazila of Kishoreganj at Tk304.95 crore - Protection of both embankments of Karnaphuli and Ichamati Rivers, Shilok canal and other canals under the Rangunia, Boalkhali and Kaptai upazilas at Tk398.91 crore - Protection of the right embankment of Gangachhara River in the Rangpur district and Teesta River in the Rangpur Sadar upazila (1st revised) at Tk168.84 crore. - Upgrading Gobindaganj-Ghoraghat- Birampur-Fulbari-Dinajpur Regional Highway estimated at Tk882.91 crore - Developing the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Road at Tk458.32 crore - Development and Rehabilitation of Important and Affected Roads under the Khulna City Corporation at Tk607.57 crore - Establishment of Fire Service and Civil Defence Station at 25 important upazila Sadars/Places (2nd revised) at Tk419.37 crore - Establishment of Shaheed M Mansur Ali Medical College and 500-bed Medical College Hospital in Sirajganj (1st revised) at Tk883.53 crore - Extending Infrastructural Facilities of 12 Existing Cadet Colleges in the Country at Tk428.54 crore - Rural Infrastructure Development (Comilla, Brahmanbaria and Chandpur districts) (2nd revised)at Tk769.42 crore - Construction of the Kodamrasul Bridge over the Shitalakhya River under the Narayanganj City Corporation at Tk 590.75 crore"

      "authors": "Kamrul Islam, back from Sharankhola",
      "text": "Many children in Sharankhola spend on average of three to four hours collecting shrimp fry each day. Once they collect around a thousand fry, they sell it to nearby Southkhali Bazar for around Tk1,200 for Bagda fry and 3,000 for Golda fry. Every year, when the fishing season hits it peak in the Sharankhola area of Bagerhat, people scouring the Baleshwar River for a good catch become a common sight.  At the riverbank, the Dhaka Tribune met Shimul Hossain, a young boy of eleven who was collecting shrimp fry with his mother.  Shimul usually studies at South Khuriakhali Primary School, located about one hundred metres from his fishing spot. On this occasion, however, the boy's mother, Nargis Akhter, said she had no other option but to take her child with her to collect shrimp fry. \"We are barely making ends meet without any savings,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I am struggling to cover the day-to-day expenses of my family, (so) where would I get the money for my children's education? \"Tuition is costly. The government is providing books free of charge, but children must be sent to private tutors for better education. I also have to give my children some money every day, so that they can have something to eat during recess at school.\" Nargis said many children in Sharankhola were working the river with their mothers, typically spending three to four hours collecting fry each day.  Once they collect around a thousand fry, they sell it to nearby Southkhali Bazar for around Tk1,200 for Bagda fry and Tk3,000 for Golda fry. \"I do not want my children to collect shrimp fry, but our life is not easy here,\" Nargis said. \"If I had an alternative means of income, I never would have let my son do this.\" Women and children of riverside villages illegally collect shrimp fry from the river and sell them to the fish farms during a certain season Dhaka Tribune Halimullah, 36, is a resident of Tafalbari who also makes his living as a fisherman in Sharankhola.  \"The fishing profession is getting more and more difficult,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. \"So I bring my children to the river and nearby canals to collect fry.\" Not only are the desperate families of Sharankhola taking their children out of school, the work they are being put to is not even legal. Bagerhat district Fisheries Officer Zia Haider Chowdhury told the Dhaka Tribune that the government had banned catching fry from rivers to protect certain species of fish. Sarankhola Matsha Chashi Samity (fish farmers' association) General Secretary Kamruzzaman Bulbul said that despite the ban, some shrimp farmers still buy fry from these natural sources if the quality is good, encouraging the continuation of the poaching. \"The shrimp and prawn populations have witnessed an alarming reduction in different rivers due to unchecked collection of fry,\" he said. Government records show that of the 7,330 families in Southkhali Union, around 4,600 are living in poverty. Nearby unions in the area suffer the same economic conditions. Southkhali Union Parishad Chairman Mozammel Hossain said the people of the area need more help from the state. \"The government provides 40kg rice per month to registered fishermen during the ban on Jatka (Hilsa fry) fishing,\" he said.   A common view in Sharankhola- children are busy catching shrimp fry Dhaka Tribune  \"However, the government is yet to take any steps for the benefit of those who collect fry from the rivers. All fishermen families should be brought under the social safety net programme, to curb child labour and illegal collection of shrimp.\" Executive Director of Voice of South Bangladesh, Md Shahidul Islam, pointed to the lack of alternative livelihood sources.  \"Unfortunately, there is no scheme for the betterment of the marginalized people of this area,\" he said, adding that no studies have yet been conducted to gauge the effects of unchecked shrimp fry collection. The director of Bangladesh Shishu Odhikar Forum, a network of 269 non-government organizations working for the children's rights, said that despite the economic hardships faced by the river families, forcing children to work is a punishable offence under the existing laws of Bangladesh. \"We urged the government that a fresh list of children and their family, who are collecting fry for a living, be made,\" Abdus Shahid Mahmud said. \"These families should be brought under the social safety net programme so that their children can have a brighter future.\" National Human Rights Commission Chairman Kazi Reazul Haque said any form of child labour is \"unacceptable\". \"The Sharankhola children have long been involved in child labour, and this has remained unaddressed for a long time,\" he said. \"I believe that the government has failed to fulfill its duty, and it should put more emphasis on social activities for curbing child labour.\" Around 276,000 hectares of land, 1.32 million fishermen, and 14.7 million fish farmers are currently associated with the shrimp farming industry in Bangladesh. Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association Senior Vice-President Kazi Belayet Hossain told the Dhaka Tribune that shrimp was the country's sixth highest exports earner, contributing 3.65% to the GDP of the country in 2017. \"Shrimp farming is the backbone of Bangladesh's frozen fish export industry,\" he said. \"In the 2016-17 Fiscal Year, shrimp worth Tk3,568 crore was exported.\" Despite these impressive figures, Shrimp Research Institute Chief Scientific Officer, Khan Kamal Uddin Ahmed, said only 17 of 57 state-owned hatcheries are currently in operation, leading to an acute crisis of fish fry among the owners of the enclosures.   \"These hatcheries are only able to supply 10-12 crore fry, against the demand of 600 crore Golda fry each year,\" he said.  \"This shortage forces fish farmers to depend on the natural source of fry. (Therefore) during the season, women and children of riverside villages illegally collect shrimp fry from the river and sell them to the fish farms.\""

      "headline": "Hatirjheel Water Taxi Service",
      "authors": "Abu Naser Rayhan",
      "text": "15 minutes inside Dhaka's Venice  You might think of Venice when asked to name a town with picturesque waterways, but if it's a lovely view from the water that you want, you don't have to go much further than Dhaka. The juxtaposition of the two cities might sound rhetorical and in fact it is. However, if you dream of floating across a picturesque waterway in the chaotic Dhaka avoiding the city hubbub, you are in luck.  Hatirjheel, the lakefront in Dhaka which has been transformed into transportation medium for minimizing traffic congestion, now provides awater taxi service with a number of 14 vessels and is becoming an increasingly popular mode of transport as it is found to be cost effective, quick and quite scenic. Currently, the service runs on four routes - Gudaraghat in Gulshan 1 to FDC, Merul-Badda to FDC and FDC to Merul Badda and Gudaraghat. I decided to take the ride from the Gudaraghat point and bought a ticket to the FDC point that costs a mere Tk15. The queue was not too long as it was a holiday and I had to wait only 15 minutes for the boat to depart.  According to the Counter Master, the rush hour on a working day usually coincides with the office hours as most of the people living around the lakefront find it easier and effective to use the water taxi service. So, if you are in for a recreational ride on a working day, it's better to avoid these hours.  The vessels are of different sizes and capacities ranging from a minimum 30 people to as high as 90 on a busy day. I hopped into the waiting boat and my journey started right away. It was a hot summer day in the afternoon but the malodorous yet soporific wind on the lake made me forget the absence of a cooling system in the boat.  The short lived water ride turned out to be an amazing one as I kicked back on by seat, and travelled through the vibrant urban heart. The beauty of the colossal Hatirjheel Lake garnished with greenery and the massive architectural fixture clothed in dazzling lights looks larger than life when seen from the water. Although the stench from the polluted lake water hit hard and threatened to suffocate at the beginning, after a few minutes into the ride I got used to it, thanks partly to my adaptability but also to the distractingly beautiful express road, modern bridge and walkways of Hatirjheel. On a regular working day, it takes almost an hour to reach FDC from Gulshan using the usual road route. The waterway cuts the time in quarter.  The lake authority also has a number of 20 pedal boats (2 seater and 4 seater) for recreational rides. A thirty minutes pedaling on the scenic lake with your dearest one will cost you Tk150- Tk300 based on the capacity of the boat.  The water taxi ride in the lake is completely safe as the operating boats are made of unsinkable fiberglass. Moreover, life jackets and lifeguards are available on board in case of any emergency.         Even then, there are some major drawbacks to the service. Apart from malodorous water, the queues are long and each taxi waits 15 minutes extra for passengers to arrive before departing. Passengers also need to walk a fair bit from the landing location to the main road. Fourteen water taxis, which will soon be extended to eighteen, cruise the water body from 6:00am and 10:00pm every day. The service has brought a significant change to the transport service in the capital and is making a huge impact in the lives of commuters living around the lake travelling to Karwan Bazar, Moghbazar, Dilu Road, Eskaton, Bangla Motor and Tejgaon areas from Badda, Gulshan, Rampura, Khilgaon and other eastern parts of the city.  According to a project official, the service will gradually be expanded to Gulshan Lake through Baridhara and a new route from Gulshan Police Plaza to FDC is currently in talks.   If you want to take a water taxi ride in these summer months, be sure to avoid the rush hours, make an early start and enjoy the ambience of the quiet lake in the coolness of the morning before the temperatures rises and the crowds flood in."

      "text": "The navy has fast-tracked construction of shelters and evacuation centres for 100,000 refugees and nearly three-quarters of the project is complete Bangladesh will next month start moving 100,000 Rohingya refugees to a remote island, disaster management officials said on Tuesday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled on October 3 to officially open newly-constructed shelters for the refugees on Bhashan Char, a muddy islet that emerged from the Bay of Bengal in 2006. The plan is already behind schedule. Officials previously said they wanted to start moving refugees from overcrowded camps near the border with Myanmar to the island in June, before the monsoon began. The navy has fast-tracked construction of shelters and evacuation centres for 100,000 refugees and nearly three-quarters of the project is complete, a senior disaster management official said. Bhashan Char is located 21 nautical miles from Noakhali, 11 nautical miles from Jahajir Char, 4.2 nautical miles from Sandwip, 28 nautical miles from Patenga, and 13.2 nautical miles from Hatiya | Reuters  \"Initially, 50 to 60 Rohingya families will be relocated in the first phase beginning next month,\" said the official, Habibul Kabir Chowdhury. Bangladesh, a low-lying riverine country vulnerable to rising sea levels, is prone to tropical cyclones, especially in the Bay of Bengal between April and November. The island is one hour by boat from the nearest land but violent storms make the journey by sea dangerous or sometimes impossible. The plan to relocate refugees there was revived after 700,000 Rohingya Muslims, fleeing a violent crackdown in Myanmar in August last year, poured into southeast Bangladesh and overwhelmed existing refugee camps. Rights groups have warned the silty strip is uninhabitable and prone to flooding and other natural disasters, and urged Bangladesh to drop the idea. But the government pumped $280 million last November into transforming it into a habitable site.   A navy official said a three-metre-high embankment had been erected around the entire island to make it flood-resistant. \"We're ready to receive refugees,\" he said, asking for anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the press. Secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, Shah Kamal, said the refugees would be able to access humanitarian relief on the island and receive training in skills such as fishing. Officials say refugees will not be forced to leave existing camps in Cox's Bazar, among the most crowded places on earth and prone to landslides, disease and other dangers. \"If we can ensure full humanitarian assistance to them, I don't see any reason why they won't come to the island. We'll convince them,\" said Habibul Kabir, the disaster official.       "

Nabanna is the celebration of harvest season in Bangladesh, usually celebrated with food and dance and music. It is also called a festival of food, as many local delicacies, like pitha, are prepared and shared. The festival is usually celebrated on the first day of the month of Agrahayan in the Bangla calendar. To celebrate the festival successfully, a meeting was held at the conference room of the Deputy Commissioner's Office on November 8, with Additional Deputy Commissioner (general) Md Ziaur Rahman in chair, reported BSS. The Khulna district administration have chalked up different programs with the theme \"Nabanna and Grameen Bangla,\" which includea rally, a fair, pitha festival and art competition for children. A colourful procession will also be brought out from the city's Shaheed Hadis Park at 8am, and a day-long musical soiree will also take place in the same venue.  The art competition will be held at the district Shishu Academy. Additional Deputy Commissioner Ziaur Rahman told BSS that the government had decided to observe Nabanna Utsab in a befitting manner, as the festival is a significant part of the country's cultural heritage."

      "text": "Party leaders are focusing their campaign activities on helping victims of land erosion The people of Ramgoti and Kamalnagar upazilas of Lakshmipur 4 constituency, near the banks of the Meghna River, have been struggling through natural disasters like flood and land erosion for the last few years. Thousands from this region batle with nature for their daily livelihoods. With the election ahead, to gain the support of the voters, candidates have focused their electoral campaigns on development work that will reduce the suffering of those affected by land erosion.  Candidates from the two major parties, the Awami League and BNP, and other heavyweight political individuals, have increased their contact with senior central leaders in the hopes of securing a nomination. At the same time, they are going door-to-door, asking for the public's votes. The main election battle in the Lakshmipur 4 constituency will ensue between the candidates of the Awami League-led 14-party alliance and BNP-led 20-party alliance.  Candidates from Awami League, BNP, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Jasa and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have started campaigning by attending different meetings and seminars. They have also started promoting themselves on banners and posters. Jasad, AL The first person to hoist the flag of independent Bangladesh, President of central Jasad ASM Abdur Rob was once elected as an opposition leader during the Ershad-led government. He became a minister under the Awami League government after winning the seat in the seventh election in 1996. Rob will participate in the coming election as well. However, in the 10th election held in 2014, Md Abdullah Al Mamun - the current MP from this constituency - won representing the Awami League.  Since then, Abdullah has been working towards the development of Ramgoti and Kamalnagar upazilas. The first phase of a 5.5km embankment project - approved by Ecnec and worth Tk1,349 crore - was eventually completed at a total cost of Tk2,000 crore.  Recently, during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to Lakshmipur, Abdullah got the approval for the allocation of the budget required to complete the second phase of the project.   Talking to the Dhaka Tribune, Md Abdullah Al Mamun said: \"The people from this region mainly demand steps be taken to prevent land erosion. To this end, the Awami League government has already finished the first phase of a project by spending Tk2,000 crore--and has promised to start the work on the second phase.\" Abdullah stated that the development that the Lakshmipur 4 constituency has achieved during the Awami League regime had not been achieved in the last 40 years prior. \"I had stayed, and will stay beside the people from this region,\" he said. Abdullah has been working with leaders and activists from each union and ward, of the Ramgoti and Kamalnagar upazilas, to ensure victory for Awami League, he told this correspondent. \"If I am nominated, I am certain of my victory,\" he said.  Another hopeful candidate, Managing Secretary for Relief and Disaster Management of central Awami League Faridunnahar Laili, is from Noakhali Sadar upazila. A freedom fighter, Laili is the former MP for the constituency's seat reserved for women.  \"I have been engaged in politics since I was a student,\" Laili told the Dhaka Tribune. \"I was twice elected as the vice-president of Shamsunnahar Hall in Chittagong University, and formerly represented this constituency, from the reserved seat for women, in Ramgoti upazila.\" Laili said the people of Ramgoti upazila want her to clinch a nomination, and if the prime minister thinks she is worthy of one, she will run for election this time around as well. The other Awami League candidates hoping to get a nomination are: Azad Uddin Chowdhury, locally known as the \"landless leader\"; Vice-President of Lakshmipur district Awami League Advocate Mahbubur Rahman; Joint General Secretary of Dhaka city Jubo League (North) Md Tabirul Haque Onu; and Deputy Secretary of Awami League Sports Committee Abu Zaher Saju. BNP This year, twice-elected MP and central BNP leader Ashraf Uddin Nizam is hoping to secure a BNP nomination. \"The people of Lakshmipur know about my honesty and capability,\" he said while speaking to the Dhaka Tribune. \"I have broken all previous records in developing the roads and infrastructure of Lakshmipur. Even now, I am thinking about helping the victims of land erosion.\" Nizam is prioritizing his efforts in fighting the cases lodged against 5,390 BNP leaders and activists.  \"If BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia or acting chairman Tarique Rahman thinks I am worthy, they will nominate me, so I can continue working for the betterment of both party and the people,\" he said.  Another BNP nomination-seeker, central President of Sechchasebak Dal Shafiul Bari Babu said he is working to recover the democracy envisioned by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia. \"I was involved with Chhatra Dal politics in my student life,\" he told this correspondent. \"After acting as the president of Dhaka University Chhatra Dal and the organizational secretary of the central committee, I am now serving as its general secretary.\"   He hoped that his desire to recover democracy by participating in the next election will secure him a nomination for the Lakshmipur 4 constituency. Meanwhile, Vice-President of Tati Dal Abdul Matin Chowdhury, another hopeful candidate of BNP, has established mosques and madrasas, and helped distribute aid among those who have lost everything due to land erosion. \"There have been 30 cases falsely lodged against me in Dhaka, but I am still continuing my political career,\" he said. \"I am hopeful my efforts will be recognized by the party, and I will be given a nomination.\"  "

Some of our relatives have already died. So, we ran away from there,\" said Salma Khatun, a Rohingya woman.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Groups like Hefazat and Jamaat are slowly starting to lose significance in politics Earlier this month, as the coalitions for the upcoming battle on December 30 took more solid shapes, a curious feature became apparent. There are about 70 Islamist political parties in Bangladesh, 63 of them are now with the Awami League-led coalition, while only five are part of BNP-led alliance. The massive irony of religious parties flocking under the wings of the \"protector\" of secularism in Bangladesh, could not escape even the most obtuse. However, as the popular saying goes, it's not how many Islamist parties you have got, it's about which Islamists you have. Once again there is the gnashing of teeth, rending of garments from the usual suspects about the fact that BNP has given nominations to leaders of Jamaat. Once again, BNP acted as the last shelter of evils that stand between Bangladesh and all that is good. However, the massive gathering of Islamic parties under the ruling regime generated furious alarms in the sincerer quarters also. They are regarding this as a definite sign of the inexorable Islamization of politics and society. The mullahs are not just coming, they're here. I think that political developments in recent years in Bangladesh, and also in the Muslim world, are showing that political Islam is not a rising tide but may be an ebbing flood past its peak. Shafi Huzur and Hefazat accepting the patronship of the ruling party and joining the coalition show that ambition of madrassa-based organizations has remained at the bread and butter level. They do not aspire to take charge of the large and complex polity, of whose gears and levers they have little understanding. Jamaat, the Islamic organization that has ambition of achieving reigning power one day near or distant, is now a shell of its former self. The braggadocious Jamaat of the 90s and early 00s, when it claimed that the dedication and professionalism of its members made Jamaat sui generis of political organizations in Bangladesh, is no more. Its pantheon of top leadership has been annihilated, the vaunted member-base couldn't do anything to stop it despite suffering grievously in all-out efforts. Jamaat rank and file are confused, shell-shocked still. Obtaining state power, always a long-term ambition, has been postponed indefinitely into the future.  Nothing could display the inherent disarray of Islamic forces within Bangladesh more starkly than the chaotic-but-deadly clash of Tablig factions that occurred on the first of December. Tablig, which was mostly known for its detachment in this world in preparation for the next, showed that it can be as scrappy as any other organization when fighting over worldly possessions. All these recent incidents only underscore the fact that nobody in Bangladesh regards political Islam ready for taking up governance any time soon.   In this age, one cannot separate the domestic from the international, especially for movements with global pretentions like political Islam. Internationally, we are also witnessing an ebbing of Islam's march on political power. In Egypt, brutal state repression has broken and scattered the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), the global organization with which Jamaat have a long-standing affinity.  It's not that MB is going away in Egypt or in other Arab countries, it is still the main non-government political organization in most of these countries. It is that MB supporters throughout the middle east and the world are introspecting why the suppression of the organization was so successful. Why they couldn't raise a groundswell of popular support for them and against the traditional rulers. In Tunisia, the main Islamist party, Ennahda, has compromised so much on secular governance that it is hardly distinguishable from a mainstream conservative party, rather than a political Islam project. In Turkey, the Erdogan regime is increasingly transforming into strongman populism rather than embarking on political Islam.  A common theme behind the evolution and current state of MB and all affiliated organizations in various countries is that, while they invested decades in developing organizational and theological support, they did not invest in developing any form of \"governance thinking.\" More honesty, more justice, more welfare, these platitudes do not make coherent political and economic thoughts capable of dealing with the modern world. Unlike capitalism, liberalism, East-Asian authoritarianism, or even populist nationalism, political Islam has not yet been able to present successful governance systems. No rational leader or thinker in the Muslim world try to inspire fellow countrymen. There is no denying that religion is becoming more important and influential in Muslim societies all over the world. However, political organizations are discovering that support for religious principles and identities do not automatically translate in to support for religious politics, policies, and organizations. Most Muslims, in the modern world, also generally render unto Caesar things that are Caesar's, and unto Church the things that are Church's. This article has so far been full of gross generalizations. After Fukuyama's debacle, no one should be unaware of how tenuous it is to extrapolate current trends into long-term projections.  However, it is not shaky to argue that institutionalizing Islamic organizations into regular politics, particularly when they are weak and small, is a better way for the development of Muslim polity than excluding them or confining them into unconventional politics. Political organizations don't just dabble in politics -- politics also make them. The crucial thing is the way of doing politics.  Shafiqur Rahman is a political scientist."

She was on the phone and had just learned that her father, who she had not seen for 18 years, was no more.\nHe remembers how heartbroken she was, not able to see him one last time. For Nayim, then a college sophomore studying Biology and hoping to pursue a career in medicine, the morning was \"a turning point in life.\"\nNayim's family had made a tough choice when it moved to the US from Bangladesh on a visitors visa stayed on as undocumented immigrants. It was a one-way ticket with the hope for a better future.\n\"I remember feeling very guilty after realizing that all her sacrifice may not amount to anything. Without documents, I still won't be able to achieve that American Dream my parents had for us,\" he says.\nHe says that moment of feeling \"helpless and powerless\" propelled him to speak out without being afraid and become a community organizer.\nHe earned a degree in Biology and now works full-time as a community organizer with Desis Rising Up and Moving (DRUM), an organization focusing on immigrant rights of the South Asian community in New York City.\nThis was possible because of an Obama-era programme -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA -- that allowed nearly 700,000 immigrants, who came to the US illegally as children, to stay and work legally.\nPresident Trump has rescinded that programme and asked the Congress to find a legislative solution by March 5, failing which people like Nayim may have to return to the countries they came from or go back to living in the shadows.\nWhile the majority of the DACA recipients, also known as \"dreamers\", are from Latin American countries, at least 2,640 are from India and 490 are from Bangladesh. Nayim says the actual numbers of South Asians is much higher but because of the stigma and shame attached to being undocumented, a lot of people did not come forward.\nAlso, he says, a large number of South Asian community members did not apply for DACA because they were concerned about sharing information about the whole family with the government.\nDespite the risks, DACA changed lives for the better.\nNayim says the first time he got on a plane after coming to the US was after DACA. Many people were able to fly back to their home countries to see their families. It was only after DACA that people like him with college degrees could get \"on-the-book\" jobs.\nTrump's order has put not only that freedom at risk but also left the families worried because once DACA is cancelled, they do not know what the administration will do with the information they have about undocumented families.\n\"We do not have a choice but to fight,'' Nayim says, adding, \"even DACA was not given to us by President Obama without a fight.\"\nNow, along with several other Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Indians, he spends his time organizing rallies, putting pressure on lawmakers and mobilizing the South Asian community to come out.\nA recent poll found that 83% of Americans and 67% Republicans support allowing immigrant young people to remain in the US under the DACA programme.\nBut there are also many who say the government should abolish it once and for all so that in future nobody takes immigration laws lightly.\nResponding to the concerns, Nayim says: \"Leaving home and family for 20-30 years is not a choice someone makes easily or for fun. Most of the time, they do it for survival.\"\nDemocrats are threatening a government shutdown from this Friday, the deadline to pass the federal spending budget if no agreement is reached before that.\nThe Trump administration has been pushing for funding for a wall along the Mexican border in return for DACA. And so despite the looming shutdown, no deal seems to be in sight for now.\nThis article was first published in banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "The four semi-finalists - Palestine, Tajikistan, Philippines and host Bangladesh - arrived in the city Sunday afternoon after concluding the group-round fixtures in Sylhet Cox's Bazar is almost ready to host international football after eight years as the two semi-finals of the Bangabandhu Gold Cup are all set to be held on consecutive days at the oldest stadium of the district named after Bir Sreshtha Ruhul Amin. The four semi-finalists - Palestine, Tajikistan, Philippines and host Bangladesh - arrived in the city Sunday afternoon after concluding the group-round fixtures in Sylhet. It was learnt from a quick visit to the venue that the stadium has the capacity of making arrangement for not more than 10,000 spectators. The number is too small compared to Sylhet District Stadium that hosted more than their capacity of 30,000 during Bangladesh's final group stage match against Philippines Friday. The people of Cox's Bazar are eagerly waiting to watch Bangladesh's semi-final against favourite Palestine Wednesday.  Host Bangladesh put up a brave and dominating display but yet conceded a narrow 1-0 defeat against a much higher-ranked Philippines side in their final Group B match of the Bangabandhu Gold Cup at the jam-packed Sylhet District Stadium Friday evening.https://t.co/46EHiUAGag#BFF Sylhet District Sports Association vice-president Bijon Barua, also a BFF executive member, informed that giant screens will be set outside the stadium to meet the demand of deprived crowds. The stadium, situated at the heart of the city and less than two kilometers east of the world's largest sea beach, was built in 1956 through initiatives taken by renowned scholar and archaeologist Abul Kalam Mohammed Zakaria.  The revered scholar was posted as SDO in Cox's Bazar during that period, but instead of receiving funds from erstwhile Pakistan government, the local people spontaneously contributed in raising the funds. The locality had been popularly known as Stadium Para since then.   Popularly known as Cox's Bazar Stadium, the venue was renovated three years ago with the former two-storey main building converted to four-storey and new single row gallery was also built on the eastern side but it is still not enough.  The Sylhet District Stadium the venue for group games of Bangabandhu Gold Cup, would be remembered for an unreal scene four years ago when spectators broke the gate to get inside the venue during a friendly between the U23 teams of Bangladesh & Nepal.https://t.co/Z2qzLrkM9p#BFF The local organisers have been asking for expanding the gallery, installing flood-lights and building a gym for a long time but those pleas fell into deaf ears. Last time an international match or tournament was held in the venue was back in 2010 during the inaugural Saff Women's Championship.  After that the home matches of Chittagong Abahani Limited in the Bangladesh Premier League were held for only a season.  The venue usually hosts cricket and volleyball events as well, along with its outer field on the south-western corner used for indoor events like karate, taekwondo and wushu among others. Cox's Bazar DSA football secretary Rashed Hossain Nannu also informed that the procedure of preparing the venue for hosting the two vital fixtures of Bangabandhu Gold Cup began on September 22, a day after the end of the district round matches of Bangabandhu Gold Cup U-17 Football Tournament.  Through a rally, a motorcycle showdown and a band party, a group of around 500 fans of home boy Biplo Ahmed continued to fill the south-western gallery of the Sylhet District Stadium during Bangladesh's second Gold Cup group match against Philippines.https://t.co/HBVDdIb1Ha#BFF The preparation continued till Sunday. Bijon talked about their final touch of the preparation.  \"The preparation is 80% done with two days left, mostly the ground works. The main problem for us now is preparing the two practice venues. The recent rain harmed the grounds. We got only 15 days, we tried our best but I'm happy with the preparation so far,\" said Bijon. He added, \"Hope it will catch the attention during the two international matches that Cox's Bazar football deserves more. The stadium badly needs an upgrade. To start with, we need a gallery, flood-lights and a gym at least.\" Meanwhile, Philippines and Tajikistan face each other in the first semi-final Tuesday before Bangladesh take on top-ranked Palestine the following day. It will be the first time that men's international football matches will be held in Cox's Bazar."

Sports personalities Abdul Gaffer, Satyajit Das Rupu, and Badal Ray also joined the campaign. Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader, speaking as the chief guest, said: \"The response for Boat from the general public seems like 1971. The participation of the cultural personalities added a new dimension to the campaign for the polls. The defeated forces of '71 will be the losers in the upcoming election, because of the participation of the masses.\"Prominent actors Mahfuz Ahmed and Zahid Hasan endorse the Awami League during an election campaign at Dhaka's Central Shaheed Minar on December 13, 2018 | Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune Referring to the campaign as a matter of spirit and passion, he said: \"This consciousness has come here because of emotional values. Awami League will be the winner in the next election.\"  He called for the people to avoid the defeated power of 1971 as they can't win the elections in 2018. Distinguished playwright Hasan Imam, speaking on behalf of the artists present, said: \"We are always on the side of Awami League, because Awami League favours the freedom fighters. In addition, the struggles of artists began with the political struggles in 1971. The artists played a vital role in the Liberation War.\" Awami League Publication Secretary Dr Hasan Mahmud was also present at the program. The day's program at the Shahid Minar began with the national anthem. Later, a documentary on the various development activities of the government in the last 10 years was screened.

      "text": "The constituency is considered an Awami League stronghold Madaripur 1 constituency consists of 19 unions and one municipality.  It is known as Awami League's vote bank and comprises a total of 238,523 voters.  Despite the ruling party possessing a large vote bank, and a stronghold, in the area, they will face tough resistance from BNP. Local BNP supporters believe that they are prepared to infiltrate Awami League's vote bank. According to them, if the election is free and fair, BNP's candidate will surely win. MP Nur-E-Alam Chowdhury Liton is Awami League's sole candidate for this seat. In contrast, six people have bought nomination forms from BNP; to contest in the upcoming general polls for Madaripur 1 constituency. Meanwhile, with sole nomination-aspirants, for both Jatiya Party and Islami Andolon Bangladesh, are campaigning in the area. Awami League going solo Incumbent lawmaker and Awami League Parliamentary Committee General Secretary Nur-e-Alam Chowdhury Liton, is the likeliest candidate to receive Awami League's nomination. He is the eldest son of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's paternal brother--the late Ilias Ahmed Chowdhury. He has been elected as a Member of Parliament five times from 1996-2014-- and has extensively developed the Shibchar area. Nur-e-Alam Chowdhury said: \"I belong to a political family. I grew up being the politics of Awami League. I have worked in every union and ward-level committee of Awami League in my constituency. Development has touched every corner of Shibchar. I would like to finish the remaining list of development for Shibchar using the boat symbol in the upcoming general polls.\" Several BNP candidates  Shibchar's BNP is divided into two factions.  One group is led by Acting President Yazem Hossain Roman. Acting President Zaman Kamal Nuruddin Mollah leads the other faction. They both conduct party activities separately in the constituency. However, Zaman has bought BNP's nomination form to contest in Dhaka 17 constituency. Shibchar Upazila BNP acting president Yajjam Hossain Roman and the remaining 5 nominees are fighting to secure the party's nomination to contest in the upcoming general election. They are: Shibchar upazila BNP acting President Yajjam Hossain Roman, present Central Chatra Dal Vice-President Md Abdul Hannan Mia, late BNP leader Nazmul Huda Chowdhury's wife Nadira Mithu Chowdhury Dhuri, district BNP member Sajjad Hossain Siddiqui Lavlu, former Shibchar thana BNP President Abu Zafar Chowdhury, and Dhaka Demra BNP leader Rob Hawlader. Nomination-aspirant Yajjam said: \"I have been involved with BNP's politics since my student days. I am conducting rallies and have started my election campaign in every ward with regard to almost all the local BNP leaders and activists. If the party decides to nominate me, I will make sure that BNP wins this seat in the upcoming general election.\" Another BNP nomination-aspirant, Sajjad, said: \"I have been working quietly with grassroots-level local BNP activists and supporters. I am quite confident that I will be nominated. If the election is fair and free then BNP will win for sure.\" Abdul said: \"I bought BNP's nomination form to contest for Madaripur 1 constituency. Hopefully, the party will nominate me so that I can gift our party a win from this constituency.\" Meanwhile, Nadira is also working hard to secure BNP's nomination. She said: \"I have been campaigning in Shibchar for the general polls. I have distributed relief among the flood-affected people in the area--from my private funds. I am quite confident of winning if I am nominated by the party. I will work for the development of the area unlike anyone ever has.\" Other parties Jatiya Party's young leader, Madaripur district Jatiya Party Vice-President Jahirul Islam Mintu, is also campaigning for the upcoming 11th parliament election.  He has participated in multiple party activities--including meetings with senior party leaders and activists in the upazila.  Despite him being very young, he is on the party's list of prospective candidates as he has been working relentlessly for the local people of Madaripur. Concurrently, Madaripur District Islami Andolon Bangladesh Committee has declared Hafiz Zafar Ahmed as their candidate for the upcoming general polls. He is the president of the party's Shibchar upazila committee."

We will take necessary steps after the investigation.\"\nQuite recently, an angry mob of students inside the Banmali Ganguly Hostel gave Jhumur a beating after she threatened and beat up a few students.\nLater, she was thrown out from the dorm by the mob, which included the six aforementioned students.\nLater, according to students, Jhumur, with the help of some top Chhatra League leaders in the college, persuaded the college authorities to kick the six out of their dorm.\nMeanwhile, students of the college were infuriated by the move and took to social media platforms to heavily criticize the college authorities.\n\n\n\n\n"

A 60-70 foot section of the embankment failed on Sunday afternoon, causing the flooding. Locals have expressed fears that the next tidal surge could cause the flood to worsen. Local UP chairman Abu Hena Shakil said the embankment was already at risk, and despite the BWDB being notified, they took no action. \"As a result of the recent new moon, the current of the Kholpetua river increased greatly. This has already caused a number of problems, such as trapping 50 families and causing hundreds of fish enclosures to be inundated. If the embankment is not repaired quickly, the flood will get more severe over time,\" he added.  \"Seeing the state of the dam and the nonchalance of the authorities, locals tried to repair the dam itself. However, despite a monumental effort, the embankment failed after a great surge in the afternoon,\" Shakil said. The UP chairman also said: \"No one from BWDB has inspected the area yet, but a contractor has been hired and repairs are supposed to begin after the new moon.\" Assasuni Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Maffara Tasnin said: \"We have asked the district administration to assist in the repair of the dam, and it will be done soon.\""

The funds will be disbursed through the Korea International Cooperation Agency (Koica), the government's organization for delivering assistance to developing countries, read a joint press release by WFP and Koica. The Building Resilience to Achieve Zero Hunger (BRAZH) initiative aims to reach over 4,000 families living in flood-prone areas, in the Kurigram Sadar and Chilmari sub-districts of Kurigram district, in the northwest of the country from 2018 to 2021. WFP, with the help of Koica, will be able to pilot a series of innovative approaches to resilience-building, including micro-insurance products to protect smallholder farmers and day labourers; forecast-based financing models to disburse aid before a predicted weather disasters; and seasonal livelihood planning to develop climate-resilience options. These activities will be conducted in close partnership with the Bangladeshi Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, the Department of Disaster Management, local government, as well as national and international technical institutes. This partnership with Koica follows the successful implementation of the three-year Saemaul Zero Hunger Community Project from 2014 to 2017 with a contribution of US$3 million. For this project, communities engaged in disaster risk-reduction work received cash grants and allowances to build their economic resilience. \"These activities were designed based on the Saemaul Undong principle of self-help, diligence, and cooperation--with participation and contribution based on Korea's community development experience,\" said Koica Country Director for Bangladesh Joe Hyungue. Koica was established as a government-funded agency dedicated to grant aid programs in April 1991. The organization strives to combat poverty and support the sustainable socio-economic growth of developing countries--based on core values of promoting peace, people, and prosperity."

It was part of a session, titled \"Health and Migration,\" of the inaugural day of the 4th Annual Gobeshona Conference for Research on Climate Change in Bangladesh (Gobeshona 4), organised by the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD).\nThe four-day conference is being held at Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB).\n\nAlso Read- Experts: Haor regions need short-duration rice varieties to avoid crop damage in flash flood\n\nAnother presentation by Mohammad Mahbubur Rahman, a fellow of Gobeshona Young Researchers Program-2017, noted that growth in the urban population caused by internal migration can cause further issues such as increased contamination of water.\nEarlier, during the inaugural session, Executive Director of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS) Dr Atiq Rahman emphasized taking up quality research on climate science for higher adaptability to the threats of global warming.\n\"Ten years ago, nobody believed solar energy would be possible, but the solar industry in Bangladesh has since gone to become one of the biggest in the world. It's necessary to connect climate science researchers to the policymakers and recognise that the private sector also plays an important role. But their focus is split between people, planet and profit,\" Atiq observed.\nVice-chancellor of IUB, Dr M Omar Rahman said that research required for innovative solutions to complex problems.\n\"Developing countries face a problem of not having a culture of research and lacking the infrastructure of research. Often thought the way we teach young researchers is quite archaic,\" said Dr M Omar Rahman.\nThe inaugural session's keynote speaker, Institute for Research into Superdiversity (IRIS)Research Fellow Dr Alice Baillat Elsa Helene, said that Bangladesh, on the one hand, is depicted as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and, on the other hand, as one of the champions of adaptations.\nTerming Bangladesh as \"Weak Power Climate Leader,\" Dr Alice Baillat Elsa Helene said, \"The concept of weak power pushes us to change our perception of vulnerable countries that are far from being only victims, but also active players of the fight against climate change.\"\n\"Bangladesh has been the first least developed country to frame a comprehensive climate change strategy and action plan, national climate fund in 2009,\" she said, adding that vulnerability has been a fertile ground for innovation and experimentation where Bangladesh has acquired a \"first mover advantage\" in being the first to develop adaptation and disaster risk reduction policies.\nIn the opening speech of the inauguration programme, Director of ICCCAD, Dr Saleemul Huq, introduced Gobeshona as a knowledge-based platform, and explained how it brings together scientists, researchers and policymakers.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "All flights to and from London's City Airport were cancelled on Monday after an unexploded World War II bomb weighing half a tonne was found buried in silt in the River Thames. Police said they expected the bomb at George V Dock in east London would be removed by early Tuesday, having set up a 200-metre exclusion zone after the ordnance was found during work at the airport on Sunday. The Metropolitan Police said properties within the exclusion zone had been evacuated and a number of roads were cordoned off. \"The timing of removal is dependent on the tides, however, at this stage we estimate that the removal of the device from location will be completed by tomorrow morning,\" police said in a statement, adding the shell was lying in a bed of dense silt. London City Airport is the city's fifth biggest and is popular with business travellers. It is London's most central international airport and is close to major financial districts in the City of London and Canary Wharf.  The docklands area of London's East End was a trading hub in the 1940s and was heavily bombed by German planes in World War Two. The airport was opened in 1987 as part of the broader regeneration of the area. The airport told passengers not to travel there on Monday. Regional airline CityJet said its flights from the airport had been rescheduled to land and take off from London Southend airport, while Italy's Alitalia said it would operate flights from London Stansted airport. British Airways said it was trying to minimise disruption for passengers and said in a statement: \"We are rebooking customers due to travel today onto alternative flights or offering refunds for those who no longer wish to travel.\" "

All of the big parties have multiple prospective candidates for Sherpur 2, which consists of two upazilas: Nokla and Nalitabari. Nokla upazila has 151,386 registered voters across 10 unions, and 67 voting centers with 302 voting booths. Nalitabari upazila has 197,458 registers voters across 10 unions and one municipality. It has 72 voting centers with 408 voting booths. The ruling party has three prospective candidates in this constituency.  They are Awami League Presidium Member and present MP Matia Chowdhury, former Krishok League leader and upazila Vice-Chairman Badiuzzaman Badsha, and upazila Awami League General Secretary Moksedur Rahman Lebu. According to locals, Matia Chowdhury, because of her honesty and transparency, is the most popular candidate of the three and they expect her to win in the upcoming general polls. Matia Chowdhury was first elected in 1991 for this constituency. She was re-elected MP in the 1996 national elections, though lost by a very close margin to her BNP counterpart late Jahed Ali Chowdhury in the 2001 general polls.  Between 2008 and 2014, she again served as the constituency's lawmaker. Badiuzzaman Badsha, who was a rebel candidate of the ruling party during the 10th general polls, said he would be guided by the people this time.  \"My decision to participate as a rebel candidate in the 11th general polls depends on my supporters,\" he said. Meanwhile, from Jatiya Party, zila Jatiya Party leader Md Shawkat Saeed and Jatiya Cultural Party Central Committee Member Kazi Roji Siddique are seeking the party's nomination. For BNP, the party's upazila Joint General Convener and Central Committee Member Fahim Chowdhury, BNP Chairperson's Advisor Barrister M Haider Ali, former student leader of Chatra Dal Rashid Shemol, and zila BNP Joint General Convener and Nalitabari upazila Chairman AKM Mokhlesur Rahman Ripon are in the running for the nomination. AKM Mokhlesur Rahman Ripon is quite confident about being nominated as he won the previous upazila parishad elections against a heavyweight ruling party candidate, despite being a rebel candidate of  BNP. The locals of Sherpur 2 constituency are expecting a close fight between the top two parties, Awami League and BNP."

      "text": "\nCCC to use vetiver grass to ease waterlogging, slope erosion\n\n\n\n\nAnwar Hussain, Chittagong\n\n\n\n\n Published at 02:30 am February 24th, 2018\n\n\n Last updated at 02:31 am February 24th, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe Chittagong City Corporation (CCC) has undertaken numerous projects for years to address chronic waterlogging problem of the port city but its efforts have yet to yield any significant outcome.\nTo make matters worse, around one-third of the port city goes under water during every monsoon even after a little rainfall.\nTo address the issue, three successive mayors of the CCC have already spent around Tk324 crore in the last 14 years.\nAgainst this backdrop, the corporation has now come up with an unconventional and low-cost approach to deal with the longstanding problem. It plans to plant vetiver grass that helps reduce soil erosion on steep slopes of hills.\nAs part of the pilot project of vetiver grass plantation, the authorities are now planning to cover the four major hills of the port city with vetiver grass, locally known as \"Binna\" grass, to control slope erosion.\nVetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides), a clumping grass without stolons or rhizomes, is known for its ability to reduce siltation and stabilize soil. Its non-fertile seeds ensure that the plants will not spread beyond where they are planted. Engineers liken the vetiver root to a \"living soil nail\" with an average tensile strength (used to describe the extent to which something can stretch without breaking) of 1/6 mild steel. The deep root system makes vetiver extremely drought tolerant and difficult to dislodge.\n\nCCC Chief Engineer Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed told the Dhaka Tribune that initially four hills - Burma Haji Pahar, Khulshi Pahar, and hills on both sides of Tigerpass intersection - have been earmarked for vetiver grass plantations.\n\"The port city's water congestion is inseparably connected with soil erosion from the hills. Indiscriminate deforestation, hill cutting and unplanned human settlements result in massive soil erosion. Following torrential rainfall, the soil eroded from the hills clog up the drains and nearby water bodies and trigger water stagnation in the city,\" he said.\nIf the pilot project yields positive results the corporation will send a project proposal to the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives, he added.\nAccording to experts, when a raindrop falls, it is usually absorbed into the pore spaces of the soil. But when the pore spaces become saturated (full), the raindrops will either remain on the surface as puddle or flow downhill. As the water flows downhill, it carries with it soil particles and other materials, which is called erosion.\nMd Rashidul Hasan, assistant professor at the department of urban and regional planning of Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET), told the Dhaka Tribune that unlike other parts of the country, the hills of Chittagong region constitute of crumbling soil and become vulnerable after a heavy rainfall if the surface is not covered with vegetation.\n\"The soil becomes heavy after absorbing rainwater and the steep slopes cannot bear the mass weight of the wet soil or mud, resulting in landslides.\"\nThe less vegetative (plant) cover and leaf material on the ground, the more open the soil will be to the runoff water. Slope erosion can therefore be prevented by protecting the soil surface with some form of cover and controlling runoff before it develops into an erosive force.\nProf Dr Md Shariful Islam of Department of Civil Engineering, BUET, who is providing technical assistance to the CCC in this regard, said that vetiver is a miracle grass. It is being used as an efficient bio-technology for slope protection in many countries for its special attributes like longer life, strong and finely structured root system, and high tolerance of extreme climatic conditions.\n\"It has been used in many tropical countries for being a simple and economical method to conserve soil by slowing the velocity of water and stabilizing steep slopes. The grass can survive extreme weather conditions ranging from -14 degree Celcius to 55 degree Celsius,\" said Prof Islam who has been conducting a research on vetiver for over a decade.\n\"The extremely deep and massively thick root system of vetiver binds the soil and at the same time makes it very difficult for it to be dislodged under high velocity water flows. This deep and fast growing root system also makes vetiver drought tolerant and highly suitable for steep slope stabilization,\" he further said.\n\"Vetiver grass is available in Bangladesh. The grass can grow in both silt and clay types of soil. Apart from saline soil, the grass can even grow in heavy metal contaminated soil. It is not a weed. This grass is non-competitive with adjacent crops and cost-effective. So, vetiver grass plantation could be a sustainable, green, and cheaper bio-engineering solution to slope protection,\" said Prof Islam.\nAminul Hoque Chowdhury, deputy director of Department of Agricultural Extension, Chittagong said that vetiver grass is used as a cover crop (crop grown for the protection and enrichment of the soil) all over the world.\n\n\"The concept is quite new in our country. If the rate of nutrient and water uptake is higher by vetiver grass, then it might affect other plants. So we have to be careful in this regard,\" said the agriculturist.\nProf Dr Md Al Amin said that any type of vegetation slows down the runoff velocity.\n\"Vetiver grass is one of the tried and tested methods all over the world for slope stabilization. We should also adopt approaches like bolting system to reduce slope failures,\" said Prof Amin who teaches at the Institute of Forestry & Environmental Sciences (IFES) of Chittagong University.\nCCC Mayor AJM Nasir Uddin said that they were considering planting vetiver grass to stop erosion.\n\"Hill cutting should be stopped, othrwise vetiver grass plantataion will be of no use,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n"

Last year rice production fell due to a devastating haor flashflood and rice blast attacks.\nIn 2018-19 MY, which begins with the harvesting of Boro, the production of rice is forecast to exceed the government's target, stated the USDA report, as farmers increased cultivation areas with an expectation of good prices, and to recoup the Boro and Aman production losses from the previous year.\n\"Farmers have switched to Boro rice from wheat and potato cultivation as they attempt to avoid loss from wheat blast and the lower price of potato. The government's procurement price of Boro and Aman paddy [unhusked] and rice [milled] of last year offers an opportunity to get good prices for this season's Boro rice,\" said USDA.\nHowever, USDA noted, farmers' expectation of a higher price may be dampened if production is higher as expected and imports continue to follow the pace of the last few months. \"As highly fluctuating husked rice price is mostly controlled by millers, past experience indicates that millers manage to keep the paddy purchase price lower through imports of more rice [husked] before the harvest season.\"\nUSDA estimated that rice imports will fall to 0.8 million MT in 2018-19 MY, comparing it to an estimated 3.6 million MT in 2017-18 MY, due to higher domestic production backed by favourable weather conditions.\nThe rice import estimate is revised upward to 3.6 million MT in 2017-18 MY due to increased imports to fill the supply shortfall caused by the previous year's devastating flood and the application of a 2% import tariff.\nAccording to the Ministry of Food, from July, 2017 to March, 2018, total rice imports were a little over 3.5 million MT. Of these, over 0.95 million MT has been imported by the government while the rest by private traders. This is the highest ever rice import in Bangladesh while the previous highest record stood at 3 million MT during the 1998-99 financial year.\nAround 67% of Bangladesh's cultivated land area is used for rice production. A study by the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) reported that in the period 1990-91 to 2016-17, adoption of modern varieties (MV) increased area by 11% in Boro, 246% in Aus and 135% in Aman season rice.\nAlthough government has a long term plan to reduce Boro rice area and increase Aus and Aman rice production, the yield of Boro rice is still dominant in producing 54% higher yield than Aus and 40% higher than Aman.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "Tk1.79cr distributed among erosion victims The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved a proposal to protect Zajira and Naria upazilas of Shariatpur district from river erosion at a cost of Tk1,077.58 crore. The committee at a meeting, with Finance Minister AMA Muhith in the chair, gave the go-ahead to the proposal placed by Water Resources Ministry, official sources said, reports BSS. Under the proposal, the contract will be handed over to Bangladesh Navy-run Khulna Shipyard for implementation of the project to protect 8.90km of riverbank in the upazilas, that includes dredging and construction of ferry terminals. The approval came at a time when thousands have been rendered homeless by the scourge of the Padma in the two upazilas over the past three months. The government has so far distributed nearly Tk1.79 crore in cash and 5,952 bundles of corrugated Iron (CI) sheets among 5,081 families affected by the Padma erosion in the district this year. Earlier, the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry allocated Taka 1,81,50,000 for the district as house building grants along with 6,050 bundles of CI sheet. Under the scheme each erosion affected family will get cash Tk3000 along with a bundle of CI sheet. Additionally, the government has distributed 675 tons of rice and Tk52 lakh in cash as gratuitous relief (GR) among the river erosion victims of Noria, Zajira, and Bhedorganj upazilas of the district in the current year, said officials.  Disaster Management and Relief (DM&R) Minister, Mofazzal Hossen Chowdhury Maya, while visiting Naria upazila on September 18, said, \"The government under Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) program will distribute rice among 5,081 erosion affected families till December 31.\"  Project Implementation Officer (PIO) of the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry of Zajira upazila, Shawpan Matubbar, said that in Naria, the government has distributed 5,000 bundles of CI sheet and Tk1.50 crore as house building assistance among 5,000 erosion victim families. Apart from this, the government has distributed 609.72 tons of VGF rice among the erosion affected families,where each family will get 30 kg of rice in a month till December, along with 14,000 packets of dry food, said the official. Meanwhile, the government has allocated a total of 18,000 packets of dry food for erosion affected poor families,each packet containing five kg of rice, one kg pulses, one kg sugar, one kg flattened rice, 500 grams of puffed rice, 1-kg edible oil, and a box of matches. A vast area with about 200 buildings, including hospitals, clinics, mosques, temples, and business houses in Naria, has been eroded as the mighty Padma continues to devour its right bank in the district, leaving hundreds of people homeless. River erosion in Naria and Zajira upazilas of the district has been occurring in the rainy season for the last several years. But this time, erosion by the Padma has taken a serious turn. The locals said over 20 square kilometres of land in Naria have been eroded in the last three years. This year the erosion began some two and a half months ago, but the severe erosion began on September 3 and it is still continuing, they added."

      "authors": "Nawaz Farhin Antara",
      "text": "Four parties, including BNP, come together, demanding an impartial government for the national polls Amid many speculations, a new political alliance called Jatiya Oikya Front, led by eminent jurist Dr Kamal Hossain, was formed on Saturday with major opposition BNP as one of its members. As its members, Dr Kamal's Gono Forum, BNP, ASM Abdur Rab-led Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) and Mahmudur Rahman Manna-led Nagorik Oikya have announced to work towards shared political goals aimed at ensuring free and fair voting in the 11th general election. The alliance, however, does not include Bikalpadhara Bangladesh or its President AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury-led Juktofront, which had initially brought together the aforementioned four parties, showing growing signs of rifts among the political groups. Dr Kamal announced the new coalition at a press conference held at the National Press Club in Dhaka on Saturday evening. He said: \"We are forging the unity in the interest of the 160 million people of the country, not to protect the interest of any party.\" \"The call for national unity has been made on behalf of millions of citizens. The new alliance has two partners of Juktofront as well. I expect the others to join the unity process.\" He emphasized taking the unity process to district and upazila levels to achieve success. \"This unity will form a peaceful government through the elections by suppressing the autocrats.\" Dr Kamal said the alliance would continue its movement till its demands and visions were met and agreed upon by the government. He hoped that Bikalpadhara would also join the new alliance. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, JSD President ASM Abdur Rab, Nagorik Oikya Convener Mahmudur Rahman Manna, Gonoshasthaya Kendra Founder Zafrullah Chowdhury, and Gono Forum Executive President Subrata Chowdhury, among others, were beside Kamal at the time. BNP Standing Committee members Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and Moudud Ahmed, former caretaker adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein, former vice-president of Dhaka University Central Students' Union (Ducsu), Sultan Mohammad Mansur Ahmed, were also present. Manna, who was the member secretary of Juktofront, also briefed the media on the new coalition's seven demands, which include the release of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia, and 11 common goals. The seven demands of Jatiya Oikya Front include formation of a non-partisan government through discussion with all political parties, after the resignation of the incumbent government and dissolution of parliament to hold a fair election; release of all political prisoners, and withdrawal of false cases filed against opposition leaders and activists. Their demands also include Election Commission reform with qualified personnel, no use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the next election, withdrawal of false cases filed against students and journalists, and deployment of army personnel with magistracy powers 10 days before the national polls Seven demands: 1.    To ensure a fair election, a non-partisan government must be formed through discussion with all political parties, after the resignation of the incumbent government and dissolution of the parliament. Release of political prisoners, including of Khaleda Zia must be ensured, and false cases filed against opposition activists must be withdrawn 2.    Election Commission must be formed with qualified personnel, and electronic voting machines (EVMs) must not be used in the next election 3.    Level playing field during election time must be ensured 4.    False cases field against students and journalists must be withdrawn, and laws such as Digital Security Act must be scrapped 5.    Army Personnel, with magistracy powers must be deployed ten days before the next general election 6.    Foreign and domestic observers must be present during election time, and media professionals must be allowed to perform their duties without any restrictions 7.     Trial of all ongoing cases filed against political personalities must be postponed from the announcement of the polls schedule, till the declaration of the election results. New cases must not be filed against those political personalities during this time 11 goals: 1.    Establishing good governance by bringing balance of power in parliament, government, president and prime minister with an aim to build a Bangladesh with the spirit of Liberation War to end the authoritarian regime, and decentralizing the administration 2.    Amending the constitution, including Article 70, and forming a constitutional commission to appoint impartial and honest officials to the important positions in constitutional bodies 3.    Ensuring freedom and power of the judiciary 4.    Ensuring necessary initiative for modernizing the Anti-Corruption Commission and bringing the corrupts to book 5.    Ensuring an investment-friendly environment, creating jobs and establishing merit as the only baseline for recruitment in government jobs 6.    Ensuring security of the people, their property and fundamental rights and women empowerment 7.     Implement infrastructural reform for freeing the public administration, police and local government from corruption and grouping 8.    Establishing discipline in the financial institutions, including Bangladesh Bank, and ensuring financial growth focused on proper use of national resources, fair distribution and public welfare 9.    Building a national consensus against militancy, terrorism and communalism, and establishing positive, creative and balanced political environment by ending politics of vengeance and negativity 10.    Adopting a \"friendship with all, enmity with none\" foreign policy 11.    Ensuring advance training, modern technology and equipment for the armed forces to strengthen and modernize them 'Change starts now' At the press briefing, Mahmudur Rahman Manna said the people wanted change and the beginning of that change started with the formation of the new unity. He also announced a three-point program of Jatiya Oikya Front - campaigns across Bangladesh to spread out the movement, views-exchange meetings with foreign diplomats and envoys, and with journalists. BNP Secretary General Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said: \"Jatiya Oikya Front has kicked off the movement for the masses to free the nation from the prevailing situation.\" The party's Standing Committee member Moudud Ahmed also said the new alliance would be a turning point to bring back the people's right to vote. \"Dr Kamal has made a very bold move because he wants democracy. This unity now has only one aim - compel the government to accept our demands and hold a fair election,\" he added. Zafrullah Chowdhury said: \"Dr Kamal Hossain is not leading the unity formation process by taking anyone's side. He is doing what needs to be done to deal with the existing crisis prevailing in the country.\" Senior BNP leader Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain added that Jatiya Oikya Front was a light of hope ahead of the next election. On October 7, the leaders of BNP, Jatiya Oikya Prokriya, and Juktofront, held a meeting at Mosharraf's house in the city and reached a consensus to wage a united movement to force the government to hold a credible election. Over the last month, BNP and the previous coalition comprised of Oikya Prokriya and Juktoront have voiced similar demands concerning the upcoming polls. Jatiya Oikya Prokriya was initiated by Juktofront and Gono Forum on September 15. Later, on September 22, BNP extended its support to the platform at a rally. Since then, leaders from the three political platforms have held several meetings to finalize the next course of action. With this, almost all the parties who oppose the ruling Awami League will have joined a single platform. On Friday night, the leaders of BNP, Juktofront, and Jatiya Oikya Prokriya, finalized a draft framework of the new coalition with the demands and goals to force the government to step down before the polls and organize fair balloting."

The High Court canceled Relief and Disaster Management Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya's graft conviction, on Monday.  Maya had been sentenced to 13 years imprisonment by a lower court in the graft case, reports UNB. A bench of Justices Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice KM Hafizul Alam delivered the judgment. Maya's lawyer barrister Syed Ahmed Raja said that the HC relieved Maya from the jail sentence accepting an appeal he filed. After re-hearing the appeal filed by Maya on Sunday, against the lower court's conviction, the HC set Monday to deliver its verdict. On August 14, the High Court had set October 7 to deliver its judgment in the case.  Assistant Director of Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), Nurul Alam filed the case with Sutrapur police station for illegally amassing wealth, worth Tk29 lakh, on June 13, 2007. A Special Judge's Court sentenced Maya to 13 years' jail and also fined him Tk5 crore for the wealth accumulated on February 14, 2008. On February 14, 2008, a Dhaka court sentenced him to 13 years in jail and fined him Tk50 million over wealth accumulation. Maya filed an appeal with the High Court on May 25, 2009. Following the appeal, the High Court acquitted him from the corruption charges on October 27, 2010.  On June 14, 2015, a three-member bench of Appellate Division led by former Chief Justice SK Sinha scrapped the High Court verdict and ordered a re-hearing his appeal."

The diplomat made the statement while speaking to reporters after inspecting the newly-established Rohingya camp in the Balukhali area of Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya upazila.  Miller also said: \"We must create a conducive, safe environment in order for the Rohingyas to return to their homeland. We must give them back their rights, and ensure that repatriation is voluntary. The US government is continuing to work with the international community in order to create such a suitable environment.\"  He also said: \"The amount of harm wrought upon Cox's Bazar by the influx of so many refugees is immeasurable, but the US will work on mitigating the situation.\" Earlier, Miller reached Cox's Bazar by plane around 9:30am Tuesdayon a three-day trip. He subsequently visited multiple Rohingya camps in Bandarban and Cox's Bazar, where he met with refugee leaders, and donor agencies, NGO, and international NGO officials.  Since August 2017, over 700,000 Rohingyas have entered Bangladesh fleeing the persecution of Myanmar security forces. They have taken shelter various refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, taking the total number of refugees living there to over 1.1 million."

After the initial damage of 1 kilometer area during the monsoon season, the city's flood embankment once again is facing the wrath of the mighty Padma. From Wednesday evening till Thursday morning, about 150 meters of the city flood embankment have dissolved in the river bed. Frightened residents are taking shelter on higher ground away from the river bank.  According to locals last year's sand dredging is the main reason of the current river erosion. They said on Wednesday evening despite low water levels in Padma, sudden erosion began near the Godar Bazar area of Rajbari. As a result the entire area, including Rajbari city is under threat. Mohammad Mazibur, a resident of Gopalbari village under Rajbari Sadar upazila said: \"Dredging in the Rajbari section of Padma River is responsible for the flood. Many of the anxious residents are moving away from the affected area.\" Sadar upazila Water Development Board Deputy Assistant Engineer Md Hafizur Rahman said: \"Daulatdia of Rajbari zila to Sialdangi of Pangsha upazila share 85 kilometers of river channel in-between. On Wednesday about 100 meter area of the city flood embankment got damaged. We have sent the new embankment design to the ministry. We are hopeful to start the repair work very soon.\""

He said: \"Bear in mind that our independence was achieved in exchange for huge bloodshed and supreme sacrifice.\"  The president, also the armed forces supreme commander, simultaneously asked the newly commissioned officers to be the partners of the common people in their \"happiness-sorrow and smile-cry\". \"Stand by the distressed people during their tough times,\" the president said. Referring to Bangladesh Army's outstanding contribution in various development activities, he hoped that the newly commissioned officers would establish ideals through their works which others will follow. Hamid hoped that the army would strengthen its position worldwide by dint of their efficiency, merit and knowledge. \"The Bangladesh Army is a symbol of our nation's pride. On this happy moment, I extend my heartiest good wishes and congratulations to all fresh armyofficers,\" Hamid said. He said the Bangladesh Army was born through the great Liberation War in 1971, adding that the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman framed a defence policy in 1974 to build a strong and trained army suitable for an independent country.  The President said Bangabandhu took initiatives to establish a world-standard military academy in Bangladesh alongside infrastructural development of different cantonments with opening Bangladesh Military Academy in Comilla Cantonment in 1974. President Hamid described BMA as a modern and international standard academy while in recent years the institute earned an extra status in the global military arena by introducing a four-year honours and engineering degree courses. \"People in the globe not only visit here (the military academy), but also impart training from here,\" he observed. He said the incumbent government formulated the Forces Goal-2030 enhancing overall capability of Bangladesh Army to a greater extent. Earlier, the president reviewed the smartly turned out parade riding on an open jeep and took salute at the impressive march-past. Through Saturday's parade, a total of 257 cadets including 37 female, two Saudi Arabians and one Sri Lankan were commissioned.

According to sources, more than: 2,000 houses, 500 business centres, several schools, mosques and other establishments have been washed away by the consequences of aggressive river erosion. The river is threatening increasingly more areas. On Sunday morning, a big portion of Naria Upazila Health Complex and a mosque adjacent to the hospital also washed away. At least 12 hospital buildings are at risk of being washed away at any time, said locals. In the last month, the river has devoured several multi-storey buildings, a mosque, 2,000 business centres, 300 shops, and others establishments located on the riverbank. A1.50km area, from Naria Banshtola to Purba Naria, was washed away by the river in the last couple of days-- but the authorities concerned paid no head on it, locals said. Although the erosion is ongoing for the last couple of years, no initiative to build a dam or embankment was taken by the local administration, claimed the locals. They also claimed the government should declare the area a disaster zone. Shahidul Islam Babu, mayor of Naria Municipality , said they started to send relief materials to the victims. UNO Sanjida Yeasmin said she told the higher authorities to declare the area a disaster zone. On a recent visit, she also assured the locals that the construction work on the 9km dam will start on the first week of October."

      "text": "The move comes in line with a High Court order issued in August 2013 The Election Commission has cancelled the registration of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islamias a political party, which had opposed Bangladesh's independence during the Liberation War of 1971. The commission issued a gazette notification,signed by the commission's Secretary HelalUddin Ahmed,to this regard on Sunday. According to the gazette, Jamaat's registration was cancelled in line with the Sub Clause 4 of Article 90H of the Representation of the People Order (RPO) 1972,following a 2013 High Court order that declared the party's registration illegal and cancelled. The cancellation of the registration means Jamaat would not be able to take part in the upcoming 11th general election, which the commission plans to hold in the last week of December. Commission Secretary Helal Uddin Ahmed on Monday also told reporters: \"We have issued the gazette announcing the cancellation [of Jamaat's registration] after receiving the full verdict from the High Court.\" He also said that there was also no stay order from the Supreme Court's Appellate Division in this regard. \"We have received the affidavit from the concerned advocate through an information slip of the Appellate Division. There is no stay order.\"The Election Commission gazette notification, cancelling Jamaat-e-Islami's registration as a political party, which was issued on Sunday | Collected In the August 1,2013 verdict, the High Court had declared Jamaat's registration with the Election Commission\"illegal and void,\" while observing that the registration was unlawfully done and the party's charter contained elements contrary to the constitution and election rules of Bangladesh. It also said that Jamaat had no moral right to be in Bangladesh's political arena for the atrocities it committed during the Liberation War. Jamaat, a long-time key ally of BNP, the same day had moved the Supreme Court, challenging the verdict. The commission withheld the party's registration after the High Court order, while waiting for the copy of the full verdict. On November 4, 2008, Jamaat had registered with the Election Commission during the military-backed caretaker government's term, after the commission made it mandatory for political parties to register for contesting in the polls, and had the 'scale'allotted as its election symbol. However, apart from losing the registration, many top leaders of Jamaat were tried and sentenced to either the death penalty or life imprisonment over the last five years by two special war crimes tribunals for crimes committed against humanity during the 1971 war. Some of them were also executed following their convictions."

The people of all faiths will practise their own religious rituals properly. This is the principle of Islam,\" she said.\nShe made the remarks while inaugurating construction works on nine model mosques and Islamic cultural centres in different places of the country through a videoconference from her official residence, Ganabhaban, in Dhaka.\nThe nine mosques and centres are being constructed under a project titled \"Establishment of a total of 560 Model Mosques and Islamic Cultural Centres in each District and Upazila.\"\nSheikh Hasina said her government has taken this initiative so that people can get the real teaching of Islam and exercise Islamic culture properly.\n\"We want the image of our holy religion to be upheld. Islam is a religion of peace. We want the peace to prevail,\" she said adding that the dignity of Islam is being defamed by killing innocent people and carrying out militant and terrorist acts in the name of the holy religion.\nShe reiterated that there will be no place for militancy, terrorism and drug on Bangladesh soil. \"We want everyone here to live in peace and have socio-economic progress.\"\nRecalling that Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman established the Islamic Foundation in March, 1975, Hasina said it was his dream that the people from all religions would perform their own religious rituals freely in this country.\nLater, the prime minister heard the speeches of imams (religious leaders) and public representatives of Tungipara upazila of Gopalganj, Chittagong, Mymensingh, Noakhali, Dakkhina Surma of Sylhet, Khulna, Rajapur of Jhalakati and Sherpur of Bogra through the videoconference from Ganabhaban.\nShe also talked to Opposition Leader Raushan Ershad through the videoconference while inaugurating the model mosque in Mymensingh.\nReligious Affairs Minister Matior Rahman also spoke on the occasion, while Principal Secretary Md Nojibur Rahman conducted the videoconference.\nReligious Affairs Secretary Md Anisur Rahman made a brief description of the project through a power-point presentation, informing that construction works of over 100 mosques will start by the end of 2018.\nA video documentary on the project was screened. The district-level model mosques will be four-storey ones, while that of the upazila-level model the three-storey ones.\nThe model mosques to be constructed in coastal areas will be four-storey ones with the ground floor remaining vacant for use as shelter centres during any natural disaster.\nA total of Tk8,722 crore will be spent on constructing the mosques and centres.\nRoad Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader and the prime minister's Political Affairs Adviser HT Imam were also present.\n\n\n\n\n"

The people have the right to know.\n\"If it is spying, then the people would never know about what goes on. Actually, it is an anti-transparency law for governing the state.\"\nOnline activist Arif Jebtik said online journalism had served to raise awareness among people of many things that take place around them.\n\"Illegal activities of government officials involved in corruption have been exposed (so) I think this section has been formulated to protect the corrupt officials,\" he said. \"This law has ensured that people who are harassed at government offices do not get the chance to collect evidence.\"\nPosts, Telecommunication and Information Technology Minister Jabbar said journalists had \"conditional freedom\" in Bangladesh.\n\"Why should you do something secretly? It is unacceptable?\" he asked. \"One can never violate state secrecy. Will you be able to force yourself into someone else's house? Can anyone take pictures in someone else's house without permission?\"\nWhen presented with the scenario of a journalist being denied permission to take a picture of a person, Jabbar said: \"It depends on the situation. Since you are asking for permission, it is not confidential anymore.\"\n \nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

The 16,000-acre island was once used as a shelter by pirates.\nIt usually takes around two and a half hours to reach Bhasan Char by boat from the Nolchira terminal of Hatiya upazila.\nThe journey started with a hired engine-run boat from Nolchira boat terminal of Hatiya around 9am and ended at Bhasan Char around 12:30pm. Before the start of the journey, this correspondent had contacted officials of a construction firm and convinced them to take him to Bhasan Char.\n[caption id=\"attachment_250598\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Workers move construction material from the water vessels into the island Fazlur Rahman Raju/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nWhen the boat reached the island, hundreds of water vessels carrying construction materials were seen in the area. Workers were busy unloading these materials.  After entering Bhasan Char, this correspondent also found trucks and lorries carrying bricks and stones. Excavators were seen piling up mud for the construction of the embankment. Roads have been built across the char area and several officer cadets of the Bangladesh Navy were seen roaming the construction site on bikes.\nThe navy has built a cluster pilot building on the char as a demo project. Construction firms are using the demo as a model.\nA shopkeeper, requesting anonymity, said: \"We have heard a Rohingya family was sheltered around the pilot project area and received all facilities including access to navy doctors.\"\n\nDuring the visit, this correspondent also found an aged person collecting medicine from a shop with a prescription signed by a navy doctor.\nAccording to sources, a total of 1,440 buildings will be built in the area to shelter Rohingya refugees.

      "text": "On December 13, BFJU gave the government a 48-hour ultimatum to unblock the news sites While some people assumed a recent ban on 54 news sites was government interference in media, the government has said the websites were shut down due to national security concerns based on an intelligence report. On December 13, the Bangladesh Federal Journalists Union (BFJU) and a section of the Dhaka Journalists Union (DJU) gave the government a 48-hour ultimatum to unblock the news sites. While staging a demonstration in front of the National Press Club, in Dhaka, they claimed the government's decision was nothing but interference in the media; and threatened to wage tougher political movements if their demands remained unfulfilled. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said that the websites were harmful for national security since they spread propaganda and indecent content. \"The websites were blocked due to national security concerns based on an intelligence report given by Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and the National Telecommunication Monitoring Centre NTMC),\" the minister told the Dhaka Tribune. \"We have been having discussions for further action against the websites,\" he said. However, the minister did not mention a specific allegation against specific content or the news site. Also Read- Now 54 news portals, sites blocked Meanwhile, the journalists' leaders claimed the government initiative was an attempt to shut down media in the country, and demanded the ban on the sites be lifted within two days. BFJU President Ruhul Amin Gazi said: \"If the government does not lift the ban on the websites within 48 hours, a greater course of action will be declared.\" While talking to the Dhaka Tribune, he said that 54 organizations, collectively, cannot make any mistake and the government did not explain the exact reasons behind blocking them. \"If any news site does anything wrong or if any content seems to be manipulated, the government has to explain that before the nation. We do not know which content was anti-state or anti-government, and nobody knows. However, the government has widely blocked the news sites,\" journalist leader Ruhul said.  \"We are not in favour of yellow journalism, neither are we in support of shutting down  news sites. If any organization does anything illegal, action should be taken accordingly,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), on December 9, sent letters to International Internet Gateway (IIG) operators and Internet Service Providers (ISP) to restrict access to 58 news sites. Following the letter, the news sites were found unavailable from the morning of December 10. On December 11, BTRC reopened four news portals--poriborton.com, priyo.com, risingbd.com and dhakatimes24.com-- and kept the other sites blocked. Also Read- BTRC reopens 58 news sites blocked over 'national security' concern Dhaka Tribune also contacted NTMC Director Brig Gen Ziaul Ahsan and RAB Director (Legal and Media Wing) Mohammad Mufti Mahmud Khan, for comment, but was unable to reach them by phone. BTRC acting chairman Md Jahurul Haque--also the vice chairman of the commission--refused to comment, saying he had been moved away from BTRC, and was currently working for the Bangabandhu Satellite. BTRC Senior Assistant Director (Media and Communication wing) Md Zakir Hossain Khan said: \"The concerned authorities asked us to take steps against the 58 websites. We just executed the order as a technical organization.\" \"Four news sites were mistakenly included in the list, and upon receiving further instructions, we reopened them,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. When asked about the reason behind blocking the websites, he said the actions were taken as the websites appeared to be a threat to national security. \"Sometimes, some of these websites were responsible for humiliating the country's president and prime minister. Whenever, such activities against someone-- who is involved in running the country--are found, we take action according to the policy of the commission,\" Zakir told the Dhaka Tribune. Despite several attempts, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Media Advisor Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury was unavailable for his comment in this regard."

      "text": "The Dutch Minister stated that his government will continue supporting the implementation of g Bangladesh's plan The government of the Netherlands has assured Bangladesh that it will assist the country in  implementing its Delta Plan 2100. Dutch Minister for Infrastructure and Water Management Cora van Nieuwenhuizen expressed her government's readiness to help Bangladesh to this end. The minister said this during a meeting with Ambassador of Bangladesh to the Netherlands Sheikh Mohammed Belal, at the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management of the Netherlands, on Monday. She also stated that the Netherlands will support inland reclamation and river dredging in Bangladesh, said the Embassy on Tuesday, reports UNB. The Dutch Minister remarked that Bangladesh has always been an important country for a global initiative on climate change. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte had invited Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to join the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) as Co-Convener and attend the launching of the GCA in The Hague on October 16. Referring to the invitation, Nieuwenhuizen said that she hopes that Bangladesh's prime minister will join the GCA and attend the inaugural ceremony; to demonstrate to the world that Bangladesh is at the forefront of climate change adaptation and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change.  Ambassador Belal congratulated the Netherlands for taking the initiative to steer the GCA towards obtaining global political commitments to climate change adaptation and focusing on solutions to climate change. He also thanked the Dutch government for inviting Bangladesh's prime minister to join the global initiative. At the meeting, both the Dutch Minister and Bangladesh's Ambassador expressed their satisfaction at the fast-growing bilateral relations between the two countries--following the official visit of the PM Sheikh Hasina to the Netherlands in November 2015, and the Dutch twin-ministerial visit to Bangladesh in June 2015. Referring to the approval of Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, on 4 September this year, by the Government of Bangladesh, the Ambassador expressed sincere thanks to the Dutch government for their technical assistance in formulating the plan. The Ambassador has also sought Dutch support under the broader framework of Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 to mitigate long-term flood risks and the adverse impacts of climate change. This would occur through: basin-wide water management, land reclamation, river-dredging, building the capacity of Bangladesh's River Research Institute, and developing knowledge via education and training. During the meeting, the Dutch Minister expressed her hope to visit Bangladesh at an opportune time to see, in person, Bangladesh's prowess in climate change adaptation. She would also like to further explore Dutch cooperation in implementing Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100."

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "To achieve the upper-middle income status, the report says, Bangladesh must act now to tackle environmental degradation and pollution, especially in its cities Every year Bangladesh loses about $6.5 billion, which is about 3.4% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 2015, due to pollution and environmental degradation in urban areas, says a new World Bank report. The report titled \"Enhancing Opportunities for Clean and Resilient Growth in Urban Bangladesh: Country Environmental Analysis 2018\" was released during an event at a hotel in Dhaka on Sunday. It revealed that the cost is $1.44 billion in Dhaka alone, which is 0.72% of the national GDP. To achieve the upper-middle income status, the report says, Bangladesh must act now to tackle environmental degradation and pollution, especially in its cities. Globally, Bangladesh is one of the countries that are most affected by pollution and environmental risks. Pollution has reached an alarming level; in 2015, it caused about 80,000 deaths in cities, the report said. Across Bangladesh, 28% of all deaths are from diseases caused by pollution, compared to a 16% global average. Admitting the economic losses, Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Anisul Islam Mahmud told the function that the government was going to frame a new Environment Policy, the draft of which was ready for placing before the Cabinet. \"The draft policy has already been examined and will be sent to the Cabinet for green light soon. We will enact a new law to punish the polluters,\" he added, reports UNB. He said the government would introduce an online monitoring system to oversee the operation of the effluent treatment plants (ETP) at the industries to enforce the law effectively. The function was also addressed by World Bank's Acting Country Director Rajashree Paralkar, Environment Ministry's Additional Secretary Manjurul Hannan Khan, Department of Environment Director General Dr Sultan Ahmed and World Bank project leader Sanjoy Srivastava. World Bank's environment and natural resources global practice manager Kseniya Lvovsky had presented the highlights of the report at the program.   Growth at risk \"Bangladesh pays a high price from environment degradation and pollution in its urban areas. This puts its strong growth at risk,\" Rajashree Paralkar said at Sunday's event. \"The country must act to put in place the right policies and institutions for green growth and ensure its industries adopt clean technologies,\" she added. Pollution and environmental degradation, including wetland encroachment and unregulated disposal of hazardous wastes, especially harm women, children and the poor. Nearly one million people in Bangladesh, mostly poor, are at risk of lead contamination, says the report. This can lead to IQ loss and neurological damage, especially for children, and can increase the risk of miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women, it added. In greater Dhaka, the sites contaminated by heavy metals are mostly in poorer neighbourhoods. The report focuses on three areas: cost of environmental degradation, clean and resilient cities, and institutions for clean industrial growth. Of the total economic losses, the ambient air pollution cost $2.42 billion while household air pollution cost $1.27 billion, according to the environmental country analysis. Inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene have a direct impact of $0.43 billion while the indirect impact is $ 0.08 billion, arsenic in drinking water cost $0.80 billion while occupational pollution costs $1.52 billion in the economy. The World Bank observed that unplanned urbanisation and industrialization are affecting both big and small cities. In the last 40 years, Dhaka lost about 75% of its wetlands. \"Due to filling of wetland and now with high-rise buildings built on sand-filled areas, parts of the city are more susceptible to flood inundation. Smaller cities like Pabna see a similar toll from unplanned urbanisation. Since 1990, Pabna lost half of its wetlands, and its lifeline, the Ichamoti River, is dying.\" Dhaka and other cities can and must do far more to prevent encroachment, as well as invest in and sustainably manage their wetlands and canals, says the report."

The prime minister delivered her statement at high-level leaders' dialogue on \"Implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change: Towards COP24 and Beyond,\" held at the UN Headquarters on Wednesday, reports UNB. \"We need support for climate change adaptation and wider capacity-building-- and also for technology development and transfer in areas like agriculture, public health, and disaster management,\" she said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was present at the event. Sheikh Hasina said she hoped member states would take the opportunity to have a discussion about climate finance, at COP24, to put the world on track to meet pre-2020 aims and long term goals of the Paris Agreement. Pointing out that Bangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, the premier said: \"Climate change threatens the life and livelihood of 160 million of our people.\" She said Bangladesh has climate action and disaster risk reduction in its national plan.  \"We've investments of over 1 percent of our GDP to address  climate change impacts. Moreover, $450 million has been allocated, from our own resources, for adaptation and mitigation purposes,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh has adapted its agricultural methods to weather the impact of climate change.  She recalled the moment when she announced, in New York, five years ago,  that Bangladesh will never exceed the average per capita emissions of the developing world--as a responsible member of the international community.  Sheikh Hasina said: \"Our commitment to low-carbon, climate-resilient development is firm. We plan to move to carbon budgeting and resilient industrialization. We wish to de-carbonize our manufacturing pathways.\" She said Bangladesh has installed around six million Solar Home Systems and provided two million Improved Cook Stoves for the underprivileged. She also said that Bangladesh is developing stress-tolerant crop varieties to cope with the impacts of climate change.  \"In spite of our limitations, we allocated $385 million of our own funds for adaptation and mitigation,\" the prime minister added."

The report, titled \"Global Terrorism Index 2018,\" ranked Bangladesh as 25th in terms of the impact of terrorism in 2017. This classifies the country as having had medium impact from terrorism. On the other hand, the USA was ranked 20th in the index, and classified as having had high impact from terrorism. As per the report, Bangladesh dropped by four ranks as compared to 2016, meaning the country has had a lower impact from terrorism in 2017. Conversely, the USA climbed 12 ranks after having been ranked 32nd in 2016.  Myanmar, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India are also among the countries that have had a higher impact from terrorism than Bangladesh in 2017. The Global Terrorism Index is produced based on data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). Data for the GTD is collected and collated by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. The key findings of the index include a 27% decrease in deaths from terrorism across the globe from 2016 to 2017. There were 18,814 deaths in 2017. This is the third consecutive year that number of deaths from terrorism has decreased. Deaths are now 44% below their peak in 2014. When compared to the peak of deaths from terrorism in 2014, the largest falls in the number of deaths occurred in Iraq, Nigeria, and Pakistan, with falls of 6,466, 5,950, and 912 deaths respectively."

If this situation continues, people will lose their trust in the election process.\"He said he was hopeful that if the election was free and fair, and the voters were able to exercise their voting rights, then the sheaf of paddy symbol would win by a large margin in the 11th general elections, due on Sunday.Moudud also claimed that the deployment of the armed forces members had done little to improve the situation.\"When there is no security for the candidates, the voters cannot be safe either,\" he said.Alleging the ruling party and the administration of not ensuring a level playing field, Moudud said: \"At least 31 cases have been filed against us, in which 965 of our leaders and activists have been made accused. At least 1,649 more have been listed as unidentified accused. Since December 10, 766 of our members have been injured in attacks on our campaigns. At least 78 of our field workers have been put in jail. Do those numbers speak of a good election environment?\"Despite this situation, we will remain in the election race till the last minute,\" the BNP leader vowed. \"Let the people of the country and the international community see how an election is held under a partisan government.\"Moudud further said this was a great opportunity for the Awami League to prove that holding a fair election is possible under a partisan government, but they failed to do so.The press briefing was also attended by BNP's Companiganj unit Orgnizational Secretary Md Jahangir Alam, Companiganj municipality unit Organizational Secretary Mominul Haque, and Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal's Noakhali district unit General Secretary Abu Hasan Md Noman, among others.In an immediate reaction to Moudud's press briefing, the Companiganj upazila unit of Awami League held a press briefing later in the day, where they refuted the BNP leader's allegations.Speaking at the press briefing, Companiganj Upazila Parishad Chairman and Awami League's district unit Organizational Secretary Mizanur Rahman Badal said: \"Barrister Moudud Ahmed's allegations are false and baseless. He made all these statements after not getting the expected response from the voters in the area (Noakhali 5).\""

At least 20 species of fish and aquatic animals, including two species of prawn were found floating in the river due to massive industrial pollution. A great number of fishes such as catfish or carp that lives in deep water were found dead on June 21 and 22, floating on the river. Halda River is known as the country's largest natural breeding ground for carps.  The committee points out the causes of the disaster and ways to restore the river from man-made pollutions. Also Read - Dead fish in Halda River pose danger to livelihoods, biodiversity President of Halda River Protection Committee Prof Dr ManzoorulKibria chaired the program while it was addressed by Shamshul Haque Haidari, Md Ali, Chowdhury Farid, Amin Munna and Reza Mozammel of the Halda River Protection Committee, among others. During the press conference, researcher Dr Manzoorul warned that the brief spell of massive pollution, for which a great number of fish died, would take a long term toll on the river. \"Although we have been conducting research on the river for a long time, we are not familiar with such type of disaster,\" he said. Dr Manzoorul further added: \"On behalf of Halda River Research Laboratory of Chittagong University and Halda River Protection Committee, we have collected water and dead fish samples from different points of the river and tried to identify the source of the problem.\"  Also Read - Paper mill sealed off for polluting Halda Quality of water in Halda \"After the recent disaster, water samples from 11 points of the river have been collected for lab tests,\" said Dr Manzoorul. \"The level of dissolved oxygen, found in the water was very low and is not suitable for fish and other aquatic organisms to survive. Pitch dark and foul smelling water was found in Chhayar Char to Ramdas Munshir Hat areas of the river. \"The water samples tested in the lab showed that the extent of pollution was higher in the downstream of the river. The average level of dissolved oxygen was found 1.01ml per litre against the required level of at least 5ml per litre, in the eight-kilometre stretch of the river from AzimerGhat to Madunaghat area,\" said Dr Manzoorul. Dr Manzoorul also pointed out: \"The level of ammonia in Khandia and Katakhali- two feeder canals of the Halda, were found to be hundred times higher than the tolerable limit. Apart from that, layers of oil were also found floating sporadically in the mouths of some feeder canals\" The fishes died due to low level of dissolved oxygen and exceedingly high levels of ammonia, which contaminated the river water.  Also Read - 17 Halda dolphins die in four months Industries responsible for polluting the Halda \"100MW Hathazari Peaking Power Plant and Asian Paper Mill were found to be the major industrial polluters for the Halda.The plant illegally constructed an underground pipeline to release its untreated furnace oil to the adjacent canal lined to the Halda. The power plant is yet to set up Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP),\" said Dr Manzoorul. While speaking about Asian Paper Mills Dr Manzoorul said: \"The mill has set up ETP. However, it virtually turned its adjacent canal into a dumping station. The waste released by the paper mill has deposited over a stretch of two kilometres of the canal and created a 1-1.5 ft thick layer of paper mill waste.\" Dr Manzoorul pointed out about the illegal set up of many poultry farms surrounding the river and the poultry bird excreta, also responsible for the falling level of dissolved oxygen in the river. \"Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) blocked Bamanshahi canal a few years ago, for a housing project. \"Both industrial and domestic wastes are now being channelled to the Halda through Khandakia canal due to the diversion,\" added Dr Manzoorul."

Such an initiative proves that development projects have been undertaken without thinking about the lives of people living near the river.\"\nHe made the comments on the concluding day of a two-day long conference titled \"Water Roots Innovation\", organized by ActionAid Bangladesh in the coastal town of Kuakata in Patuakhali.\n\"The rivers of Bangladesh are dying. The sweet water content inside the rivers has diminished, and there has been a steady rise of salinity,\" said Imtiaz.\nLocated in West Bengal, India, the Farakka barrage is roughly 16.5km distant from the Bangladeshi border. Built to revive the Kolkata port, it has been blamed for reducing water flow, increasing salinity and drying up the waters around the Sundarbans delta.\nBangladesh, heavily reliant on agriculture, bears the brunt of the barrage's destructive effect.\nOn the concluding day of the conference on Saturday, speakers discussed various solutions aimed at reducing river water pollution and the water crisis in Bangladesh.\nWater specialist and General Secretary of \"Ganga Bhangon Protirodh Samity\" (Ganges River Erosion Prevention Committee) of India, Toriqul Islam spoke: \"When it comes to the negative effects of the Farakka barrage, we are not against Bangladesh. People of Malda and Murshidabad inside India are similarly affected.\"\n\"People are losing their livelihoods on a daily basis because of Farakka,\" continued Toriqul. \"We wanted the barrage, but now it has become toxic for us.\"\nOn the concluding day of the conference, activists from China, India and Nepal shared their stories on topics related to river conservation.\nAccording to Prof Dr Liyan Zhang from Tianjin University in  China, while industrial activities are done in the name of development, rivers get polluted, destroying people's livelihoods. Farmers and the youth of the country can help to solve the problem, and the central leadership will have to take the initiative, he said.\nCountry Director of ActionAid Bangladesh Farah Kabir said: \"Historically, culturally and economically, our country has always been rich in the use of water and river multiplicity. Now, through regional initiatives such as unplanned development and urbanization, we are destroying the rivers.\"\nThe Chief Whip of Bangladesh Parliament, A S M Feroz, said: \"We want to save rivers. We want to remove structures near water bodies that are negatively impacting them.\"\n\"But due to obstacles like the Farakka barrage, the rivers in Bangladesh are going to die soon,\" he said. \"People use the rivers without taking the water and the river's own water flow into account. They need to start using the rivers responsibly.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "For centuries, the locals of a small village in Shariatpur district have been praying in an ancient mosque. After 500 years of devoted use, however, the landmark building in Shibpur village under Nagerparha union of Goshairhat upazila has become dilapidated, and now poses serious risks to the safety of worshippers.  Locals have demanded the mosque be renovated and recognized as a national heritage site, because of its historical and aesthetic values.  They say it has a glorious history - although there are no surviving records of it. The site is not even listed in the government's architecture book list.  The mosque - situated about 8-10km from Sadar upazila of Shariatpur and 5km from the Arial Khan River - is popular because of its impressive decorative art.  The bricks were carved with ornate designs, while the structure itself is surrounded by serene green trees and a pond at the western side.  The square mosque, which has been set up on four kathas of land, has an ornate dome with a minaret on the top. The mosque's beauty is further enhanced by minarets on each of the four corners. The interior of the mosque is intricately designed with rosettes, while the exterior exhibits depictions of art during the Muslim rule in Bengal. The architectural patterns blend harmoniously to reflect both the Sultanate and Mughal rules. Locals have also attached superstitions to the ancient mosque, with some believing that it is possessed by spirits. Some have informed that for many years, people were afraid to enter the mosque in fear of spirits. Others have dismissed the idea. Their beliefs are that the mosque was constructed during Mughal Emperor Akbar's rule in 1576. Bengal remained a Mughal province until the beginning of the decline of the Mughal Empire in the 19th century. After the last great Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's death in 1707, governors employed in Bengal practically became independent rulers.  However, others villagers believe the mosque was constructed during the Nawabi period between 1717 and 1765.  \"Nawab\" is a particular designation indicating political rank and power in the Mughal administrative hierarchy. In the British period, the term was used for a state conferred honorary title of rank, but it did not have any official attachment.  During the middle of the 18th century, they served as rulers of the provinces of Bengal. Nawabs were only nominally subordinate to the Mughal Empire. Abdus Salam Talukder, a tutelary of the mosque, said the truth would always be shrouded in conjecture. \"We cannot know the real history as there are no written documents, but I have always heard from my forefathers that the mosque was established by British Indian architects in the periods of Nawabs,\" he said. \"But maybe the mosque was constructed during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir.\" According to Abdus, Haji Shariatullah, an eminent 19th-century Islamic reformer from the Indian Subcontinent under whose name Shariatpur district was named, used to visit the mosque from time to time. Sometimes he would come with his son Dudu Mia to offer prayers. \"We tried to renovate the mosque because of its current dismal situation,\" Abdus said. \"But we failed as we lacked funds. We even sent a letter to Awami League leader and former minister Abdur Razzaq, as he is our MP, but did not get any response.\" Abdus Salam Talukder confided that currently, people come to pray inside the mosque five times a day, including for the Jumma prayers on Friday.  \"We try our best to preserve the heritage,\" he said. \"But we need the government's help to protect the mosque.\" Md Mujibur Rahman, director of Bangladesh Human Rights Enforcement council and a resident of the village, said despite the mosque's rundown state, he goes to pray there every now and then. \"Protection of such a heritage site is the government's duty, for the sake of the country,\" Mujibur said. Architect and Chief Executive of Urban Study Group (USG), Taimur Islam, said there are many historical sites in Bangladesh, but very few are listed officially.  \"If anything inside the mosque gets damaged, there is no way we will be able to restore it the way it was,\" he said. \"These structures should be preserved for their aesthetic values. Otherwise, our future generation will never witness our country's rich history.\" Taimur questioned the activities of the Ministry of Housing and Public Works. \"The authorities concerned rarely take the initiative to search the historical sites across the country, citing their lack of employees,\" he said.\"This cannot be a valid excuse.\" Ahmed Anisur Rahman, sub-assistant engineer of Shariatpur Public Works Department (PWD) told Dhaka Tribune that they did not know anything about the mosque in Shariatpur.  \"We can only renovate buildings that are included in the list provided by the government,\" he said. \"After obtaining the list from the government, we visit the site and fix the amount of money needed for renovation.  \"If the mosque in Shariatpur has an actual historical origin, and if it is in a dilapidated state, the concerned people can get in touch with the District Commissioner's office for renovation.\"  "

But 47 in 59 balls and 87 in 78 in two successful chases in the ODIs have made him feel slightly better about himself, reports ICC's official website Quinton de Kock has played two good hands as South Africa have gone 2-0 up in the one-day international series in Sri Lanka, and he's now hoping for a 5-0 scoreline. A sequence of 3, 10, 32 and 8 in the two Tests didn't make for happy reading for de Kock, but with South Africa totalling 126, 73, 124 and 290, his failures didn't stand out too much. But 47 in 59 balls and 87 in 78 in two successful chases in the ODIs have made him feel slightly better about himself, reports ICC's official website. This man was at his destructive-best in the second One-Day International against Sr Lanka. @QuinnyDeKock69's brilliant 87 (13 fours, 1 six) proved crucial in South Africa taking a 2-0 lead in the series and earned him the Man of the Match award. #ProteaFire #SLvSA  pic.twitter.com/XE7TNN9fjO \"Obviously I am feeling more satisfied than I was in the Test matches, it was quite tough then,\" he said after his knock from the top of the order helped South Africa win the second ODI by four wickets and earned him a Player of the Match award. \"Coming now into white ball, change of format, starting to add some value to the team is always nice. It's great also to be on the winning side in Sri Lanka, so all things are good at the moment. \"Coming from the Test series, it was quite difficult to play spin, especially when the wickets are given a chance to deteriorate over a couple of days. So it's nice to come into white-ball cricket, you know the spin is going to be a bit more truer. We practiced hard during the Test series to deal with the spin, so it's nice for me and for the team to finally be playing spin properly.\" South Africa's wins in the two matches have been set up by their bowlers, who have kept Sri Lanka to 193 and 244/8.  WATCH: 2nd ODI Highlights - Sri Lanka vs South Africa at Dambulla - https://t.co/rz9Rx0EkDh #SLvSA \"In the one-day format, it's always nice taking wickets up front,\" pointed out de Kock. \"That's the goal for any bowling side. The more wickets you take up front, the more you can control in the middle, so yes, that's the plan.\" Once the bowlers were done, it was over to the batsmen, and de Kock partnered Hashim Amla (43) for 91 runs to set up the chase before carrying on to put the game beyond Sri Lanka's reach. \"I think Hash's demeanour is very relaxed. We keep each other very calm. That's what we do well together. It was just wonderful to get along with him and score some runs together with him,\" said de Kock. And now, he hopes to do it again in the third game, and then the fourth and the fifth, to wrap up a series whitewash. \"It's the mission going two-nil. Hopefully three-nil, and then winning the series will also be a great way, to go through the series and hopefully win the last two after that,\" said de Kock. \"The Test series was obviously a tough one for us, so we're trying to play our best cricket now in the one-day format.\" The third ODI will be played on Sunday in Pallekele."

The only sand embankment in the area is under threat of being eroded, locals said. The people of Chotokhata, Banpara, Baishpukur Char, Chatunama Bhendabari Forest Char in Dimla upazila have been suffering as the roads and houses were submerged following the onrush of hilly water from the upstream. \"About 400 meters of the dam has already been gorged into the river,\" they said.Besides, the river has already swallowed the 10-meter approach road near dam no-4 at Dohalpara point due to rushing waves, reports UNB.   Meanwhile, more than 10,000 people of 23 villages in the char areas of Teesta and Dharala rivers have been trapped in flood water in Lalmonirhat district following onrush of water from upstream hilly areas. The officials of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) said the situation turned serious after India had opened the sluice-gates of the Gazaldoba barrage. However, the water level of Teesta River at Dalia Teesta Barrage Point is below the danger level on Wednesday. Rafiqul Alam Chowdhury, executive engineer of BWDB in Dalia said \"The flood situation has slightly improved in the district after 44 sluice gates of Teesta Barrage have been opened to control the flow of water."

Most of the drains in Dhaka are not correctly connected with one another, causing flood and waterlogging in the city,\" said Mobasher Hossain, a renowned architect.\n Causes of waterlogging\nThe sewerage system, water pumps, canals and rivers are maintained mainly by seven government bodies. Experts said there is a serious lapse of coordination among the organizations. As a result, the proper maintenance of the city's drainage system cannot be ensured, they added.\n\"There is a lack of coordination among the organizations responsible... Development work is going on, unplanned and uncoordinated. Waterlogging will never be solved unless the bodies coordinate their efforts and work in tandem,\" said Mobasher, former president of the Institute of Architects Bangladesh.\n\nEchoing him, Shyfun Naher, project coordinator at the Social and Economic Enhancement Programme, said: \"We always see the authorities are busy developing and repairing the drainage system all over the city. Their work never ends, as there is no coordination among the organizations.\"\nShe also stressed the need for reclaiming canals that have been grabbed over the years.\nDNCC's measures\nIn 2016, Annisul Haq, the late mayor of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC), took numerous measures to address the problem. As a result, the situations in such areas as Gulshan, Banani, and Baridhara have noticeably improved.\nHowever, people living in other areas including Mirpur, Mohammadpur, and Kuril are still reeling from the problem.\n\"Our work to mitigate the crisis at Mirpur, Mohammadpur, and some other places is in full swing. I hope the drainage development work will be completed before the monsoon,\" Osman Goni, a DNCC panel mayor, said.\n\n\n\n\n"

Also Read - Eight charged over Gulshan cafe attack  Defending her husband, Sharmina Parveen, who was also among the rescued 17, told different news outlets at the time that Hasnat was just following the instructions of his captors to keep her and their children safe during that dire situation.When asked whether the investigators were able to explain the pictures further, Monirul only said: \"We have analyzed those pictures. We have submitted our findings to the court.\"Monirul also said the investigators did not find any evidence of involvement of the cafe's pizza chef, Saiful Chowkidar, who was killed during the attack, or Zakir Hossain Shaon, who was detained as a suspect and later died of wounds at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.Police have pressed charges against eight people in the case. Six of them are behind bars, while the two others are fugitive.The names of a further 13 people suspected of involvement in the Holey Artisan attack have been wiped from the charge sheet as the suspects have all been killed in various drives conducted by different law enforcement agencies.Last year, the court acquitted another suspect, Tahmid Hasib Khan, as the prosecution failed to produce specific evidence to prove him guilty in the case.Tahmid was arrested on August 3, 2016 on suspicion of having links to the attackers."

      "text": "Illegal mining in India wrecks absolute ecological destruction in Bangladeshi villages downstream Shaheed Siraj Lake, popularly known as Niladri Lake, has emerged as a popular tourist destination in the recent years. The lake known for its scenic hilly surroundings and blue water is also associated with the memory of the Liberation War. But right now, the view is all grey. As far as the eye can see, there is nothing but sand on the banks. The lake is on the west side of the Chandpur village in the Tahirpur Upazila of Sunamganj. Every corner of the village is filled with sand. Crop fields, houses, and even Pochashulbill, a large wetland area, have disappeared under sand. Chandpur Government Primary School's ground floor and the playground in front has disappeared under sand. The school had to abandon the main building and move to an adjacent tin-shed house. The playground of Chandpur High School is also covered in sand. From the west bank of Zadukata River to Tekerghat point, the road is covered in sand.  A large canal that once supplied water to the Pochashulbill has completely disappeared, with only an abandoned bridge attesting to its presence. According to the Sunamganj Department of Agricultural Extension, 350 acres of land on the border of Tahirpur has been rendered inarable by sand. Other sources say the sand covers almost 500 hectares. All the freshwater fish and other animals in the area, including snakes, are dead or gone. Dr Md Abul Kashem, dean of agriculture at the Sylhet Agricultural University, said every year around 80 million tons of sand comes down to the area from upland, which is in the bordering state of Meghalaya in India. Most of it comes to the Sunamganj and Sylhet borders through rivers and waterfalls. Shaheed Siraj Lake in Chandpur village in the Tahirpur Upazila of Sunamganj Dhaka Tribune Tahirpur Agriculture Officer Abdus Salam said that the sand and stone fragments are flowing down from the Meghalaya. The flow of sand increases in the rainy season.  \"The biggest volume comes through Lakma Point. In three villages, 350 hectares of land are covered with sand,\" he said. Around 800 families in these three villages have been affected, many from the ethnic Khasia and Garo communities. The sand has filled up about 50 hectares of another wetland, the Pochasol Haor, on the south side of these villages. Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of the Sylhet Water Development Board, said: \"This massive influx of soil is due to landslides and trees getting uprooted upstream.\" Deserted land Sulai Sangma of Chandpur had been living in the area for 54 years, working as a farmer. He is now a manual worker. \"Around 57 families from ethnic communities lived in the Chandpur and Rajai villages. Of them, 14 have moved to different parts of Sylhet and eight to Mymensingh,\" Sulai said.  Andrew Solomon, 55, a resident of Rajinilain village, said he had lost 30 acres of farmland to sand and gravel from the Meghalaya.  \"The entire ecology of the region has changed. There are no crabs, no fish, and even snakes are moving away. No animal can live here. In the winter, the entire area becomes dry. In the rainy season, some canals become terrible,\" he said. Chandpur Government Primary School that has been declared abandoned owing to the massive influx of soil  Dhaka Tribune Abul Kashem, chairman of the Uttar Barua Union Parishad, said that about 700-800 families were affected due to the intrusion of sand.  \"There are about 1,200 families living in these three villages, about 100 of them ethnic minority families, and half of them have suffered losses,\" he said. \"The sand and gravel flood to Tahirpur through the canals Nayachara, Burunga, Pagla Ghat, Rajani Line, Puranghat and Rajai.  \"Even the water we get is reddish. This water cannot be used for anything. If you bathe with it you get rashes,\" Kashem added. 'Two countries have to work together' Various programs have been taken with an intention of solving the sand problem. Government intervention has been sought to sort out the issue by sending a letter to different levels of the government. But, it is a matter of sorrow that this is increasing day by day, let alone sorting it out. Kashmir Reza, a prominent Haor researcher, and president of the Environment and Haor Development Organization said local people are very concerned with the aggression of sand. To stop this, the government of both the countries will have to take effective measures, he said. Advocate Shah Shahida Akhter, Coordinator of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) Sylhet chapter, said: \"This is a bilateral problem. It can only be sorted through discussions between the two countries.\" Ministry of Environment and Forests requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 24, 2008 to take diplomatic measures to protect the agricultural land. Subsequently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka in 2009. Nevertheless, no further progress has been noticed.  At a meeting held between Sunamganj 17 Rifles Battalion and Shillong 83 BSF Battalion of India in the Meghalaya hills in November 2008 Bangladesh submitted a memorandum that called for stopping the unplanned extraction of stones in the hills. Asked about the crisis, General Secretary of the Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA) Abdul Matin said: \"Such cross-border environmental issues exist in many countries of the world.  \"But we have not noticed any effective initiative to overcome the problems of the sand pollution and disaster coming from India.\" he added. \"Nevertheless, the life and livelihood of the people of Tahirpur of Sunamganj are in jeopardy due to the sand, along with an issue of environmental disasters. Therefore, it is crucial to take sincere and pragmatic initiatives from the highest levels of the two countries,\" Matin said. "

      "text": "Several foreign tourists have been sexually assaulted in India in recent months Indian police were holding six men on Thursday after a Russian tourist was allegedly drugged and gang-raped in a popular southern tourist town, officials said. Media reports said the 21-year-old had bite marks on her face and arms when she was found naked and unconscious on the floor of her hostel room early on Monday. \"Six men have been detained over the rape and drugging of the woman,\" investigating officer Mangayar Karasi told AFP. The woman, who was travelling on her own, had arrived in the town of Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu state, 190 kilometres from Chennai, last Thursday. Those in custody included the hostel manger and her tourist guide, who told police he found her on the floor hours after they had consensual sex, another investigator said. She said the woman was being treated in hospital for a drug overdose and minor injuries, with efforts being made to record her statement. The medical report has confirmed sexual assault, the officer said.  Local and foreign tourists flock to Tiruvannamalai for its 9th-century Annamalaiyar Temple, one of the largest Hindu temple complexes spread over 25 acres. Sexual violence is rife in India with nearly 110 rapes reported every day but activists say that figure is the tip of the iceberg as most cases go unreported. Several foreign tourists have been sexually assaulted in India in recent months. Last month a Japanese tourist was raped by a taxi driver in a north Indian town, followed by the rape of a 20-year-old Canadian tourist by her guest house owner in Delhi. India's junior interior minister Wednesday told the national parliament that 110,333 rape cases were reported in the country between 2014 and 2016.  The country's dire record on sexual violence has been in the global spotlight since the 2012 gang-rape and murder of a woman on a New Delhi bus sparked angry protests. The incident led to tougher sentences and reforms in the country's rape laws but sexual crime against women, as well as against minors, remains rampant. "

No representative of the community has been appointed since Kauching Chak resigned on February 8 this year.  The Chak people had complained about his negligence to council Chairman Kyaw Shwe Hla and the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affair's (MoCHTA) State Minister Bir Bahadur Ushwe Sing.  The post was declared vacant on March 6 on the president's order. Sources say the council's recommendation to fill the vacancy has stalled at MoCHTA. MoCHTA increased the number of council members to 15, from five, with Kyaw as the chairman, on March 25, 2015. The council is comprised of representatives of 11 indigenous communities and Bangalis. This 2017 file photo shows a number of Chak community people are participating in health camp in the district | Dhaka TribuneCouncil sources say the absence of Chak representatives deprives the community of development and other facilities. \"We are facing many problems as we do not have a representative,\" Naikhyangchhari Chak leader Headman Mongchanu Chak told the Dhaka Tribune. He demanded the vacancy be filled as soon as possible. Sources say the prime minister will appoint new members to the district council as per MoCHTA's recommendation.  Awami League's Naikhyangchhari Upazila unit Vice-President Taslim Iqbal Chowdhury said: \"The Chak community is falling behind - socially and economically. A member should be appointed soon.\" Bandarban district council Chairman Kyaw told the Dhaka Tribune that they sent an application to MoCHTA to appoint a new member. \"We have yet to hear from them,\" he said"

      "authors": "Reuters, Kabul",
      "text": "After civil war in the early 1990s, which destroyed much of the city, the Taliban took control in 1996, imposing strict Islamic law The aging Ariana Afghan Airlines Boeing 727 took off from Islamabad with about 10 passengers, myself included, huddled near the exits, bound for war-torn Kabul months after the 2001 fall of the Taliban. The Afghan capital had been consigned to rubble by rocket-propelled grenades and artillery fire, first in fighting between mujahideen warriors and the Soviets after their invasion in 1979, and then between different mujahideen factions. The airport was fringed with burnt-out fighter planes and scores of people, a skewer in each hand, scouring the tarmac for landmines. Someone put a ladder up against the fuselage, opened a flap, poured in some liquid and threw the empty can over his shoulder. Fast forward 16 years, or four World Cups. I fly in from Dubai, sipping red wine as we descend into Kabul, a city transformed from rubble into a bustling capital, though still visibly plagued by the escalating war with Taliban insurgents. The centre of the city is a heavily protected zone of concrete fortresses, razor wire and well-protected checkpoints. The ruins of an office building near the presidential palace bear witness to a massive bomb last year that killed 150 people. But in other areas, such as in the west of the city, shining blocks of flats have replaced the debris, behind lines of stalls and shops selling fresh vegetables, smart phones, fashion and kitchenware and the all-important building materials. The memory of women bowed by the all-enveloping burqa, enforced under Taliban rule, trudging past destroyed homes is also fading amid talk of possible further Taliban ceasefires, upcoming elections, the national cricket team's first \"test\" match against India - and the World Cup. \"The city has been transformed,\" said Omaid Sharifi, co-founder of ArtLords, a group promoting Afghan culture that is best known for painting murals on the city's many concrete blast walls. \"On the street, boys and girls are walking together. ... There is art, culture and music. People are contributing. People are being more kind.\" The heavy security presence across Kabul underscores the danger that continues to face the city, where hundreds of civilians have been killed and wounded in attacks this year and where regular blackouts and flooding make life a misery for many. But amid the danger, prosperity has improved for fortunate members of Kabul's middle class, which grew up on the flood of money that came into the city following the US-led campaign that overthrew the Taliban in 2001. Four women, their made-up faces free of veils, giggle as their car takes on what have become heavily jammed streets of workaday Kabul. A top-of-the-range tailor shows off his ware in a long, air-conditioned shop that would not be out of place in Paris. \"Business is good now and getting better,\" the tailor said. \"My quality is number one. European standards. I am happy.\" A few cafes have popped up down lanes where musicians and artists, who thrived in the pre-Soviet invasion days, have returned. But this part of the city is also home to many fair-skinned Hazaras, an Afghan minority often targeted by militants. After civil war in the early 1990s, which destroyed much of the city, the Taliban took control in 1996, imposing strict Islamic law. After a brief respite following the 2001 campaign, the city has been subjected to wave after wave of suicide attacks. \"That was the darkest period,\" said Sharifi of the years of Taliban rule. \"You couldn't even listen to music.\" He remembers being taken to see football matches by his father. Twice, the games were preceded by executions. \"My father tried to protect me and close my eyes. But a kid's curiosity - I could see with one eye. A bunch of guys turned up in three cars and killed the men. Like sheep.\" So what next for the fast-growing capital, sitting up against the khaki mountains of the Hindu Kush? An unprecedented three-day ceasefire by the Taliban over last month's Eid ul-Fitr festive period brought them roaming into the capital for hugs and selfies and raised hopes for a longer peace. \"You can't ignore the Taliban,\" Sharifi said. \"But there are red lines. If they come back and join the political process, we will be there with our art. People can't just keep killing.\" The tailor agreed. \"If the Taliban come back, it will be with a new government, not like before,\" he said. \"We will have a good future if there is no fighting.\" "

      "authors": "Mehedi Al Amin",
      "text": "Experts say the river water will be undrinkable in five years The cost of safe drinking water in Dhaka will triple if no action is taken against its current trend of pollution, a deputy director of the Department of Environment has warned. The bulk of Dhaka's water presently comes from groundwater provided by Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Dhaka Wasa). As the water table is now depleting faster than it can replenished, however, Dhaka Wasa has turned to Meghna river as an alternative, which has already started becoming polluted.  \"If the (river) pollution continues, the water quality may further deteriorate, leading to a very high price for making it drinkable through treatment,\" DoE deputy director Md Mustafizur Rahman Akhand said.  According to a recent report released by the DoE, Dhaka Wasa and other stakeholders, if the current pollution trend continues, a toxic mix of pollutants is going to make the Meghna river water undrinkable in five years. The joint report \"Protecting Water Quality of the Meghna River for Dhaka's Sustainable Water Supply\" was released under the Dhaka Environmentally Sustainable Water Supply Project (DESWSP) on October 11. The report's other stakeholders were the Department for Forests and Climate Change, the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It urged better governance and law enforcement to protect the river from uncontrolled industrialization, the dumping of waste, and the use of pesticides. 'Drastic rise' in pollution Currently, Dhaka Wasa supplies 605 deep tube wells in Dhaka with groundwater. Every year, the groundwater level declines by 2-3 metre, creating a shortage and causing 30-40 deep tube wells to become ineffective.  Authorities have turned to Meghna River as an alternative.  However, there are around 2,000 industrial factories situated along the banks of the Meghna in Narsingdi and Narayanganj, of which many are washing and dying factories which emit chemical waste into the river.  Most of these factories do not have any Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and the ones that do hardly ever run them. Thirteen large factories are discharging wastewater directly into the river. Under the Meghna project, the authority will pump water from two intake points 30 kilometres away from Dhaka via the Bisnondi and Haria canals.  This is despite Bisnondi canal being routinely polluted with waste from a number of small-and medium-sized textile factories, as well as by untreated domestic waste. The other canals  located upstream - including Amider, Boatarder and Harihuda - are also being heavily polluted. The report also says that the Meghna has a high presence of E-coli from the domestic waste of 3.3 million people who live in the area.  The river also has high levels of the organophosphate insecticide Dimethoate, the herbicide Diuron, and the fungicide Carbendazim, and contains unacceptable levels of heavy metals such as chromium. The level of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) - the element most essential for the survival of fish, invertebrates, bacteria and underwater plants - has also fallen to below acceptable levels over the past two decades, making the waters inhospitable to life.  In 2002, the DO level of the Meghna was 7.5mg per litre, falling to 6mg by 2011 - both acceptable levels. From 2012 to 2016, however, the DO level fell to as low as 4.6mg.  Since 2007, the level of Electrical Conductivity (EC) - a measurement of dissolved pollutants in the water - has increased from 124 to 164 microsiemens per centimetre. Prior to 2007, it was around 100. The rise in the EC level directly affects the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Although COD standard for drinking water is 4mg per litre, the rate in the Meghna was found to be as high as 38mg from May 2016 to Jan 2017. What can be done? A director of the environment department, who wished to remain anonymous, said selected areas will be declared as Ecological Critical Areas (ECA) to prohibit the setting up of environmentally dangerous industries in order to maintain water quality and to prevent pollution.  \"In addition, the government has planned a number of economic zones both upstream and downstream of the intake points,\" he said. The Department of Environment (DoE) is providing technical assistance for the Dhaka Wasa project. \"If these areas can be declared as an ECA, industrialization can go in a planned and controlled way,\" said Md Mustafizur Rahman Akhand, DoE deputy director.   \"Industries with state of the art technology to treat their waste properly will be eligible to get environmental clearance certificate in the ECA. Also, existing industries can also be monitored properly.\" "

At a press conference at the party president's political office in Dhanmondi on Wednesday evening, Quader spoke to the media on various current issues. \"There should be some clarification about keeping some of our top leaders out of the election,\" he said. The ruling party has not nominated its joint general secretaries Abdur Rahman and Jahangir Kabir Nanak, and organizing secretaries Bahauddin Nasim, Ahmad Hossain and BM Mozammel Haque for the upcoming 11th general election. These leaders will be involved in conducting the election activities of the party, Quader said.  \"Our experienced and skilled leadership, who should be conducting the electoral activities, usually take part in the elections themselves. This time our leader has taken a decision,\" he added. \"There are many precedents of this. In India, BJP keeps its top leaders out of election,\" Quader said. He said Prime Minister and Awami League President Sheikh Hasina had sat down with these top leaders and given them some instructions. \"In democratic politics, not everybody takes part in elections. In India, many leaders avoid elections in order to help their parties,\" he said."

      "text": "Architect Mohammed Rezwan's brainchild project is one of twenty-five designs and innovations to be exhibited at 'Design with the 90%'   Floating school innovator Architect Mohammed Rezwan's designs - floating school, training centre and health clinic of Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha - have once again been selected for inclusion in the forthcoming exhibition, 'Design with the 90%' organized by Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  The 'Design with the 90%' exhibition is focused on design solutions that addressed the most basic needs of the 90% of the world's population not traditionally served by professional designers. It is the third in a series of themed exhibitions that demonstrate how design can be a dynamic force in transforming and, in many cases, saving lives.  The exhibition will be on view from September 13, 2018 - May 19, 2019 at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Headquarters Discovery Center in Seattle, Washington, United States.  The exhibition will highlight 25 designs and innovations including affordable and sustainable shelter, food, drinking water, sanitation, education, and health solutions for the most marginalized communities around the world. The exhibition will feature Shidhulai's school-boat along with D-Rev's ReMotion Knee (an affordable prosthetic that helps to restore natural movement), Bernard Kiwia's Bicycle Phone Charger (a mobile phone charger made from scrap bike and radio parts), PATH's Freeze-Preventive Vaccine Carrier (ensure the right temperature to keep vaccines from accidentally freezing during transport to rural areas) and other innovations. The organizers selected Rezwan's school-boat because of its innovative approach towards making education more accessible, and because of the way it helps integrate sustainable alternative technologies with Bangladeshi vernacular tradition. Furthermore, the school-boat now defines the social design movement by improving the daily living conditions of people in flood-prone areas. \"We are thrilled to bring this exhibition to the Gates Foundation to highlight the important role that design and innovative approaches can play in solving some of the world's most critical challenges that determine the quality of life for millions of people around the world,\" says Ms. Charlotte Beall, Deputy Director of the Gates Foundation Discovery Center.  Architect Mohammed Rezwan is the founding Executive Director of 'Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha'. He invented 'floating education system' to ensure access to year round and quality education in flood-prone regions. He developed, expanded, and sustained floating schools over 16 years period.  The non-profit organization, 'Shidhulai Swaniravar Sangstha' has been rendering exemplary service in providing education to children in flood-prone areas, who otherwise have no access to education. Rezwan introduced floating school in 2002, and other organizations started replicating it in 2010s. Now floating schools are replicated in eight countries - transforming the lives of millions. \"Architects usually design for the people who have the capacity to build buildings.  \"I always thought, 'Why can't an architect design wonderful things for the poor people living in rural communities?' That's the reason all of our projects are design solutions to solve social problems. After 16 years of designing the school-boat, our work will be showcased at the Gates Foundation again, for the second time. As an architect I am really honored, I hope we will be able to develop more life-transforming designs and impact more lives in flood-prone areas. Also I hope this recognition will encourage young designers, architects and non-designers to develop such design approaches to improve the rural communities around the world,\" says Rezwan. Also, the S AM (Swiss Architecture Museum) exhibited Rezwan's school-boat design in the 'Bengal Stream' architectural exhibition in Basel in Switzerland during 2017-2018. This travelling exhibition is scheduled to present in Architecture Center Arc-en-reve in Bordeaux in France, German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt, and Royal Academy in London during 2018-2020."

A circular issued by the Public Administration Ministry on Monday made Deputy Commissioner and District Magistrate Golamur Rahman and replaced him with Power Division Deputy Secretary Shahriaz. The move follows a written sexual harassment allegation submitted to the ministry by a female officer in the Natore district administration. The officer in her letter, submitted on October 24, said she had been working in that district since 2017. Golamur Rahman became Natore DC on October 9. She said Golamur had transferred her to another department immediately after taking up the post. He also asked her to take official documents and meet him at the circuit house where he lived alone. Three days after joining, the female officer alleged, Golamur connected with her on Facebook Messenger and sent her frequent messages. Often he sent the messages at late hours, seeking explanations from her the next morning if she did not reply. On October 15 he made grossly inappropriate proposals to the female officer. The Dhaka Tribune has received what appear to be screenshots of messages between the officer and Golamur Rahman. The messages attest to the allegations made by the officer. However, the Dhaka Tribune has not been able to verify the authenticity of these screenshots. On October 22 the Public Administration Ministry transferred the female officer to another district. Golamur also tried to interfere with this transfer."

      "text": "\nLittle headway into Tasfia murder case\n\n\n\n\nAnwar Hussain, Chattogram\n\n\n\n\n Published at 04:18 pm May 7th, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nInvestigators have made little progress into the murder case of Chattogram schoolgirl Tasfia Amin, found dead in the city's Patenga area on May 2.\n\nPolice have arrested Tasfia's friend Adnan Mirza from Khulshi on Thursday night. The family of Tasfia and Adnan claim that the murder mystery will be solved when suspect Sohail is arrested.\nMohammad Amin, the victim's father, said, \"Sohail is a close friend of Adnan. Everything will be solved if Sohail is brought to book.\"\nHe alleged that Adnan had his daughter killed by his friends. \"I want exemplary punishment for the killers,\" Amin added.\nChattogram Metropolitan Police (Karnaphuli Zone) Assistant Commissioner Zahedul Islam said they were conducting drives to arrest Sohail and other accused, hoping to find out the reason behind the killing \"within a very short time.\"\nAmin filed a case with Patenga police accusing six persons including Adnan, a ninth grader of Bangladesh Elementary School, Sohail, 16, Sowkot Miraz, 16, Asif Mizan, 23, Imtiaj Sultan Ekram, 24, and Firoj, 30.\nAdnan is the son of Iskander Mirza, a businessman.\nAmin claimed that his 16-year-old daughter, who studied at Sunshine Grammar School, and Adnan were involved in a romantic relationship for about two to three months. But their affair turned sour for some reason. That is why, Amin suspects, Adnan and the other accused took his daughter to the beach and killed her.\nTasfia's father accused police of wasting time. \"Police can arrest the accused within a short time if they want. The reason behind the delay is not clear to us,\" he said.\nIskandar claimed that his son was innocent, saying that his family too wanted the murder to be solved.\nTasfia's family members said she had gone out to meet Adnan around 5pm on May 1.\n\"My son is innocent. He (Adnan) left the house at 5pm that day. He saw off the girl in the evening and went to his aunt's at 7pm,\" he said.\n\"He went out again after receiving a call from Tasfia's father and was with him until 11pm. He returned home at 11:45pm. Adnan was in the house until 5pm the next day. Then how was my son involved with the murder?\"\nPolice: We're trying our best\nPolice said that Adnan developed a relationship with Tasfia through Facebook five months ago. He had earlier studied at Sunshine Grammar School and later shifted to Bangladesh Elementary School.\nTasfia had been missing since Tuesday after going out to meet Adnan. The duo met at a restaurant in the city's Golpahara on Tuesday evening. Adnan's friend Sohail was also with them.\nAfter Tasfia's mother called her over phone, they went out of the restaurant and left the place separately by auto-rickshaws. But Tasfia did not return home.\nHours later, Tasfia's family called Adnan and wanted to know her whereabouts. Adnan went to Tasfia's house around 8pm and stayed with them until 11pm.\nThe girl's body was found on the concrete block of the Karnaphuli River at the Naval Road area the next day with multiple injury marks to her knees and forehead.\nAccording to the case filed by Amin, Tasfia's face was bruised and battered and there were signs that her body had been dragged around.\nTasfia's mobile phone could not be recovered. Meanwhile, her viscera samples have been sent to Dhaka to ascertain the cause of death.\nEarlier, police had requested a Chattogram court to allow them to interrogate Adnan for 10 days in their custody. But the court rejected the plea and ordered on Sunday to question the suspect in presence of the superintendent of Gazipur Juvenile Correction Centre, since he was not an adult.\nPatenga police's Officer-in-Charge Abul Kashem Bhuiyan said, \"We are trying our best to arrest the accused. We are conducting raids. We will be able to determine the real cause of death after getting the post-mortem report.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "UN Under-Secretary-General Adama Dieng praises Bangladesh for the response to the refugee crisis The United Nations (UN) on Saturday commended the commitment demonstrated by the government of Bangladesh in supporting the Rohingya refugees and stressed that the root causes of the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar must be addressed. \"The Bangladeshi people demonstrated very early on, their solidarity towards the Rohingya people, providing them with shelter and support when they arrived,\" said UN Under Secretary General and Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng. The under secretary general was addressing the closing session of a workshop titled \"Fostering Peaceful and Inclusive Communities in Bangladesh: The Role of Religious Leaders and Actors\" at a hotel in the city. He stressed the importance of ensuring Rohingya refugees are given opportunities to uplift themselves educationally and have access to livelihood opportunities in Bangladesh until they can return to Myanmar. Adama Dieng said religious leaders can play a very important role by promoting messages of peace and tolerance and by fostering dialogue between the Rohingya refugees and host communities. \"I hope the religious leaders and actors, as well as policy makers and civil society representatives present here today will continue to show this same humanity\", Dieng said. Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Md Nojibur Rahman, conveyed Sheikh Hasina's message of support for interfaith initiatives that promote social cohesion and respond to pressing development challenges in Cox's Bazar district resulting from the influx of Rohingya refugees. Stressing that the government of Bangladesh was fully committed to working with the United Nations and civil society to address the Rohingya crisis, the principal secretary encouraged religious leaders to also support this cause. UN Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh Mia Seppo emphasized that the government and the people of Bangladesh are the biggest donors to the Rohingya response.  She said the UN is committed to assisting Bangladesh, but it was host communities in Cox's Bazar who were the true 'first responders'. Mia Seppo praised Bangladeshi host communities for their compassion, stating that Bangladesh's traumatic experience in 1971, with millions of Bangladeshis forced to flee as refugees, had made the country particularly generous towards refugees from other nations. She also underlined that the biggest challenge in the region is to ensure a sense of hope for a better future, and that interventions need to address the urgent needs of Bangladeshi host communities affected by the crisis, just as they also aim to improve conditions for the refugees themselves. During the second and last day of the event, a broad range of Bangladeshi religious leaders and actors, government policymakers, academics, civil society and United Nations representatives discussed ways to promote dialogue and social cohesion in Cox's Bazar following the influx of Rohingya refugees. The event was jointly organized by the United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the Save and Serve Foundation. The meeting also focused on how the Plan of Action for Religious Leaders and Actors to Prevent Incitement to Violence that Could Lead to Atrocity Crimes, developed by the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect and launched by the United Nations Secretary General in July 2017, could be implemented in the areas in Cox's Bazar affected by the Rohingya crisis. Meanwhile, Deputy Spokesman for the UN SecretaryGeneral Farhan Haq said the UN is trying to facilitate the safe and voluntary return of the Rohingya refugees to Myanmar. \"We need to make sure that the conditions in Myanmar are conducive to their return,\" he told reporters in a regular briefing at the UN headquarters on Friday."

      "text": "The NGO is getting accolades from the world over for its astounding architectural beauty Award-winning Friendship Centre, an architectural establishment of a non government organization (NGO) Friendship brings hope to the people in northern char areas of the country. The NGO brings a ray of sunshine to the lives of people through  many training programs it offers at its Friendship Centre in the Gaibandha district, such as teaching, medicine, law and even theatre. The establishment, located in Madaner para, in the Kanchipara union of the Fulchhari upazila, Gaibandha, has impressive architecture designed by eminent architect Kashef Mahboob Chowdhury. The Friendship Centre built as a live-in training centre for the NGO's community social workers that helps people inhabiting nearby chars (riverine islands) inspired by the Buddhist monastic architecture of the North Bengal flood plains, was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2016. They were inspired by Louis Kahn, an American architect, who designed Buddhist monasteries with its forms and planned drawing on influences that integrated structural designs, which blends with natural serenity and modernity in perfectly. The NGO is getting accolades from the world over for its astounding architectural beauty. Offices, library, meeting rooms, and prayer and tea rooms adorn its spectacular premises in pavilion-like buildings surrounded by courts and pools. The Centre is also rented out for outside meetings, training, and conferences as a means of generating income.  The local hand-made brick construction has been inspired by the monastic aesthetic works of the 3rd century BC ruins of Mahasthangarh, the earliest urban archaeological site found in Bangladesh. In line with the rural orientation the single storey building is surrounded with greenery that it looks like a greenfield in a bird's eye view.  As Gaibandha is susceptible to flooding and earthquakes, and whose low-bearing soil has a low bearing capacity, the building is surrounded by embankments with a water run-off pumping facility which increases its beauty and protects the establishment. Constructed and finished primarily of one material - local hand-made bricks - the spaces are woven out of pavilions, courtyards, pools and greens, corridors and shadows encircled by trees. Lokman Hossain, manager of the centre said, to help and empower one of the neglected parts of the country, Friendship, the NGO established this 32000 sq ft training centre in 2011 on 7 bighas of land costing Tk8 crore in the riverine island of Gaibandha. The Friendship Centre is divided into two sections, the outer \"Ka\" block for the offices, library, and training classrooms and the inner \"Kha\" block for the residential section. At a time, 80 people can be trained here in four separate classrooms. He said: \"Our programs, including health, education, capacity building and women empowerment, are targeted at some of the poorest people in the country.\" He elaborated on their vision in making the building with the idea \"Simplicity is the intent, monastic is the feel.\""

The Rohingyas, including 17 children and six women, arrived on the other side of the border of the Kajiatoli area under the Kasba upazila on Friday evening to enter Bangladesh. They were escorted back by the BSF members on Tuesday morning in about six vehicles, confirmed Gopinathpur union parishad Chairman SM Mannan Jahangir and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) 25th Battalion Commander Lt Col Muhammad Golam Kabir. According to BSF Tripura Frontier sources, the 31 Rohingyas were officially handed over to the nearest Amtoli police station on Tuesday morning,  and later in the day, the West Tripura District Judicial Court in India put them in jail for the next 14 days Tension in border Gopinathpur Chairman SM Mannan Jahangir claimed the BSF was trying to force the refugees into Bangladesh. The BGB, meanwhile, intensified their vigil to prevent the Rohingyas from entering the country. Multiple flag meetings between BGB and BSF yielded no results. Mannan said the BGB had tightened security at the border to deter illegal entry into Bangladesh. Reports were circulating since Saturday that the BSF was trying to push in the Rohingyas, which the Indian force refuted in a statement. Inhumane situation The BSF set up tents for the Rohingyas and supplied them with food, before taking them back in phases on Tuesday. For the past four days, the 31 Rohingyas were living under the sky in the chilling cold, which made them ill. Cold and hunger took toll on the children as well. Indian central government denies involvement The Indian government said it is not a party to movements of Rohingyas, mentioning that it is aware of media reports of alleged movement into Bangladesh by some such persons, reports UNB. Also Read- BGB-BSF flag meeting yields no solution for 31 Rohingyas on B'baria border \"The government (India) is not a party to such movements,\" said a Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson in response to a question about the presence of Rohingya refugees stranded on the India-Bangladesh boundary in Tripura. The spokesperson said they will work with their neighbours to handle such matters through mutual consultation. \"The government is aware of the presence of 31 persons originally from the Rakhine State of Myanmar, currently at the Zero Line on the India-Bangladesh border,\" said the MEA spokesperson. Too little, too late? Reports published on Tuesday in the Dhaka Tribune said over 1,300 Rohingyas have arrived since May 2018. Though displeased at the arrival of Rohingyas from India to an already-overburdened Bangladesh, Dhaka is yet to take up this issue with New Delhi, according to a senior government official. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and the officials said that the issue will soon be raised with the Indians. However, they could not come up with a satisfactory answer when asked why this issue has not yet been discussed with the country's first neighbour; especially since Rohingyas have been arriving in Bangladesh from India since May last year. Some of the officials expressed their \"displeasure\" with India over the issue and questioned India's \"good intentions\" regarding helping Bangladesh on this issue."

      "text": "The move has yet to be endorsed by UN agencies and major bilateral donors A global rights group cast doubt on Friday on Dhaka's claims that thousands of Rohingya refugees are ready to move to Bhashan Char that critics say is prone to natural disasters. Dhaka has long wanted to move 100,000 people to the silt islet of Bhashan Char to relieve overcrowded mainland camps where almost a million Rohingya have lived since fleeing a brutal military crackdown in Myanmar in 2017. Officials have said that between 6,000-7,000 Rohingya have already expressed their willingness to be relocated to the island, starting in November.  But Fortify Rights said it interviewed 14 Rohingya at three camps, including some who appeared on lists of refugees allegedly willing to go, and found that none had been consulted \"and all opposed it.\" \"The island is not a sustainable solution for refugees and no one knows that better than the #Rohingya themselves,\" says @matthewfsmith @FortifyRights. We interviewed 14 Rohingya no one said they were willing to go to Bhasan Char. @AFP: https://t.co/TSMv12qBY7 One woman on the list told Fortify Rights: \"If the Bangladesh government forces me to go to the island, I will commit suicide by drinking poison here in the camp. I will not go there... No one told me I was on the list.\" \"We are afraid of living near the water. People say that it takes four hours by boat to reach the island... Even if they force me to go there, I will not go,\" the US-based group quoted another woman as saying. It added that officials were pressuring Rohingya camp leaders to identify those to be relocated, and that it had seen a copy of a list identifying more than 70 families. \"The island is not a sustainable solution for refugees and no one knows that better than the Rohingya themselves,\" said Fortify Rights' Chief Executive Officer Matthew Smith.  Global rights group casts doubt on #Bangladesh claims that thousands of #Rohingya refugees are ready to move to a new island, saying many seem to oppose it and have not been consulted on the matterhttps://t.co/ERxHnXOKcD Other rights groups have also expressed misgivings about moving people to the island in the Bay of Bengal - which takes around three hours by boat to reach. The move has yet to be endorsed by UN agencies and major bilateral donors. Earlier this week US Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia Alice G Wells urged caution during a House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. \"We urge Bangladesh to postpone any refugee relocations to Bhashan Char until independent experts can determine it is a suitable location,\" she said. Bangladesh is growing impatient with the Rohingya's presence in the country, and has clamped down on them since a repatriation attempt collapsed in August with not one of the refugees agreeing to return to Myanmar.  This week the project's chief architect told AFP that the island and its storm-proof buildings would be protected by 11-feet high perimeter, calling it \"one of the safest embankments\" in Bangladesh. \"It will be safer than any other coastal region in Bangladesh,\" Ahmed Mukta from London-based firm MDM Architects said, saying it would be \"heaven\" for the Rohingya compared to their crowded, \"inhumane\" camps."

      "text": "Bangladesh to hold expo in Brazil from November 7 to 8 to explore the export market The increase in import cost of onion is responsible for the sudden upsurge in onion prices at Bangladeshi kitchen markets, says Senior Commerce Secretary Md Mofizul Islam. He said: \"Onion prices have gone up in India by Tk10 to 12 per kilograms due to flood. As a result, the import cost has also gone up and Bangladeshi markets are witnessing the effect.\" The secretary said this in a press briefing on the outcome of Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi's recently concluded tour to Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The commerce minister visited the South American countries from Aug 14 to 24 to explore the markets to boost export.  Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said: \"Bangladesh will hold an expo in Brazil from November 7 to 8 to explore the export markets, especially for apparel goods.\" The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce & Industries (FBCCI), with assistance from the government, will organize the expo while Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) will coordinate the event.   Onion prices at the capital's kitchen markets shot up to Tk50 to 55 per kg from Tk40 last week, which the traders blamed on supply shortage. Nurul Haque, a Karwan Bazar-based wholesaler, said there was minimal import of onion after Eid-ul-Azha, causing the prices increase. \"The onion market is heavily dependent on imports, especially from India,\" he said. The wholesaler however hinted that prices might come down in a day or two as onion imports would start to increase again.   According to traders, Bangladesh consumes about 2.8 million tons of onion annually, of which about 50% are met by local produces and the rest with imported ones.   In fiscal year 2017-18, 2.33 million tons of onion was produced in 212,194 hectares in the country."

      "headline": "36% of Dhaka's water bodies filled up in 9 years",
      "authors": "Md Saidun Nabi",
      "text": "Experts say the growing trend of land grabbing has put Dhaka under massive threat At least 3,483 acres of water bodies and lowlands across the metropolitan area in Dhaka have been filled up in the last nine years, causing concern among experts and environmentalists. Concerned by the earth filling in the name of development, the experts have said the government and its relevant agencies must take a strong position against land grabbers. Speaking at a media briefing on the situation of filling up of water bodies in Dhaka and its surrounding areas, violating the city's Detailed Area Plan (DAP), they said the government must also take proper and strict measures in restoring the water bodies and wetlands. The briefing took place on Thursday at the Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) office in Dhaka. Speaking at the event, the environment experts expressed their resentment as a number of government agencies, along with private organizations and individuals, have filled in many water bodies, low-lying areas, canals and rivers not only in and around Dhaka, but across the country. However, they did not categorically list how much wetland areas have faced earth filling or grabbing by the government agencies. Presenting a study on the topic, Adil Mohammad Khan, general secretary of Bangladesh Institute of Planners, said that Dhaka city has lost 36% of its water bodies to earth filling, considering the DAP adopted for the capital in 2010. The parts of the city under the jurisdiction of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkah (Rajuk) had 100,937 acres of water bodies and lowlands nine years ago, but 22% of those - 22,156 acres - have been filled up since then, greatly contributing to the perennial water-logging issue, he said.  However, the study, prepared based on satellite images, did not identify the land grabbers, he said, pledging that their identities will be confirmed and disclosed in the next report. Adil requested the government agencies responsible for protecting and monitoring the water bodies to publish an annual report, with the officials concerned held accountable for their duties. Citing the rampant and growing trend of land grabbing and environmental degradation, TIB Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman said Dhaka is facing an existential threat. \"If the authorities responsible are being negligent in duty, people have to raise their voices,\" he said. \"There is no scope of having faith (on action or pledges against the accused). Many in the government and in the administration do not want the rule of law to be in place,\" he viewed. Iftekharuzzaman attributed the current situation to the parliament, where 62% of the lawmakers are actually businessmen, saying: \"Now we can see the negative impact of having so many businessmen representing (the people) in the house. Businessmen, in association with the administration and politicians, harm the environment.\" Building public consensus emphasized The TIB chief suggested dissolving the tripartite syndicate and building public consensus to this end. Welcoming the High Court orders on the illegal BGMEA building and Modhumoti housing project, Iftekharuzzaman said the problem is that the government is not proactive in fighting the land grabbers. He also went on to say that the mindless earth filling and grabbing of water bodies clearly depict that irregularities have taken an organizational shape in the country.  Iftekharuzzaman said an upcoming revised DAP must address the matter seriously. Rajuk, which is largely blamed for the sorry state of the water bodies, must be made accountable for the losses incurred, and its activities have to be transparent, he said. Land grabbers to be punished on the spot Mubasshar Hussain, former president of Institute of Architects, Bangladesh (IEB), said land grabbers have to be tried and punished instantly on the spot, regardless of their political identity. He also suggested that a stricter law and tougher watchdog can stop such criminal offences. \"If we can't go for technology-based monitoring, we will lag behind and will help the culprits to take advantage,\" he opined. Bangladesh Poribesh Andolan (Bapa) Joint Secretary Iqbal Habib said: \"We are already late in addressing the issue. I hope the government will take this report into account and in due course, will take necessary measures.\" \"The filling of water bodies gained momentum in 1995, and the crisis has been deepening since then,\" he stated. Most water bodies were not marked in the previous development map until the DAP was issued in 2010, leading to the current situation, he said, adding that the authorities concerned should have put emphasis on tech-based surveillance to check the situation. Feroz Ahmed Kanak, a research associate at the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services, who released another report at the event, said the Amin Bazar landfill is a burning example of grabbing. It was built on a 52-acre land in 2004, but has expanded over the years to nearly 100 acres, mainly due to the negligence of the authorities, he said. \"Even before the DAP was designed, the dumping yard was not considered as a flood flow zone,\" mentioned Feroz. Jointly organised by TIB, BAPA, BIP, Nodi O Poribesh Unnoyon Parishad, and Bangladesh Environment Lawyers' Association (Bela), the event was addressed, among others, by BUET Professor Ishrat Islam."

Water Development Board Executive Engineer Abu Raihan and Sub Assistant Engineer Ashrafuzzaman Khan said strong currents, huge waves and an onrush of flood waters from the upper regions are causing the erosion. On a visit to the area on Monday it was  found that the authorities were trying to stop the erosion by erecting a barrier made of concrete cement blocks, stones, CC blocks and sand-bags to protect the area. Subhash Chandra Roy, president of the distriict Puja Udjapin Committee said the Meghna has devoured the basements of four Hindu Temples along with other houses on the Harishava Road. When contacted, Water Development Board Engineer Mohammad Rafiqullah said they have placed 2,500 geobags at vulnerable points till 6 pm on Sunday. Sub Assistant Engineer Ashrafuzzaman Khan, who surveyed the depth of the river, said it was about 45 to 65 feet at different points of the erosion area, and a length of almost 200 metres had been eroded. Another 500-metre area is under threat of fresh erosion as many cracks have developed in different spots.     Meanwhile, hundreds of curious men, women and children gathered at the erosion-heavy sites where police, and DB men were deployed to prevent people from visiting or loitering around vulnerable points. Local councilor Md Ali Majhee said at least 35 families have lost their homes so far due to the erosion along 200 metres of the town protection embankment. Many families are on the verge of becoming homeless, he added. Deputy Commissioner Shawkkat Osman said the district administration has taken steps to take the victims to safer places. Deputy Minister for Water Resources AKM Enamul Haque Shamim MP visited the area on Monday. He said, \" We have taken steps to protect the area from the river erosion.\""

The new act proposes to enhance existing fine of Tk50,000 to Tk5 lakh and also inflict one-year jail to persons at fault. \"The cabinet in principle approved the draft of Mongla Port Authority Act 2019 by replacing The Chalna Port Authority Ordinance, 1976 making some additions, adjustments and rearrangements of the laws,\" Cabinet Secretary Mohammad Shafiul Alam told a news briefing at the secretariat in Dhaka on Monday. The Mongla, earlier known as Chalna, was renamed as Mongla in 1987 and the port had so far been running under The Chalna Port Authority Ordinance, 1976, he said. Definition of the inland vessels has been incorporated into the new law adding few more terms such as lease, terminal, berth and container freight station to it. Moreover, the new law proposes incorporation of some sections and changes as well into it, he said. Under the proposed law one would now face jail term up to one year and Tk5 lakh fine instead of existing Tk50,000 for polluting environment, he said. The new law suggested enhancement of jail term up to two years from existing six months and Tk2 lakh fine from existing Tk50,000 for violating the law. It also recommended for six months imprisonment and Tk2 lakh fine from the existing six months and Tk50,000 respectively on charges of evading tolls, he said. Trial of the offences committed under the law will be held in accordance with the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code), he added.  Simultaneously, Shafiul said, in the proposed law there would be a board of seven members instead of four to run the port. Two new sections, one with provision of \"restricted port are\" and the rest for appointing operator, have been added to the law, he informed. The cabinet also approved the draft of two policies- Neuro-Developmental Disabilities (NDD) Related Integrated/Special Education Policy 2019 and Non Neuro-Developmental Disabilities Related Integrated/Special Education Policy 2019 by incorporating a set of guidelines. \"In line with the policies none can establish educational institutions for the disabled people without prior permission of the government. If anyone violates the policies he or she will be liable for punishment,\" the cabinet secretary said. The policy suggested having at least 75 students for approval of setting up an educational institution for the disabled, he said. It should be ensured that there would be a teacher against each five autistic students in such institutions, he said. At the beginning of the meeting, the prime minister unveiled a book of poetry titled \"Swapno Panshi\" written by Science and Technology Minister Yafesh Osman. Besides, the cabinet approved in principle the draft of \"The Chandpur Science and Technology University Act, 2019.\" The cabinet also approved two separate proposals to form a company titled \"Start Up Bangladesh Limited\" under Bangladesh Computer Council to create more entrepreneurs in the country's ICT sector and a joint venture company titled \"Bangladesh Power Equipment Manufacturing Company Limited\" in partnership with the state-run Rural Power Company Limited and Chinese private company Shenzhen Star Instrument Company Ltd.

      "text": "The discussion was organized by Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) at their office in Dhaka Lawyers and rights activists have urged those wishing to get married to learn the related rights, and conditions before tying the knot. The call was made at a discussion on directives issued by the High Court after public interest litigation (PIL) on accessing justice after rape, and discrimination in marriage certificates. The discussion was organized by Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) at their office in Dhaka on Sunday afternoon. Supreme Court Advocate and BLAST legal advisor SM Rezaul Karim said: \"The major problem for us is that we have limited knowledge about marriage. If everyone knew about the safeguards available to them, it would be much easier for them to get justice.\" Aynunnahar Siddiqua, another Supreme Court advocate, said many lawyers were among those who did not know marriage law well, and misleading explanations from such lawyers was creating misconceptions among the public. \"Young girls are victimized as they are not aware of their rights. Everyone should learn about their rights before getting married,\" she added. Referring to the recent verdict on a PIL filed jointly by Blast, Naripokkho, and Bangladesh Mohila Parishad, where the High Court Division directed the government to omit the word \"Kumari\" (virgin) from in front of the bride's name on Muslim marriage registration forms, she said: \"The court also directed to mention if the groom was married or divorced, decreasing discrimination in the marriage registration forms further.\" Supreme Court Advocate Tajul Islam said many women did not know they could file for divorce without permission from their husbands by approaching the court. Advocate Rezaul Karim said while the government wished to raise awareness about rights, but field level officials responsible for circulating the information appear to be unwilling, on the basis of recent incidents. \"This is where the duty of the journalist comes in, as they can enrich news reports with information about rights so people can learn more,\" he added."

Visiting several spots in the city, the Dhaka Tribune found moderate traffic at the hubs in the morning, but it rose sharply later in the day. Transport staff said, holidaymakers started returning from Friday morning, and it is expected that traffic would have increased after 8pm on Saturday, and Sunday morning.  Among the three public transport options, waterways seemed to be busier during the day. Abul Kalam, manager of a Shyamoli bus counter in Sayedabad bus terminal said, he had witnessed huge traffic in Chittagong since noon as the passengers were trying to reach Dhaka before the rush-hour.  According to Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) data, over eight million people had left Dhaka by trains, buses, and launches till Tuesday to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr--one of the biggest religious festivals for Muslims-- Eid was celebrated across the country on Wednesday. Jahirul Haque, a private service holder, who returned to Dhaka on Saturday morning by a launch from Bhola, said he came back early so that he could have a day's rest before commencing work today.  Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, Abdur Rashid, a relative of a passenger returning to the capital from Khulna by train, claimed that the Dhaka-bound Sundarban Express had been running late by two hours.  Kamalapur Railway Station Master (acting) Sitangshu Chakrabarty said, the number of returning passengers had increased. \"However, there isn't a big rush of Dhaka-bound people to the extent we had assumed before, and the trains are running mostly on time.\" Meanwhile, the Dhaka Tribune's correspondents in Madaripur and Manikganj informed that there was a huge rush of vehicles in Shimulia-Kathalbari, and Paturia-Daulatdia routes.  Abdus Salam Miah, manager of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) at Kathalbari point, said: \"Generally, 18 ferries are operating on the route to transport people. But since Friday, three more ferries began operating in order to meet the huge demand for transport.\" The traffic inspector of the Kathalbari launch terminal said, there was a huge influx of Dhaka-bound passengers on Saturday, all launches were operating there with discipline, and they ensured that no vehicles were charging extra money for the journey."

      "text": "'We have to determine how much industrialization should be allowed in a particular area so that tourism, salt and fishing industries do not go extinct' Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA) and Waterkeepers Bangladesh on Friday demanded that foreign investors invest in green energy, rather than in a coal-based power plant in Coxs Bazar.    The demand was echoed at a press briefing at the Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU) in the capital.  In the press briefing, the two environment-based organizations have also demanded that foreign investors to pull out the finances they have already invested in environmentally damaging coal-based power plant.  They also urged the government to conduct the scientific survey-strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) before planning to set up any large scale industries and buildings in the south-east region of the country.  They added: \"We have to determine how much industrialization should be allowed in a particular area so that tourism, salt and fishing industries do not go extinct.\" Human right activists Sultana Kamal expressing concern over government's plan to construct a coal-based plant said: \"This will destroy Cox's Bazar\". She also said: \"Few years back, we campaigned as Cox's Bazar being one of the most beautiful places in the world, but now we are literally strangling the life out of it with the construction of a coal-based power plant.  At the conference, Iftekharuzzaman, executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) emphasized the needs to conduct a survey to establish an industry. Companies like JICA surveyed and invested money in the Matarbari Project but they did not reveal the negative impacts it would have on the environment. Sharif Jamil, general secretary of BAPA and coordinator of Waterkeepers Bangladesh, published a report titled \"The tourist capital of Bangladesh endangered by plans to build the largest coal power hub in the world\" at the press conference. He said 17 fired coal power plants with a generating capacity of 17,944 megawatts (MW) of electricity are proposed for construction in 25-km of Cox's Bazar. Besides, 13 of the 17 coal plants are proposed for construction within 10 kilometres of each other on flood-prone Matarbari and Moheshkhali Islands. The cluster of eight coal plants proposed for Moheshkhali Island will make it the largest coal plant hub in the world.  In addition, Cox's Bazar coal plants will generate 72 million tons of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) every year by 2031. The emission of carbon dioxide will be way more than countries like Albania, Armenia, Bhutan, Cambodia, Congo, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Senegal and Zambia combined, confirmed Jamil.  Terming these projects as harmful the speakers demanded renewable energy instead of coal-based power plant considering the impact.   Sultana Kamal chaired the press conference, while Executive Director of Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) Iftekharuzzaman, BAPA's executive vice-president Md. Abdul Matin, Joint Secretary Sharmin Murshid, President of Cox's Bazar branch of BAPA Fazlul Quader Chowdhury, and Abu Bakkar Siddique, member secretary of Maheshkhali branch  also spoke  in the conference."

The plane made the landing on Friday afternoon after one of its front tyres got damaged. Biman General Manager (Public Relations) Shakil Meraj said the pilot of the Dhaka-bound flight, carrying 61 passengers, noticed that one of its front tyres got damaged soon after it took off from Osmani International Airport in Sylhet at 3:30pm. Controller of Osmani International Airport AKM Anisuzzaman Talukder said: \"There was a loud noise soon after the flight took off. Later, part of a tyre was found on the runway. \"The tyre might have burst.\" The matter was informed to Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport through the control tower and a special arrangement was in place at the airport to face the situation, said an official at the security section of the Sylhet airport, preferring anonymity. However, the flight made an emergency landing at the Dhaka airport safely around 4:10pm, Shakil said. He also said all the passengers and the pilot along with his crewmembers disembarked from the aircraft unharmed. Earlier on February 24, another Biman Bangladesh Airlines aircraft made an emergency landing at Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong following a hijacking bid by a miscreant. The suspected hijacker was later overpowered and arrested during an eight-minute commando operation. He later succumbed to his injuries. The Dubai-bound Biman flight via Chittagong took off from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 5:13pm and made the landing at the Chittagong airport at 5:41pm on the same day."

But, like any configuration, it comes from a financial implication. And at present, South Africa is relooking our global presence,\" said Ambassador Dr Anil Sooklal at a lecture session in Dhaka on Wednesday. Sooklal is the deputy director general for Asia Pacific and the Middle East of Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) in South Africa. Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) organized the lecture on --Commemorating the Silver Jubilee of Diplomatic Relations between South Africa and Bangladesh -- at its auditorium. \"I think, after 25 years of democracy and having established our presence globally, it will be a time to revitalize it. I can assure you that if we open any new office in Asia, it will be in Bangladesh,\" Sooklal said. He said they discussed it at a meeting on Tuesday about opening an embassy in Bangladesh. \"We have a political agenda and decision that we will have to open an embassy in Dhaka,\" he added. The South African envoy acknowledged that Bangladesh people are now facing difficulties in processing visa application from Colombo. Noting that South Africa will shift this responsibility to New Delhi from Colombo soon, he said, \"South Africa is in a very advanced process of introducing e-visa within the next year to alleviate much of challenges you are facing now in terms of getting visa.\" Chaired by Foreign Secretary Md Shahidul Haque, the lecture session, was also addressed, by BIISS Director General AKM Abdur Rahman."

Owing to high demand in the market and lucrative prices, a large number of growers are getting more involved in the project, said Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) sources. DAE officials also said they have taken various steps in the project to educate farmers about the harmful effects of using pesticides and chemical fertilizers in vegetables fields. To grow various kinds of vegetables including brinjal, gourd, sweet gourd, kakral, karola, koida, cucumber, cabbage, cauliflower, tomato, potato, poi-shak, palong-shak and data-shak, a DAE team is working with farmers  in Vaterchar of Narayanpur union council, Belabo upazila. Because of the motivation and training, a large number of farmers are now inspired to cultivate more chemical free vegetables using vermicomposting and other organic fertilizers. The farmers are bringing more lands into this form of vegetable cultivation. The union has been declared a model union, the sources said. The farmers hope over one lakh tons of vegetables will be produced in the union this winter season. Ayub Ali, Hamida Begum, and Abul Kashem of Vaterchar village said they have achieved tremendous success in producing various chemical and pesticide free vegetables by using homemade vermicomposting. Many farmers of the village also have become solvent by producing chemical free organic vegetables as demand is very high in the area, said DAE officials. Chandi Das Kundu, director Field Service Wing of Department of Agriculture Extension, says two villages in every upazila will be brought under the 'Safe Vegetable Village' project to cultivate safe vegetables. Narayanpur is one of them, he added. Belabo upazila agriculture officer Naziur Rouf Khan said  a total of 150 farmers have been trained in three blocks of the union to cultivate vegetables on 30-hectares of land this season. On 15 December, a team led by Chairman of Bangladesh Food Safety Authority, Syeda Sarwar Jahan, visited the area. She said a market will be set up in the municipality to sell chemical free and safe vegetables of the upazila."

      "text": "The minister said this is likely if the international community fails to take effective measures to cope with climate change impacts Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister, Md Shahab Uddin, said that Bangladesh may incur a loss of 2% GDP by 2050 if the international community fails to take effective measures to cope with climate change impacts. He said this responding to a starred question placed by treasury bench lawmaker Nasimul Alam Chowdhury of Comilla-8 in parliament with Speaker Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury in the chair on Sunday. In his words: \"If the international community fails to take effective measures to cope with climate change impacts, the country may incur a loss of  2% of its GDP (gross domestic product) by 2050, and as much as 9.4% of its GDP by 2100.\" Citing study findings of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Shahab Uddin said the country suffered a loss of US$ 1.67 billion in 2007, which was equivalent to 6 to 8% of its GDP, due to a devastating cyclone induced by global climate change. He added that a countrywide flood caused a loss of 4.8% of the country's GDP in 1998. The environment minister further said that the government has been implementing various programs across the country to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change."

      "headline": "Seven poems by Kaifi Azmi",
      "authors": "Kaifi Azmi",
      "text": "Poetry Translated by Sudeep Sen  Kaifi Azmi is a major Urdu poet in India who introduced Urdu literature to Indian cinema. He has written many ghazals, and worked as a lyricist, writer and actor in Indian film. He received the Padma Shri, Sahitya Akademi Award for Urdu (1975) for his collection Awaara Sajde and Sahitya Akademi Fellowship for lifetime achievement (2002). He also won the National Film Award for Best Lyrics (1970) for the film Saat Hindustani.   One kiss (Ek bosa)   The moment I kiss these beautiful eyes-- a hundred lamps in the darkness--glow, glitter.  What flowers, what buds, what moon, what stars-- all my rivals--bow at your feet--head lowered.  They begin their dance--the idols of Ajanta, as the long close-lipped caves start to sing.  Flowers bloom in unkempt wilted gardens  on the thirst-wrenched earth--clouds collect, hover.  Momentarily, the world relinquishes cruelty-- momentarily, all stones start to smile.  One moment (Ek lamha)   What we call life, is but a few moments--  and within them that one moment-- when a pair of expressive eyes look up from a teacup  and drown in the heart-- drowning, say:  today, you should keep your silence--   today, I will keep mine. Let us just sit, hand in hand with our mutual gift of grief, with our shared heat of emotions.  Who knows in this moment on some distant mountain-- the snow might start to melt.   Courage (Hausla)   You are the sun--don't hide behind clouds You are the moon--don't stop shinning  You are a coquette--don't subdue your desire You are lightning--don't stop sparking  As yet, love hasn't conceded defeat-- As yet, don't give up on love--   Two nights (Do raatein)   Jumbled-confused emotions, ask not about them. Scared-frightened favors, ask not for them. Again and again her benevolence. Timidly, furtively, arriving at my bed  wanting to explain to me who knows what all-- and then being overcome, by shyness. How fleeting the night was, do not ask.  Let us see whether or not, my sighs bear fruit. Let us see whether or not, this night will pass. Scattered clouds hang aimlessly. Her manner is subdued and scared.  A few tears have appeared on her cheek-- and a few, balanced on her lashes.  Now God only knows whether or not, morning will come.  Calm ocean (Pursukoon samandar)   Tired, defeated ocean--why aren't you agitated? Why aren't you angry?  Breaking the banks--why don't you overflow? Why don't you rise? Why aren't you angry?  On your shores lie shanties born of oppression By builders who have ruined homes. These illegal shanties--why don't you erase them? Why aren't you agitated? Why aren't you angry?  You have no waves, crests or sound-- The helpless, oppressed world looks at you. Why don't you fret-and-foam? Why aren't you angry? Why aren't you agitated?  Tired, defeated ocean--why aren't you agitated? Why aren't you angry?  Custom of giving (Dastoor-e bakshish)   The sea overflows for some--for others, the goblet is empty. What times are these, what unfair apportioning--o wine-bearer?   You haven't grasped yet, the thirst-ridden's disposition-- Your nature of giving, must change--o wine-bearer!   Renewal (Tajdeed)   Tumult, zeal, commotion, yearning-- all these deserted me, when she left. I was certain now, there'd be no laughter, no tears. I'd already laughed aloud, cried aloud.    Someone, today, stretching her limbs  cast rings of silken-light around my sight. Tumult, zeal, commotion, yearning-- these same sparks, smiled once again.  Smile (Tabassum)   The bud--light of this garden's eyes,  night's pearl, spring garden's radiance--  soft, delicate, blooming, rosy-- shiny, innocent, quiet, mischievous-- once showered her myriad charms on me.  Alas, I erased this joyful, beautiful vision. I extended my desirous hands. Hidden within the petals, a spark that burnt my hands.  Still, the bud--smiled at me.   Second storm (Doosra toofan)   And then such a night arrived when taverns closed  and fire-temples stayed unlit.  He, who opposed taverns and temples--  the dissenter, the writer-- he, who always fought against the divine will for life  who for the sake of humanity, challenged God's will--  he, who always fought--fell quiet one day,  masking his face with his own book, falling asleep. However, his pen-- which bears a hundred names and has a hundred tasks-- continues fighting, as before; continues moving, as before-- sometimes in one hand, sometimes in another. Moving along, several fingers got bent-- and some fingers weaving daily, new conspiracies-- daily, new nooses-- and then hung him on a scaffold.  Skies didn't send any consolations, he was not called to the heavens. From his broken ribs  blood trickled, dripped in such a way-- the ropes burnt away, the conspiracies rotted away. This isn't an episode from Noah's age, but it is from the present day. On his tongue's tip, he raised the ocean and decanted it into the wind. On his beak's tip, he picked up the earth and flung it into the void. Jungles and villages trembled, the oceans trembled, unintelligent people trembled, intelligent people trembled. This is not a storm that drowns the earth-- instead, the submerged emerges.  Advice (Mashvarey)   Age: 'This storm, this cyclone, this fast current-- the crackling show, thunderous scenes, dark vastness, heaving ocean-- no guiding light, no stars in the firmament-- the traveler stood still, motionless, disillusioned.'  Youth: 'For him, the companion; for him, the shore's rim-- who caught in a storm-flood, attempts to swim-- dark vastness, heaving ocean-- these currents will keep beating their heads in-- how far will you go, sticking to the shore's rim?'  Celebration of love (Pyar Ka Jashn)   Celebration of love--we must rejoice in a new way. Sadness in any heart--this sadness mustn't stay.  On trembling lips, a promise of fidelity--bravo, I say? Your unsure feet, see where they've carried you--bravo, I say? In my home, your face all lit--bravo, I say? In every home--I must light a lamp, today.  The soul shies away--seeing smoke masking every face. Bashfully-abash--on my lips, a laugh appears. Ecstasy of our meeting--transforms into torment. If we are to laugh--we must help others to laugh.  In your sleep-asleep eyes--chalice spills over. Your lost-distracted glances--contain missives of love. Thirst on my lips--your lips, my reward. Will I be rewarded--or will I have to steal it away?  Around my neck, your arms--a sandalwood garland. Awhile back, these eyes, tearful--now, intoxicated. Did I not say--spring will enter my house too?  Only condition--the first to enter, will be you!  The poems have been excerpted from Kaifi Azmi: Poems | Nazms: New & Selected Poems (Bloomsbury UK).  "

      "text": "MET office says temperature may remain unchanged for the next two days   A mild cold wave is sweeping over Bangladesh, disrupting normal life and causing suffering to people mostly in the north-western districts. The cold wave, sweeping over Chuadanga, Dinajpur, Panchagarh, Rajshahi, Pabna, Naogaon, Nilphamari, Jessore and Kurigram, and it may continue and spread, says the Met Office.  While people were forced to limit their outdoor activities in many districts, children and elderly people were found suffering the most yesterday, report our correspondents.  People like day labourers and rickshaw pullers were also distressed as they could not find work amidst the cold wave.  With inadequate warm clothing at their disposal, poor people of these areas were seen trying to stay warm by lighting up small fires.  Dhaka also continued to feel the chills yesterday, with the Met Office recording the capital's temperature at 14.8deg Celsius at 6pm.  Weather in the city may remain dry, while moderate to thick fog may occur from midnight till morning. Night temperature may also fall slightly, said the Met Office.  According to the Met Office, the weather may remain dry with temporary partly cloudy sky over the country in the next 24 hours till 6pm Friday; while moderate to thick fog may also occur at places from midnight till morning.  The country's highest temperature -- 28.3deg Celsius -- was recorded in Teknaf yesterday, and the lowest -- 7.9deg Celsius -- in Chuadanga.  Night temperature may fall slightly and day temperature may remain nearly unchanged across the country.  \"Temperature may remain unchanged for the next two days. It'll start rising from December 22,\" said Ruhul Kuddus, a meteorologist at Dhaka Met office.  He said a cold wave may sweep over the country in the first week of January, reports UNB.  In Chuadanga, the mild cold wave is continuing to disrupt the everyday life of the people.  The local weather office has indicated that the temperature may further drop, reports our correspondent Mehedi Hasan.   Not enough winter clothing   In Dinajpur's Hili, the cold has intensified due to the cold wind blowing in from the Himalayas.  Dense fog from morning till the afternoon is forcing vehicles to keep their headlights during daytime, reports our correspondent Halim Al Raji.  Hakimpur Upazila Nirbahi Officer Abdur Rafiul Alam said they have already started distributing winter clothing and blankets among the poor.  But he also sought help from aid organizations that donate winter clothing for the poor to deal with the cold wave.  In Panchagarh, the country's northern most district, weather continued to deteriorate yesterday, reports our correspondent Sazzadur Rahman.  Tetulia Met Office In-Charge Md Rohidul Islam said temperature in the area fluctuated from 8deg Celsius to 13deg Celsius during last week, and the mercury will drop further if there was rain.  Panchagarh Modern Sadar Hospital's Resident Medical Officer Md Sirajuddaula Polin said most of the patients suffering from cold and cold-related diseases were children and the elderly people.  The district's Deputy Commissioner Sabina Yasmin said around 30,000 blankets have already been distributed among the poor through government and non-government initiatives.  The locals, however, said that the distributed blankets were still insufficient compared to the number of people in need.  \"We have sent a requisition letter to the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry, seeking additional winter clothing for the people,\" Sabina said.  In Kurigram, temperature continued to drop yesterday due to the cold wave, with the Rajarhat Met Office recording the lowest at 9.8deg Celsius, which was lower than the previous day, reports our correspondent Ariful Islam.  Chairman of Sadar upazila's Jatrapur Union Parishad Ayub Ali said the cold was more intense in most of the areas in his union as they were located on shoals.  Saying they have received 440 blankets in two phases, he stressed: \"There are more 6,000 families in my union and most of them are underprivileged. This is not enough.\"  However, according to the relief department of the district administration, 51,514 blankets allotted for Kurigram were already distributed among the people in nine upazilas.  Indicating the possibility of another cold wave in the last week of the month, Rajarhat Met Office In-Charge Subol Chandra said there was a chance of light rain next week. "

      "text": "Why is it High Time to Concentrate on Proper Youth Centric Climate Financing in Bangladesh? Most of the disastrous impacts of climate change are expected to be felt within the near future. Young people are particularly vulnerable to the impacts, as they are often on the margins of decision-making and will face the climate change impacts for many more years to come. So it would be unethical to take steps (or not) to mitigate climate change or adapt to the problems without their contributions. Globally, youths have participated in movements spontaneously (and in large numbers), they have collaborated with organizations that are working to address their concerns and provide solutions to real-world problems. According to UNFPA (2014), 48 million youth are living in Bangladesh, which is 30 percent of the total population. Securing the future of this large segment of society cannot be ensured without their participation and engagement at much larger scales than currently. The Joint Framework Initiative on Children, Youth, and Climate Change is recognition of the role of youths in tackling climate change, given by the United Nations. This initiative coordinates efforts of 16 intergovernmental entities (e.g. UNFCC, FAO, UNDP, the World Bank group), some nongovernmental organizations (e.g. the British Council, EarthChild Institute, the World Association of Girls Guides) and many youth organizations to empower young people to take adaptation and mitigation actions and enhance active participation of youths in climate change policy and decision making processes. In 2009, the UNFCC secretariat allowed the Youth Non-Governmental Organizations (YOUNGOs) to receive official information and notices, to participate in the meetings, to request speaking slots, and to receive logistical support. The YOUNGO networks have been organising the Conference of the Youth (COY) every year on the weekend before the UN-Level COP, since 2005. This conference brings together the climate change enthusiastic young people from around the world, who promote sustainable lifestyles, look to reduce their emissions footprints and are eager to engage. In the 21st UNFCC intergovernmental negotiation conference (COP 21), youth delegates got involved through a broad range of activities for the very first time. At the latest conference, COP24, a sixteen-year-old girl, Greta Thunberg gave a powerful speech on climate change which drew the attention of the world, proving the power of youth activities and their voices. Examples of climate actions taken by the youth are not only in international conferences. Youths are also implementing various projects around the world. In Central Guyana, the Amerindian people are \"Custodians\" of the rainforest but have a severe lacking in their basic needs. A project designed to ensure the protection of the forest, aiming at improving health, hygiene and environmental management delivered a child-to-child educational programme. This programme engaged and empowered the children, of that particular area, to conserve the rainforests, which vastly contributed to mitigation efforts, by absorbing CO2 emissions. In Morocco, the El Moudda adaptation Initiative is an award-winning project, which is led by young people under 30; this is a community-based adaptation project aiming at various sustainable development measures. They build infrastructure such as dams and early flood warning systems to support community-based Disaster Risk Management. They helped the community through local consultations, awareness raising for conservation, reforestation and re-vegetation of the land aside from the villages. In Ethiopia, UNICEF financed 50,000 school going students, through their environmental clubs, for planting trees in the region of Addis Ababa as a mitigation and adaptation measure. It is imperative that the Bangladesh government and society as a whole help prepare our significant youth population to fight for a sustainable future. There is a vast opportunity in supporting the youth to contribute to existing policies and agenda of the Government and boost national development. Among the key policies developed by the government (in relation to climate change) are; the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP 2009) and the Country Investment Plan (CIP) of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change--both of which focus on community-based adaptation, increasing resilience at the community level and capacity building as crucial approaches to sustainable development for Bangladesh. Similar to the examples above, such as El Moudda Initiative, the youth of Bangladesh can be engaged to deliver real changes at the community levels. Youth actions in climate change have already been activated in Bangladesh. Various environment-related university clubs had started working in this problem. They are arranging workshops, seminars, innovation fair, various competitions on climate change and environment-related problems.  For example, Local chapters of Youth-mappers are contributing a lot in mapping base volunteering, and Green Planet Club of Independent University organized Green Genius Contest, where university students present their innovative ideas to make a sustainable environment. Academic institutions are also promoting youth-oriented climate actions. Department of Environmental Sciences, Bangladesh University of Professionals, arranged Environmental Fest last year. Institute of Remote Sensing, Jahangirnagar University arranged two days workshop on applications of GIS and Remote Sensing, where 100 students from ten universities participated and had some introductory lessons about applications of geospatial technologies in environmental management. A recent initiative, developed by the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) supported by UKAid and British Council, aims to build the capacity of young people to become the actors in taking climate actions. It is designed as a year-long mentorship programme, entitled \"Re-think & Innovate for a Sustainable Environment (RISE)\" that works to engage the youth (selected university students from across Bangladesh) to break down the complex sustainability issues that will challenge their generation and to identify opportunities in how they can initiate projects and activities on their own. The programme focuses on providing a grounding of climate science and sustainability issues, mentoring on project design and implementation, representing their peers among various stakeholders (policymakers/practitioners/private sector firms, etc.) and engaging their peers to collaborate and participate in national development issues. As a critical barrier to most initiatives is support (mostly financial and technical), the programme aims to catalyze the youth into; identifying the appropriate assistance and guidance needed, to approach key stakeholders (investors/decision-makers, etc.) and propose feasible solutions and mobilize their peers into making real changes. The youth of any nation is a valuable asset for prosperity and sustainable development, and the youth of Bangladesh is no different. These eager and enthusiastic minds can, and should, be channeled towards adaptation & mitigation projects (under our existing policies/frameworks). To network and share their ideas, and most importantly, to become actors that take climate actions it is vital to provide adequate support and assistance by investing in the youth of our nation.

      "text": "There are 78 rivers in the division and 25 of them have dried up while 10 are on the verge of dying, said sources at Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) Most rivers in Khulna Division are facing a serious navigability problem, hampering the movement of boats and vessels as repeated requests for dredging fell on deaf ears. There are 78 rivers in the division and 25 of them have dried up while 10 are on the verge of dying, said sources at Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA). These 25 rivers are Haria, Mayur, Hamkura, Kocha, Shela in Khulna, Bhola, Haura, Sara, Chuna, Jamuna, Ramsagar in Bagerhat; Sonai in Satkhira; Teka in Kushtia; Chitra in Narail; Kumar, Maragang and Bhadra in Madaripur. Besides, sholas have developed in the middle of Rupsha and Pashur rivers under Khulna-Mongla river route, hampering the movement of vessels. Goods-laden cargo vessels navigate the area braving risks as a shoal emerged in the Kazibachha River in Batiaghata upazila. A huge shoal has emerged in the Shibsha River from Deluti to Goroikhali in Paikgaccha upazila of the district, disrupting the movement of small engine-run boats. Launches and boats are moving through three routes - Khulna-Madinabad, Khulna-Nildumur and Khulna-Jorsing routes - of the district while cargo vessels are operating on Abhaynagar and Nauapara routes in the northern parts of the division. Recently, the BIWTA has written to the authorities concerned for dredging at 20 points of the rivers. The points are - Hodda, Nalian, Ghugrakathi, Manipur, Kurikaunia, Madinabad, Patakhali on Khulna-Nildumur route, Sardarghat, Mathbaria, Manipur, both sides of Bagi ghat, on Khulna-Jorsing route, Maninabad ghat to Patakhali point, Jaigir Mohol to Madinabad on Kopotakkho river, Chalna, Dakope, Kamarkhali, Botbunia, Kalibari, Arshibosha, Mongla-Chalna, Angtihara-Raimangal route, Khulna-Kalabogi and Joymonirgol-Sonnashi route. According to the letter, dredging work is needed on the listed routes to maintain river transportation but the authorities concerned did not take any effective measure despite being informed several times. Mostafizur Rahman, deputy director of BIWTA, said, \"We've sent a proposal seeking dredging work on the internal river routes of Khulna-Mongla, Khulna-Barishal, Khulna-Bagerhat, Daulatpur-Gopalganj and Tekerhat-Gopalganj routes. The dredging works will start once the authorities concerned give the nod.\" SM Asaduzzaman, president of BIWTA Khulna Workers Union, lamented the current shabby state of the river transportation sector. \"Vessels used to operate on 19 river routes from Khulna port only a decade ago. But now, no goods-laden vessels, except those carrying government food and fertiliser, ply these routes,\" he said."

Bangladesh -- a densely populated and impoverished low-lying nation of 168 million people -- is among the most vulnerable to global warming with rising sea levels threatening coastal villages. Flood-affected people in Balasi Ghat, Gaibadha heading  for shelter on Monday, July 22, 2019 |Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka TribuneIn a study billed as the first of its kind in comparing household spending to public financing, researchers found rural families were shelling out an average $2 billion a year to address the impacts of climate change. In contrast, Dhaka's budget for climate change in rural areas for 2018-19 was $1.46 billion, while international financing was an estimated $154 million annually, the report by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) found. 'We're losing the race': UN secretary general calls climate change an 'emergency' https://t.co/NiGZ57dyS8 The report was released days before a United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York between governments, business leaders and international organizations. \"This research reveals an alarming imbalance,\" IIED's director Andrew Norton said in a statement. He said: \"It is unacceptable that the poorest people are shouldering the burden of spending for adapting to climate change in Bangladesh. \"Much more needs to be done to make sure more public climate finance reaches the people who need it most.\" Also Read- Leading the way in adaptation  Families -- instead of buying food or spending their money on health and education -- were repairing damaged homes and replacing animals and crops. They were using the money to raise their houses above flood levels, and some were even taking out high-interest loans from informal sources, pushing them further into poverty, the researchers said. For women and girls living in poverty, the #climatecrisis hasn't simply resulted in warmer summers.From devastating flooding in Bangladesh to life-threatening drought across East Africa, the devastation of climate change is already happening. [?] https://t.co/KEAmmrOGME pic.twitter.com/r93bDCirP1 Mohammad Nannu's home was destroyed last year by the shifting currents of the Padma, a tributary of the Himalayan river the Ganges. He told AFP he borrowed money at an interest rate of more than 20% to make ends meet after the disaster, which experts said was due to climate change. \"I became penniless after losing my home and property... when the Padma devoured our entire village,\" the 50-year-old said. Local mayor Shahidul Islam said just a handful of families were provided with new homes, with hundreds of others having to rent or move to cities. Atiq Rahman, a Bangladeshi expert who sits in a UN climate change panel, welcomed the study but said $2 billion was \"a fraction of the amount\" Bangladeshis and the government spent every year. \"This is an underestimate. There are many climate change-related costs that cannot be easily monetized,\" he told AFP, citing the impacts on health, land fertility and livestock."

Chittagong, just like Dhaka, has been suffering from a never-ending water-logging problem, and the main culprits of this problem are the more than 1,500 illegal structures in the city that obstruct the free flow of water -- these structures include concrete buildings, shanties, tin-shed houses, graveyards, and crematoriums. Our second-most populous city, and trading hub, is particularly vulnerable to water-logging, with around a third of the district of Chittagong going under water during the monsoon each year, while parts of the city get flooded during high tides even when there is no rain. Of course, while illegal encroachments constitute a large part of the problem, there is more to the whole picture. Our cities are fitted with faulty and outdated drainage systems; furthermore, waste disposal is an issue that needs to be addressed without delay, as plastic waste matter in particular is rarely disposed of properly, usually being thrown out on to the street -- this plastic then goes on to clog up our drains, leaving with the water with no place to move to. The authorities have made assurances that the problem in Chittagong is being taken seriously, with the government undertaking a Tk1,620 crore project to tackle the problem of water-logging, address flood control, and improve drainage facilities.  We hope this money is put to good use, so that our port city can function to its full potential, not just commercially, but in terms of the quality of people's lives. "

We have identified a number of new areas for collaboration. I am confident these will provide further impetus to our growing relations. We also witnessed the signing of 40th ODA loan package,\" she said.

      "text": "These jute mills are located in Khulna's Khalishpur, Dighalia, and Atra industrial regions, and also in Jessore's Noapara industrial area Approximately 30,642 tons of jute goods are currently in stock at the nine state-owned jute mills located in Khulna and Jessore, having a market value is Tk270 crore. Sources said the goods were sitting idle in the jute mills as exports to Sudan have been halted for a long time, but with the increase in demand in the local market, the number of idle jute goods are also decreasing. Lack of capital is another reason why there are no stocks of raw jute in the mills, where industry insiders blame the inefficiency of the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) for lack of funds and fall in production. Md Baniz Uddin Miah, liaison officer at BJMC Khulna office, said out of the 30,642 tons of idle jute goods, 8,130 tons are located in Crescent Jute Mills, 6,117 tons in Platinum Jute Mills, 6,594 tons in Khalishpur Jute Mills, and 978 tons in the Daulatpur Jute Mills, 1,116 tons in Star Jute Mills, 1,474 tons in Alim Jute Mills, 2,057 tons in Eastern Jute Mills, 3,396 tons in Jessore Jute Industry and 600 tons in Carpeting Jute Mills. These jute mills are located in Khulna's Khalishpur, Dighalia, and Atra industrial regions, and also in Jessore's Noapara industrial area.  Sources also said the nine state-owned jute mills owe the workers 10-11 weeks wages, worth Tk44.22 crore, while officials have to be paid four months' wages worth Tk9.84 crore, all totaling Tk54.7 crore. Md Mizanur Rahman, director at the Khulna Department of Labour (DOL) office, said the Director-General at the DOL as well as the Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment have both been notified of the dire conditions, but lack of funds at BJMC has stalled the payment process. The fund crisis has further been intensified by lack of raw jute available in the mills, he added. Abdul Hamid Sardar, convener of CBA, non-CBA Sangram Parishad, said the workers had staged countless protests and organized strikes, demanding payment of all their wages and other dues, but to no avail so far."

The fertilizer is being kept out in the open in the metropolitan's jetty no 7, Roosevelt jetty, Port jetty and Shiromoni areas, for lack of space in the Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation (BADC) warehouses in the district. According to BADC sources, in FY2018-19, three types of fertilizers--Triple Super Phosphate (TSP), Muriate of Potash (MOP), and Diammonium phosphate (DAP)--were imported from Morocco, Canada, and Saudi Arabia. The imported fertilizer were brought to Khulna from Mongla port by six contractor companies. The companies, Poton Traders Ltd, South Delta Shipping and Trading Ltd, Bulk Trade Intl, Nawab and Co, MSK Ship Management and Chartering Ltd, and Taiba Saifullah were responsible for the preservation of the consignments of fertilizer until the BADC took over.  The sources also said, the matter was brought to notice at the BADC meeting in the district on July 27.  Probhash Kumar, joint director of BADC, said: \"The fertilizer imported in FY2018-19, were yet to be stored in our warehouse. Currently, the BADC's warehouse has a capacity of 13 metric tons and there aren't any warehouses for rent,  and there is no adequate space to store the load of fertlizer.\" \"The fertilizer is being preserved in airtight plastic covers, but stagnant waters may damage it.\" Kamrul Ashraf Khan, proprietor of Poton Traders Ltd, said: \"The quantity of fertilizer imported were more than the capacity of the BADC warehouse. We have to spend extra to rent, guard, load and unload. If the fertilizer consignments are not delivered to BADC's warehouse, we cannot claim the payment.\""

      "text": "'Many people have inclined towards rearing cows due to its high demand, especially during Eid-ul-Azha. Many marginal farmers have become self-reliant by rearing cows' There will be no crisis of sacrificial animals, and the cattle markets would not face any crunch for the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha in Chittagong this year, livestock officials, and traders opined. According to the district livestock office, around 6,10,000 heads of cattle are currently available for Eid sacrifice purposes. Of them, 4,14,000 cows, 1,47,000 goats and sheep, and 46,000 buffaloes are in stock at different farms of Chittagong. Last year, 6,55,000 cattle were sacrificed in the district. According to district livestock office, 1,50,000-2,00,000 cattle which come to Chittagong from different parts of the country will fill the shortfall. While speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, livestock officer of Chittagong Dr Md Reajul Huq, assured that the local demand for sacrificial animals could easily be met as there is an adequate supply from domestic sources. \"Many people have inclined towards rearing cows due to its high demand, especially during Eid-ul-Azha. Many marginal farmers have become self-reliant by rearing cows,\" said the livestock officer.         Agreeing with the livestock official, Md Shafiqur Rahman, president of Chittagong Cattle Cooperative Association Ltd also said that the district cattle markets would not witness any supply crisis. Animals to arrive from next week \"Sacrificial animals will begin to arrive in the next few days. Local cows are in huge demand, cattle reared in different farms of Chittagong fulfill 30% of the demand, while the rest is procured from other districts like Bogra, Kushtia, Jessore, Faridpur, and Chapainawabganj,\" he said, adding that the recent flood would not have any impact on the supply.    There are more than 300 cattle farms in Chittagong, also cattle are raised by individual farmers, particularly for Eid-ul-Azha, sources in the livestock office said. Around 47 veterinary teams headed by a veterinary surgeon, each comprising of three to five members would be deployed in 200 cattle markets of the district, including 40 permanent ones.    Livestock officer Dr Md Reajul Huq told the Dhaka Tribune that the veterinary medical teams would check the health of cattle, provide emergency treatment, inspect if the cattle are fit for sacrificing, and detect whether those have been fattened artificially, through the conventional symptom-based methods. \"There will be more than one medical team in the permanent cattle markets. Besides, a mobile veterinary clinic will provide service in the port city,\" said the livestock officer.   Steroid-fattened cattle Some dishonest, and profit-hungry cattle traders bring steroid-fattened cattle for sale at the time of Eid-ul-Azha. Use of hormones, and steroids for fattening cattle is banned, according to the Animal Disease Control Act, 2010. The Act has set at least two years imprisonment, or a fine amounting to Tk50,000, or both for those involved in the offence.   \"Such cattle can be easily identified. Artificially fattened cattle carry some telltale signs. Healthy cattle appears vigorous, while an artificially fattened cow will move slowly, and appear lethargic, it will also show symptoms of respiratory problems,\" said the livestock officer. Dr Azizur Rahman Siddiqui, Civil Surgeon of Chittagong told the Dhaka Tribune that the consumption of artificially fattened cattle poses a serious health hazard."

Deputy Inspector General Md Ruhul Amin at police headquarters, who heads the probe committee, said: \"We have found preliminary evidence against the former officer-in-charge of Sonagazi police station and senior police officers. We are taking this very seriously and are looking into it. \"But, had the local administration and madrasa managing committee taken action when the sexual harassment was first reported, this tragedy could have been avoided.\" DIG Ruhul Amin said the investigation will take several more days to wrap up as investigators are examining various documents. He said Sirajuddaula, the madrasa principal, had a history of condemnable behaviour that was known to the madrasa governing body. The police officer also notably stressed the involvement of political figures in the murder. The DIG was with four other police officers who formed the probe committee. They visited the madrasa and Nusrat's home. They spoke to madrasa staff and students, and Nusrat's family. Three days after the Police Bureau of Investigation (PBI) assumed responsibility of the case, PBI Chief, Banaj Kumar Majumdar, submitted a report to the inspector general of police, noting negligence on the part of police and local administration. Nusrat was set on fire on April 6, refusing to withdraw a case her family filed last month against Sirajuddaula for sexually harassing and assaulting her. After she was set on fire, her family filed another case against eight people, including Sirajuddaula, on April 8. The 18-year-old girl died at Dhaka Medical College Hospital on April 10, after five days in treatment."

We must organize ourselves and guard our rights,\" said Dr Kamal while addressing the inaugural session of Gono Forum's fifth national council on Friday. He said no one, including the president and the prime minister, is above the constitution, reports UNB. \"We must register our protest if anything is done beyond the constitution. We must make the government accountable. Or else, we will lose our ownership of the country,\" he said. The Gono Forum chief said people must remain aware of the way the country is being run.  Dr Kamal, also the Jatiya Oikya Front convener, said the police can help ensure a democratic and constitutional rule in the country by playing its proper role. He said people will have to force the government to run the country as per the constitution with their united efforts. Depicting the country's overall situation, Dr Kamal urged people not to get frustrated. The council began at the Mohanagar Natya Mancha in the morning with party president Dr Kamal Hossain in the chair. Dr Kamal together with party senior leaders inaugurated the council by hoisting the national and Gono Forum flags around 10am.  Mokobbir joins Gono Forum council Although he took oath as an MP violating his party decision, Gono Forum presidium member Mokobbir Khan joined its fifth national council on Friday. Mokobbir, who was elected MP from Sylhet 2 with Gono Forum ticket in the December 30 general election, took oath as an MP of the 11th parliament on April 2, going against the party decision. On April 20, Gono Forum central committee at a meeting decided to send a show-cause notice to Mokobbir Khan for \"violating\" its constitution and indulging \"anti- party\" activities. Mokobbir joined today's council and sat on the dais with Dr Kamal Hossain, creating resentment among party leaders and activists. Talking to UNB, party training affairs secretary Rafiqul Islam Pathik said it is painful that Kamal Hossain is doing \"dual politics\" over Mokobbir's issue. \"I came out of the council and boycotted it in protest against Mokobbir's presence at the council,\" he said. He said many party leaders and activists were angered seeing Mokobbir on the stage. Nearly 1,000 party delegates from across the country joined the event. The last council of Gono Forum was held on December 10, 2011."

      "text": "The hunger strike is still ongoing Around seven people have been hospitalized as state-owned jute mill workers in Khulna, Jessore, and Narsingdi have continued their hunger strike for the second consecutive day. The workers have been taken to Khulna Medical College Hospital on Wednesday morning. Workers of 24 state-owned jute mills, out of the 26 which are under the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC), began the strike on Tuesday afternoon. The workers, along with their dependants, are currently still carrying on with the strike under the banner of CBA-Non CBA Sangram Parishad. In Khulna and Jessore industrial areas, several workers from nine state-owned jute mills -- Star, Platinum, Crescent, Alum, Eastern, Carpeting and three others -- fell sick after almost 21 hours of starvation, and were administered intravenous saline. Examining the ill workers, the healthcare worker of Khalishpur jute mill, Shyamoli Mandal, said: \"The workers are also suffering from low blood pressure.\" One of the sick workers, Platinum Jute Mill CBA President Shahana Sharmin said: \"The workers hoped that they will come to a resolution during the meeting with the chairman; however, they were disappointed again. As a result, they went to a hunger strike.\" Jessore Jute Industries (JJI) Labour Union Treasurer Israil Sarder said the jute mill workers of Jessore are also continuing the protest. In Narsingdi, thousands of jute mill workers, including workers of UMC jute mill, have continued   Tuesday's hunger strike as well. All activities in the jute mills have come to a standstill due to the protests. No jute laden trucks or any jute mill officials were allowed to enter the mills on Wednesday. Besides, traffic movement has been severely hindered as workers have positioned themselves near the main gate of the UMC jute mill. Workers' union leaders during the strike said that non-payment of wages had led them to destitution, therefore they were protesting to press home their 11-point demand. Their demands include implementation of the National Wage Commission, payment of all weekly wages, adequate budgetary allocation for the jute sector and ensuring sale of jute products, payment of the outstanding provident fund and gratuity to retired workers and settlement of insurance benefits to the families of the deceased workers, recruitment of workers, regularization of temporary workers, reinstatement of sacked workers, and balancing, modernizing, rehabilitating, and expanding the jute mills for better productivity.

A project worth Tk48 crore aims to ensure safe water for at least 600000 residents of the upazilas, namely Rupsa, Terkhada  and Digholia, has been sent to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) for approval. Jahed Parvez, executive engineer of the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) of Khulna said: ''To supply safe drinking water to the three upazilas, 1500 water tanks having a capacity of 3000 liters each, 2200 deep tube wells, 223 tube-wells, 1,500 feet deep each, 50 hand-driven tube wells , 30 community latrines and modern latrines for high schools will be set up under the project which would start next year upon approval.''  According to the Upazila Health complex, at least 10 people including man and woman died of arsenic in last 10 years and residents have been asked not to drink water from arsenic contaminated tube wells.  Even residents of many unions of Rupsa, Terkhada upazilas reserve rainwater for drinking as they have been suffering without safe drinking water, locals said. According to the Terkhada upazila health complex, currently 46 people are affected with arsenic in six unions and water of shallow tube wells are being tested on a daily basis."

Rural women have gradually taken an active role in the labour force. According to the Asian Development Bank, they were about 8% around mid-1980s. But in 2017, they account for nearly 36% of the national labour. According to the latest data, overall migration (internal and overseas) by men is at 11%, so the economic work in the village farm is likely to be taken over by women. So their role has increased and they are contributing The role of women in rural economic has increased and they are contributing more in rural labour.   What are the existing obstacles hindering rural women from being more involved in economic activities? A number of factors may discourage women from being actively involved. One is lack of accessibility to resources. Traditionally, men have been facilitated in this role. Accessibilities to resources, to land and finance is something hindered by the culture. There has also been a lack of proper freedom to freely participate.     Climate challenge will be an emerging challenge. It is going to affect women as well. There is no anti-discriminatory law that might benefit the woman. Besides, migration increases workload of women and they will be expected to take care of all household chores. How can Bangladesh eradicate discrimination and underdevelopment of rural women? First, take a look at the laws and policies in place with affirmative action with proper revision. If it is clear, then see that it is enforced and closely monitored. If it is not clear, consider affirmative action. Women need to be included in mainstream development processes. If that happens, they will feel that they are empowered and will contribute more. Empower them with finance, infrastructure, education and skills to make it balanced and sustainable.   While the theme for International Rural Women Day talks about sustainable accessibilities to infrastructure, services and social protection with empowerment, do you think this is being practiced in Bangladesh? Look past the offices. They are accessible. The laws are there. But the thing is, are the practitioners giving them proper opportunities? The practitioner and implementers of the laws need to be act properly to improve accessibility.              How can an increase in gender-based violence and sexual harassment impact the national economic progress? The impact would be devastating. Bangladesh has made good economic progress, and women have largely contributed. They are now more engaged in rural production than ever. But this can be affected if they do not feel comfortable to go out. If their movement is restricted, their outdoor activities will be restricted. Imagine what would happen if millions of women were confined in their house out of discomfort. How can we promote agricultural cooperatives and entrepreneurship involving rural women? My general statement is - make the rural area more attractive than what garments factories could offer. When you want to make it attractive you have to empower them, give them access to resources, finance, capacity building. Make them feel secure. Give them all-in-one packages including incentives for entrepreneurs. You must provide a support system where they know they are happy living in rural areas. How could Bangladesh ensure food security for rural women?    Agriculture is a source of income. Besides, non-farming activities can strengthen can secure their livelihood. Secure means settled. If they have settled their livelihood, it means they have food security. Home gardening could be a contributing factor. Food loss has been a concern for Bangladesh. How can rural women help reduce food loss through involvement in agro-processing and other relevant areas? Food loss is major threat. It affects Bangladesh just like the rest of the developing world.   Processing foods at home would be great solution. In Sri Lanka, they have small, affordable machines which are easily accessible. Women there use work with their families to process food. There is an obligation for the supply chain to buy from them. It works well there. We are working with Daffodil International university and Philmac, one of our partners, to replicate the Sri Lanka model here. What would you say is the best quality of Bangladeshi rural women that is helping them succeed economically? Rural women in Bangladesh are very hard-working. The existing limitations could not prevent them from working. Their love and concern for their family drive them. What is CIRDAP doing to enable rural women of Bangladesh? I have already mentioned one.We are planning to do a research next year on women aged between 18-27 who are out of work and educations. We want to facilitate their involvement in economic activities.   In addition, we are trying to promote good practices in Bangladesh and promoting and mobilizing the women participating in economic activities.   Do you think current initiatives is enough for the development of rural people? If not, what can the government and stakeholders do to help? There are some good practices in Bangladesh already. Brac, RDA, and BARD are doing good work. We have found that \"One House One Cow/One Farm\" program really improved the situation. But we need to do better. To do better, we need to find the gap, and more importantly, implement properly. A number of projects were implemented without knowing the lives and micro-politics of the rural area, and so they failed, might have even damaged things somewhat. You can have the resources to help, but unless you find the person who needs the help, it is a waste. You need to find who actually needs the benefits and work accordingly. "

For the celebration, 89 Puja mandaps have been set up and hundreds of gates have been erected across the district town. Although Durga Puja is the biggest festival for Hindus across the country, Magura is an exception where Kartiany Puja is observed with pompous festivity.  Local Hindus say Shatish Chandra Biswas of village Nanduali in Magura sadar upazila was the pioneer of Kartiany Puja in the district. Shatish observed the puja in his house 65 years ago and the festivity of the puja is increasing day by day. According to Hindu legend,  women in the Dapore era who lived on the banks of the Jamuna River, worshiped Lord Shree Kishna in the Bangla month of Kartik. Following their tradition, residents of Magura have been observing the puja. Basudev Kundu, president of Magura district Puja Udjapan Parishad said 89 puja stages have been set up in the district. He said the Kartiany festival was also a manifestation of communal harmony in the district where Hindus and Muslims would celebrate the festival. \"We are proud that we have been successfully observing the Puja for years with immense festivity. We are grateful to the people and the district administration for their cooperation in this regard.\" he added. A good number of Hindu devotees from India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal also visit the district every year to celebrate the festival. Additional Superintendent of Police, Tariqul Islam, said security has been beefed up in the district for the Kartiany Puja festival.  Around 65 years ago fisherman Shatish Maghi of Nanduali village under Magura Sadar started observing this Puja for the first time in the district. From then onwards, the Hindu community of the district celebrate the Puja every year. A good number of Hindu devotees from India, Sri Lanka and Nepal visit the district every year to celebrate the festival. Pronay Ghosh, general secretary of Notun Bazar Smreeti Shangha Puja Manda, \"Kartiany Puja is our glorious tradition. We get support from all section of the society for the festival.\" Proddut Kamar Shingha, president of Magura district Puja Udjapan Parishad, \"We are proud that we have been successfully observing the Puja for years with immense festivity.

Monowar Ahmed, Secretary, Economic Relations Division (ERD), and Manmohan Parkash, Country Director, ADB, signed the agreement on behalf of Bangladesh and ADB, respectively, at a ceremony in Dhaka, said a press release. The Second City Region Development Project builds on a similar such project which was completed in 2018, according to ADB. The project will bolster growth, improve living standards, and improve mobility, flood resilience, and solid waste management in Dhaka and Khulna city regions, said ADB Country Director Manmohan Parkash. He said by improving institutional capacity and community awareness, the project will strengthen municipal governance, institutional coordination, and sustainable service delivery. \"It'll also support preparation and implementation of comprehensive frameworks for integration of urban development with south-west economic corridor (SWEC) development, and thereby contribute to establishing the SWEC as a major economic corridor in South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation,\" Parkash added. The project will support the rehabilitation of 300 km of urban roads in the Dhaka city region and 30 km of drains around Dhaka and 120 km around Khulna. It will also fund the preparation of an integrated solid waste management plan, including the construction of a composting plant for Khulna. To strengthen capacity, the project will help identify priority investments, prepare or update various plans, and provide training in pourashavas and city corporations in integrated urban planning, sustainable service delivery, and operation and maintenance of urban infrastructure, ADB said. To reduce startup delays for future projects, support for the preparation of detailed engineering designs for investments involving the latest technologies and smart applications will be provided, it said. This will include integrated real-time data platforms and sensors, advanced building materials, and geotechnical engineering. The project will also conduct community awareness campaigns covering at least 200,000 people, including at least 100,000 women on reducing, reusing, and recycling solid waste."

      "text": "Promoting agro-tourism in our country can do wonders in terms of revenue generation Geographically, Bangladesh is a rich land of agro-tourism resources with enormous appeal to sight-seers. Internationally, Bangladesh is now fourth in vegetable production and fourth in fish production. In addition, native capacities for rice, flower, wheat, prawn, and tobacco cultivation have promoted our rural development. These rural dynamic products may uphold agro-tourism.  If we reform land-water-forest sectors through home grown strategies, all -- environment, water, land, forest, marginal farmers, fishermen, women, minorities, and indigenous peoples -- will be economically, socially, and environmentally included for sustainable rural development.  Time has come to preserve rural farming practices and cultural diversity to a great extent for collective welfare, and to distribute the benefits of the tourism industry even at a marginal level.  The promise of tourism in Bangladesh Agro-ecological tourism as a distinctive field that covers the rural environment with its agricultural products, processing and packaging, agro-based services, rural community, and their culture and belief system. It is also called eco-tourism, agricultural tourism, dairy farm tourism, farm vacation tourism, bucolic tourism, agro-entertainment, and honey-tasting tourism.  Bangladesh Economic Review (2010) states that Bangladesh has basically three avenues of generating revenue: Industry, agriculture, and services. Tourism is a part of the service sector, which contributes to the GDP of Bangladesh.  Agriculture is the lifeblood of the Bangladesh economy, and a powerful driver of poverty reduction in Bangladesh. In rural Bangladesh, the factors behind the agriculture sector growth are: Irrigation expansion, improved technology, more efficient markets, and finally, widespread mechanization.  Really, Bangladesh's agriculture sector has been enhanced in terms of productivity and output growth over the last 46 years, regardless of recurrent natural disasters, like climate change, cyclones, drought, and flood and population growth.  Needless to say, challenges to sustainable agricultural growth are numerous. It can be a loss of arable land due to climate change and salinity intrusion in the south, severe droughts in the north, building of industry and infrastructure, and excessive emphasis on urbanization and house-building, as well as water shortages in the dry season due to unresolved river-related disputes with neighbouring India.  It is expected that the Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, along with other private tour operators, will prefer the issue of correcting the image by undertaking promotional measures in order to develop tourism in Bangladesh. The government should also extend cooperation in this regard by playing the foremost role in building this positive image, so that the industry can play its proper responsibility to the economy of the country.  Why we need eco-tourism The lands of Kushtia are fertile for tobacco, Mymensingh for paddy, Chandpur and Barisal are known for fish, Sathkhira for prawn, Jessore for flowers, Dinajpur for its wheat, and so on. So, Bangladesh has a lot of options when it comes to promoting the concept of agro-tourism, and find new means that can contribute to its overall economy.  Cox's Bazar is the tourist capital of Bangladesh. The shark-free beach is good for bathing, sun-bathing, and swimming. The breath-taking beauty of the setting sun behind the waves of the sea is captivating. Visiting the fascinating spot like Himchhari, Teknaf, Inani beach, and various temples can form memorable experiences of one's lifetime. The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world. Two-thirds of the Sundarbans is in Bangladesh. Wildlife photography is an important part of eco-tourism, and related experiences include boating inside the forest, nature study, meeting fishermen, wood-cutters, and honey-collectors. Rangamati is a wonderful repository of scenic splendor, with flora and fauna of varied descriptions. The township is located on the Western bank of Kaptai Lake. Rangamati is a favourite holiday resort, because of its beautiful landscape, scenic beauty, lakes, colourful tribes, its flora and fauna, indigenous museums, hanging bridges, homespun textile products, ivory jewellery.  arketing strategies  The international tourism system is totally reliant on information technology for its growth, competitiveness, and long-term survival. In promoting the agro-tourism industry of any country, the internet can play a leading role to facilitate information exchange internationally.  The internet can be used effectively for the many purposes of tourism and marketing, including direct sales, advertisement, and customer support. The tourism authority needs to consider the effective use of this technology for the promotional activity of this industry.  Advertising is a non-personal form of mass communication, and it offers a high degree of control for those responsible for the design and delivery of the advertising message. Different tourist attractions of the country can be advertised on television, radio, newspapers, and magazines.  To market agro-ecological tourism, geographical information systems (GIS) are very important. Through these systems, the tourism authorities can easily sell agro-tourism products and indigenous farming tools, show suitable localities for the incorporation of various plants and animals, elucidate geo-demographic characteristics.

      "headline": "How a hotline is helping people with legal aid",
      "authors": "Nawaz Farhin Antara",
      "text": "The six-month-long pilot project was inaugurated on March 3 The national emergency helpline provides three distinct services - police, fire, and ambulance. As the national helpline has no dedicated legal aid service, Project Shetu, set up by Justice Vision Foundation (JVF), has been working with the national helpline provide legal counselling and assistance to those in need as a pilot project. The six-month-long pilot project was inaugurated on March 3.  Dhaka Tribune obtained detailed records of the calls and complaints received and the assistance provided over 76 days of operation. How does the service work? The national emergency helpline - 999 - has allocated three other emergency numbers to Project Shetu for use. When a caller asks about legal issues, 999 refer them to one of the Project Shetu. These calls, referred as \"case calls\" by the 999 service, provide the caller to a network of over 200 volunteer lawyers. Before proceeding, a team of volunteers vet the call to assess its genuinity and determine viability and urgency. The lawyers take the case pro bono if the complainant is needy, and charge only half the usual cost if they can somewhat afford to pay.  When the issue is about police stations reluctant to register a GD or case, the lawyers address them by visiting the pertinent police station. In many situations, the lawyers try to arbitrate between both parties and involve local leaders like the chairman or ward councillor. And in extreme situations, when neither arbitration nor police involvement is satisfactory, the lawyers file cases directly with the courts. Between March 3 and May 18 this year, 58 cases were filed with the courts. Divorce and remarriage in Gazipur Around 50% of all recorded cases originated in the Gazipur district, 10% from the Dhaka division excluding Gazipur, 15% in the Rajshahi division, and the other 15% were from all over the country. Project Shetu looked into the unusually high number of complaints - mostly regarding domestic abuse, women and children repression, and dowry - from Gazipur. They found that there was a tendency among the RMG workers in the area to engage in multiple relationships. Many female RMG workers were found to have married four or five times, and male RMG workers were married seven or eight times. Project Shetu observed that due to a high concentration of RMG factories in the district and employee turnover, divorces and remarrying are frequent phenomena, according to Project Shetu Director Sayeda Ferdous Ahmed, who is also chairman of the Justice Vision Foundation. Cybercrimes in Barisal Project Shetu reported that the majority of complaints over cybercrime came from Barisal. Likewise, most cybercrime cases that were filed also originated from Barisal. From the case details, it was noted that the victims were mostly lonely housewives with husbands elsewhere or teenagers with jilted ex-boyfriends. Most victims were aged 14-26.  Married women who seek company to cope with loneliness, and young girls with vengeful ex-boyfriends - both groups are frequent victims of blackmail at the hands of predators masquerading in society. For the women, having their husband send them money on a regular basis make them lucrative targets. The much younger girls, however, suffer from intimate photos and videos uploaded to the internet. Furthermore, the conservative nature of society and the scandalous nature of the crime prevent the victims from asking for help from their families.  How are cybercrimes dealt with? Cybercrimes by nature are murky grounds for many prosecutors and judges to delve into, considering they are a relatively new by-product of the internet. The Information and Communication Technology ACT passed in 2006 was overhauled and a more up-to-date, nonetheless controversial, Digital Security Act was passed by the parliament in 2018.  The fact that there is just one cybercrime tribunal in Bangladesh only drives the point home further. The lawyers go to the police, whose cybercrimes unit then take down the offensive content, which can take up to seven days. The online removal is not a permanent solution, as the perpetrators can re-upload faster than they can be removed. Uncertain future despite success Mohammad Tabarak Ullah, superintendent of police (Telecom & Information Management), attached to the National Emergency Service, told Dhaka Tribune: \"When the callers ask us where they can find legal aid, we refer them to Project Shetu or 109, a dedicated hotline for issues regarding violence against women and children.  \"We would like for victimized women to receive the legal assistance they seek. We partnered with Project Shetu as they were able to provide the necessary service. The pilot project has been going well, but we cannot really say how things will be after the project concludes.\" Advocate Salma Ali, a rights activist and executive director of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association, said: \"I've received several calls pertaining to this nature. The alarming rate of cases from Gazipur is eventually going to blow up beyond reasonable proportions soon. Many women, even those who seek legal aid, are reluctant to admit how many times they have been married.  \"The men file cases to prevent divorces, hoping that arbitration can hold the marriage together so they do not have to pay the dowry. And the women file cases in order to realize their dowry. Some men believe that if a woman asks for divorce, the husband is not required to pay them anything. The confusion leads to lawsuits.\" The lawyer noted that the BNWLA has found that the majority of people involved in these cases had moved to Gazipur from northern Bangladesh in search of work. She suggested that the RMG workers be provided dormitory facilities and personnel training on how to interact, who to interact with, what to avoid, etc to prevent untoward incidents. Advocate Salma Ali also stressed for the implementation of the Sexual Harassment Guideline. Magnitude of violence Sutopa (pseudonym), a 26-year-old woman from Dhaka's Gulshan, inherited a vast fortune from her parents. But her mother had remarried, and after her death, the stepfather conspired with Sutopa's husband to appropriate her property by getting her committed to a rehabilitation centre after labelling her a drug abuser. Her business partner contacted the national emergency service and informed them of the plight. Project Shetu's actions saw the heiress released from rehab. Currently, they are litigating against the stepfather and husband. In Rajshahi, an eight-year-old boy called 999 after his uncle cut off his mother's left breast when she refused his advances. The boy's father was working abroad, and was contacted by Project Shetu. The issue was not brought before the court or the police. The husband, concerned over the reputation, asked for arbitration and the legal team provided the required counselling to resolve the issue without involving the law. The woman was provided medical treatment, and her brother-in-law faced no action. Tamanna (pseudonym), a 20-year-old from Dhaka's Rampura, divorced her husband because he would abuse her during sex. He was a large 102kg man and she was less than half his weight at 49kg. Unable to fend off his beatings, she sought freedom in divorce. But Tamanna would find no respite as her husband had recorded videos of their intercourse without her knowledge. He threatened to upload the videos online, and she contacted the emergency helpline. Project Shetu saw to it that a GD was filed and the case was turned over to the DB. Project Director Sayeda Ferdous Ahmed said the High Court is now quite familiar with Project Shetu. She said the High Court has advised to engage in more counselling and raise awareness for the widespread domestic violence.  The lawyer said the non-profit project is funded entirely by the volunteers themselves, but always open to donations."

      "text": "The inundated roads are making it worse as the villagers couldn't even travel to the nearby health complexes for treatment Floodwater started to recede in Kurigram, and Gaibandha prompting many flood-hit people to return to their homes, yet the inundated roads, and waterborne infectious diseases, keep compounding the sufferings of the affected people in the districts. With the recession of floodwater, the two northern districts  are facing post flood hazards, such as diarrhoea, and other waterborne diseases have been spreading sporadically among the flood-affected people, intensifying the sufferings of the flood victims. The inundated roads are making it worse as the villagers couldn't even travel to the nearby health complexes for treatment. In Kurigram, Although the water level of major rivers has fallen, the sufferings of about a million flood-hit people have increased, because of a shortage of drinking water, food, fodder, and fuel. Sanitation has also turned out to be a major problem with many people suffering from water-borne diseases. Locals alleged that they are not receiving proper medical care from the authority, and are lacking of doctors, and medicine, making the situation worse. Locals of Namarchor village of Sadar upazila, Munni, Shahida Kajli, and Nejam Uddin said they are treating their sick children only with oral salines from nearby shops. No help from the authority has reached Sadar, Chilmari, Roumari, and Rajibpur upazilas. Denying the allegations, Kurigram Civil Surgeon Dr Aminul Islam said a total of 85 teams with 35 MBBS doctors are working in the flood-affected areas ensuring proper medical treatment to the people of the district. Chilmari Upazila Health Complex Residential Doctor Mostari Begum said: \"The victims are mainly suffering from diseases like diarrhoea, dysentery, fever, eczema, itches, and other waterborne diseases. \"These diseases will spread more after the water fully recedes,\" she added.  The district administration's control room sources said, 73 unions of nine upazilas were flooded. Farmers of the flood-hit areas, in particular, are staring at an uncertain future as 20,000 hectares of cropland were flooded. The district's infrastructure has also been severely damaged with 1,245km road, 40km embankment, and 41 bridges and culverts affected. Over 9,734 tube wells are also underwater. According to Kurigram Water Development Board, Brahmaputra and Dharala rivers were flowing 63cm and 23cm above the danger level respectively, Brahmaputra was 90cm above the danger level, and Dharala at 59cm on Saturday. A total of 755 educational institutions, including 128 secondary schools, 70 madrasas, 17 colleges, and 540 primary schools, had to suspend academic activities due to rising water. Among the district's 1,240 government primary schools, 536 had been flooded. The district administration has distributed five metric tonnes of rice, Tk 13.5 lakh, and 3,000 packets of dry food among the flood-affected people. The district administration sources said over 64,000 people took shelter in 186 centres in the district. In Gaibandha, floodwaters started to recede from Brahmaputra, and Ghagat River in the last three days. The situation worsened as there is an acute shortage of pure drinking water in addition to improper sanitation. In the last five days around 6 kilometres of rail tracks went out of order due to the inundation. Bangladesh Water Development Board, Deputy Engineer Mukhlesur Rahman said: \"In the last 24 hours the water level has receded in Brahmaputra, and Karatoya River but it is still above the danger level.\" Abul Kashem , station-master of Gaibandha railway station said: \"Railway communication to only Lalmonirhat and Dinajpur is continuing. And road communication from Gaibandha to Sundarganj, Saghata, Phooljhori, and Balasi is disrupted.\" According to district relief and rehabilitation office (DRRO), Almost 5.5 lakh people are stuck in their marooned homes. Among them, 75 thousand took shelter in 184 government shelters. Almost 600 kilometres of roads are underwater. 63 kilometres of embankments are broken. 12 thousand hectares of crop fields are underwater. Fishes of 7000 ponds are lost in the flood. Gaibandha District Commissioner Abdul Matin said: \"We allocated almost Tk15 lakh, a thousand metric ton rice, and 6 thousand cartons of dry food for the flood victims.

      "text": "The petrol pump owners began the strike on Sunday morning Fuel supply in Rajshahi, Khulna, and Rangpur divisions has come to a standstill with petrol pump owners going on an indefinite strike to press home a 15 point demand. Petrol pump owners began their strike on Sunday morning upon a decision of Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Khulna Divisional committees of the Bangladesh Petrol Pump and Tank Lorry Malik-Sramik Oikya Parishad. Around 26 petrol pumps in Natore were shut down due to the strike, causing severe problems for vehicle owners. Under these circumstances, traffic on the roads has also declined. The shutdown of petrol pumps has led to a fuel crisis in Rangpur division. Interdistrict supplies and supply of fuel to buses that operate between Rangpur and Dhaka, came to a halt due to the strike. All of the petrol pumps in Rajshahi division were quite crowded on Saturday night, following the declaration of this strike. Owner of Bengal Travels, Khalid Ebadullah, who went to Rajshahi town's Afrin Filling Station to get fuel, said people crowded the filling stations since morning for fuel since the announcement of the strike. Bangladesh Petrol Pump Owners' Association's Rajshahi Division General Secretary Rafikul Islam told Dhaka Tribune: \"The protest initially began from Khulna division and gradually spread out to Rajshahi and Rangpur. Today, around 500 petrol pump owners of these two divisions joined the strike. \"If our demands are not met, drivers of CNG-run auto rickshaws will also join us, and gradually it will become a nationwide protest.\" 15-point demands pressed by Bangladesh Petrol Pump Owners' Association | Dhaka Tribune He said that they will continue demonstrating until their demands are met. Bangladesh Petrol Pump Owners' Association's Rangpur Division Vice President Abul Majed said: \"We have urged the government previously to raise the commission for selling fuel as well as to increase the rent for tank lorries, but our demands were not carried out even after government assurances to that effect. \"As a result, we were forced to call this indefinite strike. We will not withdraw it until all our demands are met.\" On November 26, the association's leaders gave an ultimatum to meet their 15 point demand by November 30. Their demands include payment of 7.5% commission for selling fuel, introduction of accident insurance of Tk5 lakh for tank lorry workers, increasing fares for tank lorries, stopping police harassment and extortion, and dismissing the order to collect licenses for pumps from the Department of Environment.  Several petrol pump owners said they can hardly make al profit after paying workers their due wages, because of the nominally small commission they receive. Customers are also distressed by the sudden strike as they have been forced to buy fuel at a higher price from retailers. MP denied fuel in Thakurgaon Workers of Chowdhury Filling Station in Thakurgaon refused to fill the tanks of two cars of Awami League Presidium Member Ramesh Chandra Sen, MP. The Thakurgaon 1 constituency MP went to the filling station on his way to Dhaka after visiting his area. Regarding this incident, Thakurgaon District President of Bangladesh Petrol Pump Owners' Association, Enamul Haque, said the owners would continue their strike until the government meets their 15 point demand."

Speakers made this remark in a peace conference during an event observing the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, in front of the National Press Club in Dhaka on Tuesday.  Successful diplomacy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and dedication of the Bangladeshi government along with relentless efforts of the men and women peacekeepers from this country has now been established all over the world, the speakers stated.  The event was presided over CLNB President Harunur Rashid. Among others, Bir Protik Colonel (rtd) Didarul Alam, was present at event.  The International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, 29 May, offers a chance to pay tribute to the uniformed and civilians personnel's invaluable contribution to the work of the organization and to honour more than 3,800 peacekeepers who have lost their lives serving under the UN flag since 1948, including 98 last year.

      "text": "New study claims rising sea levels far worse that previously calculated   A new research suggests that if carbon emissions peak by 2020, land now home to roughly a fifth of the populations of Bangladesh and Vietnam may be lower than high tide lines by 2100. Quoting the research by Nature Communications, the World Economic Forum in an article said hundreds of millions more people are already at risk from climate breakdown-caused coastal flooding and sea level rise than previously thought.  The research also fears that the proportion under threat would rise to a third of the population in Bangladesh if emissions continue unchecked. Even with immediate and deep emissions cuts, large swathes of the coastal land we live on now could be uninhabitable by the end of the century, the article said.   \"Existing estimates of risk from sea-level rise - taken from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission - did not exactly paint a rosy picture for coastal communities. But, in using space-based satellite imagery to measures the elevations of surfaces closest to the sky, much of the data actually reported the elevation of treetops and rooftops, rather than the ground itself.\"  Flood-affected people in Balasi Ghat, Gaibadha heading  for shelter on July 22, 2019 | Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune\"As a result, it overestimates coastal elevations by more than two metres on average, and more than four metres in urban areas,\" the article added. Based on the new model, it has been estimated not 28 million but 110 million people already live below the current high tide line. At the same time, instead of 68 million people living below annual flood levels, the figure is now 250 million - the same number that live less than one metre above sea level. Mentioning that the increase in vulnerability to sea-level rise and flooding is not evenly distributed, the report also said more than 70% of those living on at-risk land are in eight Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, China, and Japan.  \"And for many of these countries, the increase in risk that the new model predicts for the coming decades is much higher than three-fold.\" It also mentions that modern defences, such as levees and seawalls, will remain vital in protecting hundreds of millions of coastal residents, but these by no means guarantees protection against future sea levels and storms as superstorms already breach flood defences in the most developed cities in the world. It also said that away from urban areas, the astronomical costs of protecting large areas from sea-level rise and flooding means that millions will need to be resettled in the coming decades - or else forcefully displaced by the rising seas.  \"Even in countries such as the US and the UK, sea-level rise this century may require large-scale migration away from unprotected coastlines. In countries less able to cope, loss of lives and livelihoods, political chaos, and conflict are highly likely without support,\" it said."

      "text": "He added that Japan's aid to Bangladesh, last year, totalled $1.8 billion  Japanese Ambassador in Dhaka Hiroyasu Izumi has said the Special Economic Zone for Japanese investors in Bangladesh--and the One Stop Service Act--are likely to attract more Japanese companies; especially in the fields of: food, commodity products, light industry, and ICT. \"Since the year 2008, the investment from Japan to Bangladesh has been expanding and the trend is getting stronger, especially after 2011,\" he told UNB in an interview.  This trend, Ambassador Izumi said, is likely to continue for the coming years; considering the competitive labour force and the size of the market of Bangladesh with its large, young population. He, however, said the investment climate and doing business in Bangladesh \"are not very favourable\" for foreign companies.  The time-consuming process of applying to launch businesses and registration, as well as a lack of sufficient infrastructure, an intricate process of applying for work visas, and a complicated tax system-- including retroactive taxation--could be named as the main bottlenecks to start businesses in Bangladesh, he said. In particular, Ambassador Izumi said, the insufficiencies in logistics and taxation systems, such as \"too-heavy tariffs,\" need to be addressed.  \"They are not only the hindrances for FDI from Japan but also cause drawbacks to the growth of the local economy in Bangladesh,\" he said. Analysing the current situation of the foreign companies, and listening to their requests, are essential to make the overall investment environment more attractive, said Ambassador Izumi. Responding to a question, the Japanese envoy said that surrounded on all sides by the sea, Japan is also deeply rooted in the blue economy and has a long history of using marine resources.  \"I, therefore, believe Japan and Bangladesh can exchange knowledge and expertise in blue economy and marine resources,\" he said. A conference was co-organised in March by the Ministry of Fisheries & Livestock and Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, the envoy said adding, \"'Bangladesh Blue Economy Dialogue on Fisheries and Marine Culture'\" was quite suggestive and meaningful.\" \"We would like to consider future cooperation in the field of blue economy with the government of Bangladesh,\" said the Ambassador. When asked about Bangladesh's exports to Japan, he said in Japan they are seeing more and more clothes manufactured in Bangladesh, but Japanese people are not very aware that they are made in Bangladesh. \"To further encourage exports from Bangladesh to Japan, I believe it is very important for Bangladesh's companies to conduct thorough market research in Japan, especially focusing on the quality-oriented tendency of the Japanese consumers,\" said the Japanese envoy. Other potential exports from Bangladesh to Japan, he thinks, could be medicine, leather goods or agricultural (marine) products.  \"For any product, however, creating additional value that attracts Japanese consumer is the key to expand and boost exports to Japan from Bangladesh,\" said the Ambassador. To do so, he suggested having more opportunities to introduce Bangladeshi products in Japan, such as organising trade fairs or exhibitions, to make them familiar to Japanese consumers. Responding to a question on people-to-people contact, he said friendship between Japan and Bangladesh started immediately after the independence of Bangladesh. \"Since then, the two nations have always been very close friends.\" For example, the Ambassador said, Japan has provided scholarships for more than 4,000 Bangladeshi students over decades. Last year, more than 120 students received this scholarship and went to Japan from Bangladesh. Also in the field of business, there are currently more than 260 Japanese companies operating their businesses in Bangladesh, and interaction through business is also growing rapidly. Dhaka, Tokyo plan big for 2022 The year 2022 will mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Bangladesh and Japan. \"The coming years will be very important for our two countries. Toward this anniversary, we are working hard to enhance our bilateral relations even further,\" said the Japanese Ambassador. In celebration of this anniversary, Bangladesh and Japan are expecting to see more and more interaction between the two countries, including cultural and people-to-people exchanges in the years to come. The Ambassador said several cooperation projects were launched with the successful mutual visits by the two Prime Ministers-- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe--in 2014.  \"Apart from bridges, we are working on other projects like the Dhaka International Airport Terminal, Dhaka Metro lines, and Matarbari port and power plant, and all these projects are going well as planned with high quality.  It is my tremendous joy to celebrate this anniversary with the people of Bangladesh based on this ever-growing relationship,\" he said. Since his arrival in 2017, Ambassador Izumi said he has been witnessing an increasing number of visits both at ministerial and other levels.  \"I expect our bilateral relationship to grow even closer and stronger in the years to come.\" He said Japan has been the single biggest bilateral development partner for Bangladesh and the amount of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Bangladesh from Japan last year marked $1.8 billion. \"This figure was a record, the largest-ever Japanese ODA support to Bangladesh for one year. I am pleased to inform you that Bangladesh is now the second-largest recipient of Japan's ODA in the world,\" he said."

      "text": "Last couple of seasons witnessed a substantial growth in rice production Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal on Sunday hinted about rice exports and restricting imports in a bid to bring relief to the growers hit hard by lower pieces of paddy.  \"The country will export rice even though it needs subsidy,\" said the minister while addressing a program at planning ministry in the capital. The farmers were suffering not getting fair price of their produce as the markets had higher amount of stocks than what was needed. Meanwhile, the rice, imported in recent years, increased the stocks, lowering the price further. The minister, in the program, also criticized the rice import and said that the import would be banned immediately. \"The country's farmers need to be saved and for that import must be stopped,\" he said. According to food ministry data, the country imported 2,00,000 tons of rice over the last 10 months of the current fiscal and 3,80,000 more tons are under process of import. The government promoted rice imports two years ago withdrawing the import duties to meet rice supply shortage caused by 2017 flood, which badly affected crops, especially in hoar areas. The government then had said they would require 10,00,000 tons of rice but a total of 60,00,000 tons were imported in last two years, said the food ministry. Besides, last couple of seasons witnessed a substantial growth in rice production.   As a result, the prices of rice were not rational with farmers' cost of production, which caused losses to the growers. Meanwhile, boro rice has started coming to market, bringing down the rice prices further. \"Boro rice has started coming, adding to the stocks, which was already higher than the demand,\" said HM Asad, a Karwan Bazar-based wholesaler. \"As a result, we have to cut the price by Tk300-400 per 50kg bag of rice to maintain market competitiveness,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune.  \"The government initiative to keep the rice prices in favour of consumers deprives farmers of fair prices,\" he claimed. During a visit to several markets of the capital on Saturday, the Dhaka Tribune has found rice selling at Tk30 to Tk50 depending on their verities, which was Tk38 to Tk65 last week, a Tk8-15 fall per kilogram. Experts were repeatedly calling for reducing production costs though increasing yield. The minister Mustafa Kamal said the use of new technology could reduce the cost of production, bringing more profit to the harvesters. Hinting at government initiatives for technological revolution in agricultural sector, he said that the government would bring high-tech agriculture machineries for the farmers.  \"We want to provide such machineries at subsidized rates but the farmers are not interested to buy those,\" the minister expressed frustration."

      "text": "The evolution of home essentials in Bangladesh How does one tell the story of Bangladesh? The road most taken leads to the country's violent birth and the glory of its founding fathers. Another popular approach is to talk about this rising South Asian tiger that is smashing its development goals and making strides in other arenas, such as sports. But in the tales of heroes and legends, the everyday colours of Bangladesh fade into the background, and to really see them, you'll have to enter the homes of ordinary Bangladeshis.  This is exactly what International Homeware has been doing for the past 62 years, and the story of this family business might well be the story of the evolution of lifestyles in Bangladesh.  A little background In 1957, the late Alhaj Abdul Wazed opened a ceramics outlet in New Market, called \"Crockeries View\", importing fine crockery and tableware. This expanded into three more showrooms under the names, \"Unique Traders\" (since 1964), \"General Gift House\" (since 1967) and \"Unique Promotion\" (since 1992). He was succeeded in 1992 by his son Mizanur Rahman, who took the business further, expanding the range of products and the reach of the brand. In the early years of the present decade, the separate stores were brought under the umbrella of International Homeware (IHW), which boasts 7 outlets around the country, and has expanded its product range to include not only ceramics and glassware, but also kitchen appliances and industrial grade dishware and equipment for restaurants and hotels. In 2010, the founder's grandson Moin Ur Rahman joined the company as Managing Director, thus bringing the company into its third generation. Avenue T caught up with the young MD to talk about the journey of this family owned business. The face of change A week before our cover shoot, I'm sitting in the air-conditioned boardroom at IHW's corporate headquarters in Banani. The reception area outside bears the three framed photographs of the founder, his son, and his grandson, and looking at it, one can fill the weight of history settle down on one's shoulders. Moin enters, a little late, red-faced from wrestling the traffic to get here, apologizing profusely for the delay. Stuffy businessman? Absolutely not. His funky haircut, infectious energy, and the habit of prefacing every statement with an emphatic \"auughhhh\" all give him the vibe of the laid back best friend. For a business looking to adapt to the contemporary zeitgeist, you could not have asked for a better face for the company. We settle in to a comfortable chat about the evolution of the business and lifestyles in Bangladesh 5  Questions with Moin Ur Rahman What's it been like, entering the business in its third generation? It's been familiar and intimidating all at the same time. On one hand, my Dadaji and my father have created a legacy of quality products, importing only the finest goods from all over the world, and the goodwill and the reputation they have created makes it easier to do business than it would have if we'd had to start from scratch.  The downside of being the young voice in a company which has been doing things a certain way for the past two generations is that you meet a certain resistance to change. When I push forward some innovations, I am met with a lot of: \"But this is how we've always done things\" and it can get frustrating. It's a process, but I think I'm getting better at handling it.' How, in your opinion, has the business changed? To start with, things are much more complicated now. When my grandfather started out, there wasn't so much competition, but at the same time, the client base is also much, much smaller. Pre-Liberation, the spending power of the population was much lower; their tastes were very different. The bulk of Dadaji's clients were wealthy Aga Khani families.  Then immediately after 1971, there was a ban on imports for a while, and we had to switch to local ceramics and products, and that was a struggle to innovate and maintain the standards we had already set.   When the ban was finally lifted, the market had begun to change. When my father took over, he had to travel extensively, undertaking long voyages, sacrificing a lot of his comfort to find the best products. I marvel at it because I could never travel like that. It definitely paid off -- where most other home essentials companies flood the market with Chinese products, we actually bring top quality products from Brazil, UK, France, Germany, Italy, UAE, India, Czech Republic, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan, and China. We diversified our product ranges into three categories: Home & living, Kitchen & Dining and Household Electric Appliances. We had brought all our outlets under the IHW brand banner.  By the time I came in, we'd already seen the rise of the middle class, and the restaurant boom. Right now, we're seeing people, particularly young corporate and entrepreneurs, new couples, with a lot more disposable income. And mind you, I'm not just talking about Dhaka - I've seen lifestyle stores in Chittagong, Rajshahi, Barisal and Khulna, devoted to beautiful home essentials.  There are new businesses, hotels and restaurants popping up all the time, and these need the industrial and restaurant-grade appliances, so we're seeing an increased demand for those as well.   Bangladeshis now travel more, and are social media savvy, and this informs a lot of their purchase decisions, not just what they buy, but also, how they buy.  So what's the plan? What changes are you trying to bring in? To begin with, we're looking at a future that is very digital. So far, the business model my Dadaji and my father had been used to was based on face-to-face interactions, but increasingly, people prefer to buy their goods online, especially if it's a brand they trust, so we're working on our e-commerce platform, which is launching very soon.  If we want to match the current trends and face the future, we also have to adopt newer methods of business and sustainable resources to import as a trading company, thus ensuring effective and efficient output. A lot of this involves incorporating new management principles  centred on building a better relationship with our employees, patrons and partners.  In addition to evolving the business for the contemporary client, I also want to bring some changes into the workplace culture at IHW. We've so far run the traditional model of business, with formal hierarchies and relationships. While I acknowledge that I don't have access to unlimited funds, and we do have some 300+ dedicated employees, I also want to make this a fun place to work at. Ideally, I'd like to change the office design to incorporate more open spaces, and maybe bring in some facilities that will allow the employees to relax. Our previous generations didn't really mix work and play, but newer studies have shown that productivity goes up in an office environment that allows a reasonable amount of opportunities for recreation and relaxation. And happier employees will just be better at customer service. It's going to be a process of adjustment, but hopefully I'll be able to bring that change in. IHW has also been involved in some admirable CSR projects and collaborations. Could you please elaborate on these a little? We're partnering with the It's Humanity Foundation (IHF), which provides free education, healthcare and vocational training to underprivileged children. One of the foundation's projects is an artisan project called Protibha, which facilitates the mothers of these unprivileged children to generate an income by using their creative skills. When we found out that one of those creative skills included glass painting and they were using glassware from IHW, we decided to get further involved, by providing them the glassware, and then displaying the finished artisanal glassware at our outlets for sale. In this way, we promote their work, and also help them earn an income, which then supplements the support already provided to their children, who are enrolled in the IHF schools.  What is your message to the readers of Avenue T? Enjoy your life. Use the 'good' china, instead of storing it in the cabinet for the 'proper' occasion. Life is short; give yourself the permission to enjoy it.  "

According to district Department of Agriculture Extension sources, the devastating storm damaged least 5,017 fish enclosures, and 2,000 hectares of Aman, along with large amounts of winter vegetables, betel leaves, mustard, and boroi across the district. Md Osman Gani Sohab, a farmer from Shyamnagar, said he lost his Aman crops on four bighas of land in the flood caused by incessant rain during the cyclone Bulbul. Another Aman farmer Khalilur Rahman from Sadar upazila, who planted his crops on five bighas of leased land, said: \"All my crops were damaged overnight during the storm.\" Abdul Bari, a shrimp farmer from Assasuni upazila, said: \"My shrimp enclosure on 150 bighas was completely flooded, causing me to lose shrimps and whitefishes worth around Tk35-40 lakh.\" Belal Hossain, another shrimp farmer from Shyamnagar upazila, said: \"After my fish enclosure on 30 bighas was flooded, I lost shrimps and whitefishes worth around Tk30-35 lakh.\" Arbinda Biswas, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension of Satkhira district, said: \"2,000 hectares of Aman which were destroyed by the flood and storm were worth approximately Tk28.33 crore. Apart from this, 80 hectares of winter vegetables worth Tk2.8 crore, 12 hectares of betel leaves worth Tk1.51 crore, 50 hectares of mustard worth Tk26.4 lakh, were also damaged, causing an aggregate loss of around Tk33,10,90,000.\" Satkhira Fisheries Officer Moshiur Rahman said: \"At least 5,017 shrimp enclosures on 5,719 hectares across Assasuni, Shyamnagar, and Kaliganj upazilas were flooded causing a loss of 414 tons shrimps and whitefishes worth around Tk10.36 crore.\" Burigoalini UP Chairman Bhabatash Mandal said: \"The cyclonic storm wreaked havoc in my union. The sheer force of the storm uprooted a large number of big trees. Pucca and tin-shed homes were damaged, and shrimp enclosures and croplands were inundated.\" Ahead of the cyclonic storm Bulbul, the danger signal 10 was hoisted at Satkhira. The storm which hit the district around 5am on Sunday lasted till 9am, causing substantial damage to homes, croplands, and roads alike."

      "text": "A large portion of the embankments across Satkhira could collapse this coming rainy season  The low lying areas of two villages in Satkhira's Assasuni upazila have been inundated after the embankment bars on the Kholpetua river cracked.  Around 100 feet of embankment wall in Kola village in Pratapnagar union of the upazila collapsed into the river.  The collapse flooded the low areas of the Kola and Hizlia villages. Several houses and over a hundred fish enclosures have been marooned and damaged.  If not repaired quickly, some 250 kilometers of the embankments across Satkhira might collapse in the coming rainy season.  According to sources concerned, two rivers--the Kapotakkha and Kholpetua--flow through seven unions in the Shyamnagar and Assasuni upazilas of the cyclone-Aila-hit district.  Moreover, the embankment on the Ichamati river, flowing through parts of the Debhata upazila, have also become dilapidated due to a lack of overhaul.  The embankment bars in these areas are in such ramshackle condition that they could collapse anytime; resulting a huge amount of land being submerged. According to the Water Development Board, around 250 kilometers of the 799.10 kilometer-long embankments in the district have been labeled extremely risky.     Subrata Mandal, a resident of Kamalkati village under Padmapukur union of Shyamnagar upazila, said: \"The embankment's condition--in the Kamalkati, Purbapatakhali, Chaulkhola and Banyatala villages of Padmapukur union--is very risky and might collapse anytime.\" Padmapukur Union Chairman SM Ataur Rahman said nearly six kilometers of the embankments in his union are badly decayed. Masudul Alam, chairman of Gabura union in Shyamnagar upazila, also said the barrage in his union and adjacent areas is extremely vulnerable after being damaged by two cyclones -- Aila and Sidr. He also complained about negligence of duty by the Water Development Board as it is their duty to look after the well-being of the dam. According to sources, there are 377.10 kilometers of embankment line under Water Development Board 1 in Satkhira. Sixty kilometers of that embankment line is damaged.  On the other, Water Development Board 2 is responsible for 422 kilometers of embankment line. One hundred and fifty kilometers of the line is also damaged.  Arifuzzaman Khan, executive engineer of Water Development Board 2, said: \"We have sent notice to the higher authority concerned about the embankment's risky condition. Necessary steps will be taken after receiving funds.\" Meanwhile, Ekata Jubo Sangha and development organization BARCIK staged a human chain in Padmapukur union's Kamalkati village; demanding the repair of the embankments on Kholpetua and Kapatakkha rivers. People of all strata of life took part in the human chain."

It also said the decision to revoke the licences of 25 companies and suspend the licence of one was upheld. Licences of all these companies were either revoked or suspended when BSTI in the first phase of tests found 52 out of 406 food items to be substandard. BSTI on Tuesday also said that 22 of the 93 other food items, currently being sold in the market, were found substandard in the second phase of testing."

      "text": "Locals say renovation and preservation could potentially turn this place into a tourist spot for people keen on travelling Rudrakar Math (Rudrakar Field) is a historic establishment and archeological site in Shariatpur. Even though locals identify it as the Rudrakar Jamindar Bari Math, it is in fact the mausoleum of Nilmoni Chakraborty, an influential Jamindar who lived over 250 years ago. However, this tall historic structure is in near ruins, neglected by the authorities.   Locals say renovation and preservation could potentially turn this place into a tourist spot for people keen on travelling. It is approximately 3km south of the Shariatpur deputy commissioner's office. Locals know this place as the Babu Bari Math. Visiting, this correspondent found this historic site in a dire state, with collapsing wall plaster, garbage, and weeds all around. There used to be inscriptions on the wall even a few years ago, and the valuable artifacts used in the structure were stolen over the years since the liberation war.   During the war the Pakistani army, with the help of local Razakars (Pakistani collaborators), tried to destroy the math using machine gun and mortar shells, but it did little to no damage to the structure. According to local history, at the beginning of the era of Jamindars, the Mandir was established in phases by Banilal Chakraborty, Khitilal Chakraborty, and Boshontolal Chakraborty, the three sons of Nilmoni Chakraborty.     It took renowned masons Tilok Bhuiya and Gurucharan Bhuiya, and hundreds of extra hands, to complete the structure  over a span of 10 years.  Senior citizens in the region said that under Jamindar rule, this region saw  great advancement in the practice of education and culture. During British rule, they built 19 schools in a half square kilometre area, where education and cultural practices flourished.  Rudrakar Jamindar Bari was surrounded by 8 or 10 multistoried buildings. Among them, the three storied buildings were residential chambers. The others were used for court sessions, warehouses, theatres, kitchens, and worshipping purposes.     Rudrakar Union Parishad Chairman Habibur Rahman Dhali said: \"A lot of valuables were stolen from the site due to negligence. It is my sincere request to the government that they look into preserving and renovating this historic monument, so that it can be turned into an attractive tourist spot.\"  Shariatpur Additional District Commissioner Md Mamun Ul Hasan said: \"We have previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Department of Archaeology regarding renovation of the Rudrakar Jamindar Bari Math. We will once again notify the authorities concerned to renovate and preserve this ancient archaeological site. \""

September-October (Ashwin-Kartik) is their peak breeding season, he added. \"Ilish follows the lunar cycles of seasons for breeding. This year's ilish ban started four days before the first full moon and ended seven days after the new moon of Ashwin-Kartik. This means their conception period started just few days before ban ended\", said another District Fisheries Officer Abu Sayed. According local fishermen, ilish breeding season started after the end of imposed restriction period due to the delayed start to the rainy season. Ajit Kumar Das, a leader of the Barisal Fish Traders Association, said the huge quantity of egg bearing ilish may indicate the change of breeding season of ilish."

      "headline": "Private credit growth trimmed down to 14.8% for FY20",
      "authors": "Mohammed Monirul Alam",
      "text": "BB unveils monetary policy statement The Bangladesh Bank (BB) on Wednesday unveiled a cautious monetary policy focused on achieving 8.2% economic growth in the current fiscal year, claiming a surplus of liquidity in the banking sector to fund the private sector. In the new monetary program, the central bank lowered the target of credit to private sector to 14.80% for the current 2019-20 fiscal from 16.50% set for the second half of the last fiscal year. The policy projected 24.30% credit growth for the public sector. Actual credit growth to private sector was 11.29% and 21.10% for public sector in January-June, according to BB data. Governor Fazle Kabir unveiled the monetary policy statement (MPS) at a press conference held at the central bank headquarters in the city. Senior BB officials were present at the program. Fazle Kabir said the central bank reviewed the budgetary investment requirements before setting up the fresh credit growth targets to ensure sufficient flow of finance to public and private sectors to enhance the economic expansion. \"This is 'a cautiously accommodative' monetary program in order to help the government achieve 8.2% GDP (gross domestic product) growth target and contain inflation at 5.5%,\" Fazle Kabir said. He said that the central bank thought the 14.80% growth in private sector credit would be enough to raise investment towards achieving the targeted GDP growth. He said the BB would pursue its policy instruments for keeping inflation at 5.5% as projected by the government in the budget for 2019-20 fiscal. Fazle Kabir said this MPS would  be in action for the entire fiscal, from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. He said the BB decided to enforce one monetary program for each  financial year, effective from the current fiscal, instead of twice. He said the BB had been announcing two MPS since 2006 -- one in January and another in July. Capital market  Regarding the capital market, the MPS stated that correctly priced new IPOs (initial public offerings) of healthy and well-managed corporations might bring lasting solution to intermittent volatility at capital market.  It says the newly introduced IPO rules by Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission will be instrumental to overcoming manipulation of the market information. In his speech, the governor, however, didn't make any comment over the capital market. Non-performing loans (NPL) The governor said the NPL would decrease in the last quarter that ended on June 30, 2019 as the central bank pursued banks to enforce policy instruments like new provisioning guidelines for the defaulters. Banks were also advised to avoid imprudent lending so that no new NPL was generated. Till March 2019, the NPL rose to Tk110,874 crore or 11.87% of total loans and advances of the banking sector. The Banking Regulations and Policy Department of Bangladesh Bank established a Task Force to monitor banks' NPL.  Single-digit interest rates Regarding single digit interest rates, the BB governor said the weighted average lending rates of banks came down to 9.58% in June 2019 from 9.95% in the same month of previous fiscal. He said the BB would continue pursuing banks to reduce lending rate to single digit.  Liquidity mismatch Denying the much-talked-about liquidity shortfall in the banking sector, the governor said a mismatch had been detected in liquidity status of banks as some banks had sufficient liquidity while some did not.  Till June 2019, surplus liquidity was at Tk86,816 crore at banks after maintaining CRR (cash reserve requirements) and SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) provisions, he claimed. The governor said high export earnings, rise in remittance and FDI (foreign direct investment) inflows together eased the liquidity pressure. \"In addition, there is a money market from where a bank can borrow on call to meet liquidity demand, if any,\" he said. The governor said the central bank would not consider any change in key-policy rates like repo, reverse repo and CRR and SLR right now as it felt no liquidity crisis existed. Foreign exchange market Trashing the possibility of any depreciation of taka against US dollars, the governor said the forex market was stable now with exchange rate at Tk84.50 for one unit of greenback.  \"We are comfortable with that. No depreciation will take place right now. However, we are not rigid. Situation will tell us what to do and the central bank will do that for sure,\" he added. Incentive for inward remittance  The governor said the central bank recently proposed a monthly ceiling for inward remittance for getting incentive for the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The proposal came following the government's announcement of providing 2% cash incentive for inward remittance. \"This initiative is aimed at widening scope of exploiting the external resources as cash incentives will encourage remitters to send higher amount of money through banking and other legal channels,\" said the governor. Replying to a question on outgoing remittances, the governor said the central bank would include the information distinctly in next monetary programs. BB to carry out study on informal economy, employment Replying to a question over the disclosure of employment statistics simultaneously with the country's development, the governor said the BB would carry out employment statistics in its next monetary program. Admitting the necessity of carrying out study on informal economy, governor Fazle Kabir said, \"We will go for conducting the study soon.\" BB measures in aid of flood-affected people  The governor said the central bank took initiatives to help flood-affected people across the country by undertaking different programs. The initiatives include suspension of farm-credit repayment until flood situation improves, fresh credit for farmers and flood-affected people to help implement income generation schemes, relief works for flood-affected peoples from the Corporate Social Responsibility funds of banks."

      "text": "The Cricket Association of Bengal organized the program at the Eden Garden on completion of the first day of the historic day-night test match there Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday said Bangladesh is working for the development of cricket as it is the most popular game in the country and sought India's help in this regard. \"Now, cricket is the most popular game in Bangladesh as it's in India. We have put in much efforts to improve the game. Hope, India would continue to help Bangladesh develop its cricket,\" she said while addressing a cultural program at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, reports UNB. The Cricket Association of Bengal organized the program at the Eden Garden on completion of the first day of the historic day-night test match there. Sheikh Hasina said the multi-faceted relationship between Bangladesh and India has reached a new height over the last decade. \"It's my sincere hope that the deep ties of friendship that exist between Bangladesh and India will continue to grow and flourish in the coming days.\" About hosting international cricket events, Hasina said Bangladesh hosted many international competitions, including ICC World Cup matches. She recalled the first test match of Bangladesh against India at Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka in 2000 when the present president of Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Shourav Ganguly was the Captain of the Indian team. \"Today is a memorable day for the cricket fans in both Bangladesh and India. Many of team members of the first test match between India and Bangladesh are present here today. I extend my greetings to them. I'm sure we'll have many more similar and happy occasions in the days ahead,\" the PM said. Hasina said Bangladesh and India share identical history, culture, language, sports and other unique commonalities, and recalled the enormous contributions of Indian government and its people, especially the people of West Bengal, to the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971. \"We fought a war against an unjust military ruler at the clarion call of our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. At that time, a number of critical activities was mobilized and carried out from West Bengal, particularly from Kolkata with the support of the people of India,\" she said. Hasina said Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman visited Kolkata on February 6, 1972 during his first oversees tour of India. \"We have a very special relationship with India. The relationship is the friendliest one. The friendship of Bangladesh and India is in our hearts. The bonds of friendship will remain firm and long-lasting,\" she quoted Bangabandhu as saying in a dinner party during his first visit to Kolkata after the Liberation War. \"This is still the guiding principle of Bangladesh-India relations. Today, our relationship has become a role model of good neighborliness for the rest of the world,\" Hasina added. She said Bangladesh Bhavan at Santiniketan is yet another milestone of the growing cultural ties of the relationship of Bangladesh and India. Last year, she along with her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi and Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee inaugurated it, Hasina mentioned. The people of Bangladesh and West Bengal share food habits, poets, novelists and artists, the Prime Minister pointed out. She said the overwhelming influence of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore and Rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam on the lives of the two peoples is unique. \"Cricket is another binding force between the people of our two countries,\" the premier said.

      "text": "'We were about to harvest our ripe Aman crops, but before we could, the cyclone flooded all our crops' Farmers in Koyra upazila of Khulna are frustrated and in despair. It will be a bad harvest for them, with 26,000 hectares of crops destroyed by Cyclone Bulbul across the district which hit the coastal areas of Bangladesh early Sunday. Shamim Sheikh, a local fish farmer, said his fish enclosure on two acres of leased land was completely destroyed by the cyclone. He also said there were other farmers in the upazila who will face similar if not greater losses.  Abu Taher, a paddy farmer from Ghatakhali, said: \"We were about to harvest our ripe Aman crops, but before we could, the cyclone flooded all our crops.\" Abul Kashem, another paddy farmer, said: \"The paddy on my eight bighas of land was just about to form grains, and we could harvest within a few weeks. But the storm ruined everything.\" Koyra Upazila Agriculture Officer Mizan Mahmud said: \"Farmers in the upazila have been instructed to bind their collapsed paddy crops together to save them from rotting. However, crops which have lost the sheaf are most likely going to get spoiled.\" Pankaj Kumar Majumdar, deputy director of the Department of Agricultural Extension of Khulna district, said: \"At least 25,000 hectares of Aman, 864 hectares of vegetables, 52 hectares of banana, 100 hectares of papaya, 40 hectares of mustard, and 36 hectares of betel leaves were destroyed. \"Farmers in the district were expected to harvest 91,000 hectares of Aman, 3,610 hectares of vegetables, 503 hectares of banana, 357 hectares of papaya, 40 hectares of mustard, 790 hectares of betel leaves.\"    Koyra Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Shimul Kumar Saha said: \"At least 2,300 home were completely destroyed, while around 4,800 homes were partially affected in seven unions of Koyra upazila due to cyclonic storm Bulbul.\" On Sunday, cyclonic storm Bulbul hit the coastal areas including Khulna, around 3:30am and wreaked havoc for five hours."

      "text": "Since morning, no goods were unloaded or released from Benapole Land Port Since on Monday morning, no goods were unloaded or released from Benapole Land Port. Drivers in three North Bengal districts also joined the strike. Bus and truck drivers in 10 districts have gone on strike, protesting the new Road Transport Act 2018 (RTA) which came into effect across Bangladesh on November 17. The unannounced strike has crippled the country's southwestern districts since Monday morning, causing immense suffering to passengers and cargo transport. The 10 districts are Jessore, Khulna, Bagerhat, Satkhira, Magura, Narail, Jhenaidah, Meherpur, Kushtia, and Chuadanga. \"Transport workers in 10 districts in the country's southwestern region have stopped bus services,\" Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association General Secretary Mortaza Hossain told Dhaka Tribune.  Since morning, no goods were unloaded or released from Benapole Land Port, with a line of empty trucks on both sides of the border, waiting for goods to transport. However, export-import and immigration services remained active at the land port. At the same time, vehicular movement of other smaller transport remained normal along the  Jessore-Benapole route. In Khulna, bus drivers went on an indefinite strike, demanding correction in some sections of the RTA, halting communication on all road routes in the district. The demands include rectification of fines imposed on vehicle owners and drivers, and withdrawing restrictions imposed on small vehicles. Confirming the matter to Dhaka Tribune, Kazi Md Nurul Islam Bebi, president of Khulna Motor Workers' Union, said: \"The bus drivers decided to go on an indefinite strike demanding amendments to the newly enacted act. \"Transport workers do respect the new law; however, it affects transport workers and owners directly. Therefore, they are protesting so that some of the sections in the law, including penalties and fines on drivers and owners, and making them a non-bailable offence, are amended.\" Meanwhile, the Dhaka Tribune found bus drivers and workers, and other transport workers, playing cricket on the lawn of Sonadanga bus stand on Monday morning. \"We work all day and do not get any time to play. On Tuesday we are relieved from our everyday duties.  We are making good use of our free time, playing cricket,\" said transport worker Abul Hossain. Khulna Bus Workers Union President Mahabubul Islam said the drivers suspended their service as most of them did not have a license. Transport workers play cricket in the bus stand area due to leisure in their regular work flow on Monday, November 18, 2019 | Dhaka TribuneThe drivers cannot get a new license or renew their old license from the BRTA due to the sudden demand brought on by the implementation of the new law, he added. Strike leaves passengers stranded Passengers from different districts who are currently trapped in Khulna, expressed frustration with the situation. \"I wanted to go to my village home from Khulna, but I found no mode of transportation at the Sonadanga bus stand,\" said Rajia Aktar of Faridpur.  Mamun Sheikh, a resident of Dhaka, said: \"I could not get back to work after vacation as my Royal Falguni Paribahan bus ticket was refunded because of the strike.\" In Satkhira, transport workers declared an indefinite strike by halting services on all routes until the new Road Transport Act is amended. Meanwhile, thousands of passengers were in distress as bus services were suddenly suspended in the district. They have been trying to reach their destinations on three-wheelers paying higher fares. Transport workers, including bus drivers, said the new law imposes the death penalty on drivers if anyone dies in a road accident and a fine of Tk5 lakh if anyone injured.  They said a driver cannot afford to pay such a large sum of money as the maximum salary of a driver is around Tk15,000-20,000.  As such, the transport workers refused to resume their services until the law is amended. Former president of Satkhira Bus-Minibus Owners' Association, Abu Ahmed, said: \"The transport workers want the new transport law to be amended before it is implemented. \"The owners can do nothing if the workers stop operating the buses.\" In Jhenaidah, bus services along district's routes to Jessore, Kushtia, Magura and Chuadanga remained suspended since on Monday morning, but a few easy-bikes and now-banned three-wheeler autorickshaws were plying the highway routes. In Kushtia, bus service remained unavailable since the morning due to the strike demanding the amendment of the Road Transport Act. In Narail, all transport from the district were suspended since on Monday morning. Ibrahim Mollah, a driver, alleged that with the new transport laws do not favour them and will increase driver harassment.  In Tangail, movement of all transport from Bhuapur was suspended since morning. In Rajshahi, bus services came to a halt on all routes, including the Rajshahi-Naogaon route. Rajshahi Motor Workers Union President Jahangir Alam said the strike was not called by the union. In Hili, all bus services on the Hili-Bogra route have been suspended since Saturday. Local bus driver Shariful Islam said the drivers would have to pay fines exceeding their income if the new law is implemented.

The houses and croplands of the villages of the Kalapara and Mirzaganj upazilas were submerged under water, as the increased water level of the rivers and the sea--caused by Fani --forced the dams at several points to break, on Friday afternoon.  Panel Chairman of Subidhkhali union, in Mirzaganj upazila, Md Ismail said: \"Around 11am, the Mehendiabad, Charkhali, Golkhali, and Ranipur villages became submerged, after the dams broke due to the high tide. The houses of nearly 2,500 villagers, and their croplands, have been damaged. Lalua Union Parishad Chairman, Md Shawkat Hossain Biswas, said: \"Because of the high tide, 16 villages under Lalua union, of Kalapara upazila, were flooded. The dams for four-five kilometres, from Munshipara to Pasharbunia, are badly broken.\"  He added: \"The Charipara, Manzupara, Munshipara, Nachnapara, Chowdhurypara, Nayakata, Bhanjupara, Hawla, Kalaupara, Banatipara, Pasharbunia, Chandupara, Char Chandupara, Chhata no. 10 , Chhata no. 5, and Nawapara villages have been submerged.\" Mirzaganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO), Md Iqbal Hossain, said he has gone to inspect the flooded regions.  Fani is likely to cross the Odisha coast of India by the afternoon, move north-northeastwards over the Odisha-West Bengal coastal area, and reach Khulna and adjoining south-western parts of Bangladesh by midnight."

      "text": "Earlier on July 31, a High Court bench rejected the bail petition in the case  BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia has filed an appeal with the Appellate Division against the High Court order that had rejected her bail plea in the Zia Charitable Trust graft case.  Confirming the matter, Khaleda's lawyer and panel member Advocate Sagir Hossain Leon said: \"We filed the appeal on Thursday against the High Court order and now we are seeking her bail in the case as well.\" Earlier on July 31, a High Court bench rejected the bail petition in the Zia Charitable Trust corruption case, in which Khaleda had been sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. The court also ordered a status quo on the sub-ordinate court's order to confiscate 4,200,000 katha of land bought in the name of the Zia Charitable Trust, and asked it to send the court all of the documents related with the case.  On April 30, the High Court accepted Khaleda's appeal petition challenging a trial court verdict. On November 18, 2018, Khaleda had filed the appeal on 20 grounds, asking the court to scrap the verdict along with fine and grant her bail. The conviction On October 29, 2018, a special court in Dhaka found Khaleda guilty in the Zia Charitable Trust graft case--in absentia--and sentenced her to seven years of rigorous imprisonment. The three-time former prime minister was fined Tk10 lakh, and given a six months' additional jail term if she fails to pay the sum. Apart from her, the court also sentenced Harris Chowdhury, political secretary to then-Prime Minister Khaleda; his assistant personal secretary, Ziaul Haq Munna; and Monirul Islam Khan, assistant personal secretary to then-Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka. The court also ordered that the land bought in the trust's name be confiscated. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed the case against the four with the capital's Tejgaon police station on August 8, 2011. The same court on February 8, 2018, had also sentenced BNP chief Khaleda to five-year imprisonment in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case. Her son Tarique Rahman and four others--Kamal Uddin Siddique, Kazi Salimul Haque, Sharfuddin Ahmed, and Ziaur Rahman's nephew Mominur Rahman--were sentenced to 10 years in prison in this case, as well. However, on October 30, 2018, the High Court dismissed Khaleda's appeal in the case and doubled her punishment to 10 years of imprisonment."

      "text": "Palash used to live in Dhaka, while his family lives and runs a grocery shop in Sonargaon upazila of Narayanganj Investigators have located the family of Mohammed Palash Ahmed alias Mahadi, who was killed by security forces after attempting to hijack a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight on Sunday. The motives behind Palash's hijacking attempt are yet to be discovered. Palash's family members described him as an unruly and rebellious youth, who had become disconnected from them. Although he had quit his studies at the higher secondary level, he loved to introduce himself as a student of Dhaka University. Palash used to live in Dhaka, while his family lives and runs a grocery shop in Sonargaon upazila of Narayanganj. His family said they have no idea what he used to do in Dhaka, but had heard that he was involved in acting. They added that Palash would regularly request financial assistance, most recently borrowing 500 UAE Dirhams from his father Piyar Jahan on Friday after saying he was leaving Bangladesh for Dubai. \"What he has done is embarrassing for us. We do not want to see him again. The hijacking incident has left his mother bedridden. We will have a discussion about his body later,\" his father said. Doctors at Chattogram Medical College Hospital conducted an autopsy on Palash's body yesterday afternoon, but did not want to reveal details to the press. Sources said he sustained a bullet injury in his abdomen.  A fake explosive vest and firearm that may also be fake were recovered from Palash's body. Bangladesh's Civil Aviation Authority Chairman Naim Hassan told reporters Palash seemed mentally unstable based on his behavior on the plane. A stint in jail According to Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), Palash's fingerprint matched with records in RAB's criminal database as he had been arrested in connection with an abduction case and served 20 days in jail before securing bail in 2012.  The 25-year-old had studied at Taherpur Senior Madrassa in Narayanganj, and passed SSC level examinations.  RAB Legal and Media Wing Director Mufti Mahmud Khan told the Dhaka Tribune: \"He has a prior criminal record from an arrest seven years ago. He was arrested with an accomplice for abducting a teenager. They had asked for Tk800,000 in ransom.\" \"A case was filed against him on February 22, 2012. The police rescued the victim of the kidnapping a little over a month later, on March 24. Palash was in jail for 20 days before he was let out on bail,\" the RAB spokesperson said. He added that RAB had no information on any criminal activity by Palash from 2012 till the hijacking attempt. Quoting a police officer in Palash's home district, the New York Times reported that he was a conman who would take money from people by promising to secure jobs for them abroad. Married to an actress? Palash's family members said he visited their home with film actress Shimla about 10 months ago, saying she had wanted to visit the area. Two months later, the family learned that the two had gotten married. After the marriage, Palash visited his family less regularly and would spend most of his time in Dhaka. However, he recently returned home and stayed there for 15 days. Palash did not have a national identity card, but he had a Facebook profile under the name Mahibi Jahan. The account listed Shimla as his wife and included a number of photos of the two, while identifying Palash as an IT Business Analyst for British Airways who lived in the UK. Shimla could not be reached for comment, despite repeated attempts to contact her. \"Palash was married once before, and has a child from that marriage, but got divorced,\" his father said. His family members also said they were not aware of any links between Palash and militant groups. \"A team from Sonargaon police station visited my home around 1am yesterday, and searched my residence. The police left us alone after that. Palash was the youngest of my four children.\""

      "text": "The representatives from development organizations demanded the government to redesign the draft by repealing inconsistent and unclear sections  Expressing grave concern over the draft of the Volunteer Social Welfare Organizations (Registration and Control) Act 2019, local and international development organizations on Sunday called upon the government to change, edit and repeal some of the sections that are unclear and conflicting. In a statement issued to media, they also demanded the government to consult with stakeholders and experts to redesign the draft before placing it for approval. What does the draft say? Section 11, sub-sections 1 and 2 stipulates that this law takes precedence over other existing laws regarding registration, and all NGOs have to register, and renew their registrations every five years. Failure to renew registration or rejection by the authority will result in the dissolution of the NGO. Section 17 has the provision for dissolving an NGO, if the government authorities have reason to believe they are not in the best interest of the public, or have broken the law. Sub-section 2 says, the government can dissolve the NGO from the date an order is issued. Sub-section 3 says, an NGO will be declared dissolved from the day its registration is revoked. Also Read- Could the new social welfare law cripple NGOs? Section 3 of the draft act, says the law will get preference no matter what is said in other relevant laws, but section 4 (1) says no development organization can continue its activity without following rules of the new act which is conflicting with constitution, Trust Act 1882, Foreign Donations (Voluntary Activities) Regulation Act 2016, Societies Regulation Act 1860 and Cooperative Societies Law 2001. What do NGOs say? It is completely illogical when a foreign funded non government development organization needs to be registered under this law, despite being already registered with NGO Affairs Bureau, the NGOs said. Also, the draft has proposed that all NGOs will have to register with the Ministry of Social Welfare, even after already having registration with NGO Affairs Bureau.  The controlling system of two different government offices to a development organization will create double rule and create bureaucratic problems which will create risk of significantly curtailing NGO operations, it added. Section 10 introduces the most restrictive part of the law - all NGOs will be able to work in only one district, when they first register. After registration, NGOs can expand their scope of work, but only to five districts at a time. \"The provision will create obstacles for foreign funded NGOs and other local NGOs currently doping development work in different districts which needs to be reconsidered immediately,\" it said. Demands Expressing utter dissatisfaction, the representatives from development organizations demanded the government to redesign the draft by repealing inconsistent and unclear sections in consultation with stakeholders including local and foreign development organizations before it gets a final nod.

      "text": "According to the log book of the landfill, around 2,000 tons of waste are dumped on a daily basis from different parts of north Dhaka Amin Bazar sanitary landfill, the lone landfill for all of Dhaka North City Corporation's (DNCC) waste has turned into an artificial floating island in the flood flow zone near the Turag River, severely damaging the ecosystem. According to the log book of the landfill, around 2,000 tons of waste are dumped on a daily basis from different parts of north Dhaka. The project does not have an environmental clearance certificate from the Department of Environment (DoE). An August 5 inter-ministerial meeting at the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change claimed that DNCC did not follow the directives prescribed in the Environment Conservation Rules, 1997, in the first place while building the landfill, failing to ensure a sound environment. Interestingly, 12 years after DNCC started using the area as a landfill has just started operating an effluent plant, that again, on a trial basis and saying it would erect a wall to save waters from getting polluted from the waste. What took it so long remained a mystery.  DNCC chief waste management officer Md Manzur Hossain said they have requested for more land for further extension of the landfill. The dump yard has become over-loaded from all sides and falls on the path of a flood flow zone near a canal of the Turag River. During a recent visit, this correspondent witnessed the sorry state of the landfill as the waste was polluting with water.  The water in the river had a dark bluish tint while nearby plants lost their leaves due to the high toxicity levels in water. Solid waste is floating on the water and carried for miles as there are no walls or barriers dividing the garbage and the water. The landfill built in 2007 on 52 acres of land was expanded in 2017 as the garbage over the years exceeded the capacity, but the sanitary landfill has turned into an open dump due to the haphazard disposal of waste. Locals claimed that all the adjacent agricultural lands have also become infertile. Before the landfill was built, rice was cultivated in those lands. At present, people find dead fish frequently in the river while people living in the neighbouring area suffer from various skin diseases. A local, Mizanur Rahman, said: \"I am suffering from itches on my hands and legs. Skin diseases are inevitable if someone comes in contact with this water. \"Also, rice cannot be cultivated in nearby lands and fish are not found in the water body nowadays since it has become toxic,\" he added. Inter-ministerial meeting finds huge loss of ecosystem The surface and ground water has been polluted over time due to the unplanned dumping of various types of municipality waste in the landfill, according to the minutes of the August 5 inter-ministerial meeting. During rainy season, untreated solid and liquid waste mix with the water as the site is in flood flow zone, thus polluting the Turag River, wetlands as well as the whole environment, it added. \"Huge amount of agricultural land has been damaged, and the environment is being polluted with hazardous waste affecting birds and insects,\" the minutes of the meeting reads. The Environment Conservation Rules 1997 made it mandatory to have an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and maintain sound environmental conditions in all steps of building and operation of landfills. However the DNCC neither conducted the EIA, nor obtained any environmental clearance - a clear violation of the rules. \"They only set up a Leachate water treatment plant. Even this plant did not obtain any clearance certificate and DoE has no information whether it is enough to treat leachate water,\" the minute reads.  Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Service (Cegis) research associate Feroze Ahmed Kanak, in a study released in April, said the 200 to 300 acres of land surrounding the landfill, are not cultivable which is forcing the inhabitants nearby to leave their homes as there are no livelihood from farming or fishing and the environment is too toxic to live in. DNCC now wants land extension Meanwhile, DNCC has requested for more land for extending the landfill further. Md Manzur Hossain, DNCC chief waste management officer said that they have set up an Effluent Treatment Plant and it is treating leachate waste on a trial basis. \"We are going to incinerate the waste to produce electricity from it,\" he said.  \"We applied for 80 acre land acquisition for the extension of the landfill. We have a plan to build a wall in second phase so that waste cannot mix with water and adjacent lands,\" he added. When contacted, the DoE's designated officer for Dhaka district Sahida Begum said that they notified the DNCC several times to take the necessary steps as per the law.  \"They promised us that they would do so. We hope, as a government organization DNCC will become more respectful to the rules and regulation,\" she said."

The attack occurred as the violence in India's state of Assam spilled over to Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Guwahati, reports UNB. Acting foreign secretary Kamrul Ahsan held a meeting with Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Riva Ganguly Das at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday evening and requested the protection of personnel and property of the mission by the host government. Ganguly assured that the authorities concerned of the Indian government are being immediately alerted to enhance security of the chancery and residential premises of the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Guwahati.  It has come to the attention of the ministry that some people from the processions and agitations taking place throughout Thursday in Guwahati torn down two signposts of the mission approximately 30 yards away from the chancery premise. On Wednesday, the security vehicle escorting the assistant high commissioner from the airport to the city was attacked by mobs protesting adoption of the bill. The appropriate Indian authorities have already taken enhanced security measures to protect the Assistant High Commission premises, its personnel and members of their families, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The government of Bangladesh believes that the attack on the convoy of the assistant high commissioner and vandalization of the signposts is a one-off incident and it will not affect the excellent bilateral relations that Bangladesh and India enjoy."

      "text": "Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation, however, suspended their strike around 18 hours after enforcing it across the country People are suffering immeasurably, especially those stranded with family members at different places, as inland water transport workers enforced indefinite countrywide strike from early Tuesday. Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation, however, suspended their strike around 18 hours after enforcing it across the country, to press home their 11-point demand, including increasing salary, providing appointment letter, and identity card, and landing pass for India bound workers. Passengers of Dhaka-Chandpur route, which leaves the terminal during the day, suffered the most due to the strike, said Sadarghat police station Officer-in-Charge Md Rezaul Karim Bhuiyan. Sufferings of Passengers started to ease from the evening, after the agitating workers decided to keep passenger vessels out of the purview of the strike. They decided to allow plying of all types of passenger vessels, considering the country's present situation, and the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha, said Bangladesh Shipping Workers' Federation Office Secretary Prakash Dutta. After a meeting with the director general of the Department of Shipping, the strikers withdrew the strike after being assured that their demands would be met by August 30. Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam, the secretary general of Bangladesh Naujan Sramik Federation told Dhaka Tribune: \"Considering nationwide flood, upcoming Eid, absence of State Minister of Labour and Employment Monnujan Sufian, we have decided to postpone the strike.\" \"Passenger launches resumed operations on 43 river routes this evening (Wednesday),\" he said. On July 20, Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation announced the strike. During the strike no passenger and cargo carriers operated on any inland water routes. As a result, cargo handling remained stagnant at Chittagong, and Mongla sea ports, causing losses to exporters, and importers. In Chittagong, some 352 vessels loaded with around 4,94,155 tons of different types of goods remained stranded all day on Wednesday at different jetties of the port city.  The unloading operations were halted due to the work abstention, said Ataul Kabir Ranju, joint secretary of Water Transport Cell (WTC). The unloading from mother vessels anchored at the outer anchorage of Chittagong Port faced a huge loss due to the strike, said Mahbub Chowdhury, Vice-President of Chittagong Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce & Industries. \"The port will face container and vessel congestion, and the economy will have to bear the brunt if the deadlock continues,\" Nabi Alam, Joint Secretary of Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation said. In Khulna, around 1200 carrier vessels at Bhairab, Rupsa, Kajibacha, Shalta, Pashur, Shivasa, and Shakbaria rivers remained stranded due to the strike. No launches left the BIWTA jetty, as well as no ferries plied on the rivers since on Wednesday morning, causing huge sufferings to the commuters. In Barisal, no vessel, including good-laden ones, operated on some 18 routes in the southern parts of the country, since the morning, due to the strike, said Hashem Ali, Barisal unit president of Bangladesh Noonan Sramik Federation.

The protest began around 8am on Wednesday, with the workers taking positions in front of the main gates of the jute mills that they are employed in. The protest will continue until 5pm. Md Murad Hossain, convener of Jute Mills Sramik League (Khulna, Jessore region), said: \"This workers' movement mainly began with workers demanding the implementation of national wage commission.  Jute mill workers protest in Khulna on November 27, 2019 | Dhaka Tribune\"But, somehow, the authorities managed to assuage the protesters and thus stop the protest by settling their outstanding wages. He added: \"However, this time, the workers would not cease the protest at any cost because most of us are outraged with the fact that the national wage commission has not been implemented in five years.\" He, therefore, said they began this symbolic hunger strike as part of the demonstration and will continue to protest until the wage commission is implemented. On November 25, the workers went on a hunger strike for the first time. Jute mill workers in Khulna and Jessore held demonstrations by blocking roads and highways to press home their demands. File Photo: A worker piles his trade at a jute mill factory in Khulna on Wednesday, May 22, 2019 | Dhaka Tribune The demands included implementation of the national wage commission, repeal of public-private partnership (PPP) and payment of gratuities to retired workers and staff of the factories. The workers announced the outline of their protest program on November 23. According to their program, they will hold a procession and strike on December 2 and 3, respectively.  The jute mill workers are also scheduled to hold a rally on December 8, and planned to go on a hunger strike on December 10, by staging a sit-in protest in front of the main gates of the mills they work for."

      "text": "Climate change cannot be mitigated through discussions alone Bangladesh is globally known as one of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of global warming and climate calamity. It not only affects human development and biodiversity conservation but also poses a threat to human security, with an increased frequency of extreme weather events leading to degrading socio-economic conditions. Sea-level rise is expected to continue for centuries. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected that during the 21st century, sea-levels will rise another 18 to 59cm, but these numbers do not include \"uncertainties in climate-carbon cycle feedbacks\" or \"the full effects of changes in ice sheet flow.\" A sea-level rise of just 400mm in the Bay of Bengal would put 11% of Bangladesh's coastal land underwater, creating 7-10 million climate refugees. The variation of humidity, temperature, and rainfall caused by climate change is likely to have ample health consequences. High temperature manipulates the reproduction and survival of infective agents within the vector, thereby further influencing disease diffusion in areas where the vector is previously present. In general, by reducing fresh water supplies, climate alteration affects sanitation and lowers the efficiency of local sewer systems, leading to amplified concentrations of pathogens in unprocessed water supplies. Subsequently, mosquito larvae develop in such places, which may in turn cause mosquito-borne diseases. Apart from that, numerous diseases that are transmitted by mosquitoes (chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever), sand flies (leishmaniasis) and ticks (Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis) may also be amplified by climate alteration. Dengue has lately taken a serious turn in many parts of the country. In Dhaka alone, there were reports of hundreds of people suffering attacks, a majority of whom were hospitalized.  Economic losses will increase by threefold to a cumulative $129 billion -- and as high as $5.1 billion per year under more pessimistic climate scenarios -- with economic losses rising in later years. Based on this model, the southern coastal regions and the northwestern regions are expected to experience the largest income declines. IPCC estimates that, in Bangladesh, production of rice and wheat might drop by 8% and 32%, respectively, by the year 2050. The degradation of the quality of the urban environment is a consequence of economic activities which affect the environment, sanitation security, and public health, either directly or indirectly.  Every day, thousands of people migrate to the cities after being affected by landlessness, impoverishment, employment contraction among the poor and marginalized, river erosion, and natural calamities. In general, the urban poor live in slums and low-income settlements. Many who cannot afford to live in slum dwellings live on the streets.  They suffer from non-sanitary latrines, unhygienic garbage disposal, and impure water supply. No sanitation is safe when covered by flood waters, as fecal matter mixes with flood waters and spreads everywhere the flood water goes. In Dhaka, which has a piped sewage network, only 2% of fecal load is treated. In reality, human health depends on an adequate supply of potable water. By reducing fresh water supplies, climate change affects sanitation and lowers the efficiency of local sewer systems, leading to concentrations of pathogens in unprocessed water supplies. The unforeseen increase in extreme rainfall events, which is associated with outbreaks of diarrheal disease, may overwhelm the public water supply system. The poor, who are environmentally or agriculturally displaced and live in urban areas, have no capacity, education, or financial aptitude to fight against this climate-induced health insecurity. Scientists predict that, due to tropical cyclones and salinity intrusion into farming lands in coastal areas, environmental refugees will exceed 20 million in the future. As a result, their demand for land, water, employment, and other public services generate conflict with local residents.  Some foreign and local alliances -- WHO, IPCC, Bangladesh poribesh andolon, Bangladesh environment network, Bangladesh environmental lawyers association -- believe that climate change cannot be mitigated through discussions. To reduce the climatic impacts, we have to take financial initiatives, share adaptive technology, and increase awareness to reduce carbon use. What is critical now is to move away from producing \"papers and reports,\" and towards investing human, material, and financial resources on the issues at the places where climate change is having an impact, for a collective and sustainable Bangladesh.

The prime minister was addressing the \"national standard\" handing over ceremony of the Bangladesh Infantry Regiments (BIR)-7th, 8th, 9th and 10th at Shaheed Col Anis Parade Ground in Rajshahi Cantonment. She handed over the national standard to the commander of the respective regiments. A smartly turned out contingent of Bangladesh Army gave salute to the prime minister through a spectacular parade. Along with Chief of Army Staff Gen Aziz Ahmed and the parade commander, the prime minister reviewed the parade riding on a decorated open jeep. Describing Bangladesh Army as an \"asset\" of the country and a \"symbol\" of the confidence and the trust of the people, the premier also asked its members to be more \"professionally-efficient\" and \"welfare-minded\" with social and religious values. \"Bangladesh Army is our asset and a symbol of confidence and trust of the people. So, you will have to be even more competent, efficient, honest, and welfare-minded being imbued with social and religious values to achieve desired standard of professionalism,\" she said.  Noting that her government always received constant support of the army to serve the people, Sheikh Hasina expressed her firm belief that the army will stand beside the people whenever it will be necessary during the running of the state by the present government. The premier said the members of Bangladesh Army played an important role in upholding democratic trend of the country by performing their responsibilities with utmost sincerity in the 11th general election. \"I extend my thanks to you for it and I also express gratitude to the countrymen for getting a scope of formation of the government for the fourth time and the third consecutive term,\" she said. The premier said her government always wants to run the country as the servants of the people, never rulers. Mentioning that the government is pledge-bound to build a modern and all-round armed forces, Sheikh Hasina said for this, the government has framed the Forces Goal-2030 which is being implemented in phases. As part of it, she said, new infantry divisions, brigades, units and training centres have been established. Besides, three new divisions have been formed in the army, she also said. The prime minister said her government has established para commando brigade for the first time, while MLRS and Missile Regiment have also been added to the army for further strengthening the country's air defence system. Besides, the present government has strengthened operational capability of the army to a great extent through inducting various modern war equipment, helicopters and modern infantry gazettes to keep pace with the developed world, she added. Referring to her government's steps for women empowerment, the prime minister said the government took an epoch making decision to get female officers and soldiers admitted to the army. Sheikh Hasina said in continuation of the initiative, appointing female pilots for the first time in the history of the army initiated a new horizon. The premier recalled that despite economic constraints, Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman took steps for establishing strong armed forces in the country. At the directives of Bangabandhu, she said, Bangladesh Military Academy was founded in Comilla Cantonment in 1972. Sheikh Hasina said Bangabandhu framed the defence policy in 1974 by realizing the necessity of a developed and professional army. The premier said in the light of Bangabandhu's far-reaching defence policy, a process for modernization of the army is underway. Today, Bangladesh Army has been elevated to a dignified position at home and abroad, she said. Sheikh Hasina said to infuse more dynamism into the Infantry Division, her government for the first time realized to establish its second regiment alongside the East Bengal Regiment. \"I approved in principle the formation of Bangladesh Infantry Regiment in 1999 and formally hoisted its flag in April 2001,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh Infantry Regiment is the first regiment established after independence. There are 43 units including two para commando battalions in the regiment, she said. \"The members of the regiment are working with reputation at home and abroad and I hope that they will continue work to uphold this reputation,\" she added. Sheikh Hasina said her government has taken all kinds of steps to build Bangladesh Infantry Regimental Centre as a modern training centre. The work on increasing training and administrative facilities is underway, she said. Besides safeguarding the country's independence and sovereignty, she said, the army has engaged themselves in the nation-building programs. \"Due to your professional efficiency, the important responsibility for supervision work of the Padma Bridge and the construction work of Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Marine Drive, the Hatirjheel Project in Dhaka, and Mohipal Flyover in Feni was given to you,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the army members in different foreign missions are bringing honour and dignity through sacrifice, dutifulness and professionalism which have further brightened Bangladesh's image abroad. She said the flag is a symbol of independence, sovereignty, honour and dignity. \"So it's a responsibility of all soldiers to protect the dignity of the flag,\" she said. The premier said earning ability of getting the national flag by any unit is a matter of rare honour and pride. \"The national flag, a symbol of independence and sovereignty, has been handed over to you and I extend my heartiest congratulations to BIR-7,8, 9 and 10 for achieving this honour and glory,\" she said. \"You will have to always remain prepared to protect the dignity of the flag which you've got as recognition to your work with efficiency, hard exercise and dutifulness,\" she said. Earlier on her arrival at the venue, the prime minister was received by Chief of Army Staff Gen Aziz Ahmed and GOC and Area Commander of the army and the Commandant of the Bangladesh Infantry Regimental Centre. Ministers, advisers to the prime minister, parliament members, the chiefs of navy and air force, former army chiefs, foreign diplomats and high civil and military officials were present on the occasion."

      "text": "The minister made the statement at the roundtable meeting Agriculture Minister Dr Abdur Razzaque says a joint task force has to be set up to ensure safe food for all. \"We need to form a task force comprised of ministries, law enforcement agencies, and stakeholders so that this taskforce can work properly to ensure food safety for people,\" he said. The minister made the statement at the roundtable meeting, \"Safe food and agriculture management,\" arranged by Daily Bangladesher Khabar at the National Press Club in Dhaka on Tuesday. \"We cannot change anything rapidly due to bureaucratic problems in our country.  There is lack of skilled manpower and infrastructure for a safe food institute,\" he said. To solve the manpower shortage, new employees have to be recruited and the process of recruiting them is underway, he added.  Saying that the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority needs to be well equipped and that there is a need for labs in all districts to conduct food tests, he continued: \"We need to form a task force along with all ministries and authorities concerned that will work together to ensure food safety.\" The future of the coming generation depends on food safety, he added.  He expressed disappointment, saying the media does not focus on issues of food safety.  Dr Md Fazlul Karim, dean of the agriculture department at the Sher-e-Bangla Agriculture University, said the rule of law must be sustained to ensure food safety. He said: \"We cannot ensure food safety without ensuring rule of law.\" Chairman of Bangladesh Food Safety Authority, Syeda Sarwar Jahan, said food safety is a basic right, and food safety has to be ensured to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). She said: \"Everyone in the food industry has to take responsibility to ensure food safety,\" adding that the government plans to set up \"healthy markets\" across Bangladesh to promote organic agriculture. She continued: \"We have already sat with CEOs of city corporations and theyhave  agreed to help set up healthy markets where farmers can sell their produce. She also urged the mass media to publish reports on healthy markets soelt that people are made aware of such products in the market. Shajahan Ali Badsha, a poultry farm owner, said authorities have to arrange training sessions for farmers so that they are made aware of everything about food safety. Bangladesh Food Safety Authority member Abdul Alim, Member Director of Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council Monirul Islam, former managing director of Directorate General of Health Services, Sha Munir Hossain, and Dr Nurul Islam, director of Agriculture Information Service, and others, spoke at the roundtable meeting. Daily Bangladesher Khabar Editor Azizul Islam Bhuiyan was chaired the discussion."

      "text": "It is alarming given the fact that only 15 percent of the ilish caught in the previous year had eggs in them, officials said After a 22-day fishing embargo, about 90 percent of the ilish available in Khulna and Chandpur markets are full of eggs, triggering fears of poor production in the next season and prompting calls for extending the fishing ban, reports news agency UNB. It is alarming given the fact that only 15 percent of the ilish caught in the previous year had eggs in them, officials said. Eighty-five percent of ilish caught in Khulna this time contain eggs, said Bangladesh Fisheries Development Corporation Manager of Khulna region Md Jahidul Islam. He said the wholesale markets at Boro Rail Station fish jetty in Chandpur, and those along the shore, are packed with ilish with eggs since 90 percent of the catch is pregnant ilish.  The government had imposed a 22-day ban from October 9 to October 30 on catching, selling, storing, and transporting ilish during its peak breeding period. But the mother ilish could not complete releasing the eggs.  Consequently, shoals of mother ilish full of eggs have been caught by fishermen after the ban was lifted. The lack of rainfall delayed the cycle. \"Ilish breeding is related to rainfall,\" said Professor Abdul Wahab, who is leading the ECOFISHBD Project of WorldFish. Bangladesh's southern region did not receive much rain this monsoon. It recorded only 143mm of rainfall in June and 235mm in July. Last year, it was 220mm in June and 367mm in July. Prof Wahab said he was surprised that most of the fish contained eggs. Fish traders in Chandpur said the production will fall if the breeding is not protected. They feared the national fish will face extinction if mother ilish continues to be caught at this rate.  They say the fishing ban during the breeding season should have been extended by 10-12 days.  Chandpur Fisheries Officer Md Asadul Baki claimed the drive to protect mother ilish was successful. \"That is why the fishermen have been able to catch a huge quantity of ilish,\" he said, claiming that 80 percent  of the ilish have released eggs.  Dr Anisur Rahman of the Fisheries Research Institute said they need a few more days to determine the percentage of mother ilish that have released eggs.  In Khulna, ilish weighing 1 kg was selling at Tk 800. The same size of fish is selling at Tk 700 in Chandpur. But the huge supply of the fish is hardly making people happy.  \"Ilish with eggs don't taste good,\" one of the buyers said."

      "text": "Monirul islam says they are also yet to find any evidence to IS's claims of appointing a chief in Bangladesh The police counter-terrorism chief has said Bangladeshis returning to the country after having joined the terror group Islamic State (IS) in the Middle East, will face legal action. Additional Commissioner Monirul Islam, head of Dhaka Metropolitan Police's (DMP) Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit, was speaking at a Dhaka event yesterday. The event was organized by the Crime Reporters Association of Bangladesh (CRAB) and CTTC at the Cirdap auditorium. The CTTC chief was asked about several issues in light of the massive terrorist attack in Sri Lanka on Sunday, including if he had the exact number for Bangladeshis who had joined IS, and what would happen if they came back home. \"Young people began going out to join IS in late 2014,\" Monirul Islam said in response. \"We suspect that some were detained or arrested, some were killed and some of them were identified. But we do not have accurate statistics,\" he said. \"If they want to return home now, they have no alternative but to come via air. So they need passports. But people who left the country in 2014 no longer have valid passports. If anybody wants to return, they will have to apply for a travel pass,\" Monirul explained. \"When we receive an application for a travel pass, it is given a very serious scrutiny,\" he added. \"So, they cannot come in to the country without us knowing.Even if anyone wants to return, they will face legal action,\" the official said. Asked about the possibility of Rohingya refugees getting involved in militancy and extremism, the CTTC chief said that the refugees are a big problem for Bangladesh.  \"Rohingyas have lost their homes, lost family members; they may be involved in extremism in the future,\" he added. All intelligence agencies are keeping the refugees under strong surveillance, he said. Asked if there was any truth to IS's claims of appointing a chief in Bangladesh, the official said police had not found any evidence to support this. \"They may have appointed a Bangladeshi abroad,\" he added. The additional commissioner said that Afghanistan-returnees were the first to bring religious extremism and militancy into Bangladesh. \"Many of them have been arrested. Some have been hanged. Three or four are absconding but all of them have been identified,\" he said. Responding to a question about the spread of militancy in prison, Monirul said this is a global problem.  \"Many people become radicalized in prisons across the world. Bangladesh is at particular risk because incarcerations become lengthy due to slow trial,\" he said. He said two anti-terrorism tribunals have been established to speed up the trial of militants. CRAB President Abul Khayer, General Secretary Dipu Sarwar, DMP's Deputy Commissioner (Media) Masudur Rahman and senior officials of CTTC were present at the event. Public attention turned to the Bangladeshi Islamic State fighters from Syria and Iraq for the first time when they issued video messages hailing the Gulshan terrorist attack of 2016. At least 50 young men and a few women and children were reported missing after that."

Joint leadership has made the party stronger and organized than ever. There's no rift among us,\" he said at a press briefing at the party president's Banani office yesterday. GM Quader also said that JaPa is prepared to extend their help for flood victims across the country. \"JaPa will always follow Ershad's footprints in terms of helping people. As his successor, JaPa is prepared to stand by flood affected people,\" GM Quader said. \"Through our work, we will keep Ershad's principle alive which is to serve the country people selflessly,\" he added. JaPa's Secretary General Mashiur Rahman Ranga said at present, a massive area of Bangladesh is under water and the party is ready to extend their help to government's relief activities. Earlier, political analysts and researchers expressed their doubts whether JaPa, that has no definite ideology, organizational strength and most importantly lost the person who kept their politics alive, would sustain as a political party in the future.  They might get extinct like the party established by Maulana Bhasani or AK Fazlul Huq, as those were abolished after their death. They said, to be alive in Bangladesh politics, a party needs an authoritarian leadership and it may be the major lacking for the party in the future. Besides, the party has internal \"lack of democracy.\" The press conference was held following a joint meeting of the party's Central Executive Committee. However, party's Senior Co-Chairman Raushon Ershad and the presidium members, known to be as her followers, skipped the meeting."

      "text": "Countrywide indefinite strike was enforced to press home their 11-point demand The nationwide strike of water transport workers have been postponed over all kinds of water transport - to ease the people's sufferings on the waterways. This decision came right after a meeting between the representatives of Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation (BWTWF), and director general (DG) of Department of Shipping on Wednesday night. Authorities concerned assured the water transport workers that all of their 11-point-demands will be met by August 30. Confirming the matter to Dhaka Tribune BWTWF Secretary General Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam said: \"Considering various factors such as the nationwide flood situation, upcoming Eid-ul-Azha, absence of the State Minister of Labour and Employment Monnujan Sufian, we have decided to postpone our strike.  \"The decision came up based on the assurance to solve all our problems within August 30. All types of water transports can now operate freely.\" Earlier in the morning, water transport workers went on a countrywide indefinite strike to press home their 11-point demand. Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation enforced the strike at Sadarghat in Dhaka on Tuesday midnight with various demands, including increasing salary, providing appointment letter and identity card, and issuing landing pass for India bound workers. Sadarghat police station Officer-in-Charge Md Rezaul Karim Bhuiyan told Dhaka Tribune that launch services of all routes were suspended. \"For the last few days, they [workers] were also putting up posters at Sadarghat launch terminal to press home their demands,\" he said. Passengers of Dhaka-Chandpur route, which leaves the terminal during the day, suffered the most due to the strike.  Prakash Dutta said: \"If there is no positive discussion on our problems, the strike will continue.\"   Earlier on April 15, the workers had staged a strike with the same demands. Following the strike, the government, and the launch owners were given an ultimatum to resolve the problem within 45 working days. The ultimatum ended on June 26, without any outcome. State Minister of Labour and Employment Monnujan Sufian held a meeting regarding the issue on July 15. However, no solution was reached."

      "headline": "'Broken dreams' - Bangladesh's returning migrants struggle at home",
      "authors": "Thomson Reuters Foundation",
      "text": "Many are victims of trafficking, but have little redress for the crimes they have suffered in Bangladesh Like many poor Bangladeshis, Komol Shohlagar thought moving overseas for work would change his life. It did - but not in the way he hoped. Shohlagar, 33, travelled to Libya with people smugglers in the hope of reaching Europe, but when he got there, the smugglers held him captive to extort money from his family. He was only freed after they paid $14,000 to get him back - money they had to borrow from loan sharks. When he finally returned to Bangladesh last year, he was jobless and saddled with huge debts - a situation that left him feeling suicidal. \"I was really depressed. My family had borrowed a lot of money to save me,\" Shohlagar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"The lenders came home every other day and threatened us. There were times when I thought about taking a rope and hanging myself.\" Charities in Bangladesh say thousands of returning migrants face such struggles and little official help is available. Many are victims of trafficking, but have little redress for the crimes they have suffered in Bangladesh. The country depends heavily on foreign remittances and has an official policy of encouraging citizens to look for jobs abroad. According to official data, at least 1 million Bangladeshis secured jobs overseas in 2017 - the highest number ever recorded. But the system depends largely on unlicensed brokers working in rural areas and opens the door to trafficking and cheating. Last month, 64 Bangladeshi migrants hoping to get to Europe had to be rescued from a boat off Tunisia. In May, 37 drowned in the same region when their boat capsized. \"The state does not have a proper system to support the returnees,\" said Shariful Hasan, who heads the migration department of Bangladeshi aid group Brac. \"All our policies are focused on sending people abroad. We don't even have a system that can count the total number of returnees every year.\" Abu Bakar Siddique, the civil servant who leads the Home Ministry's anti-trafficking work, acknowledged the government needed to develop a system of support for the returnees. \"For now, what we do is, we ensure that the victims reach their families,\" he said. \"With the kind of capacity that we have, this is what's possible. \"We do work with girls who were trafficked to India. We also have shelters for victims. But as far as counselling is concerned, it's not something that we have not managed to do effectively. We have to develop our system.\" False promise There is no official data on how many migrants are defrauded, but charities say thousands return to Bangladesh every year after being cheated abroad. A 2017 study by the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit, a migrants rights group, found 51% of returning migrants had experienced fraud or degrading treatment while abroad. Nearly one in five of those who paid to be taken abroad did not even make it out of the country, it found. Stories like Shohlagar's are common. The International Organization for Migration (IOM), which helps repatriate migrants, said many were left with little choice but to go abroad again to try to pay off their debts. \"Due to the mounting pressure from the money lenders to pay back the loan, they migrants are unable to stay in their house upon return,\" said Pravina Gurung, the IOM's head of migration and development. \"The result of an inability to achieve economic self-sufficiency, social re-integration and psychosocial suffering often lead them to another unsafe migration attempt, further debt, and even suicide.\" Mohammad Jakir Hossen, 40, worked as a technician in a garment factory before he paid a broker to take him to Italy in search of more lucrative work. Instead he was taken to Libya, where he was made to work by traffickers who took a cut of his salary, holding him there with the false promise that he would eventually make it to Italy. Since he returned to Dhaka he has been running a roadside fruit stall, with little hope of making back the $5,000 he borrowed to pay for the trip. But he said he would do the same again. \"You may think that I am crazy, but if I get a chance to go outside, I will take a loan again,\" Hossen said. \"Five people including my old mother depend upon me right now. And what I earn is clearly not enough.\" Brac, one of the few local organisations that provides support to the returnees, follows a three-fold approach, said Hasan, offering practical help with their return, financial help, and counselling. Kamal Chowdhury, an associate professor at the Department of Clinical Psychology at Dhaka University, has counselled migrant returnees. Some had been raped or sexually harassed and all need help, he said, urging the government to make assessments of returnees mandatory. \"Migrant workers return home with dreams that are broken,\" he said."

Khulna Metropolitan Magistrate Amirul Islam delivered the verdict on Monday afternoon. The court also fined Shahjalal Tk5000, and in default, he will have to serve one month more behind bars. The convict, who was on bail, was escorted to jail soon after the verdict.  Shahjalal's lawyer Nurul Haque said they will file an appeal with the apex court against the verdict.  On July 18, 2017, police arrested Shahjalal in a mugging case and took him to the Khalishpur police station in Khulna city. The convict's mother, Renu Begum, claimed police demanded Tk1.5 lakh from the family to release Shahjalal.  As they refused to do so, police members took Shahjalal out of the police station in their vehicle and tortured him, she said. The next day the family found him lying on a bed of the Khulna Medical College and Hospital with gouged eyes. Quoting Shahjalal, Renu Begum claimed the law enforcement members gouged out both his eyes with a screwdriver. On September 7, 2017, the victim's mother filed a case with a Khulna court against 13 people including 11 police personnel in connection with the incident. The then officer-in-charge of Khalishpur police station, Nasim Khan, was made one of the accused. Renu Begum said police are still threatening her and other family members for filing the case."

The accident occurred on the Ambagan-Tigerpass road under Khulshi police station late on Thursday night. The deceased was identified by his family and police as Emdadul Hasan Shovon, 29, youngest son of late Abul Hossain of Chandpur. He lived with his family in Sardar Bahadur Nagar area at Jhautola. Shovon was an electrical design engineer at NJS Consultants Co Ltd and was working in the Karnaphuli Water Supply Project Phase-2 under Chittagong Wasa. Confirming the matter, Khulshi police station Sub-Inspector (SI) Md Kashem said the tragic accident took place in front of Railway Employee Girls' High School around 11:45pm. \"Shovon fell off when a CNG-run auto-rickshaw rammed his motorcycle. Afterwards, he was run over by a speeding covered van,\" SI Kashem added. Chittagong Medical College Hospital police outpost's Inspector Jahirul Islam said on-duty doctors declared Shovon dead after he was rushed in. Police later impounded both the auto-rickshaw and the covered van. But the drivers of both vehicles managed to flee. Shovon's family members said his namaz-e-janaza was held in front of Jhautola Rail Station Jame Mosjid, near Ambagan, after the Jummah prayers on Friday. He was later buried in the Haji Mosjid graveyard at Dewanhat. Shovon had completed his studies from Saint Xavier's School, Chittagong Collegiate School and College, and Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology."

      "authors": "Syed Samiul Basher Anik",
      "text": "None of the governments in Bangladesh have managed to compile a complete, verified list of Pakistan's collaborators yet Nearly five decades on after Bangladesh gained independence, there is still no specific data on exactly how many Bangladeshis collaborated with the Pakistani occupation forces and committed crimes against humanity during the 1971 Liberation War. During the nine-month war - which began with the Declaration of Independence by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on March 25 and ended with the liberation of Bangladesh on December 16 in 1971 - these collaborators, collectively referred to as \"razakars,\" helped the Pakistanis kill nearly three million people and brutally rape, torture and kill over 200,000 girls and women.  There were several organizations who were the Pakistani occupation forces' partners in crime - Peace Committee, al Badr and al Shams being among the prominent ones.  In the five decades that followed, none of the governments in the country succeeded in preparing a complete, verified list of the razakars - something that the Liberation War researchers, human rights advocates and people involved with the war crimes trial see as a failure.  Shortly after the war, Bangabandhu enacted the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 to try the razakars who assisted the Pakistani army in the killing of Bangladeshis.  Until November 30, 1973, the government arrested 37,471 collaborators under the 1972 order, but a general amnesty was declared for them in 1973. The amnesty, however, was not applicable for those who committed criminal offences like murder, rape and arson.  Later in 1975, the order was repealed and about 11,000 people, who were in custody then, were freed, officials at the Ministry of Liberation Wars Affairs said. Asked, Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Huq said an initiative had been taken to make the list in the 90s, but whatever work had been done went missing after the formation of the cabinet following the eighth general elections in 2001.  Led by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia, the cabinet of the eighth parliament included Jamaat-e-Islami leaders Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujaheed - both with strong allegations of having been active partners of the Pakistani occupational forces.  \"That's when the list disappeared,\" the minister claimed when speaking to the Dhaka Tribune.  Both Nizami and Mujaheed had been convicted during the war crimes trial and sentenced to death penalty.  Jamaat-e-Islami, the Islamist political party that has been banned from taking part in elections in the country, is a known associate of the Pakistani occupational forces in 1971. The minister said the government was currently working on a plan to list all the razakars once the list of freedom fighters is complete. 'Preparing such a list requires political will' Preparing the list of razakar, based on crimes committed nearly five decades ago, requires strong political will and cooperation from the Pakistani government, a top official of the International Crimes Tribunal said. Abdul Hannan Khan, coordinator of the tribunal, said the government has a list of 195 Pakistani prisoners of war (POWs) who reportedly masterminded the barbaric war crimes committed during in 1971. \"But in order to prepare a full list of Pakistan's collaborators, the government needs to take a strong political decision, since identification of those people will require cooperation support from the Pakistani government,\" he added. Also Read- What ICT has achieved in 9 years Bangladesh signed a tripartite pact with India and Pakistan in 1974, following a reconciliation talk between India and Pakistan in 1972. The pact allowed the Pakistani war criminals and many senior commanders to return to their country from Indian jails. The repatriation was facilitated after Islamabad issued a statement in April 1973 assuring Bangladesh of putting the soldiers on trial for their actions during the war. \"Also, the report by Hamoodur Rahman Commission, constituted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1971, inquired on the issue and also recommended that identified Pakistani soldiers be put on trial for their atrocities in the former East Pakistan. Nothing of that sort has happened as yet,\" Hannan told the Dhaka Tribune. If the Pakistani government does not cooperate, the trial of war criminals or their listing will be difficult, he added.  The complexities of the job Prof Mizanur Rahman, former chairman of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), said the government should have put more focus on preparing the list of razakars instead of preparing the list of freedom fighters. \"It is nothing but an utter failure from our part. It was the biggest mistake not take any initiatives in the last 48 years to identify those who committed such violence against our people in 1971. If the initiative had been taken right after the war, preparing the list would have been very easy,\" he added.  \"The list is a must-have, but I doubt it would be possible to prepare it properly now.\" Speaking on the issue, Liberation War Museum trustee Sarwar Ali urged the government to be cautious when preparing the list so there are no legal issues, and the list must reflect historical facts.  \"It is indeed a shame that it took us this long to do this; it is too late. Still, the government can prepare the list based on the gazettes issued in 1971, but there are legal issues too,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. Sarwar pointed out that when someone was made a collaborator of the Pakistani occupation forces - a member of razakars or Peace Committee - a gazette notification was issued against them in 1971.  \"The government must also verify the information to confirm that the people on the gazette lists were indeed the perpetrators,\" he said. Being cautious in preparing the list is of utmost importance, because wrongful accusation may lead to a legal battle, Sarwar further added.   \"The list will have to be concrete, accurate and evidence-based to avoid any complexities,\" he added."

On Monday, almost 40 meters of the embankment, surrounding the city, was damaged by the receding flood water coming from Padma, and Jamuna rivers. Areas under Harisabha, Madhya, and Paschim Sreeramdi are at a huge risk due to the renewed erosion.   Locals said, the receding whirling flood water is at its most dangerous form, and in a sudden strike the erosion devoured a large area, while they were able to transfer six buildings.  They confirmed that already four households were washed away, and there are ten other at risk, including a temple. Abu Raihan, deputy engineer of Chandpur Water Development Board (WDB) said: \"We had no idea that the erosion would hit this area again. The whole embankment is at risk right now. \"We are dumping sand bags to reduce the casualties, and another 3000 bags are ready to be used if necessary,\" he added. Visiting the area, Deputy Commissioner Majedur Rahman Khan, Superintendent of Police Mahabubur Rahman, and WDB Deputy Engineer Abu Raihan promised to take every necessary step possible to save the city. Earlier, two months ago, in another erosion strike of Meghna a 300 meter area of the embankment was washed away."

      "headline": "World Heritage Day: Shariatpur's historic medieval landmark of Manasha Bari in ruins",
      "authors": "Kazi Nazrul Islam, Shariatpur",
      "text": "If the historic site is renovated and preserved then it can become a tourist spot Due to lack of renovation and preservation, the historical and archaeological landmark of Mayurbhatta's Dhanuka Manasha Bari, in Shariatpur, has almost been lost to the mists of time. On World Heritage day today, we found that although the owner lost possession of most relics of the house, Shyamapad Chakrabarty -- the last man of his family line -- has preserved around five of the household's buildings. During his recent visit to Shariatpur, the education minister instructed the local administration to preserve the almost-500-year-old historical structure. According to archeologist Dr AKM Shahnawaz, if the government provides incentives, then Manasha Bari can become a historical tourist spot for visitors. Dhanuka village is situated in the region just behind the Shariatpur police superintendent's office; and the Dhanuka Manasha Bari is located just inside the town. This ancient structure has two significant legends attached to it. Myths surrounding the landmark The first myth says that Mayurbhatta's parents -- the Bhattacharya family -- was on a pilgrimage to Kashidham, when Mayurbhatta's mother gave birth to him inside a forest. The Brahmin family believed that religion was their priority, rather than their newborn child. Thus, the family set off for their journey once again, leaving the infant in the forest, covered with a \"shal pata,\" or sal leaf. Once their pilgrimage concluded, a deity came to Bhattacharya, in his dreams, saying that their prayers would not be accepted as they were wrong to leave their child unprotected. Realizing their mistake, the couple returned to the forest and found a peacock covering their son with its feathers. Hence, Mayurbhatta was named after the \"mayur,\" or peacock, that sheltered him; and the area later became the house of the ancient Sanskrit scholar and poet. The second legend tells the story of a teenager who had a habit of collecting flowers from the garden at dawn. One day, the teenager found a massive serpent in the garden and returned home frightened. When he went to the garden the next day, he faced the snake again, but this time it follows the teen to his house. The snake slithered around the boys in a dance in the presence of terrified onlookers. Later at night, the Manasha goddess came to the dreams of the household members, and instructed them to worship the goddess -- thus establishing the Manasha temple in the house. Since then, Mayurbhatta's house has been known as Manasha Bari. The shrines of goddesses and educational institutes A large pond is situated on the entrance of the landmark. The borders to the main house began from the west bank of the pond. At present, there are a total of five structures still standing, the: Kali Mandir -- mandir is a temple--, Durga Mandir, Manasha Mandir, a Nahabat Khana, and a Sanskrit school. Near the west border of the house, facing east, is a monument with a bungalow style two-way sloping roof, which was once used as the Manasha Mandir. Manshabari dining room Dhaka Tribune Another bigger edifice is situated on the northern border, facing south, which also has a two-way sloping roof. This monument has been marked as Durga Mandir. There is another two-storey building facing the temple--that is mostly in ruins--known as the Nahabat Khana. There is a two-storey temple for the Goddess Kali, adjacent to the west side of the manor's courtyard. A lot of the second floor and parts of the first floor of the temple have collapsed.  Another two-storey building, that has survived, on the southwest area, used to house a Sanskrit  school. Next to this school was the residence of Acharya family, however there is no way to excavate it at present. The history behind the Manasha Bari  According to historic descriptions, the descendants of Mayurbhatta came to reside in the Manasha Bari from Kannauj to present-day Dhanuka of Shariatpur. Lakshman Mishra has been shown as the descendant of Mayurbhatta in their family tree. After Shyamol Sen -- second son of the King of Sen Dynasty -- conquered Kotalipara, he brought a Brahmin named Yashdhar Mishra with him. Meanwhile, a sorceress died in Bikrampur, befalling an inauspicious haze over the kingdom. The king decided to call his priest to sacrifice all other sorceresses, when Yashdhar pointed out the fault in the idea. The king then asked Yashdhar to carry out the sacrifice; when he concluded it successfully, Yashdhar was rewarded heartily by the king. He started to live on the land rewarded to him by the king, and the king brought more Brahmins from Kannauj so that Yashdhar felt at ease living there. Lakshman Mishra is a successor of these Brahmins, but he left Bikrampur because of river erosion -- and moved to Dhanuka. Meanwhile, it is believed that Mayurbhatta and Lakshman Mishra, together, built the structures of Manasha Bari at the end of the 15th century. Architectural and cultural significance There are no inscriptions that elucidate the construction period of these buildings. Nonetheless, seeing the construction style, it is believed that they were either built at the end of the Sultanate period or the early Mughal period.  The construction style is such that there are several doors arched to enter the room from the rear of the building. These medieval monuments were built with limestone and bricks. There are also traces of Islamic architecture in the construction style of these structures. The institution and the temple were built in late 16th or early 17th century. According to the locals, the Sanskrit school building has underground cells, but it is impossible to prove its authenticity without an archaeological excavation. An excavation project was initiated by the authorities and later abandoned. However, after a bit of digging, evidence of a brick-lining was found deep inside the ground. The facade of the building is greatly damaged and the inner chamber walls have smooth plaster. There is no decoration on the wall, but there are light and simple notched designs on the walls. There are also arched alcoves every two-or-three feet on the wall. The architectural excellence of Manasha Bari proved there is a rich past and culture in this region. With the existence of the educational institution in Manasha Bari, it appears that during the contemporary period, a cultural circle has been formed in this region.  Mayurbhatta's daughter--poet Jayanti Devi, or Vaijayanti--was a Sanskrit poet Manasha Bari. She received Sanskrit education from her father, Mayurbhatta, and achieved special knowledge in scripture about conciliation. Vaijayanti husband was born into the famous Pandit family of Kotalipara in Faridpur. Her husband, Krishnanath Sarvabhouma, was also a Sanskrit poet. Temples of Manasha Bari have some significant other features of the ancient era. There are 11 ornamental tiles under the roof of the Manasha temple, and there is a big lotus in-between each tile. The flower and sapling designs on a flower vase--situated on a pillar near the main entrance of the Durga temple, and under its rooftop panel--are simply remarkable. Colored tiles were used on the walls of the eastern side of this temple. The use of these motifs were commonplace during the Mughal era. Mayurbhatta's last successor, Shyamapad Chakrabarty, said: \"Manasha Bari was established on a property of almost seven acres. Some influential people have occasionally pressured me to knock down these buildings. He said he has preserved these medieval institutions even in the face of immense pressure. Govinda Chandra Chakrabarty, son of Shyamapad Chakrabarty, said many journalists, tourists and researchers have come to receive information about the tradition of this house. However, no-one has taken any action to protect this ancient heritage. If this asset is preserved, this Dhanuka Manasha Bari can be established as one of the key tourist centers of Shariatpur. Shariatpur Deputy Commissioner Kazi Abu Taher said: \"We have sent a letter regarding the renovation and maintenance of Manasha Bari to the Department of Archeology. \"On March 15, the education minister and state minister of water resources visited the Manasha Bari. Then, both ministers instructed us to write letters again and assured us of the financial allocation in this regard.\" Former chairman of Archaeology Department in Jahangirnagar University, Dr Shahnawaz said: \"An analysis of these structures showed that these buildings were constructed in late 16th and early 17th century.  \"I have repeatedly requested the government's Archaeology Department to include the Manasha Bari of Shariatpur on their list. It is possible to build a tourism area here if the Cultural Affairs Ministry takes responsibility for the renovation and preservation of Manasha Bari.\" "

      "authors": "Mizanur Rahman",
      "text": "Various NGOs have decried several sections of the draft as 'restrictive and unconstitutional' Non-governmental organizations, and civil society members have expressed grave concern over the draft of the Volunteer Social Welfare Organizations (Registration and Control) Act 2019.  Various NGOs have decried several sections of the draft as \"restrictive and unconstitutional\". According to the NGO Affairs Bureau, between March and June 2019, the government canceled the registration of 197 NGOs. There are 2,470 NGO's registered with the NGO Affairs Bureau for their foreign funding. Another 2,217 are registered as domestic NGOs, and 253 are foreign organizations. What does the draft say? Section 4 of the draft proposes that all NGOs will have to register with the Ministry of Social Welfare, but with the caveat that all NGOs with foreign funding will have to additionally register with the NGO Affairs Bureau. No NGOs will be allowed to set up or continue their operations without government permits. Section 10 introduces the most restrictive part of the law - all NGOs will be able to work in only one district, when they first register. After registration, NGOs can expand their scope of work, but only to five districts at a time. Section 11, sub-sections 1 and 2 stipulates that this law takes precedence over other existing laws regarding registration, and all NGOs have to register, and renew their registrations every five years. Failure to renew registration or rejection by the authority will result in the dissolution of the NGO. Section 14 requires NGOs to have an account with a state owned bank, and conduct all financial transactions via state owned banks. It requires the NGOs to submit their annual work plans, audit reports, activity reports, etc. It also requires NGOS to submit tri-monthly bank statements to the local social welfare office, and registration authorities. Section 16 says, the government can expel the executive committee of an NGO, and replace them with a five-member government appointed committee. Section 17 has the provision for dissolving an NGO, if the government authorities have reason to believe they are not in the best interest of the public, or have broken the law. Sub-section 2 says, the government can dissolve the NGO from the date an order is issued. Sub-section 3 says, an NGO will be declared dissolved from the day its registration is revoked. If an NGO wants to shut down its operations, Section 18 says it must meet a series of requirements. At least three-fourths of the members of the NGO will have to vote for its dissolution at a general meeting. Only then, they can appeal to the registration authorities to shut the NGO down. The authorities will scrutinize the request, and pass it to the director general with their recommendations. If the director general deems fit, a gazette will be issued to proclaim the dissolution of the NGO. After the gazette notification, there will be a three-month period to clear all dues, and if there are no complaints at the end of the period, the NGO will be declared closed. Section 21 lists the provisions for punitive measures, which clearly state that the government can fine an NGO Tk50,000, or issue a year-long prison sentence, or both, if any NGO member is found to be in breach of existing laws, or provide any misinformation in any public statements.  Sub-section 3 stipulates that no legal action can be pursued against authorities or individuals who have enforced the punitive action against the NGO. Sub-section 4 plainly states that no criminal or civil cases can be filed against the government or any government officers if their actions in good faith harm the NGO in any way. However, there is a clause to file a case with the court if there is any grievance with the NGO's financials. Opportunity for misuse On May 26, watchdog Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) expressed deep concern over the proposed law. In a press statement TIB Executive Director Dr Iftekharuzzaman said, the proposed law will create serious obstacles in NGO activities, cautioning that it will create too many chances for misuse.  He expressed his frustration with the provision that requires NGOs with foreign funding to register with two different government offices, emphasizing the risk of the boggy nature of the government bureaucracy to significantly curtail NGO operations. The statement demanded that the government change, modify, and cancel the sections which are unclear, repressive, and conflicting, and calling for a swift amendment to the draft. NGOs perturbed Khushi Kabir, coordinator of Nijera Kori, expressing her disappointment, said: \"When we expressed our anxiety with the draft, the concerned government authority said we (NGOs) will be consulted before the draft is sent to the cabinet, but that did not happen. \"NGOs are not working against the government, they are working for development. But if the government imposes any laws to impede our work, we would like to further discuss, and try to change the law.\"  TIB Chairperson Sultana Kamal said that various sections of the law will terribly diminish NGO activities which are highly-acclaimed, and served to develop the economy, society building, reducing poverty, empowering women, and implementing the SDG. She warned that it will discourage NGO activities not only because of the restrictions, but the nature of the law, which appears to reflect the government's attitude towards citizen rights organizations. Sultana Kamal decried the draft as \"unconstitutional and unacceptable.\"  She recommended the government to sit with stakeholders, and consider their opinion before drafting a law of this magnitude.  Government feedback AJM Ershad Ahsan Habib, deputy secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare said: \"We sent the draft to the cabinet with all the opinions we received. Any changes, replacements, or additions to the law can be made before vetting. The cabinet might even take into consideration the objections or statements by various NGOs.\""

      "text": "New FM's foreign tour to begin with India Bangladesh and India will hold the next round of foreign minister-level bilateral talks in the first week of February, aiming to take the relations between the two countries to newer heights. The meeting - 5th Joint Consultative Commission (JCC) - will be held in New Delhi, paving the way for new Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen to make his maiden foreign tour to India after formation of the new government, reports UNB. A preparatory inter-ministerial meeting is scheduled to be held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday to finalize  5th JCC agenda. Foreign Secretary M Shahidul Haque will preside over the meeting. The representatives of relevant ministries, divisions, and agencies will attend the meeting. The 4th Joint Consultative Commission between Bangladesh and India, led by former Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali and Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj respectively, was held in October 2017. The 5th JCC meeting, once the date is set, will review progress made in areas such as trade and investment, security, connectivity, border management, power, energy, shipping, and people-to-people exchanges, said a diplomatic source. The two countries will also discuss common challenges and find ways on how the two friendly countries, along with other like-minded nations can continue fighting the scourge of terrorism, extremism, and radicalisation, the source indicates. The Rohingya issue might come up for discussions as well during the meeting. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Momen on Monday said he will make his maiden visit as the Foreign Minister to New Delhi as India has invited him. \"India is our neighbour and friendly country and we have a warm relationship\" he said, without giving any date and purpose of his India trip. Earlier, acting High Commissioner of India to Bangladesh, Dr Adarsh Swaika, met the new Foreign Minister of Bangladesh and handed over a letter of congratulations from the External Affairs Minister of India, Sushma Swaraj. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the first among global leaders to congratulate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after her party, Awami League's absolute victory in the December 30 elections. Prime Minister Modi expressed confidence that the partnership between Bangladesh and India will continue to flourish under her \"farsighted\" leadership. He also reiterated the priority India attaches to Bangladesh as a neighbour, a close partner for regional development, security and cooperation, and a central pillar in India's ''Neighbourhood First\" policy."

      "text": "Bahamians struggle in Dorian's devastating wake  Stunned residents of the Bahamas surveyed the wreckage of their homes and officials struggled to assess the number killed by Hurricane Dorian, as the storm bore down on the South Carolina coast, threatening record flooding on Thursday. The United Nations said 70,000 people in the Bahamas needed immediate humanitarian relief after the most damaging storm ever to hit the island nation. Aerial video of the worst-hit Abaco Islands in the northern Bahamas showed widespread devastation, with the harbor, shops, workplaces, a hospital and airport landing strips damaged or decimated, frustrating rescue efforts. One of the most powerful Caribbean storms on record, Dorian was rated a Category 5 hurricane when it killed at least 20 people in the Bahamas. Authorities expect that number to rise, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a news briefing, as retreating floodwaters revealed the scope of destruction. \"My island of Abaco, everything is gone. No banks, no stores, no nothing,\" said Marsh Harbour resident, Ramond A King as he surveyed the wreckage of his home, which had its roof ripped off and debris scattered throughout. \"Everything is gone, just bodies.\" With telephones down in many areas, residents posted lists of missing loved ones on social media. One Facebook post by media outlet Our News Bahamas had 2,500 comments, mainly listing lost family members. Dorian killed one person in Puerto Rico before hovering over the Bahamas for two days with torrential rains and fierce winds that whipped up 12- to 18-foot (3.7- to 5.5-metre) storm surges. Possible record surge South Carolina was preparing for a record storm surge, potentially reaching a height of eight feet (two metres) at the popular vacation destination of Myrtle Beach, the US National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. The storm was located about 115km south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, at 8am EST (1200 GMT) on Thursday and was headed north-northeast at about 13kph, the NHC said. It was packing 185kph winds. About a foot (30cm) of rain will drop on flood-prone Charleston and many parts of the coasts of the Carolinas on Thursday and Friday, said Bob Oravec, a forecaster with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. \"It's pretty substantial,\" he said early on Thursday. \"It's already raining heavy in Charleston and up and down the coast.\" More than 185,000 homes and businesses were without power along the South Carolina and Georgia coastal areas, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. The streets of downtown Charleston were all but deserted early Thursday as driving rain and strong winds lashed the city. On South Battery Street, a block away from the water, Brys Stephens and his family worked hard to keep the water away from a large gray home with white verandas along the front, the type of home that has made Charleston famous and is a major tourist draw. He was working to reattach metal flood gates to a sturdy high wall fronting the property. \"The gates worked pretty well so far and we've managed to keep water away from the house,\" Stephens said. \"But we've got another storm surge coming later on, so we'll see then if it holds.\" The NHC's storm surge warning covered parts of the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina stretching from the Savannah River and extending to southern Virginia. More than 2.2 million people in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina have been ordered to evacuate, although Florida has avoided a direct hit. Relief efforts An international relief effort was underway for the Bahamas, with a British Royal Navy vessel providing assistance and Jamaica sending a 150-member military contingent to help secure Abaco and Grand Bahama, officials said. Volunteers also ferried supplies to the islands in a flotilla of small boats. \"Let us give of our best in this moment of historic tragedy,\" Minnis said. He also encouraged international tourists to visit the Bahamas, which relies heavily on its hospitality industry. As many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. Norwegian energy company Equinor said it had discovered a spill on the ground outside tanks at its damaged storage terminal in the Bahamas, but was unclear on volumes and had not seen any oil at sea. The State Department said it did not believe any U.S. citizens who were in the Bahamas during the storm were killed. President Donald Trump said the United States was sending supplies, including materials originally intended for any Dorian victims in Florida."

      "text": "Members of all Chhatra League units have been instructed to assist farmers with their harvest Bangladesh Chhatra League members will volunteer to help farmers, nationwide, harvest paddy, according to press release signed by ruling party student wing President Rezwanul Haque Chowdhury Shovon, and General Secretary Golam Rabbani. The press release, issued on Wednesday, instructs members of all Chhatra League units, nationwide, to help farmers with their harvest. These directives came amid protests by farmers--in villages, towns, districts, and Dhaka--as the farmers are facing great losses due to the very low price of paddy. Some farmers set fire to their harvests as they could not afford day laborers to  cut the paddy  -as this year's paddy price is the lowest of the last three years. Over the past three weeks, a bountiful harvest has been overshadowed by the grief of rice farmers throughout Bangladesh. Farmers are demanding purchases be made directly from farms, and that crops be sold at a fair price. Currently, paddy is sold wholesale at Tk450 to Tk500 for every maund (1 maund=40kg). Many farmers have said the cost of harvesting each maund of paddy is between Tk1,000 to Tk1,500. Other reports say that farmers will suffer a loss of at least Tk300 per maund if they sell paddy at the current market price."

      "text": "Disasters are a threat to human rights In September 2019, a UN panel of scientists associated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a report on the future impact of climate change and rising temperatures. It signaled a red alert pertaining to devastating effects that would arise from ice melting in our seas and frozen regions.  The oceans have soaked up more than 90% of the extra heat generated by humans over the past decades.  This rising water level is now being driven principally by the melting of Greenland and Antarctica.  It has also been observed that glaciers are also melting at a fast pace in areas like the tropical Andes, Central Europe, and North Asia.  These regions will lose 80% of their ice by 2100 under the high carbon emissions scenario. The global average sea levels could increase by up to 1.1m by 2100. Coastal flooding will hit nearly 42 million people in Bangladesh by 2050.  Researchers have found that nearly 300 million people across the world will be vulnerable by 2050 to flooding made worse by climate change.  By 2050, low-lying areas in some South and Southeast Asian cities not far from the coast (without proper embankments) are likely to face inundation during high tide as part of the flood zone.  Bangladeshi climate experts have denoted that 100km away from the coastal zones, the districts of Pirojpur and Shariatpur might be badly affected as there are no embankments there. These debacles that are staring us in the face have raised several questions as to how the concerned countries are expected to respond to the evolving disastrous situation, and how basic human rights of the affected people need to be safeguarded while tackling and managing this growing emergency. This aspect is receiving attention because environmental sustainability and the promotion of human rights are closely intertwined and complementary objectives that are at the core of sustainable development. Efforts to promote environmental sustainability can only be effective if they occur in the context of conductive legal frameworks, and by the exercise of certain human rights, such as the rights to information, public participation in decision-making, and access to justice. It needs to be understood that the implementation of any agenda to tackle the impending climate change disaster will require relevant actors to adopt policies and mobilize resources to advance equitable, human-rights-based, and sustainable development.  Human rights mechanisms will have to address issues within the right to a healthy environment directly and also focus on the environmental dimensions of more established rights, through emerging rights, such as the right to water and development.  A number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) recognize the link between the environment and human health, and many MEAs also include provisions regarding civil liability and compensation for damage caused by environmental degradation. Human rights tribunals in the context of environmental law have also dealt with the protection of collective intellectual property rights, through principles of benefit sharing, ie in the context of genetic resources.  In addition, the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on certain groups could amount to a violation of rights to freedom from discrimination. This potential is referred primarily in the context of discrimination against indigenous peoples or racial minorities. There is also the question of environmental degradation playing a decisive role in many conflict situations. Such degradation can contribute to the outbreak of a conflict and result in the infringement of fundamental human rights, such as the right to life and health.  These infringements would include damages to the life and properties of victims of conflict, disruption of normal living conditions, and loss of access to basic services. Conflicts can also fuel environmental degradation by weakening governance structures, undermining positive environmental practices, and promoting uncontrolled systems of resource exploitation.  Thus it is crucial that conflict management is taken into account from the outset, along with humanitarian, economic, and social needs.  Neglect in the establishment of strong governance systems that factor in the environmental rule of law can consequently jeopardize the peace process and the well-being of the population and environment. Ensuring a human rights framework also denotes the importance of accountability mechanisms in the implementation of measures and policies in the area of climate change that requires access to administrative and judicial remedies. Such an approach can then serve to bring greater clarity about the underlying causes of positive or negative impacts of various economic measures related to environmental protection.  It will also allow for better choices among policies and projects. This can then improve outcomes by facilitating positive synergies, and generally improving the governance of natural resources.  It will also facilitate and increase the legitimacy of activities, programs, and policies by integrating social concerns with environmental goals and responsibilities of all actors.  This will ensure the accountability of governments, the private sector, and environmental or human rights organizations with regard to the impact of their activities on the environment.

      "text": "The huge quantity of fertilizer, worth around Tk57 crore, was imported from abroad to meet the demands of farmers from the 19 northern districts of the country when Jamuna Fertilizer Company Ltd (JFCL) came to a halt after a fire incident on November 11, 2018 For almost a year, around 28,000 tons of imported urea fertilizers have been wasting away due to being stored in the open in front of the Jamuna Fertilizer Company Ltd (JFCL) at Tarakandi in Jamalpur's Sarishabari upazila. The huge quantity of fertilizer, worth around Tk57 crore, was imported from abroad to meet the demands of farmers from the 19 northern districts of the country when Jamuna Fertilizer Company Ltd (JFCL) came to a halt after a fire incident on November 11, 2018. According to JFCL, since the fire the factory was unable to resume despite repeated attempts, during which over 350,000 tons of urea fertilizer were imported through a government initiative. Among which, 40,810 tons are still reserved at the factory. But the factory owns only two warehouses with a storage capacity of 12,000 tons, therefore almost 28,810 tons are stored in front of the administrative building. However, while visiting the area it was found that the rest of the fertilizers are barely covered with sheets of tarpaulins, and lying under the open sky beside the factory. In the process, the fertilizer, which is otherwise in granular form, absorbs moisture, and turns rocky or melts into liquid in the seasonal heatwave, rain and cold, said local farmers. Workers of the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) said the damage being done to the urea fertilizers which are not being maintained properly, due to lack of warehouse spaces, is going to cause not only the farmers but the government a huge financial loss. Sarker Abul Hossain, Osman Gani along with other BCIC dealers, said, the stored fertilizer loses its effectiveness, becomes coagulated, and then becomes hard to sell, and use.  Aligning with the dealers, Jamalpur Truck and Tank Lorry Owner's Association's Tarakandi union's President Ashraful Alam Manik said: \"The imported fertilizers have declined so much in quality that the sacks leak while loading in them in the truck. Dealers often refuse to store them in their warehouses.\" Farmers from different areas of the district, Hurmuz Ali of Sarishabari, Abdul Karim Mandal of Saatpoa, Belayet Mia, Rafet Mandalo of Charpalisha said, the northern part of Bangladesh has recently suffered a severe flood, and most of the croplands went underwater causing huge loss to the farmers. So, the Jamalpur farmers were planning to make up their losses by harvesting on a large scale. However, the deteriorated fertilizers are shattering their hopes. Frustrated over the maintenance failure of the authority, farmer Belayet Miya said: \"If the farmers do not get enough quality fertilizers for the upcoming Irri-Borro harvest season, the net harvest would be affected.\" \"The authority must import more fertilizers or resume the JFCL, otherwise farmers of the 19 districts would face huge loss due to shortage of fertilizers,\" he added. Regarding the inefficient maintenance of the fertilizers, JFCL's Manager (Commercial) Wahedur Rahman said: \"The fertilizers were stored in front of the factory for the lack of storage capacity in our warehouses. Though it is possible that some of the sacks can get damaged but it would not affect their overall quality by any means. \"Enough fertilizers are stored for the upcoming harvesting season. We would ensure proper supply to field level farmers. And hopefully, they would not face any shortage,\" he added."

Prime suspect Hasina Begum, wife of victim Abu Taher, confessed to police that she along with her next-door neighbor Mainuddin first killed her four-year-old daughter Bibi Fatema, and then her husband on Saturday morning. Additional Commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP) Amena Begum disclosed the matter at a press briefing at Dampara Police Lines in the port city on Sunday. Hasina also confessed that she had an extra-marital affair with Mainuddin for a long time, said the police official. Previously on Saturday, police recovered the throat-slit bodies of Abu Taher, 35, a day labourer, and his daughter Bibi Fatema from their house in Nimtoli area of the city. Police also recovered a bloodstained knife from the spot.  Hasina killed her daughter Fatema after the little girl discovered her mother's illicit affair with Mainuddin in the morning, Additional Commissioner Amena Begum said. \"When Fatema threatened her mother that she would reveal the matter to her father, Mainuddin held the girl tightly, and Hasina slit her throat. After sometime, Taher entered the house, and they strangled him first, and then slit his throat,\" Amena said.  Immediately after the murders, Mainuddin went into hiding, and was arrested from Noakhali early on Saturday. Nur Alam, elder brother of Abu Taher lodged a case with Bandar police station against Hasina Begum, and Mainuddin."

      "text": "Anyone can be jailed for up to 14 years for for violating the law that was passed in September last year It has been a year now since the Digital Security Bill, 2018, was passed in the parliament on September 19, 2018, amid much criticism from journalists, and human rights activists.  Within the first year of its enactment, four cases were recorded under the Digital Security Act (DSA) in Khulna, where two journalists were sued.  Md Hedait Hossain Molla, local correspondent of Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune, was sued, and arrested on January 1, for publishing \"false\" information on the number of votes cast in a constituency in the aftermath of the general election.  Rashidul Islam, staff reporter of the daily Manab Zamin was also accused in the same case. According to the initial announcement of the election results, the number of votes cast in Khulna 1 was higher than the total number of voters in the constituency. As the matter was brought to the returning officer's attention, he said it was a mistake, and later came up with a correction. By the time the correction could be made, the two media outlets ran reports saying the number of votes cast was around 22,000 higher than the actual number of voters. Even though Hedayet was released on permanent bail two days later, the police have yet to submit the case investigation report in court, despite the passage of eight months. Yet, it is clearly mentioned in the law that, for cases filed under the act, the investigation reports must be submitted within 120 days. Later on August 22, publisher and editor of 'Prothom Shomoy', an online media portal, Shahin Rahman was arrested for allegedly spreading defamatory information on social media.  Khulna Press Club President SM Habib started a case against him under sections 29 and 31 of the Digital Security Act on August 9. Two more cases under the same act was filed against him by August 28. The law authorises prison sentences for up to 14 years for anyone who secretly records government officials, or gathers information from a government agency using a computer or other digital device. Mominul Islam, district convener of Bangladesh Society for the Enforcement of Human Rights (BSEHR), said: \"Each law poses some variations of pros and cons. However, in the first year of enactment of the Digital Security Act, it has mostly been abused, and journalists were victimized. This new law puts restraints on the media's freedom of expression. I think several sections of the act need to be revised again.\" Kudrot E Khoda, district general secretary of Shushashoner Jonno Nagorik (Shujan), said: \"The Digital Security Act was enacted after scrapping the ICT act. The law looks good on paper, but it is important to monitor if it is implemented objectively. The misuse of this law is preventing journalists in the district to practice their right to freedom of expression.\""

      "text": "They allegedly were being used to make fake profiles and spread false propaganda Over 20 days, 1,500 Facebook accounts were shut because they spread: fanaticism, hateful comments, perverted photos and provocative statements; Technocrat Minister of Post, Telecommunication and Information Technology Ministry, Mustafa Jabbar, has said. Affiliated sources have confirmed that numerous fake Facebook IDs had been opened using the names of prominent personalities, politicians, and other renowned people. Based on this information, a request was sent to the Facebook authority to shut the fake personal IDs, pages, and groups, by using certain focal points in the country.  Mustafa Jabbar said: \"We were able to shut down 1,500 Facebook IDs recently. They were being used to spread false propaganda; several of them were owned by militants.\" The removed Facebook IDs are not related to pornography, Jabbar further said. \"These rumours circulated as we are closing down porn sites as well. However, the rumours are false.\" Bangladesh has a better relationship with Facebook than before, the technocrat minister said. \"If we ask for something, Facebook's authorities listen to us. They evaluate the requests with their community standards and try to respond to our requests as fast as possible. I believe it is a great achievement.\" He added: \"More accounts will be blocked in the future. We have already identified them, and our team is working diligently to monitor their activities.\" The Department of Telecom (Dot), under the Posts and Telecommunications Division, is working to monitor the cyber world. A cybersecurity monitoring project has been introduced under Dot, and half of the project has already been realized. Affiliated sources have said the ever since the cybersecurity monitoring project began being implemented, it has become easier to monitor social media sites. The government has IT monitoring cells to gather data on the cyber world as well. Other than that, due to better monitoring--by law enforcement agencies, BTRC, National Telecom Monitoring Cells, and other affiliated organizations--it has become easier to identify IDs, the sources said.

      "text": "Migration continues to be a serious issue for climate-vulnerable Bangladesh There are over 258 million migrants around the world living outside their country of birth. This figure is expected to grow for a number of reasons, including population growth, increasing connectivity, trade, rising inequality, demographic imbalances, and climate change. Globally, over 68.5 million people are forcibly displaced among which 25.4 million are refugees. To address the growing number of migrants and refugees in a way that upholds the principles of human rights, in 2018, the global leaders adopted two major reports to address issues related to refugees and migration. These are called the Global Compact on Refugees and Global Compact for Migration. Bangladesh is signatory to both the agreements will be addressing the agreements taking series of actions nationally and globally. To better understand the implications of these agreement in Bangladesh, it is important to look at what the compacts are about.  The Refugee Compact The Refugee Compact has four objectives: Ease pressures on host countries; enhance refugee self-reliance; expand access to third country solutions, and support conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity.  The Migration Compact The Migration Compact comprises 23 objectives for better managing migration at local, national, regional and global levels. It expresses states' \"collective commitment to improving cooperation on international migration.\" Both compacts were being questioned by various stakeholders especially with regards to how this will be delivered when there is less clarity about few definitions (such as refugee). It is widely agreed that the compacts will only make a difference to the lives of the refugees and migrants if there is enough political will of the government to live up to their commitments. While we continue demanding for better clarity and implementation of the compacts in line with Agenda 2030, it is important to also recognize that climate change and conflict-related displacement and forced migration are on the rise -- we can start thinking of supporting the proposal of the New NANSEN Passport as one of the response mechanisms. However, this doesn't take away the fact that we need take action to prevent displacement and forced migration to take place.  National response Bangladesh continues to be within the top 10 at-risk countries to climate change impacts and disasters in the world. There are a number of scenarios with linking the temperature raise trajectory, especially how this will displace and force people to migrate. There are a number of efforts made to understand the future scenario including efforts to track what is happening with regards to displacement and migration in recent years:  * Between 1980 and 2008, it experienced 219 natural disasters -- but not enough information about how many people are displaced. Cyclone Sidr alone impacted 9 million people and at least 3 million people were displaced (NRC)  * Between 2008 and 2014 it is estimated that 4.7 million people were displaced due to disasters in Bangladesh (displacement solutions). Some of the major events include Cyclone Aila (as many as two million people lost their home)  * In 2017, the majority of new displacements occurred due to sudden-onset disasters including Tropical Cyclone Mora in May and Monsoon flooding between June and August. A total of 946,000 new displacements due to these disasters. The South Asian flood (2017) impacted 8 million people in Bangladesh   * A recent RMMRU study found Dhaka receives three out of every five (59.2%) migrants from rural areas, with one in five (20.1%) preferring the port city of Chittagong  * RMMRU surveyed 1,431 internal migrant households of 20 districts and found other urban destinations included Gazipur (2.9% of all migrants), Sylhet (1.9%), Khulna (1%), Mymensingh and Narayanganj (0.6% each), and Satkhira (0.4%). The remaining 13.2% of migrants were spread among the other districts and towns of the country Dhaka alone receives about 500,000 people each year The silver lining Bangladesh has the potential to be the biggest mover in the global gross domestic product rankings in 2030. According to the latest report of HSBC Global Research, the country is becoming the 26th largest economy in the world from 42nd now. However, such growth is tied up with the migrant workers' hard earned money and how the entire economy will be impacted by climate change and development-induced displacement and migration.  It is crucial to recognize that the government is the primary duty bearer to address the issue of migrants and refugees while the civil society organizations and movements can support in developing policy instruments to field level implementation. It is absolutely critical, while implementing the commitments, to recognize the differentiated vulnerability and struggle of women and children as migrant and refugees. Therefore, the government must develop a safeguard mechanism for the most vulnerable and marginalized. Furthermore, the government can also consider the following:  * At the policy level in Bangladesh, the government can adopt a \"people's safeguard policy\"   * Establish a national tracking mechanism for displaced and migrated people   * Establish a safety-net mechanism/fund for displaced and forcibly migrated people  For civil society organizations addressing such massive issues is a collective responsibility. Furthermore, CSOs can support the government's position on compensation from polluter countries. As the government is planning to develop 100 economic zones, support developing skills, and of local communities who can be employed within the zone, therefore, reduce displacement and migration.

      "text": "'I was admitted two days ago but I was not given a bed yet. I am not getting proper health care. Doctors are never on time; they come, and go as they please' The Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital was designed and built to accommodate 250 in-patients. But, on any given day there are between 400 to 600 in-patients from all corners of the district, during the current monsoon, and cyclone season. International non-governmental organizations (NGOs) along with the Bangladesh government are working to improve the services of the much important hospital, which is the primary source of health care for nearly 250,000 people in the district. Although the hospital is returning to its former glory in providing standardized services, the grievance of the patients from near, and far has not minimized in proportion.  The patients coming to receive health care are raising various complaints regarding mismanagement, irregularities, corruption, and overall patient-doctor experience. The health care process has improved somewhat, but to no good end. Patients said, they are suffering from a shortage of beds, frequent power outages, and hassle from brokers looking for commissions. The hospital should be able to accommodate 250 patients, but in reality, it does not have the required manpower or resources to even run a 150-bed hospital, said locals.   Patients waiting in a jam-packed line in front of the ticket counter to see the doctor is an everyday scenario. After a daylong wait, some who manage to see the doctor is satisfied, while others are disappointed as they do not get the chance.  According to patients and visitors, the women's ward on the fourth floor is always crowded with patients, making it difficult for doctors to attend to each, and everyone. Due to the shortage of beds some patients share beds, while others are accommodated on the floor, and the corridors. Razia Begum, a patient accommodated on the floor said: \"I was admitted two days ago but I was not given a bed yet. I am not getting proper health care. Doctors are never on time; they come, and go as they please.\"  Another patient, Mehrab Hossain said: \"A hospital is supposed to have the cleanest environment, but this place is making people even sicker. The management should promptly take steps to provide more patient-centric services.\" Hospital Coordinator Md Mohiuddin said: \"International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), an NGO, along with the Health and Planning Ministry yesterday inaugurated the newly improved emergency room with increased staff members, and modern equipment. \"We hope to provide modern, and international standard services from now on.\""

Three were from Char Jabbar, two each from Purba Char Bata and Mohammadpur, and one from Char Jubilee. The police have said the rape cases in the area are almost always filed from these four chars. On August 17, a 14-year-old was gang-raped reportedly by six men on her way to visit her ailing sister in Mohammadpur's Char Alauddin. On August 4, a widowed mother of one was gang-raped allegedly by three men in Mohammadpur over land disputes. On August 2, a man filed a case against another man of raping his wife. The case was later settled out of court. On March 31, a mother of six was reportedly gang-raped and her husband assaulted in Char Jabbar after the upazila elections. According to the case docket, they were attacked by one political faction because they had voted for another. The medical report confirmed that there were \"signs of forcible sexual intercourse\" consistent with rape. Among the 12 accused, eight were named. Several were teenagers as young as 15 years old, aiding their father or uncles with the rape. On March 1, a woman was raped allegedly by a man in her home. Locals detained the rapist, but released him after influential UP members intervened. The woman committed suicide the next day. Also Read- Rape in Subarnachar: Where looms the spectre of sexual violence On January 31, a 13-year-old was gang-raped reportedly by two men when they offered to give her a lift home. On January 1, a couple were attacked in their home after the general elections. The husband was tied up and the wife was gang-raped by 10-15 people. A brief examination of Subarnachar The residents are all settlers, originating from Chittagong's Sandwip, or Bhola, or Lakshmipur's Kabirhat, Hatia or Ramgati. Difficulties in their daily lives, distance from civic facilities, and remote location of the region have fostered a culture of intolerance among the groups for one another. Very few residents are educated. Fishing and farming are the only means of living in the char. But to maintain their living, a majority of the men work in brick kilns in neighbouring districts for eight months every year. Many girls are subject to child marriage as soon as they reach puberty.  In the past, the char was plagued, like many other chars, by bandits. But regular police action and increased coast guard activities have all but rooted out the violent groups who could be used to seize the land. Located at the southeastern edge of Noakhali, the 576 sq-km upazila has 289,000 residents, according to the 2011 national census. With only 500 people per square kilometres, less than half the national average population density of 1,237, the desolate and remote features of the land is only stressed.

      "text": "'Fishes coming in from Swandeep, and Hatia are comparatively cheaper' Ilish prices in Chandpur fish markets are still steep, despite the booming supply of at least around 56,000 kilograms every day. According to the fishermen and traders, Ilish fishes have started coming in from the coastal areas in Hatia, Swandeep, Barisal, Bhola, and Charfashion at the beginning of this month. Jishan, who went to Chandpur from Comilla to buy the fish said, \"We thought that we'd get it at less price, but it's really expensive.\" Dhaka resident Tuhin reiterated that he expected the fish to be cheaper, and added, \"Since it's really expensive, I bought only five kilograms, each kilo for Tk 1,200.\" A worker at the fishing warehouse, Mofiz Uddin said, \"The good quality fish are expensive. Plus prices are always steep.\" Also Read- Ilish production up by nearly 160% in 15 yrs  \"Fishes coming in from Swandeep, and Hatia are comparatively cheaper,\" said Abul Hossain, the warehouse manager. Although, Ilish production has been less in the rivers in Chandpur, the prices of the ones that weigh one kilogram are selling for Tk 1,400 each. According to warehouse workers, Ilish weighing 200-500 grams are selling for Tk 18,000-20,000 per maund. The ones weighing 700-800 grams are selling for Tk 32,000 per maund, and the 1 kg to 1200 grams Ilish costs Tk 45,000-50,000 per maund, and up to Tk 1,200 per kilograms. The prices of per kilo of 1.5 kg Ilish is Tk 2,000. \"Local Ilish from Chandpur isn't really much available. The ones that are available are quite expensive. Even yesterday I sold a two kilogram fish at the rate of Tk 130,000 per maund,\" said warehouse merchant Matin Patwary. He recommended taking time before buying the fish as saltwater Ilish are a bit reddish, while famous Chandpur Ilish, known as 'Rupali Ilish [silver Ilish], is silver-ish in colour. District fisheries officer Asadul Baqi said that in a few days Ilish supplies will increase, and the prices are likely to go down then."

The senior BNP leader made the remarks while distributing relief materials among flood victims in Hatibandha upazila of Lalmonirhat on Saturday afternoon. After distributing reliefs, Fakhrul said: \"Despite having such a crisis of relief materials in flood affected areas, ministers and MPs of this government are busy with looting instead of standing beside the victims.\" On the issue of lynching and child abduction rumours, he said: \"People are being lynched because there is no rule of law prevailing in country. If there was, then a mother would not have been beaten to death in front of her children.\" He also demanded the immediate release of the party's jailed Chairperson Khaleda zia and a re-election saying: \"Even though December 30 was the Election Day, voting was done in the night of December 29.\" The BNP leader also alleged that the government is systematically carrying out persecution against BNP men by pinning them in false cases and throwing them in jail.

      "text": "Abdul Hamid said a large number of engineers, technologists, architects, and planners from Bangladesh travel to developed countries for higher education every year and many of them migrate President Abdul Hamid on Tuesday urged students to play a greater role in development of the country and its people. He made the call at the 11th convocation of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) in Dhaka. Abdul Hamid said a large number of engineers, technologists, architects, and planners from Bangladesh travel to developed countries for higher education every year and many of them migrate. \"As a result, the country is deprived of their talents and services,\" he said, noting that there were congenial work atmosphere and ample professional fields in Bangladesh. He reminded the graduates that their institution is renowned at home and abroad. \"Remember, the university is not just a single entity. The students are its life and the honourable teachers are its soul. So, the students, who were honoured and recognized shouldn't forget the contributions of this university,\" said the president. He urged the graduates not to forget the role of the university and said he firmly believes that they will make a meaningful contribution to the development of this university and the country. The president reminded everyone that Bangladesh is making rapid progress and that it is now a member of the elite club of satellite owners. \"We want to become a developed country by 2041. To achieve this, the government is implementing mega projects like Padma Bridge, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, Rampal, and Matarbari power plant, Payra Deep Sea Port, Dhaka Metro Rail, Elevated Express Highway, and Padma Railway link project,\" he said.  \"The role of engineers in implementing, managing, and maintaining these mega projects is very important. I believe the skilled engineers of Buet will play an important role,\" Hamid said. The president said the government has adopted 'Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100' to tackle climate change induced disaster risks as part of a long-term plan. \"In this master plan, long-term strategies have been fixed for flood, river erosion, river management, water supply and waste management, urban water management and drainage. Engineers will play an important role in implementing these projects in national interest,\" he said. Terming the graduates as the most skilled human resources, the chancellor said the convocation not only recognizes them formally but also bestows responsibility on them.  \"You have to be always ready to carry out that duty. Never forget your motherland ... the general people, to whom you are indebted. Now it's your turn to pay back the country and the nation,\" President Hamid said. Stating that the fresh graduates are a standard for young generation, he said freshers will follow their ideal and get the inspiration to move forward. \"The birth anniversary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 2020 and the golden jubilee of our great independence will be celebrated in 2021. I hope you will make that celebration more colourful, bright, and successful with your invigorating enthusiasm,\" he said. Education Minister Dr Dipu Moni, Buet Vice-Chancellor Saiful Islam, and former finance minister ABA Muhith spoke at the program. A total of 5,284 graduates from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2018, registered for the convocation. Five students received gold medals from the president for outstanding academic performances."

      "text": "At least 3,483 acres of water bodies, low-lying lands filled up over the last nine years Residents of Dhaka are once again facing the threat of severe water logging, as incessant rain has inundated many parts and major roads of the capital.  The Dhaka met office recorded 48mm of rainfall from 12pm-2pm on Friday but the poor state of the capital's drainage system ensured that two hours of rain was enough to flood a considerable part of the city. Mirpur Road, Nayapaltan, Green Road, Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, Motijheel, Rampura, Banani-11, Tejgaon, Karwan Bazar, Monipuri para, Kazipara, Begum Rokeya Sarani, Mohammadpur, and Dhanmondi were among the areas flooded by the rain, with water even entering homes and business establishments in low-lying areas. The situation was even worse in areas such as Malibagh and Rokeya Sharani, where road renovation work and ongoing development projects, like the Metro Rail, pose further obstacles for commuters and residents.  However, the Gulshan area saw little to no water logging, following the revamp of the drainage system during the tenure of late Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) mayor Anisul Huq. 36% of Dhaka's water bodies filled up in 9 years At least 3,483 acres of water bodies and lowlands across the metropolitan area in Dhaka have been filled up in the last nine years, according to a recent study. Presenting the findings of the study at an event on April 25, the Bangladesh Institute of Planners (BIP) General Secretary Adil Mohammad Khan said 36% of the water bodies in Dhaka had been filled up, violating the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) for the capital adopted in 2010. The parts of the city under the jurisdiction of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkah (Rajuk) had 100,937 acres of water bodies and lowlands nine years ago, but 22% of those - 22,156 acres - have been filled up since then, greatly contributing to the perennial water-logging issue, he added. The report was prepared on the basis of satellite images. No immediate relief In Dhaka, the drainage system, water pump, canals, and rivers are maintained by a total seven government agencies:  The Bangladesh Water Development Board (WDB), Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakha (Rajuk), Dhaka District Administration, Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Dhaka Wasa), Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) and Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC).   Each of the organizations works separately to improve the drainage system in different parts of the capital. Dhaka Wasa works on the storm drain system, which handles surface water. Most drains in Dhaka are clogged by solid waste and plastic garbage, due to irregular cleanup and lack of awareness of city dwellers. Dhaka used to have 65 natural canals running throughout the city, but the number currently stands at only 26, as most of them are clogged by garbage and illegal occupiers. Urban planner and BIP General Secretary Adil Mohammad Khan said the city has been planned in a manner that does not consider the connectivity of the water management. \"There is no shortcut remedy. We have already blocked the natural connectivity to accommodate the high population density in this mega-city. We have made it a concrete jungle. Now, we have to improve the efficiencies of all existing water bodies first, and then immediately recover all the canals from grabbers and re-install their connectivity, to help the water drain from city properly,\" he added. Both Dhaka city mayors said illegally occupied city canals must be reclaimed to save Dhaka, as the blocking of the canals is largely responsible for the water logging.  DNCC Mayor Atiqul Islam said the water in Dhaka should reach rivers through canals and drainage lines of Dhaka Wasa.  \"However, the drainage lines are clogged and canals have been illegally occupied,\" he added. \"Dhaka was supposed to have 12% Aadhar (reservoir), which is now only 3%. All the ponds and water bodies have been filled up. Also, unplanned urbanization has put us in trouble, as 330 sq-km out of the total 400 sq-km area of Dhaka has already full of houses, hampering water flow routes,\" the DNCC mayor further said, adding that the authorities are in the process of mapping problem areas to find a solution. Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) Mayor Sayeed Khokhon said: \"Due to lack of proper maintenance of box culverts, water flows very slowly- at maybe at 5-10% the speed of the usual flow.\" Criticizing Dhaka Wasa, he said most city canals have been illegally occupied, and the few remaining ones are not even cleaned regularly. The DSCC mayor emphasized the need to increase the capacity of public service organizations and raise public awareness in order to address water logging. Dhaka Water Supply & Sewerage Authority (Wasa) Managing Director Taqsem A Khan could not be reached for comment as he is out of the country, while other senior Dhaka Wasa officials refused to speak on the matter."

He also said the government is hardly bothered about public welfare and improving public health and checking diseases since it is not elected by people. Rizvi alleged that though the ruling party leaders are used to talk about the country's development, people are going through immense sufferings due to serious tailbacks and sorry state of roads.  He came down hard on the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Chairman Iqbal Mahmood for his comment that corruption committed \"in good faith\" by public servants is not an offence, saying he encouraged the government employees to indulge in corruption. Rizvi also said the ACC chief's remark is a dangerous message of bad governance. The BNP leader said Iqbal Mahmood has no other alternative to defending the corruption by government officials since the ACC officials themselves are involved in corruption. He also alleged that the ACC is busy suppressing opposition in the name of preventing corruption while it has turned a blind eye to the real corrupt plundering public money and making second homes in different countries. Rizvi said the banking sector has been ruined due to government officials' corruption \"in good faith\". About the deteriorating flood situation, he said the ministers and the ruling party MPs are giving lip services from the capital instead of standing beside the victims with necessary relief materials."

On Friday afternoon, a BSF  patrol team from Amit camp under the Shitalkuchi police station of India stopped the construction of Keramatia Boro Mosque when its windows were being installed. BGB 61 Company Commander Subedar Ibrahim Molla said: \"After the obstruction by BSF, construction work has been temporarily halted. We are discussing the issue with BSF.\"  Locals say, in Mughal times a darbesh (holy man) by the name of Keramatia Hujur built a mosque in the Dolpara area. By the side of the mosque, a shrine was later built around his grave and the mosque was developed further over time.  During the partition of India in 1947 the mosque and the shrine fell in no man's land, where thousands of Muslims go to pray every Friday. The mosque committee's secretary, Alimuddin said: \"The reconstruction of the mosque was approved in 2011 by the authorities of both Bangladesh and India and construction work began on April 29 that year.\""

      "text": "In conversation with guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend on his memories of \"Goodbye Summer Concert for Bangladesh\" Goodbye Summer, a rock concert in aid of famine relief of Bangladesh on Sunday September 18, 1971, was not the only Bangladesh related rock event that summer in the UK. Though far less remembered than the ground-breaking event with George Harrison, Ravi Shankar, Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr et al six weeks earlier in Manhattan, the day-long festival at the Oval cricket ground in South London had its own rock superstars. Headlined by The Who and The Faces in their Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood heyday, it drew about as many people in one sitting as the two shows, (matinee and evening) of the historic Concert for Bangladesh in New York on Sunday, August 1, 1971. Here is a conversation with guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend on his memories of the event. Pete Townshend is happy to answer the question and waxes lyrical with a paean to growing up in a multicultural part of West London (\"a mixed-race place\") Unsurprisingly given the years that have past, he veers between remembering some things in detail, and saying \"I don't remember the concert\" (With thanks to Deborah Bonetti, Foreign Press Association Director for reading out my question and prompts) Do you have any memories of the \"Goodbye Summer Concert for Bangladesh\" at the Oval cricket ground on September 18, 1971? Pete Townshend: I remember it very well, I can't actually remember the concert. I remember the event. Rod Stewart kicked out I think 500 footballs into the crowd, which caused absolute chaos because they kept bouncing around two or three hours, all the way through our show Fun with the Faces I remember getting very drunk. Because the Faces used to know how to have a good time. They were good fun and Ronnie Lane was my best friend (he was the bass player in the Faces) we hung out and had fun Drive home I tried to give (my manager Chris Stamp's) ex-wife a lift home and she started kicking off. She was in bad shape. I pushed her out of the car and she went through a shoe shop window and I thought she would be dead. So, I wasn't feeling particularly charitable ... Pushed out of a car while driving?  No, no. We stopped the car and then pushed her out. She staggered back and (then) went through a shoe shop window On not mentioning the Oval concert in memoirs Roger's actually strange, why would he not mention that? I don't suppose I mentioned it either. I suppose it's because in a sense if you mention something like that you feel like you're bragging. I know that we did lots of amazing charitable breakthroughs On charity gigs Double O, my charity, was started by The Who (in 1976) to help Erin Pizzey start the Women's refuge system. She ran the first women's refuge in the world in Chiswick in the UK, and subsequently other charities. Double O went on to be a charity that became well known for helping people with drug problems, putting them through rehab and so on. And more recently, the teen cancer (Teenage Cancer Trust) stuff that we do, so we've always done that stuff On the Oval concert and growing up in 'a really mixed place' The thing about Bangladesh was ... These were our people. People that don't know about London, people that think, oh well its's just a big conurbation full of all different kinds of people. In West London, we grew up in a really mixed race place. Polish, Japanese, lots of Jewish people, mainly from Poland, but also from Russia. People from Somalia, I think we brought in ten thousand Somalians after the War (WWII). So, these were kids of our age from the Caribbean (and Bangladesh). The Bangladeshis tended to work very hard, so we respected them. We adored them and you know we wanted to help. It was a terrible tragedy (flood wasn't it, I think it was). We were honoured to be able to help and... I feel the same way now. I know the difference between somebody from India and somebody from Bangladesh. (pause) And, also somebody from Pakistan.

Teachers and students of the institution spotted the owl in the corridor, and rescued it through a combined effort on Saturday. MA Islam Abdullah, a teacher of the intuition said: \"After rescuing the endangered barn owl, we informed and requested the Dinajpur Forest Division, and Department of Livestock Services (DLS) to take necessary steps. \"But with no response from them we later handed the owl over to a local resort owner Narayan Chandra Pal,\" he added. Narayan Chandra Pal, owner of the \"Sonar Bangla Resort\" said: \"Obliging the medical college authority's request, I took the barn owl in. I will try to take care of the owl with utmost sincerity.\" Thakurgaon Department of Livestock Services (DLS) official Altaf Hossain said:\"We were informed about the barn owl, but it is Dinajpur Forest Division's responsibility to rescue animals. \"We only provide medical attention to animals if needed,\" he added. Majed Jahangir, who is an Assistant Teacher of Zoology in Thakurgaon Government College, said: \"The Barn Owl is considered endangered at this point in time. Due to their habitat being destroyed, hunting, and other problems such as viruses, they have a population that is very low. As a result of this they are struggling to survive out there in the wild.\" Wildlife and Biodiversity Conservation Officer of Dinajpur Forest Division, Smriti Singha Ray, said: \"Barn owls are not considered as endangered in this country as it is commonly found.\" \"So when we received the call to rescue the owl, we suggested the college authority to contact DLS for medical attention, and set it free afterwards.\""

Police seized equipments used for production of fake Indian currency worth Tk1 crore from Jatrabari's Matuail area around 6pm Wednesday, said Abdul Baten, DB's Additional Commissioner,  at a press briefing on Thursday. \"Acting on a tip-off, a team of DB [North division] conducted a drive and busted a money counterfeiting factory,\" he said. \"Three people were also arrested, and we recovered fake Indian Rupees worth Tk26 lakh and other counterfeiting equipments from there.\" The three are Liakat Hossain alias Zakir, the ringleader, Shanta Akter and Momtaz Begum.   Baten said Liakat has connections with a similar ring based in India and traders in Chapainawabganj.  \"Liakat and his gang were planning to use the fake currency to purchase cattle ahead of the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha,\" the DMP additional commissioner said.   With Eid just a few days away, a certain syndicate is planning to release the counterfeit banknotes in shopping malls and cattle markets, Baten added. In another drive in Jatrabari area, police arrested six people- Bojlu Hossain, Afsar Hossain Babu, Nurul Afsar, Md Harun, Al-Amin and Monju Mia- for possessing arms and drugs. They had 3 arms, 10 rounds of bullets, one microbus and 2,100 pieces of yaba in their possession. Two separate teams of DB's East and West division also conducted raids in Fakirapool and Sabujbagh areas respectively, on Wednesday evening. Four people with counterfeit money worth Tk90 lakh were arrested during those drives, Abdul Baten said. The arrestees are Lal Mia, Shahidul Islam, Abida Sultana and Al-Amin. A team of DB West division arrested seven people - Belayet, Dukhu Saha, Rasel, Masud Mollah, Sohan, Zahid and Akash - who were allegedly preparing to carry out a robbery. They were arrested in a drive in Rahim Bepari Ghat under Mohammadpur police station, on Wednesday night. Another team of DB's East division conducted a drive in Modhubagh area under Hatirjheel police station and arrested Nazimuddin Bhuiyan with 10kg of marijuana, the DMP Additional Commissioner said."

      "authors": "Fahim Reza Shovon",
      "text": "In the last general election held on December 30, a total of 881,619 non-EVM votes were declared invalid by the returning officers of 299 constituencies Experts are saying Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) can prevent invalid or spoilt votes during any polls in Bangladesh. The 11th parliament polls on December 30, which witnessed highest number of invalid votes ever recorded, is also a testimony that EVMs are fullproof as far as  rate of spoilt ballot papers or invalid votes is concerned.   In the election held on December 30 last year, a total of 881,619 votes were declared invalid by the returning officers of 299 constituencies.  Invalid votes have been seen in almost all constituencies (except Rangpur 6) where votes were cast manually, i.e. by stamping a seal on the ballot paper. But all the votes were declared valid in the following constituencies, where electronic voting machines (EVMs) were used: Dhaka 6 and 13, Chittagong 9, Rangpur 3, Khulna 2 and Satkhira 2. Muhammed Sohul Hussain and Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Sakhawat Hussain, who served the ATM Shamsul Huda-led Election Commission as election commissioners from 2007 to 2012, had suggested the use of EVMs to prevent invalid or spoilt votes. While talking to the Dhaka Tribune over the phone, Sohul Hussain said \"Hopefully Bangladesh will adopt EVMs for the whole electoral process in future.\" \"We introduced EVMs during our tenure. People will realize no vote-rigging can be done using these voting machines; rather votes are easily and safely cast. There will be no misconception in this regard,\" the former election commissioner added. While talking about how votes are counted as spoilt, he explained: \"Votes can become invalid on the off-chance that the voter did not intend to vote for that specific symbol. Sometimes, they might unfortunately stamp seals onto the wrong symbol during the manual ballot paper process. They then stamp the seal again on their favoured symbol. In these cases, ballot papers are announced invalid due to the double seal. \"But in EVMs, just pressing a button, the valuable vote is cast and then locked to count as a valid vote. People can easily go through this process. Furthermore, there is no chance to count any vote as invalid in EVMs,\" he further added. Former election commissioner Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Sakhawat Hussain told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Allegations of vote-rigging, like in the recently held 11th parliamentary election, would be reduced if EVMs are installed in all constituencies.\" He said: \"There is no issue of counting invalid votes in EVMs. I think the time has come to think about overall issues regarding this. Are we going to take votes by EVMs or not?\" \"As you are saying, the number of invalid votes in this election is not a small number. EVMs will be beneficial in the future, where everyone can cast their votes and no vote will be considered as invalid,\" the former election commissioner added. \"Regarding other allegations, I think party people seizing the election booths should be prevented,\" he said. In 2014's 10th parliamentary polls, the invalid vote count was 263,037; 636,294 in the 9th; 449,082 in the 8th; 462,302 in the 7th; and 373,322 in the 5th."

Short supply, bad weather conditions and increasing demand were the reasons of the price hike, traders claimed. While visiting different kitchen markets in the capital on Wednesday, Dhaka Tribune found per dozen of egg was selling at Tk115 to Tk125 which was Tk105 to Tk110 last week. Shohel Rahman, a resident of Farmgate, while speaking to Dhaka Tribune, said: \"I bought a dozen of egg for Tk105 last week, but I paid Tk125 today for a dozen from the same shop.\" \"As there is no one to monitor this price hike, shopkeepers are charging prices as they want,\" he added.  Md Jahir, a trader at Hatirpool Kitchen market area, said: \"I sold per dozen eggs at Tk125 which I sold for TkTk110 a week earlier. \"There is a high demand in the market for eggs, compared to a supply shortage and for that we also had to buy eggs at higher prices than before.\"  The prices per 100 pieces of eggs increased by Tk30 at the wholesale markets. At the wholesale outlets in Karwanbazar, per 100 pieces of brown eggs were selling at Tk890, white eggs at Tk870, local chicken eggs at Tk1,300, Pakistani chicken eggs at Tk1,100 and duck eggs between Tk1,050-Tk1,100.   Abdul Bachir Mona, an egg wholesaler at Karwan Bazar, said: \"Because of adverse weather, there are half of the total supplies of eggs available in the markets now. \"Besides, increasing cost of meat and fish has created an extra demand for eggs which is another reason for the price hike.\" Another wholesaler Iman Ali, said: \"The production of eggs have also decreased, as chickens fell sick or laid fewer eggs. \" However, egg traders also claimed that the hot and humid weather were another reason for which eggs were rotting and to make the cost balance they had to sell eggs at a higher price.  Syed Abu Siddiqui, president of Bangladesh Poultry Industries Association, said: \"Because of the flood, many poultry farms have been damaged.  \"Chicks production have decreased and overall poultry production cost has gone up as feed prices also went up. \" He further said: \"Due to the high cost of production, farm owners were unable to cope up with the demands in the market.\" \"Until the situation becomes normal, egg prices will remain unchanged in the markets,\" he added.

The approval came at an Ecnec meeting, with its chairperson and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair, held at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area on Tuesday. While briefing reporters after the meeting, Planning Minister MA Mannan said a total of 6 projects involving an overall estimated cost of Taka 4,447.76 crore were approved, reports BSS. \"Of the total project cost, Tk4,439.86 crore will come from the state exchequer while the rest of Tk7.90 crore will come from the organization's own fund,\" he said. Of the approved six projects, five are new while the other is a revised project. The minister said the Nuclear Security and Physical Protection System Cell and Bangladesh Army, Army Headquarters, GS Section (coordination) will implement the project by March 2023. The main project objectives include ensuring security to the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant through implementing the physical protection system side by side, creating a supporting environment for generating safe and protected nuclear power. It also aims to face the risks generating from Design Basis Threat (DBT) or outside of DBT for the nuclear power plant. The planning minister said concerned experts from Bangladesh Army in cooperation with the experts from Russian Federation would implement the project. A bilateral protocol between Bangladesh and the Russian Federation was signed on September 17 last year and in light of that agreement, the project has been undertaken. According to the Planning Commission, establishing nuclear security infrastructures is indispensable for implementing any nuclear power plant project and it is also separate from the construction work of nuclear power plant. Besides, establishing an effective national nuclear security infrastructure is also very much important as a precondition for setting up a nuclear power plant. The main project operations include some 300 acres of land acquisition, 1214678 cubic meter of land development, public works for security and physical protection system."

      "text": "RPI students bring forth various allegations against the ruling party student wing An assault on the Rajshahi Polytechnic Institute (RPI) principal has apparently opened up the Pandora's Box for the leaders and activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League's RPI unit. Amidst protests by teachers and students, a \"torture cell\" reportedly used by Chhatra League has been found on RPI campus by an investigation committee. Allegations have also arisen that the leaders and activist of the ruling party student wing have established a reign of terror on campus through various criminal activists and misdeeds. Leaders and activists of Chhatra League's RPI unit beat dissenters in that torture cell on many occasions, several teachers and students on Sunday told the probe team formed by the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE). The three-member probe team on Sunday recovered metal rods and pipes from Room No 1119 of a building on campus during its visit. Torture instruments found inside the torture cell of Rajhsahi Polytechnic | Dhaka Tribune The building is situated on the west side of the pond into which Principal Farid Uddin Ahmed was thrown by some Chhatra League leaders and activists on Saturday. The recovered metal rods and pipes were later handed over to the police. Top leaders of Chhatra League's RPI unit and Rajshahi metropolitan unit were unavailable for comments regarding the torture cell until the filing of this report at midnight. DTE Director and probe team Convener SM Ferdous Alam said they would submit their findings within three days. He declined going into the details regarding the torture cell, but said: \"All of our findings will be in our probe report.\" Principal Farid said he also heard about the torture cell of Chhatra League. \"But no student or teacher ever lodged any formal complaint out of fear.\" The room in Rajshahi Polytechnic where the torture cell is situated | Dhaka Tribune Allegations Many have also accused Chhatra league leaders and activists of extorting students, threatening and assaulting teachers, publicly humiliating female students who rejected their advances, and sitting for exams without attending classes, among other misdeeds. The allegations were made during a demonstration of RPI students, teachers and staff on Sunday. They formed a human chain in front of RPI around 11am on Rajshahi-Naogaon Highway, placing a number of demands to the institute authorities. The demands include permanent expulsion of those involved in the assault on the principal, bringing them to book, ban on politics on campus, ban on outsiders' entry in RPI, ensuring safety of general students and suitable environment for education. Agitated students also tore down many banners of Chhatra League leaders and activists inside the campus during their hour-long demonstration. However, Chhatra League's RPI unit President Mehedi Hasan Regan rejected the allegations levelled against them, including embezzlement of money taken from around 4,000 students -- Tk300 each -- for a freshers' reception that was never organized. He claimed that the teachers and students were lying. \"We didn't embezzle that money. The department heads have the money meant for the freshers' reception,\" he claimed. Regan said he was not on campus when Principal Farid was assaulted. \"We saw in the CCTV camera footage [of the assault] that Chhatra League's [RPI unit] Joint General Secretary Kamal Hossain Sourav was present there only. \"No one else from Chhatra League was there. We are looking into this too and will take organizational action against anyone involved in this,\" he claimed further. Requesting anonymity, many students alleged that Regan and Sourav are very close and they have established a reign of terror on campus by getting involved in different criminal activists. But everyone has been afraid to raise their voice against them, until now. Chhatra League's central committee in Dhaka on Sunday also expelled Sourav from the organization over the assault on the principal and violation of organizational discipline. The organization's Rajshahi metropolitan unit President Rocky Kumar Ghosh also said that they formed a six-member committee to look into the incident. \"Organizational action will be taken against anyone involved.\" Case and arrests Principal Farid on Saturday night had filed a case at Chandrima police station, naming eight people and accusing at least 50 unidentified others over the assault. Rajshahi Metropolitan Police Additional Deputy Commissioner Golam Ruhul Kuddus said five RPI students were arrested and sent to court on Sunday for their involvement in the incident. They are Shafi Shahriar, 24, Sohel Rana, 20, Badhon Ray, 19, Ariful Islam, 23, and Ripon Ali, 20. However, police are yet to arrest the Chhatra League men who were named in the case. From the CCTV camera footage, RPI teachers had identified Sourav, Murad, Shanto, Bony, Hasibul Islam, Salman Tony, Habibul and Maruf. Of them, only Sourav and Murad are current students. All of them have gone into hiding, said ADC Kuddus. \"But our detectives are on the case. No one will be spared. We are working to bring all of them to book.\""

Not only the junior minister, but Senior Secretary Md Shah Kamal of the ministry was also late by an hour to the event titled \"Enhancing Earthquake Resilience: MoU Signing Cemermony\" held at Department of Disaster Management (DDM) in Mohakhali yesterday. The event was scheduled for 11am yesterday and was expected to end at 1:30pm. But it started after 2pm. Shockingly, Swedish Ambassador to Dhaka, Charlotta Schlyter, left the event after waiting for the state minister for about two hours. Among other dignitaries, DFID-Bangladesh Head Jane Edmondson, UNDP Bangladesh Resident Representative Sudipto Mukerjee, and DDM Director General Shahadat Hossain were present at the event. The mayors of Tangail, Sunamganj, and Rangamati municipalities, and Mostafizur Rahman, on behalf of Rangpur city mayor, also attended the program along with a number of high ranking government officials, to face the schedule debacle. When contacted, Selim Hossen, public relations officer of the ministry, said: \"There was an urgent program for the state minister at Savar [in the morning] which is why he was late.\" MoU for earthquake preparedness Considering the vulnerability to earthquakes in Rangpur, Tangail, Sunamganj, and Rangamati, the DDM part of the National Resilience Program (NRP) signed memorandums of understanding (MoU) at Dhaka's DDM office yesterday. The Project Director of the NRP:DDM part and the mayors of Rangpur City Corporation and Tangail, Sunamganj, and Rangamati municipalities signed four separate MoUs on behalf of their respective agencies. Under the MoUs, the municipalities will work closely with project representatives in revisiting existing assessments and conducting vulnerability assessments to identify the major hazards and risks as well as appropriate options for building capacities of the institutions, including all Disaster Management Committees (DMCs), volunteers and the at-risk communities. State Minister Md Enamur Rahman said: \"A gap remains in developing structural responses to earthquakes. Bangladesh can learn a lot from Japan and becoming zero earthquake loss is our goal.\" UNDP Bangladesh Resident Representative Sudipto Mukerjee said: \"The destructive and deadly hazards associated with earthquakes pose a real and serious threat to the lives of people, property damage, economic growth, and development of the country. The earthquake risk for Bangladesh is doubly high when one considers its rapid urbanization.\" National Resilience Program is a unique collaboration among the Bangladesh Government and UNDP, UN Women and United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) that provides strategic support to develop national capacity to keep pace with the changing nature of disasters."

Pakshi Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Md Mizanur Rahman, who formed the probe committee, confirmed the matter to Dhaka Tribune on Saturday. Md Abdullah Al Mamun, divisional traffic officer (DTO) of Pakshi Western Rail Division, is leading the prove committee to investigate the accident. Three other probe committees formed by the Ministry of Railways, Sirajganj district administration, and Rajshahi Western Rail Division have already begun their investigation. DTO Md Abdullah Al Mamun on Friday, said the accident was caused by a problem on the railway tracks, as found during their primary investigation. DRM Md Mizanur Rahman in a press briefing on Saturday said, the signal system had no problem as it was controlled by CBI (Computer Based Interlocked) system developed by European engineers.  Rajshahi unit Chief Engineer Al Fattah Md Masudur of Western Rail Division said all the rail tracks were accessible 30 hours after the accident. On a visit to the Ullapara Railway Station this correspondent found workers busy fixing the rail track 1 yesterday. Ullapara Railway Station's Assistant Station Master Rafiqul Islam said: \"It will likely take about another week to fully renovate the rail tracks. Train schedule still continues to suffer.\" On Thursday, the engine and seven bogies of Rangpur Express derailed after the train, bound for Rangpur, left the Ullapara rail station. The engine along with four bogies also caught fire. Around 25 people were injured in the incident. After the accident, rail links between Dhaka, and the northern districts remained cut off for nearly seven hours, collapsing the schedule of trains in that route."

      "text": "As the river route has not been developed for years of mismanagement, this river port remained inoperative. However, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared Chilmari as a river port during her official visit to Kurigram on September 7, 2016 Although three years have elapsed since the formal inauguration of Chilmari River Port in Kurigram, it is yet to see any activities, causing frustration to local people. Sources said a Shipping Protocol Treaty was signed between the governments of India and Bangladesh in 1972 to transport goods through rivers. During the British period, one could travel through rivers from Kolkata to Guwahati as far as Dhubri in Assam. As the river route has not been developed for years of mismanagement, this river port remained inoperative. However, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared Chilmari as a river port during her official visit to Kurigram on September 7, 2016. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) set up a pontoon at Ramna Shallowghat, Chilmari on September 23, 2017, which was inaugurated by then Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan. Besides, a project was taken to develop the river port. However, the Zilla Parishad does not want to hand over the responsibility of managing the ghats of this river port. The port was given out on lease without informing the BIWTA, resulting in a conflict between the two parties. When the conflict intensified and the matter went to the court, then Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan visited the river port in June, 2018 and assured all concerned of solving the problem. But neither the problem was solved or the river port became operational, alleged locals. According to sources at the Shipping Ministry, once Chilmari was a traditional business hub. The area was recognised as 'Chilmari River Port' from the early days when big ships carrying thousands of maunds of jute, paddy, rice and other goods started moving along this river port. During the British period, big warehouses of jute, mustard, paddy, peanuts and maize were set up at Chilmari around the river port. Renowned jute companies in the country came to Chilmari and established their offices to procure jute. Besides, businessmen and traders of various areas came and stayed at Chilmari day after day to buy goods. The commercial activities based on Chilmari came to a halt due to river erosion and navigability crisis. The present government has taken up the project to improve navigability by dredging rivers. This river port is the only route to establish regional connectivity among India, Bhutan and Nepal from the Payra Sea Port. If the river port can be developed, the entire Kurigram region as well as the national economy will see a good growth. \"We can't see any ray of hope as the river port is not being operational. So, we demand this river port be made operational as soon as possible,\" said Shahidul."

He said this after meeting with top officials of the division, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), and the transport owners' association's leaders on ensuring a safe, comfortable, and hassle-free journey for homebound people, on Thursday. However, vehicles carrying daily essentials and medicines will not fall under the purview of the instructions, he added.  The secretary said the condition of the roads is better than in previous years, and the authorities concerned will take immediate steps to resolve any issues that might arise.  \"The public will not suffer on the roads [during the Eid holidays], this year,\" Nazrul said.  Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC), and the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges, will operate control rooms that will work round-the-clock with the BRTA to ease the movement of the holidaymakers.  BTRC will also operate a special bus service. Mobile courts will remain active at all times, and will conduct drives to check on ticket prices and unfit vehicles.  Public transport owners have also been asked to remain alert, Nazrul said. Law enforcement will ensure that no makeshift markets are set up on highways, and no buses are parked arbitrarily. The government has asked garment factory owners to provide Eid workers their holidays in phases, to avoid an extra rush prior to Eid day, the secretary added."

      "text": "Customers claimed the price hike was because of syndication, but the port traders denied the claim  The prices of Indian onion have doubled in the country in two weeks. Satkhira's Bhomra Land port traders have blamed the Indian online automation system, and lifting of incentives by the Indian government for the price hike. Sakhawatullah, a resident of Satkhira city, said: \"Even two week back per kg of onion was Tk20 to Tk25, which is now being sold at Tk35 to Tk40 per kg.\" Customers claimed the price hike was because of syndication, but the port traders denied the claim and said, the demand of onions in Indian local markets had increased, and at the same time imports to Bangladesh had decreased in comparison to the demand. A trader at the land port, Amir Hamza, confirming the matter said: \"Indian government previously gave 10% incentives to us traders to import more onions, which was lifted in June after the demand increased in the Indian markets.\" \"We have to buy per kg onion at Tk22 now, which we bought at Tk16 last month,\" he said.  Amir also blamed the new automation system at the Indian border, which lacked efficient workforce, therefore, was delaying the import process.  According to Bhomra Customs assistant commissioner's office, Bhomra Land port is the biggest channel for onion imports in the country. In April 48,000MT of onion were imported from this channel, in May, it was 26,000MT and in June it was only 8,617MT. Bhomra Land Port Export-Import Association Vice President Ferdous Alfa, said: \"Due to the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha, the  demand for onion in the country have increased a little, but the main reason of the price hike is due to onion fields going under water because of flood in India's Nasik.  \"Also, due to the automation system, trucks carrying perishable goods are not being allowed to pass before other goods laden trucks.\"   Bhomra C&F Association President Arafat Hossain said: \"Imports are getting delayed everyday due to online server problems, and less number of scales at the border, which must be fixed, if not, both countries will lose huge revenues, and the prices of onion will go beyond the customers' purchasing power.\" Assistant Revenue Official at the land port, Bikash Chandra Debnath, said: \"There were multiple reasons which caused the price hike, but it will soon be fixed, I hope.\""

The three restaurants were Bailey Bar B Q, Dhaka Biriyani, and Rooster Cafe. The quasi-judicial government department also fined Vaggokul Sweets for unclean and expired food items, and S Baker for not labeling their packaged products.  Bailey Bar B Q, Vaggokul Sweets, and S Baker, were fined Tk 50,000 each, while Dhaka Biriyani was fined Tk 30,000 and Rooster Cafe, Tk 20,000. Md Adbul Jabbar Mondol, assistant director of the Directorate of National Consumers' Right Protection, said if they continue to run their businesses in this way, the authorities concerned would cancel their trade licenses.    \"We are keeping them under pressure. If there is any lapse, our team will visit and take necessary action,\" he said.    The Directorate of National Consumers' Rights Protection team also identified expired tomato sauces and other condiments at Vaggokul Sweets. The popular store did not put any price tags for the sweets they were selling. It also stored some sweets in a very unclean bucket.  The staff and employees of Bailey Bar B Q kitchen were working in an unhygienic and congested atmosphere. The authorities found grilled chicken and kebabs being kept overnight on the kitchen countertop.  Dhaka Biriyani stored almost rotten vegetables and stale dough at their restaurant.  The National Consumers' Right Protection team raided BFC and Chittagong General Store in the Bailey Road neighbourhood and found their services and products to be satisfactory.  Sabiha Zaman Shobha, a customer who heading towards BFC, said the average consumer is frustrated with these restaurants and their services, and demanded exemplary punishment against restaurant owners responsible for not living up to maintaining standard operating procedures."

On the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, the PEC noted a 56% decrease registering 20 victims in 12 countries from January 1 to April 30 against 46 during the same period last year, using the same metrics. The figure is the lowest figure since 2006.  PEC Secretary-General Blaise Lempen observed the lower intensity of conflict in Syria and Iraq contributed to this decrease. In addition, the continuous engagement of governments, associations and civil society in favor of the issue of the safety of journalists has certainly produced positive effects. It is also true that other means are used to neutralize journalists. The situation remains steadily hostile in Mexico with six journalists killed and Afghanistan with four killed, which adds up to half the victims since the beginning of 2019.  One journalist was killed in the following countries: Ghana, Honduras, India, Iraq, Northern Ireland, Kenya, Libya, Pakistan, the Philippines and Yemen. The PEC strongly condemns the killings and calls for quick identification of the killers and bringing them to justice."

      "text": "Following approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), Dhaka Wasa had initiated two projects to tackle the issue and improve the water logging situation The water logging situation in the capital has not changed over the years, even after promises from Dhaka Wasa about implementing a master-plan and commitment of the government to find a solution to this problem. People of the city were reminded of the unfulfilled pledges yesterday, after a downpour left numerous areas waterlogged and led to major gridlock on the streets until well after evening. Following approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), Dhaka Wasa had initiated two projects to tackle the issue and improve the water logging situation. But their progress is very slow to make any significant headway. On June 28, 2018, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, then LGRD minister, had blamed development projects around the city for its water logging problem. He had also expressed hope that the problem would end by 2019 -- which has not happened. As a result, the perennial waterlogging scenario in Dhaka is still unchanged. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) recorded 46mm rainfall in the city between 12pm and 6pm yesterday. Just within half-an-hour of thundershowers a little after 12pm, citizens were seen posting on social media videos of waterlogging in a number of areas. Dhaka Tribune correspondents during visits also found many streets and areas inundated. The areas that suffered most include Mirpur's Rokeya Sarani and Kazipara, Jahangir Gate, Green Road, parts of Indira Road, Tejgaon, Panthapath, Shukrabad, Kalabagan, Dhanmondi, Jhigatala, Shankar, Jatrabari, Bashundhara Residential Area, Motijheel, Gulistan, Paltan, Bijoynagar, Fakirapool, Karwan Bazar, Arambagh, some areas in Mohakhali and Gulshan, and many places of Old Dhaka. Talking to Dhaka Tribune, many said waterlogging was still occurring as the drains that are supposed to take the rainwater out are clogged with garbage. At the same time, heavy gridlock on major roads, which were inundated, made it extremely difficult for city dwellers to commute. Sufferings Many people were seen wading through the water to reach their destinations. Sarjin Sharif, a resident of Shankar area, told Dhaka Tribune: \"The road in front of my house is completely submerged. \"I need to go to work, but I cannot even get out of the house to find a vehicle.\" Dhanmondi's Road No 27 also went under knee-deep water very quickly, leaving many including students suffering amid heavy rain. Nafisa Nazmul, a former student of Brac University, said: \"I cannot find transport to go to Panthapath from Mirpur 10. The roads are completely underwater.\" East Jurain resident Awenim Rahman also told Dhaka Tribune that the main streets in his area were fine, as they were rebuilt and their heights increased recently. \"But the branch lanes, which are still low-lying, are completely inundated.\" He said he also faced horrible traffic jam on his way to the office later in the afternoon. \"I found all the roads leading from Gulistan to Paltan, Shahbagh, Kakrail, Dainik Bangla, and Farmgate via Banglamotor and Karwan Bazar absolutely gridlocked,\" Awenim said expressing frustration. Independent University Bangladesh faculty member Kazi Mubinul Hasan said: \"I live in the Bashundhara Residential area. On a usual day, it takes me less than an hour to reach Shukrabad. But today [Tuesday], it took me nearly two hours.\" Nilkhet and New Market areas, Elephant Road and Mirpur Road also saw major gridlock after the rain stopped a little after 3pm. The rain even left the roads leading from the main entrances to archways in the Bangladesh Secretariat, adjacent to Zero Point in Gulistan, under knee-deep water for at least three hours. Officers and outsiders both suffered while going from one building to another. Many were even seen entering the offices barefoot. Those turning up at the secretariat without cars were among the worst sufferers. Many said the secretariat had seen a similar problem on Sunday. More rains incoming BMD Meteorologist AKM Ruhul Quddus told Dhaka Tribune that they recorded 45.3mm of rainfall in the capital between noon and 3pm yesterday. Between 12pm and 6pm, a total of 46mm rainfall was recorded. Meanwhile, BMD also recorded the highest rainfall in Sylhet - 120mm. According to a Met Office weather bulletin, light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind over the country was likely again in the next 24 hours as of 9am today. \"There is a chance of light rain on Wednesday in Dhaka, Khulna and Chittagong regions, and in the rest of the country it will rainless,\" said Ruhul. The bulletin added that light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind is likely to occur at most places in Dhaka, Mymensingh, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, many places in Khulna and Barisal divisions, and a few places in Rangpur and Rajshahi divisions during the time. Moreover, it said, some places in Barisal, Chittagong, Mymensingh and Sylhet divisions may see moderately heavy to very heavy falls until this morning. Slow progress of master-plan Aiming to fix the perennial problem, the Ecnec last year had approved two projects -- \"Expansion of Drainage Networks and Development of Canals Project in Dhaka City\" and \"Land acquisition, excavation and re-excavation of Hazaribagh, Baishteki, Kurmitola, Manda and Begunbari canals.\" But both, being implemented by Dhaka Wasa are advancing at a snail's pace. One of the projects has registered only 8.25% progress in the past one year, while the other just 1.5% over the span of 14 months. Regarding the extremely sluggish progress, urban development expert Prof Nazrul Islam said such projects, after being passed, advance slowly due to many issues. \"But in course of time, their progress gained pace. But these two projects seem to be progressing very slowly. Only the authorities implementing them can explain why,\" he said. Dhaka Wasa Managing Director Taqsem A Khan was unavailable for comment over phone. However, engineer Nuruzzaman, former member of Dhaka Wasa Board, told Dhaka Tribune: \"Wasa is trying to solve the waterlogging issue by implementing some projects. It is visible that once areas used to remain waterlogged for five to six hours, but this year the water cleared from roads in two to three hours. It is a significant improvement.\""

      "text": "A necessity for the vulnerable sector    Bangladesh is recognized as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change because of its geographical location and socio-demographic features. Agriculture is the most significant economic sector in Bangladesh. Despite Bangladesh's remarkable achievement in improving agricultural productivity, the sector is facing risk from climate change, extreme weather events, and sea level rise to address the adverse impact of climate change on agriculture. Climate change is expected to decrease Bangladesh's agriculture GDP by 3.1 % each year (World Bank). For example, the damage from climate change effect in 2007 and 2009 cyclones were estimated at around 2 million metric tons of rice, which is enough to feed 10 million people.  Transforming the agricultural sector and building resilience will not be possible if there is no significant amount of capital available for climate-smart investments in agriculture. Moreover, robust financial investments are needed to support the global food system. Climate finance plays a pivotal role by supporting developing countries to reduce emissions, decarbonize their economies. Climate finance in agricultural sector innovates ways to use climate finance to improve and increases access to finance for smallholder farmers in the agricultural sector while delivering positive outcomes namely increased resilience and reduced emissions intensity. The smallholder farmers are the most vulnerable vast majority of farmers who have little or no capacity to adapt, lack a safety net, and are highly exposed threat in their livelihood and food security risks. Bangladesh is among the largest recipients of climate funds from International Finance Corporation, World Bank mostly for adaptation in the agricultural sector. Climate finance budget allocation for the Ministry of Agriculture in 2018-19 is Tk13,915 crore where climate-relevant allocation is 39 percent (Finance Division, Ministry of Finance). Adaptations to climate change for agricultural sectors include: resilient variety crops, new and diverse cropping pattern, irrigation techniques, sustainable land management, early warning systems, new research. In this case, climate finance acts as a remedy as it helps to adopt many strategies to cope with the existing situations and those expected to impact the country in the future. Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) mainly focuses on the promotion of agricultural practises focusing on floating gardens, community-based adaptation, advocacy for climate change adaptation measures, coastline and flood defences. Bangladeshi agricultural scientists have encouraged adopting new technologies and developing climate-smart crop varieties, as a means to diversify the agrarian practices of subsistence farmers. Due to the fund, many farmers are reporting experiencing increasing bumper yields. Thus through the use of new practices and new technologies climate change finance has, for now, improved the situation for some farmers.   CourtesyExamples of adaptation for the agriculture sector Floating Gardens are a process used in many regions during the monsoon season, ingenious farmers create their floating seedbeds and grow plants on floating gardens. Hydroponics system in Bangladesh, based on floating gardens, was recognized in December 2014 by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) for innovation, sustainability, and adaptability. Farmers in some parts of the country where flood waters can remain for a prolonged period have developed floating gardens in which plants can grow on the water on floating organic beds of water hyacinth, algae and other plant residues. This environmentally friendly traditional cultivation technique utilizes the natural resources of wetlands to grow vegetables and other crops almost all year round, providing numerous social, economic, agricultural, and ecological benefits to the local population. It helps the farmers to cope with the situation. Sunflower oil production is recently introduced as a quality-based oilseed crop and is gaining popularity among local farmers because of its easy extraction method. Sunflower is categorised as a low to medium drought sensitive crop. The cultivation of sunflower may be suitable in the coastal environment because of its high yield and wide adaptability. In 16 districts of Bangladesh, sunflower oil is being harvested, and the average production is about 1.2t/ha, which is relatively encouraging. Shrimp farming is a relatively new form of agriculture introduced in Bangladesh on a commercial scale. Shrimp can cultivation is possible in both brackish and freshwater. Currently, shrimp fish cultivation is widespread throughout the coastal region and Bangladesh produces more than 2.5 % of the global production of shrimp and has become the seventh largest exporter of shrimp to the Japanese and USA markets. Rainwater harvesting is a method of inducing, collecting, storing, and conserving local surface runoff for agricultural production. Farmers in water-scarce areas face difficulties in agricultural output due to unavailability of water at the right time and in the right amount. It is expected that the use of rainwater will save farmers' money as well as increase production. Rainwater harvesting can be effectively used by farmers to overcome the hardships of nature. The method of rainwater harvesting for agriculture is standard as a result of the irregular nature of rain in many countries and is widely practised in areas where there is an irregularity in seasonal rains. Rainwater harvesting technology help store water in the rainy seasons, for usage, during the drought period. Agriculture is the most vulnerable sector as its productivity depends on climatic factors like temperature, rainfall, light intensity, radiation and sunshine duration, which are predicted to become increasingly erratic. The number of climate change induced disasters has and will continue to increase over the coming years. Therefore, climate finance mechanisms have the potential to continue to strengthen the links between financial institutions and smallholder farmers by addressing some of the critical financial-sector constraints on agriculture.

      "text": "Bangladesh have achieved their first ever win against India in T20 format on Sunday when they defeat the hosts by seven wickets at Delhi A confident Bangladesh side is looking to repeat their match winning performance or even better display against hosts India at the Saurashtra Cricket Stadium in Rajkot on Thursday. Bangladesh have achieved their first ever win against India in T20 format on Sunday when they defeat the hosts by seven wickets at Delhi. Now, Tigers have the golden chance to seal the three-match series as India are on a backfoot with a relatively inexperienced bowling attack. Weather is a big concern for the match due to effect of cyclone 'Maha'. According to Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Cyclone Maha, which is expected to hit the Gujarat coast today, has weakened into a severe storm on Wednesday. But still the storm is likely to bring \"heavy rains\" during the next 48 hours in Gujrat state. The weather, however, was clear on Wednesday morning as Bangladesh team practiced in their scheduled time at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium. Tigers started their training with warm-up session in morning and after an intense fielding practice session the batsmen went to nets adjacent to the stadium. India had an optional practice session on Wednesday in the afternoon session. Like their counterparts, they enjoyed the condition which was hot and humid all the day until evening. But, before the sunset the first sign of rain was seen as the dark cloud started to gather during. And around 7pm local time a light thunderstorm hit Rajkot with moderate wind. At the stadium area, pitch covers were blown away and suddenly all the flood lights were went off for few minutes. From the press box area of the Saurashtra Cricket Stadium, strong wind was felt during the raining period. After half an hour the rain, however, stopped.   The weather forecast was suggesting near 50 percent on precipitation on Wednesday evening while the forecast at Thursday evening is predicting near 15-20 percent of precipitation. However, in morning and noon session both teams were preparing for an exciting contest amid rain threat. The pitch in Delhi, where the first game took place, was a tricky one for the batsmen but pitches in Saurashtra Cricket Stadium generally offer good help to the batsmen. Both the captains are focusing on their own game plans rather than concerned about the weather too much. \"We will observe the wicket before the match and then decide about the playing eleven. The wicket looks good. We are expecting a good batting track with an average score of 170-180. Probably we will field the same eleven and don't break the inning combination but the final call will be taken before the toss,\" said Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad at the pre match press conference at Rajkot on Wednesday.  His counterpart Rohit Sharma was also expecting a run feast. \"The pitch looks good. Rajkot is always a good track to bat and it does offer some assistance to the bowlers also. I think it will better pitch than that of Delhi,\" said India captain Rohit  in the pre match media session. "

      "text": "At least six people were killed - including a 17-year old high school student - after two nights of rioting in the capital as police clashed with protesters opposed to the re-election of President Joko Widodo Tens of thousands of  Indonesian military and police were deployed on the streets of Jakarta Thursday, as a deadline approached for a presidential challenger to file an appeal over claims of widespread cheating in last month's election. At least six people were killed - including a 17-year old high school student - after two nights of rioting in the capital as police clashed with protesters opposed to the re-election of President Joko Widodo. The violence has been fanned by claims from Widodo's rival Prabowo Subianto, a retired general, that the April 17 poll was a fraud. Indonesia's election commission on Tuesday confirmed Widodo had beaten Subianto, who has until Friday to challenge the results at the Constitutional Court. The 67-year-old has appealed for calm and said he would pursue legal channels, as he did, unsuccessfully, against Widodo in the 2014 election. Election officials and analysts discounted Subianto's claims of rampant cheating in the world's third-biggest democracy, after India and the United States. The government has partly blocked access to social media - including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram - in a bid to clamp down on fake news and hoaxes linked to the violence. At least six people are dead and hundreds injured as Indonesia continues to grapple with post-election riots. https://t.co/o6L14Mm4QT On Wednesday evening, the area around the election supervisory agency's office erupted in fresh skirmishes with thousands of protesters chanting and waving Indonesian flags. Some hurled stones, fireworks and molotov cocktails at riot police who lined up behind a razor wire barricade near the election supervisory agency building, where a police post was torched. Police pushed back the main group of rioters after firing tear gas and rubber bullets at the demonstrators.  An Australian Broadcasting Corporation news crew said it was attacked without warning by a mob. 'Provocateurs' Indonesia's capital been gripped by bigger demonstrations in the past, but the level of violence in this week's clashes has not been seen in years. Among the half-dozen people killed was a 17-year-old high school student and a 19-year-old, according to local media. Authorities said the victims died from gunshots or blunt force trauma, but denied that they fired live rounds on the crowds. It remained unclear who was responsible for their deaths. By Thursday morning, Jakarta's streets were relatively quiet as the police and military kept a close watch on buildings in the downtown core, including the election supervisory agency building - the centre of much of the violence - as well as parliament, embassies and the presidential palace amid fears of more unrest. Nearly 60,000 security personnel were deployed Thursday, nearly double the previous number, after Widodo vowed that he \"won't tolerate\" more riots. Authorities have blamed the violence on \"provocateurs\" that they claimed had come from outside Jakarta to stir up trouble. \"We've detained more than 300 suspects and are now interrogating them,\" said national police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo. Elsewhere, smaller election protests were held in Sumatra's Medan city and in Pontianak on Borneo island, where over 500 demonstrators armed with stones and firecrackers blocked roads, damaged vehicles and set two police posts alight, local police said."

      "text": "What makes it different from the last DNCC polls is the absence of strong candidates As many as three million voters are set to go to the polls tomorrow to elect a new mayor and councillors for new wards, in the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) by-polls, without any enthusiasm or electioneering in sight. What makes it different from the last DNCC polls is the absence of strong candidates.  This has failed to generate a buzz among voters, not to mention lack of strong opposition candidates. While five candidates will vie for the mayoral position, only ruling Awami League-nominated candidate Atiqul Islam was seen to be electioneering, which ended yesterday.  The other candidates are Shafin Ahmed from Jatiya Party, Anisur Rahman Dewan from National People's Party, Shahin Khan of Progressive Democratic Party, and independent candidate Abdur Rahim. Polling for mayoral elections will be held in 54 wards of DNCC. Also 36 new wards, 18 in DNCC and 18 in Dhaka South City Corporation, are up for elections on the same day. Unlike the mayoral by-polls, vigorous campaigns are being conducted by candidates for councillor posts, as the posts are being contested for the first time. Election materials, including ballot papers, have already reached the offices of the returning officers concerned, as the Election Commission finalizes its preparations for the elections scheduled tomorrow. Arrangements are already in place to send the election materials to the polling centres by today, before voters head to cast their ballots starting 8am tomorrow.  The elections will take place until 4pm without any interval. A public holiday has been announced in DNCC areas so that all voters can exercise their voting rights. Electioneering concluded on Tuesday Returning Officer for the DNCC mayoral polls, Md Abul Kashem, told BSS that no candidate or none in favor of any candidate can conduct any meeting, rally, or procession starting midnight in the DNCC areas, after the electioneering schedule ended on Tuesday.  \"No offices will remain open on that day. But Public academic examinations will be held as per schedule. Students residing in hostels or residences for study purposes will be exempt from the directives concerning leaving election areas\" the RO said. Kashem added that the ban on traffic movement will be relaxed on highways and inter-district roads inside DNCC, considering the issue of public suffering, but vehicular movement on connecting roads will remain banned. Vehicle restrictions According to a home ministry circular, motorcycle transport will be banned in DNCC polling areas from today till Friday 6am.   Meanwhile, all vehicle traffic in the area--excluding emergency services--will be banned for 24 hours starting Wednesday midnight (12am) to Thursday midnight (12am). Vehicles affected by the ban during the by-elections are: motorcycles, trucks, motorized three-wheelers, taxis, microbuses, jeeps, pickups, and cars. Water vessels moving through the area will also fall under the vehicle ban. However, the restriction on vehicle traffic will be loosely implemented on important roads, streets, and highways leading into and out of Dhaka, and at inter-district bus terminals. The circular also directed non residents or voters in the DNCC to leave the area by Tuesday midnight (12am), to ensure a peaceful by-election, and to avoid facing legal action on voting day. Filling a void The DNCC mayoral post fell vacant with the death of Annisul Huq on November 30, 2017. According to the schedule declared by the Election Commission, the by-polls for the DNCC mayoral post were supposed to be held on February 26 last year. But a High Court bench stayed the election for six months after hearing two separate writ petitions on January 14 last year. However, another High Court bench later cleared the way to hold the by-election by withdrawing the stay order."

      "text": "A pregnant woman dies at Bangabanadhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University At least three people including a pregnant woman died of dengue as the tally of patients suffering from the mosquito-borne virus kept spiraling with 1,687 new cases across the country on Friday.  Shockingly, two of the victims died in Dhaka.  The deceased are Md Raiyan Sarkar, Mosharraf Hossain and Maliha Mahfuz Onnya. Raiyan, a 6th grader of Government Mohammadpur Model School and College, died while undergoing treatment at Square Hospitals in Dhaka while Mosharraf, 30, at a Noakhali hospital. The expectant mother, Maliha Mahfuz Onnya, died at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), a private news channel reported, without disclosing her identity.  She had been suffering from dengue fever for the last ten days. With the latest deaths, the number of people who died of the mosquito-borne virus jumped to at least 47, according to the unofficial tally.  Interestingly, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) claimed that no deaths took place due to dengue in a 24-hour span until last afternoon. In a media release issued at 4pm, the DGHS made the claim, confirming that 1,687 people were affected with dengue anew.  Also Read- Quader for united efforts to control dengue With this, the number of dengue patients hit a record high of 21,253 since the beginning of this year. Dhaka city alone saw 992 new patients, clearly depicting that it continued to bear the brunt of dengue.  Outside Dhaka, Chittagong division became the second most affected area having 119 cases, followed by Khulna division (91 patients) and Rajshahi division (87 patients).   Since January, according to DGHS, a total of 14 people died of dengue across the country, with the highest 10 deaths registered only in July.  Currently, 6,582 people are hospitalised while the number was 4,903 on Thursday afternoon.   From January to March, there were only 73 infections in total. In April, there were 58 infections and two fatalities. The number of infected patients nearly quadrupled to 193 in May, and blew up to 1,863 in June with two more deaths. The outbreak far surpasses the previous largest instance from 2002 when there were 6,232 confirmed dengue cases with over 62 deaths. The dengue outbreak was largely attributed to the flood situation at the time. Fears, promises, criticism pour in  Urging all to work together to control the dengue outbreak, Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader said there was no improvement in the dengue situation.  \"The dengue situation is bad in Bangladesh. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is also worried about the country's dengue situation,\" said the minister while addressing a program in Dhaka on Friday. Also Read- Fakhrul : Declare state of emergency to tackle dengue \"The dengue situation is not out of control. We have strength to control the situation. It is possible to control it through united efforts,\" he said. Quader furthered there is no way to deny that dengue has spread all over the country. Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Mayor Atiqul Islam told reporters that the new sample of insecticide to kill mosquito will arrive from abroad in a day or two. But, on Thursday, lawyers of the DNCC and its southern counterpart claimed that samples of mosquito repellent would be brought from abroad by later in the day.  Meanwhile, Information Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud on Friday urged physicians to stand by dengue patients on humanitarian ground.  He also accused some doctors for trying to utilize dengue prevalence as a means of business. \"Most of the physicians have already stood beside the dengue patients on humanitarian grounds, but a section of doctors is trying to utilise the dengue prevalence as a means of business,\" he said while inaugurating a cleanliness and mosquito killing drive in the capital.  Blaming the health minister and both the mayors of Dhaka for the dengue outbreak, Nagoril Oikya Convener Mahmudur Rahman Manna at a discussion in Dhaka said the entire country is grappling with the mosquito menace.  \"People are not safe. But the minister and the mayors failed to act properly to resolve the issue. They are staging a drama on the pretext of procuring insecticide to kill mosquitoes,\" he added. Also Read- Mamata: Bangladeshi mosquitoes behind dengue in West Bengal  The government is deliberately importing effective  repellents, alleged BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.  \"Dengue menace is an annual affair. But, why the government turned a blind eye despite knowing the fact? It willingly procured insecticide that does not destroy mosquitoes. Who embezzled the money?\" he questioned.  Health Rights Movement's President Prof Rashid-E-Mahbub said negligence among the authorities concerned caused the dengue to take an epidemic shape.  \"All has to take responsibility for the failure. Firstly, the government has engaged in a blame game. But right now, we have to think of treating dengue patients and fighting the mosquito menace,\" he furthered.  The scenario across the country In Jhenaidah, five more cases including that of 7th grader were recorded in the district's Kaliganj upazila. Four of them were infected with the dengue virus while in Dhaka, said local hospital sources. All five patients were being treated at the Jhenidah Sadar Hospital.  Dr Hussain Shafayet of the Kaliganj Upazila Health Complex said they were yet to receive the dengue-testing kits.  In Barishal, 48 more patients have been admitted to the Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital in 24 hours ending last afternoon. Local health officials said people returning home from Dhaka ahead of Eid-ul-Azha are pushing up the number of the positive dengue case.  Dr Abdur Rahim, divisional heath director, said patients are approaching to private pathologies since no dengue testing-kits (like NS-I) reached at any of the 43 public hospitals in the district as yet. In Gaibandha, an upward trend of dengue cases is noticed. Until Friday, at least 11 dengue patients were confirmed. All of them live in Dhaka, but returned to their village home with the dengue virus, said Gaibandha's Civil Surgeon Abu Janif.  Other than taking measures to contain the virus, local authorities concerned have launched a loudspeaker campaign asking people not to panic over the menace as well to be aware of Aedes mosquitoes. In Dinajpur, three people were found to be dengue positive. Like most cases, the trio lives in Dhaka and returned to the district after being infected by the dengue virus. Local administration said the government clinics and hospitals have no dengue-testing kits. In Madaripur, 18 new cases were confirmed until 2pm yesterday, pushing the number of dengue-affected people to 48. Of them, 15 patients were being treated at local hospitals.  Most of the new patients came from Dhaka, said local hospital sources.  In Tangail, the situation is no different from other districts. Eight more patients were hospitalised yesterday, with total number of dengue cases soaring to 66.  In Bogra, the number of patients continued to rise. Until last morning, 148 patients were confirmed at Saheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College."

      "text": "The Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change has assured that action will be taken against DNCC A parliamentary standing committee has recommended that the highest amount of fines be realized from the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) for polluting environment by dumping waste haphazardly at the Amin Bazar sanitary landfill. The Standing Committee on Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, at a meeting held at the parliament on Satruday, came up with the decision as the DNCC has been using the landfill for dumping waste without any environmental clearance. Appearing from the meeting, Committee Chairman Saber Hossain Chowdhury, said the law is equal for all and there are provisions for fines if a person or an organisation pollutes the environment.  \"The dumping ground used by DNCC is illegal. The environment department earlier issued letters to the organization, but they did not respond. Also Read - A landfill in flood flow zone The ministry has assured that action will be taken against the DNCC, in line with the recommendations made by the standing committee, he added. According to the meeting minutes, three separate letters had been issued to shut the dumping station, but the DNCC has not paid heed to the letters. Dhaka Tribune on August 29 ran a report on \"A landfill in flood flow zone\" that said that Aminbazar sanitary landfill, the lone landfill for all the DNCC waste has turned into an artificial floating island in the flood flow zone near the Turag River, severely damaging the ecosystem. About 2,000 tons of waste is dumped on a daily basis from different parts of north Dhaka to the landfill that does not have an environmental clearance certificate from the Department of Environment (DoE). An August 5 inter-ministerial meeting at the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change claimed that  DNCC did not follow the directives prescribed in the Environment Conservation Rules, 1997, in the first place while building the landfill, failing to ensure a sound environment, it says. The dump yard has become over-loaded from all sides and falls on the path of a flood flow zone near a canal of the Turag River. The landfill built-in 2007 on 52 acres of land was expanded in 2017 as the garbage over the years exceeded the capacity, but the sanitary landfill has turned into an open dump due to the haphazard disposal of waste. The Environment Conservation Rules 1997 made it mandatory to have an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and maintain sound environmental conditions in all steps of building and operation of landfills. However, the DNCC neither conducted the EIA nor obtained any environmental clearance - a clear violation of the rules."

      "text": "Mounting land scarcity around Dhaka city prompts authorities to re-assess the solid waste management strategy With increasing population, rapid economic expansion and urbanization, the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) is exploring prospects of generating renewable energy from municipal solid waste being dumped into Aminbazar landfills, said Dhaka North Mayor Atiqul Islam. Mounting the land scarcity issue around Dhaka city prompts authorities to re-assess the solid waste management strategy, because generating renewable energy from solid waste not only reduces the land pressure problem, but also generates cleaner energy and better environemnt. A proposal was sent to the Local Government Division, in this regard, Atiqul said while launching a combing operation against dengue-carrying Aedes mosquitoes in the capital on Sunday. The mayor said he had a discussion with the chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Saber Hossain Chowdhury, who is now out of country. \"Upon his return, we will hold a meeting on September 21 at the DNCC and will try to determine a viable solution to mounting solid wastes in the landfills,\" he said. The Standing Committee on Saturday recommended that hefty fines will be realized from the DNCC for polluting environment by dumping municipal solid waste unsystematically at the Aminbazar landfill requisite environmental clearance. \"We are always concerned about ecology and environmental pollution. As an immediate action plan, we [DNCC] have proposed to produce cleaner energy from recycling the solid waste,\" the mayor said. Sources said the DNCC has long been using the Aminbazar landfill for dumping waste without any environmental clearance.

      "text": "India is the second largest onion producer and exporter in the world after China India's ban on onion export will not affect the local market as the country has sufficient stock, a top trade official has claimed, saying a large quantity of onion imports from Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar are in the pipeline. \"There is nothing to be worried about India's ban. We have adequate stock,\" Commerce Secretary Jafar Uddin told Dhaka Tribune last night. He said two ships carrying onions from Myanmar already anchored at Chittagong port, which would raise the domestic stock.  \"I don't see any possibility of instability in local market. What we need is coordinated efforts to strongly monitor the market to ensure smooth supply and check price manipulation,\" he maintained.     The Indian government on Sunday banned onion export amid growing prices in their domestic market after production of the vegetable fell short of target due to flood caused from incessant rainfall, India Today reports.  India is the second largest onion producer and exporter in the world after China. In last couple of months, the Union government of India started tightening onion export by imposing several initiatives leading to price hikes.  Apart from this, the Indian government firstly withdrew 10% incentives on onion export in June and later, in mid-September, it re-fixed the vegetable's minimum export price per ton at $850. Reuters adds: The Indian government said exports would be prohibited with immediate effect. In several cities, prices of the essential kitchen item have doubled in recent weeks, prompting the government of the world's major onion exporter to take steps to calm prices ahead of key state elections later this year. In June, India withdrew 10% export incentives on onions after prices started to rise due to dwindling supplies from last year's harvest and a delay in planting of the summer-sown crop. Excessive rainfall in the second half of the monsoon season has led to crop damage in several states and stocks held by traders are insufficient to meet demand until the new crop arrives in end-October.  The government has also attempted to bring down prices by releasing more onions from federal buffer stocks, prices have remained fairly high. The ban has sent waves of panic in the country that the essential cooking commodity will be costlier.  Bangladesh consumes a higher quantity of onions than the country produces annually.  According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the country's onion production in 2016-17 fiscal year was 1.86 million tons against the demand for 2.4 million tons. The country has been facing a price spiral of the cooking ingredient since the Eid-ul-Azha celebrations early last August. In recent weeks, prices of the commodity escalated further. On August 17, the commerce ministry came up with the statement that the country had 1.6 million tons of onions in stock and claimed that the quantity of stock was enough to meet domestic demand.  Onion prices in the country jumped from Tk45 to Tk70 per kg on September 14, a day after India fixed minimum onions export price per ton at $850. Usually, the minimum export price of onion at international market stays in between $250 and $300. Yesterday evening, visiting Sukrabad kitchen market, Dhaka Tribune found per kilogram local onion selling for Tk80-90 while imported one for Tk70-80. On the other hand, super shop Shwapno at Panthapath was selling Indian onion at Tk74 per kilogram.  Bangladeshi is eighth on the Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) list of top ten countries producing onion.  China tops the FAO list with annual production of 24.28 million tons, followed by India 22.42 million tons, USA 3.73 million tons, Iran 2.37 million tons, Egypt 2.37 million tons, Russian Federation 2.13 million tons, Turkey 2.13 million tons, Bangladesh 1.86 million tons, Pakistan 1.83 million tons and The Netherlands 1.77 million tons."

The prime minister said this in replying to a supplementary raised by Jatiya Party lawmaker Kazi Feroz Rashid in the House during a question-answer session with Speaker Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury. The Leader of the House said her government has reintroduced an automatic signalling system in the capital which had almost gone out of order previously. She said traffic could be controlled manually in some areas, but there are allegations that manual traffic control is ineffective.    Sheikh Hasina said the biggest problem is that city commuters do not follow traffic rules. Referring to the notorious traffic jams in London and Washington, the Leader of the House said traffic jams are now a worldwide problem. She said people are buying more cars as the population's financial solvency is on the rise. In reply to a question from treasury bench member Didarul Alam, the premier said a number of projects were executed in the last 10 years through various ministries and departments, while many schemes are being implemented to ease traffic jams in the capital. If the schemes are implemented, she said, it is expected that Dhaka city will be free from traffic jams very soon. The Leader of the House also said her government is considering implementing projects similar to Dhaka, in Chittagong also, to reduce traffic jams in the port city."

      "headline": "Shariatpur pottery items are exported worldwide but the potters are not getting their fair share",
      "authors": "Kazi Nazrul Islam, Shariatpur",
      "text": "Although still producing earthen pots and utensils, lack of innovation and inability to use technology has held them back without ever reaching their full potential. In the small village of Kartikpur in Bhedarganj upazila of Shariatpur, a dynasty of potters, namely Pals and Kumars, have sustained the rare pottery industry in spite of the onslaught of technological advancements. Although still producing earthen pots and utensils, lack of innovation and inability to use technology has held them back without ever reaching their full potential. A host of potters in Kartikpur, namely Samir Pal, Pradip Pal, Sandip Pal, Gobind Pal, Jawahar Lal Pal and Uttam Pal, have a few factories set up in the region, where they create at least 3,000 items, including utensils, collectibles, and household products. These items include terracotta shades, tiles, candle stands, flower vases, coin boxes, wall coverings, wall pots, visiting card boxes and scores of other such products. Hundreds of workers from the neighbouring villages of Rambhadrapur and Dingamanik are also recruited in the factories, breaking an age-old tradition of only Pal community members working in the craft. A wide range of NGOs and other development agencies, namely Aarong, Caritas, Heed Bangladesh, Usha Handicrafts and more, usually purchase products from Kartikpur's potters, which are sold across the country, as well as internationally in countries spanning Europe, North America, the Middle East, and neighbouring countries like India. Every factory etches their logo on their products for authenticity. Work reportedly goes on throughout the year, with products ranging between 1.5 inches to 6 feet, costing anywhere between Tk5,000-30,000. Potters said they usually begin the process by gathering alluvial soil and mixing it with water. The clay mixture is then processed, using an imported filter from Germany, and kept on a special pan for 20 days. After 20 days, the excess water is drained and the clay formation that remains, known locally as mundu, is dried in the sun and mixed with very little water, forming the base for all their pottery items. They said that newly-formed pottery items and must be stored in closed rooms for 10-12 days before fire curing, after which they are colored as required and are then delivered to clients.  Previously, clients would market the products for the potters, but now they have taken over the marketing process themselves. Sandip Kumar Pal, a potter, said his family has been in the pottery business for generations. He was first inspired by an art faculty of then-Dhaka Art College in 1976 to showcase his products and to sell them in Dhaka and Chittagong. After gaining exposure, he was approached by several NGOs and other agencies, who signed contracts with him to market his products further and beyond Bangladesh. He also said the agencies are now showcasing his products in countries across the world, fetching foreign currency in the process. Uttam Kumar Pal, another potter, lamented that the production price of a night lamp is between Tk70-80, but sells for only Tk90-95. Even worse, when it is sent to Dhaka it sells for anywhere between Tk400-500. \"My factory also builds clay elephants 5-7ft long, which cost Tk15,000-20,000 to make,\" he added, \"but they sell in Dhaka for Tk30,000-40,000.\" Rangadip Pal lamented that at one point, he used to earn Tk60,000 a month from selling his pottery items, but now the scenario is not as rosy as before. He has gained a lot more in state honors and recognition than before, but his income has not been the same, as the revenue numbers are not good enough to replenish his working capital on a monthly basis. The potters sought government intervention for the sustainability of the industry. Enam Ahmed, deputy manager of the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) industry assistance centre in the district, acknowledged the contribution of these potters to the economy and culture. He added they will provide more technical support to the potters if they request their assistance, in terms of innovation, integrating technology into their trade, and financial support, if necessary."

The minister also said: \"The highways all over the country are in good shape at the moment, and better than any time prior - except the ones in flood-affected areas, which got damaged and are being repaired on an emergency basis.\" He made the statement at a press briefing held at the Secretariat on Monday. Quader blamed the cattle markets on roads and alongside highways as the main cause of congestion during Eid days. \"This is totally prohibited this time, and orders have been sent to the concerned authorities to take steps,\" the minister said. The two city corporations in Dhaka have also been requested to look after the matter, so roads do not get blocked for cattle markets, he added. Quader said to ensure smooth movement for homebound people, trucks, lorries and covered vans will be off the roads for three days before and after Eid.  Vehicles carrying medicine, export-oriented garments, goods and fuel will be outside the purview of the restrictions. The expected date for Eid-ul-Azha is August 12. The government will help the BGMEA to send garment workers back home by providing BRTC buses. The garment owners have been asked to give Eid holidays to workers in phases, so the last minute rush can be avoided, the minister added."

      "text": "This made over 200 families of low-lying areas homeless, locals and Water Development Board officials said. Padma River erosion took an alarming turn in the last few days, rendering over 200 families homeless in the Rajeswhawar union of the Chandpur Sadar upazila. The affected people of Rajarchar, Mander Bazar, Khaskandi, Lagnimararchar, and Dewan Bazar areas of the union said onrush of flood waters from upstream and heavy rain in the last few days  swelled Padma-Meghna, flooding the areas on its banks. This made over 200 families of low-lying areas homeless, locals and Water Development Board officials said. A large number of flood victims took shelter on nearby highlands including  Bashgari, Majherchar, Goal Nagar and Rayerchar. Hajrat Ali Bepari , chairman of the Rajeswhawar union said about a thousand other families, living close to the river, are passing their days in anxiety and fear of being devoured by the Padma in the near future. He also said the  erosion along vast areas on the river bank earlier washed away scores of homesteads, schools in the area. The situation had been deteriorated due to constant erosion, he added.  Erosion-hit Kamal, 40, and Akkel Ali, 35, of the union said they had been passing sleepless nights in fear of erosion. \"Where will we go? We are all poor people,\" said Akkel Ali. Gourango, Abul Kalam and Laila of Mander Bazar alleged that unplanned dredging had sped up the erosion.  Executive Engineer of Chandpur Water Development Board Abu Raihan said, \"During the monsoon season the water stream in the river is very high. There are strong vortex current flows. This place is very risky within the union.\" He said they have nothing to do as the union is situated in the char area.  "

      "text": "Without a collective effort, we cannot fight climate change The global temperature has been increasing since the pre-industrial era. This year, a widespread increase in temperatures continues to affect several parts of the world.  India witnessed its highest temperature in the northern part of the country. Some parts of the country experienced temperatures exceeding 45 degrees Celsius. On June 10, the highest temperature soared to 48C, which was highest temperature recorded in June.  On June 8, Kuwait recorded the highest temperature in the world, reaching 52.2C in the shadows and 63C under direct sunlight.  In early May, parts of Bangladesh experienced searing heat. The highest temperature recorded was 39.5C in Rajshahi. According to a World Bank report, \"South Asia's Hotspots: The Impact of Temperature and Precipitation Changes on Living standard,\" the average temperature of South Asia has increased and will continue to increase, with negative impacts on agriculture, health, and productivity.  The report said that the average temperature of Bangladesh is projected to increase by 1C to 1.5C by 2050. Chittagong has been selected as the most vulnerable to changes in average temperature and precipitation followed by Barisal and Dhaka divisions. One of the major impacts of rising temperature is rapid glacier retreat across countries.  Approximately, there are 150,000 glaciers in the world, excluding large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, which occupy about 200,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.  Over the last 40 years, the glaciers that have been lost or melted are equivalent to a layer of ice 70 feet thick.  The Tuyuksu glacier, 30km (or 18 miles) south of Kazakhstan's largest city Almaty, is melting at an unprecedented rate.  Millions of people rely on the melted waters of the Tuyuksu glacier. In the past 60 years, glaciers equivalent to more than half a mile have been lost.  Between 1986 and 2014, the glaciers of Bolivia have shrunk by 43%, according to new research. Researchers studied the satellite images produced by NASA of the Bolivia Cordillera Oriental and found out that the glaciers had decreased from 530sq-km to 300sq-km. In the long run, more than two million people will be in a dire situation in the dry season. The Himalayan region has lost 13% of its glaciers contributing to a loss of 443 billion tons of glacial ice over the past 40 years.  Himalayan glaciers are a vital source of water for eight countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, and India and capture 10% of the world's freshwater and support irrigation, energy, and the livelihoods of 750 million people living downstream.  Hence, further melting of the Himalayan glaciers will wreak havoc on bio-diversity and economic growth, and lead to food and water shortages of billions of people.  Climate vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh have primarily relied on devising climate adaptation approaches and strategies.  It is imperative for the developing countries to devise climate adaptation approaches in conjunction with mitigation measures to effectively address climate change.  The NGOs of different developing countries should also come forward in this regard. For example, by the end of the year 2019, BRAC's Climate Change Program (CCP) is planting around 200,000 trees in 65,000 households with the intention of sequestering carbon dioxide and enhancing livelihood options in three selected environmentally critical areas that include cyclone, flood, and drought-prone areas of Bangladesh. Also, different mitigation efforts through application of renewable energy technology will be undertaken in conjunction with climate adaptation approaches.  Developing countries such as Bangladesh contribute insignificant greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However, collective efforts may help to minimize the problem to some extent.  Tahmina Hadi is Deputy Manager, Knowledge Management, Climate Change Program (CCP), BRAC."

      "text": "Local farmers are worried about their yield as adverse weather conditions are threatening their crops   Farmers of Moulvibazar's Hakaluki, Kauadighi, and Hail haors, along with other haors, have started harvesting their Boro paddies--ahead of schedule--due to adverse weather conditions and heavy rain. Whenever thy sky turns black with thick clouds, the hearts of the local farmers fill with fear, and panic strikes among them, as they worry about whether they will be able to collect this year's harvest without losing some to unfavorable weather conditions. According to the Moulvibazar Agriculture Extension Department, farmers cultivated Boro paddy on 130,031 acres of land against the target 131,252 acres, in the whole district.  Expressing great worry, local farmers Selim Ahmad, Laikujjaman, and Kamruzzaman have already started harvesting as they fear that heavy rain and adverse weather conditions, will cause them extensive loses despite a bumper Boro yield in the area.  It has been observed that due to the heavy rain in the area, water levels of the local rivers and canals have risen to alarming heights. Hailstorms are also responsible for causing immense damage to the Boro yield of the district. Anfar Ali, Abdul Khaliq, Majnu Miah--all Boro paddy farmers from the Bhukshimoil union--told the reporter that they are fearing a flood this year, which could take away all of their yield and leave them empty-handed. \"We have started harvesting. Despite the pesticide attacks on our crops, we expected a good yield, but bad weather has forced us to worry a great deal about the harvest and profit.  \"We are very concerned\"  Commenting on the situation, Haor Bachao, Krishak Bachao, Krishi Bachao Sangram Parishad President Siraj Uddin Ahmed Badshah said: \"People of the haor region have been neglected for a very long time. The government has not implemented their promises to develop the haor areas.  He added: \"The government needs to come forward to save all the haors and rivers of the district, as well as the people living here, from the verge of destruction. Only then--along with natural resources here--the haor will live, agriculture will live, and the local farmers will be able to live.\" Kulaura Agriculture Officer Jagalul Haider said, \"The crop is good. Boro paddy harvesting began in a different way in the haor. Rice is rotten in many places. It will take another week for Boro. There is nothing to worry about. There will be some rain during Chaitra and Boishakh.\" Addressing the issue Moulvibazar Agriculture Extension Department Deputy Director Mohammad Shahjahan told Dhaka Tribune: \"The amount of rainfall in area till now has caused no damage to Boro paddy cultivation in the district. \"Farmers in Hakaluka have already started harvesting their crops. I hope the farmers will be able to collect their harvest without any interruption.  Responding to a question about farmers harvesting their crops ahead of schedule due to the fear of rain and adverse weather conditions, he said: \"Why would the farmers harvest partially-ripened paddy? No-one does that.   \"According to the correct scientific methods, farmers should harvest their cultivation when 80% of their whole yield is ripe, but our farmers wait even longer.\""

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "A 'Dead Stop' sign at rail bridges instruct train to stop first before crossing it at only 5km/h There are at least 13 rail bridges with \"Dead Stop\" signs on the 179km Sylhet-Akhaura route, posing a serious risk of accident to thousands of passengers. A \"Dead Stop\" sign at rail bridges instruct trains to stop first before crossing it at only 5km/h. Sources at Bangladesh Railway (East) said six trains - Parabat, Jayantika, Paharika, Udayan, Upaban and Kalni - carry 12,000 to 15,000 passengers every day over these dangerouse locations, reports UNB. Eight of these \"Dead Stops\" are situated in an 18km stretch from Sylhet to Mogla Bazar and five in 164km stretch from Mogla Bazar to Akhaura Bridge.  According to Railway Engineering's Sylhet branch, the 13 bridges with \"Dead Stop\" signs are - Samshernagar-Tilagon section's bridge No 200, Mogla Bazar-Maijgaon section's bridge No 43, 45 and 47, Kulaura-Baramchal section's bridge No 5 and 7, Satgaon-Sreemangal section's bridge No 141, Sreemangal-Vanugach section's bridge No 157, Maijgaon-Vater Bazar section's bridge No 29, and Montola-Itakhola section's bridge No 56. Sajib Kumar Malakar, assistant station manager of Sylhet railway station, said most of the bridges in this section are in risky condition. \"I cannot confirm whether the June 23 accident happened only because of the bridge's condition,\" he added. Five people were killed when six coaches of Dhaka-bound \"Upaban Express\" went off the rails on June 23 after a culvert over the Barochhara canal, near the Baramchal railway station, caved in. A coach of fertilizer-carrying BC Special Train from Shahjalal Fertilizer Factory derailed at Maijgaon station adjacent area on April 5. A coach of Jalalabad Express ran off the tracks at Mollikapur area under Fenchuganj upazila on May 16. An oil tanker train derailed at Kulaura in Moulvibazar in March 2018, snapping rail communication for two hours with other parts of the country. Trains on Sylhet-Chittagong and Dhaka-Sylhet routes were halted for 15 hours on February 23 last year due to derailment of Upaban Express at Satgaon in Sreemangal. In 2017, media reports highlighted the sorry state of Monu Bridge and how bamboo was used to repair it. The bridge remained that way since then and is currently included in the list of risky bridges. Bhoismara Rail Bridge between Sreemangal and Satgaon stations was damaged in a flash flood on April 5, 2017. The condition of the bridge has not improved yet. The same is the case with the rest of the bridges that are using \"Dead Stops\" to prevent accidents and loss of life. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on June 25 ordered the authorities concerned to conduct a survey of rail bridges and culverts across the country and repair those damaged or risky."

      "authors": "Masud Alam, Comilla",
      "text": "Farmers are acutely at risk of contracting sewage-borne diseases Comilla City Corporation's unplanned drainage system is turning farmland into water bodies; as polluted water is flooding hundreds of hectares of farmland. However, the city corporation has undertaken several mega projects to improve  rural infrastructure and increase opportunities for urbanization. Among these projects, one of them was undertaken to ensure a better sewerage system. However, the newly-constructed drainage system--in nine wards of Comilla City Corporation, including wards 23 and 24-- has brought sewage onto arable farmland, into open fields, and near educational institutions; mostly harming farmers in the process. Diseases--such as: cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and diarrhea--are emerging from these unhealthy conditions. Various crops, dwellings, schools, and other institutions, are in danger of becoming water-logged. Farmers complain that due to the negligence of the city corporation officials, the drains empty onto farmland instead of into rivers or canals. They claim that if the sewerage system had been carefully planned, the farmers would not be suffering. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said the drainage line empties onto farmland for various reasons; including that some cases filed against construction of the line, by people who do not want drains over their land, have left the process incomplete. He said: \"We are trying to find a solution to this problem.\" Visiting the area, this correspondent found that starting from the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) Comilla sector, the main drain pipe ends near Nandanpur Bishwaroad. Branches of drainpipes from other areas link to this main drain line, leading the sewage water away to places near farmlands, houses, and educational institutions in several areas, including: Gandhamati, Changini, Batabaria, and Rampur. The main drain line of the 23rd and 24th ward ends near Batabaria school, while Ghungaijhuri canal is only 2700 square feet away. If the drain had been extended by 2700 square feet--over the Changini-Nandanpur area to the canal--then the problems would not have existed. There are at least 30 government and non-government institutions in wards 23 and 24, including: the Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development (Bard), the BGB sector headquarters, Comilla University, a section of cantonment, a cadet college, Shalban Vihara, and the Buddhist Bihar Museum. Locals said if the unplanned sewerage system persists, these places will flood with polluted water. A farmer from Nandanpur, Abul Hashem said they are struggling to yield crops as contaminated water is flooding their arable farmland. They demand the pipeline be moved so that it ends at Ghungaijhuri canal, rather than on the farmland. Many people--including Md Ayub Ali, Md Lutfur Rahman, Zahid Hossain Mithu, and Md Abul Kalam--have complained that apart from harming the crops, farmers are also contracting skin diseases from the contaminated water. Dr Mosleh Uddin, president of Comilla Environment Movement, said: \"Due to the dirty and contaminated water of the drains, the farmers of those areas are [working] in extremely dangerous conditions. \"All the polluted water from the city is flowing onto agricultural land. As there is no way to dispose of the sewage--other than in the southern area of the city corporation--the area will be considered a recycling zone.\" He said it is possible to protect the agricultural land--at least in those areas--by creating a recycling project. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said: \"The work to extend the drainpipes, for them to empty into canals, is going ahead according to the master plan. It will be completed in phases. He also said alongside it, there is a plan to extend the main drain line of Nandanpur towards Ghungaijhuri canal. The mayor said: \"A man named Abdul Jalil from ward 24 has filed cases against seven city corporation officials, including me. Construction of drains in various places is hindered due to these problems.\""

      "text": "Parents dream of financial security, advancement  Unable to bear the cost of their children's education, many parents push them into work in the transport sector with dreams of financial security and advancement, employers, transport leaders and experts told Dhaka Tribune. While visiting the Amin Bazar, Gabtoli, Mohammadpur, Sutrapur, Jatrabari and Kachpur areas, it was seen that a significant number of children were employed on human haulers, as well as in automobile workshops and battery recharging shops. The employers claimed the children were employed as per the wishes of their parents.  Md Bulu, owner of Janani Engineering Workshop in Gabtoli, said although a number of children and teenagers were employed at the workshop, they were all well taken care of and trained in the necessary skills to succeed in the industry. \"Children who leave the workshop in search of better earnings often go astray and fall into drug addiction,\" he added. Meanwhile, a workshop owner in Amin Bazar and another in Sutrapur urged the government to set up a mechanism to measure and certify the skills of children trained in the workshops, to ease their progress in the industry. Challenges to addressing child labour in transport sector Experts said the informal nature of the transport sector made it difficult for the government to bring discipline to it. The Labour Act prohibits employing children under the age of 14 in hazardous work, but the act is not applicable for the informal sector. Save the Children Director (Child Rights Governance and Child Protection) Abdullah Al Mamun said listing the names of child labours would help monitor the rate of enrolment of children in the transport sector. He also said that among the 38 types of child labour categorized as hazardous, the transport sector offers some of the highest salaries. Education and Development Foundation (EDUCO) specialist (child labour) Afzal Kabir Khan said money was not the only reason many children were employed in the transport sector.   A number of parents push their children into child labour as they are unable to monitor them properly owing to their own jobs, he added. \"Many parents tell employers they cannot take care of their children as they both have jobs, and they wish for a successful person to take care of them so that they do not end up committing crimes and become addicted to drugs,\" Afzal said, mentioning that the parents harbour hopes of their children's quick advancement in life and starting their own business. During a presentation in April this year, INCIDIN Bangladesh Executive Director AKM Masud Ali said many boys were dropping out of school to join the workforce, as their parents were unable to bear the cost of education. The current state of child labour in Bangladesh Comparing data on child labour in the country in 2003 and 2013, from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and International Labour Organization (ILO) Bangladesh, Bangladesh Shishu Adhikar Forum (BSAF) said the number of child labourers decreased from 4.7 million to 1.7 million. However, the number of children employed in hazardous work only decreased from 1.3 million to 1.2 million over the same period.   Experts and transport workers said a number of initiatives to address child labour were taken after the first survey in 2003, but political turmoil from 2005-2008 hampered the initiatives.  The Awami League government once again prioritized child rights after coming to power in 2009, bringing significant improvement until 2013. However, the initiatives appear to have had little impact on the numbers of children in hazardous work, the experts added. Subsequently, the government made a list of 38 categories of hazardous work. Transport sector related work on the list includes truck, three-wheeler, and bus helpers, as well as automobile workshop and battery recharging shop workers. Although the categories have been made, the country is yet to collect data on how many children are employed in each category of hazardous work. BSAF said surveys show that about 25.4% of child labours work in transportation. Experts also said the number of underage bus helpers has decreased over time, and most child labourers are employed on three-wheelers and in workshops. Political willingness crucial to preventing child labour in transport sector EDUCO specialist Afzal Kabir Khan said the government has taken a number of initiatives to reduce child labour, but few of them were targeted at the transport sector. Save the Children's Abdullah Al Mamun said political willingness is crucial to preventing child labour in the transport sector, and some of the government's activities had raised questions over they had effectively rectified the convention related to minimum working age. The country has ratified 33 conventions related to child labour.  Mamun said the government has made education compulsory until grade 8, but a surprisingly large number of children still dropout before this point. A large number of them go into work in the transport sector. \"If the government can ensure that no one drops out before the age of 14 and implements courses on ICT training, the problem could have a good solution,\" he said, mentioning that children may be more eager to receive ICT training than traditional vocational training such as livestock rearing.  EDUCO specialist Afzal Kabir Khan said a special social safety net program is needed for child labourers.    Meanwhile, BSAF Director Abdus Sahid Mahmood pointed out that a lack of monitoring mechanisms and government willingness is making the child labour situation worse. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Chairman Kazi Reazul haque said monitoring child labour is a complex issue, and suggested the government form a Child Directorate to coordinate between government institutions and address child labour. The government reiterated its promise to eliminate child labour from the country by 2025 when adopting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). According to the law, a court can slap a maximum Tk5,000 fine on the employer and maximum Tk1,000 fine on parents for child employment.   The National Child Policy 2011 called for ensuring a child friendly environment at workplaces. Furthermore, it said that the cost of treatment from any accident at the workplace would be borne by the employers. "

In Natore, around 1,700 families in five unions of Lalpur upazila have become waterlogged as the Padma River continues to swell as a result of the opening of Farakka Barrage gates. Farmers in the affected areas are counting losses as their sugarcane fields and crop lands were inundated, causing immense sufferings to the residents of the areas. Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Ummul Banin Duti said: \"Three shelter homes were opened and the flood victims were asked to move there.\" The local administration said 500 flood-affected families in Lalpur union received 15kg rice each as relief. Assistant Engineer of Natore Water Development Board Al Asad said: \"The water level of Padma will continue to rise till Saturday.\" The flood situation in the upazila has been worsening for the last several days following a rise of the Padma water level. In Rajbari, water level of the Padma River was recorded at 12cm above the danger point at Goaland point in the district, and the water continually rose for the past 7 days.  As a result, three out of six ferry ghats in Daulatdia have been shut down due to strong currents in the river, said the Launch Ghat Supervisor Md Mofazzal. In Faridpur, the Padma has been continually rising since the past two days and remained above the danger mark yesterday. Faridpur Water Development Board (WDB) Executive Engineer Sultan Mahmud said: \"The water level in the Padma River here increased by 6cm and is flowing at 13cm above the danger point on Thursday.\" Due the current conditions, low-lying areas of the district were completely inundated causing severe distress to locals. Water somewhat receding in Pabna, Tangail  In Pabna, the Padma is flowing 14.33cm above the danger level at Pakshey Hardinge Bridge point as the water level has risen only by 0.8cm in last 24 hours, according to the hydrology department of WDB.

      "text": "Climate change has become a real threat to human beings with an unabated rise in global temperature, says the prime minister Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has underscored the \"will\" of the richer segments of societies - everywhere - to act ambitiously against climate change as there are enormous amount of science, technology, innovation and finance to address the problem. \"Let me also say we've enormous amount of science - technology - innovation - finance to address climate change. We only need the 'will' of the richer segments of societies - everywhere - to act ambitiously against climate change. We need to 'transform' our lifestyles, attitudes, systems, economies,\" she said on Saturday. She made the remarks while delivering her speech at a panel discussion on \"Climate Change as a Security Threat\" at the Conference Hall of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich, Germany. She said that climate change has become a real threat to human beings with an unabated rise in global temperature. About Bangladesh, the prime minister said increasing cyclones, storm, surge, and monsoon flooding challenge livelihood of its people. \"Our Bay of Bengal is increasingly getting acidic. Twenty percent of our people living along the coast and one third of Bangladesh's population eventually risk displacement with rising sea level although we have little contribution to global warming,\" she added. She said flooding erodes river banks during every monsoon while numerous families overnight become homeless and helpless. \"We lose thousands of acres of precious farmlands. And, let's note that our mighty rivers carry nearly one fourth of entire load of sediment carried by all the major river systems in the world every year.\"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina addresses a panel discussion on 'Climate Change as a Security Threat' at the Conference Hall of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich, Germany on Saturday, February 16, 2019 |Focus Bangla Hasina mentioned that the erratic pattern and intensity of rainfall and rising heat make farming difficult for Bangladesh's people. There are also reports of growing water stress during dry season. She said changing climate is taking its toll through the emergence of new pathogens. \"Diseases like malaria, which we successfully eradicated risks a comeback. Similar risks are evident in diseases in serials, livestock and poultry,\" she said, adding that temperature variation is challenging breeding of Bangladesh's national fish ilish. \"There are serious enough challenges for the precious gains we made in development.\" Displacement issue The prime minister said despite the fact and also the IPCC findings - a lot of people - including those that are conscious of climate change are yet to understand the climate displacement issue. She said South Asia, East Asia and the pacific experience most displacement in such contexts. All together, these regions at present have 8.6 million displaced people due to sudden-onset disasters mounting to 40% of the global total, and had new displacements in 2017. She mentioned that an estimated 46 million people were displaced in South Asia alone by sudden onset disasters during 2008 to 2013, though the actual number of people moving internally and across borders in South Asia is not known. \"It's anticipated that population movements in the context of disasters and climate change in South Asia, south East Asia and in the Indian Ocean rim are likely to increase over the next decades,\" Hasina apprehended. She said the challenges ahead are likely to be enormous, as a recent World Bank report -- titled \"Groundswell - Preparing for Internal Climate Migration\" -- projects that without concrete climate and development actions, in South Asia alone, more than 40 million people could be forced to move within their countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change. \"Bangladesh has been in the forefront in addressing coping mechanisms, in particular in agricultural sector. We've invented flood-resistant, salt- tolerant and drought- tolerant rice varieties.\" Collective good Replying to a question, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh military has been engaging with a lot of development activities as well as leading the disaster response in the country. They can also be engaged in early warning mechanisms. She said most of the UN members are engaged in the discourse of climate change in the multilateral fora. \"We need to keep the discussions and engagements up.\" Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable front line countries, she said, and added that her government has mainstreamed climate actions and disaster risks reduction in its national plan. \"We've investment of over 1% of our GDP to address climate change impacts. Moreover, $450 million has been allocated from our own sources for adoption and mitigation purposes.\" In 2012, Hasina recalled, she pledged in New York that Bangladesh will pursue a low-carbon development pathway as its commitment to \"collective good\" of tackling climate change. \"Our commitment to low carbon, climate resilient development is firm. We planned to move to 'carbon budgeting,' resilient industrialisation. We wish to decarbonise our manufacturing pathways.\" She said Bangladesh has installed around six million solar home systems, provided two million Improved Cooking Stoves among the poor, in spite of limitations the country allocated $385 million to the Bangladesh climate change trust fund for adaptation and mitigation. Director of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Hans Joachim chaired the panel discussion on Saturday, which was moderated by Chief Political Correspondent of Deutsche Welle Berlin Melinda Crane-Rohrs. Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs and International Trade of Kenya Monica Juma, Foreign Minister of Norway Ine Eriksen Soreide, US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Co-Executive Director of Greenpeace International Bunny McDiarmid were also present as panel discussants."

      "text": "Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit India in the first week of October There appears to be a sudden increase in the engagements between Bangladesh and India in many areas of mutual interest. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit India in the first week of October, while the Indian External Affairs Minister is most likely to pay his maiden visit to Bangladesh on August 20-21. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan is now in India to hold meetings with his counterpart Amit Shah. Railways Minister Md Nurul Islam Sujan will conclude his visit to India today (Thursday). After more than eight years, the Water Resources Secretary-level talks will be held today (Thursday) in Dhaka.  These engagements are taking place in a short period of time and there is no scope for anything different, diplomats concerned told Dhaka Tribune. In such broad relations between Dhaka and New Delhi, engagements in different sectors are quite natural, they said.  Prime Minister Hasina will attend the India Economic Summit of the World Economic Forum, 'Innovating for India: Strengthening South Asia, Impacting the World,' to be held in New Delhi on October 3-4, according to multiple government sources. Although she is going to attend a multilateral event, there will be bilateral meetings on the sidelines with Indian leadership . Also Read- PM Hasina to visit India in October At those meetings, Hasina will discuss bilateral issues concerning the Bangladesh-India relationship, including the water sharing of common rivers. Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar is scheduled to arrive in the capital on August 20 on a two-day trip, his first visit since he was appointed following the formation of the new Indian government led by Narendra Modi.  As this visit will be his first, it is unlikely to have any substantial outcome. Both sides will just touch upon pending issues and talk about ways to find solutions, and will explore new areas of cooperation. The timeframe for the prime minister's visit will be finalised during his visit. Home minister Khan was due to hold bilateral meetings with his Indian counterpart Amit Shah, also president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, at 7:30pm (Bangladesh time) on Wednesday, said a Bangladesh High Commission official in Delhi. The meeting was scheduled to take place in New Delhi at 4:30pm (Bangladesh time), but was delayed due to the death of former Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, he said, adding that the meeting was due to end at around 9:30pm followed by dinner. According to the agenda, the meeting would discuss issues related to putting a halt to the killing of innocent Bangladeshis along the border by the Indian Border Security Force, the smuggling of drugs, human trafficking, and militancy and terrorism, as these are common problems for both neighbours, said a senior official. About the national register of citizens (NRC) in Assam, he said the agenda doesn't list the issue, but if the issue is raised, Bangladesh will put forward its arguments emphasising that it's an internal affair of India. \"We are prepared (regarding NRC),\" he added. A Bangladeshi delegation, led by Railways Minister Sujan, discussed the ongoing railway projects under an Indian line of credit, including the expedited supply of 10 broad gauge and 10 metre gauge locomotives under Indian grants, and other issues. The delegation visiting India from August 3 to August 8, has also gathered experience on Indian railway's catering, ticketing, and operation of trains.  The first Water Resources Secretary-level meeting in more than eight and a half years will take place on Thursday at state guest house Meghna. Both sides will discuss various issues concerning 54 common rivers spanning the two countries, according to a top Water Resources Ministry official. \"Since the issue of the Teesta water sharing agreement is now at the prime minister level, we will not discuss it in detail. But obviously, we will touch upon it,\" he said, adding: \"We will place emphasis on other common rivers which are important too.\""

According to local sources, the erosion has taken a serious turn in Ghagha, Mollikpur, Shierbr, and Makrail areas along Madhumati's banks, and at 15 points including Kargati, Soto Kalia, and Suktogram, of Nabaganga banks. People  of the affected areas have accused the local Water Development Board (WDB) of its negligence as water from the rivers poured into houses in Kalia upazila. \"I have never seen Nabaganga rise so much in the last 35 years. My house was destroyed in a matter of seconds,\" said Ilias Ali, a resident of Sukragram. Many, who have lost their houses in river erosion, are living with their relatives, but some like Julmat Sheikh of Kalia upazila's Noragati village, have been staying under the open sky with their families as they have nowhere else to go. Locals accused the administration of doing little to help them. According to the locals, the WDB has failed to prevent recurring erosion because of their lackadaisical attitude.  Babra-Hachla Union Parishad Chairman Mojammel Hossain said the situation will be brought under control soon. The local contractors declined to perform the emergency work at the beginning of monsoon as WDB officials usually demand 10 percent bribe for such projects, alleged contractors. When contacted, WDB Executive Engineer Md Zulfikar Ali declined to comment over the issue. Meanwhile locals formed a human chain in the district yesterday protesting the  negligence of WDB. Among others, Monisha Ghosh, Profullo Barman, Liton Kumar Ghosh, Kalyani Barman, and Modon Ghosh of the affected areas spoke at the gathering. They urged the administration to take immediate steps to save the people from becoming victims of river erosion."

State Minister for Water Resources Zahid Faruk, attending as chief guest, said the Delta Plan will improvise Bangladesh's GDP and make it two digits, impacting economical-social development, said a press release. The discussion topics covered a wide range of water-related areas such as flood control, flood forecasting, irrigation and drainage, river morphology, salinity and sediment transport, coastal hydraulics, port, coast, and estuary management, environmental impact assessment, bridge hydraulics, and related infrastructure. According to Prof M Monowar Hossain, executive director of IWM, their mathematical model has played a significant role in solving various complex water problems in the country and abroad. \"IWM can play a significant role in implementing the Delta plan 2100 by using these methods,\" he suggested. Many government institutions including the Water Development Board, LGED, etc partners with IWM to verify the feasibility of many projects, he added. Within the coming 100 years, Bangladesh needs to fight against challenges such as temperature rising, heavy rainfall, flood, disintegration of river, drought, rising sea level caused by climate change. To combat these challenges; a long-term Delta Plan-2100 in Water Management and Flood Control is prepared for implementation by using limited resources all together in area-based planning will develop the economic state of Bangladesh."

The minister's original plans were to travel by rail, but the prevailing conditions forced the change. Railways Minister Nurul Islam Sujon was set to visit a stretch of the rail tracks along the Kurigram-Teesta route after a bridge near Tagraihat rail station partially sank into the soil after a flood in 2017. Kurigram Deputy Commissioner Sultana Parveen confirmed the visit. While Kurigram has experienced great strides in development under the Awami League government over the past 10 years, the negligence in the rail sector has caused consternation among locals. According to sources at the Kurigram rail station, only one train operates in the district under two separate names. Due to the shortage of trains and the poor state of tracks, commuting has become a tedious endeavour for locals. A 33km route takes nearly two hours by train now, a staggering example of the breakdown in infrastructure. The dependence on rail is mostly because of the low cost. The bus fare from Kurigram to Rangpur is Tk80, while it costs only Tk15 by rail. Hence, countless people from low-income groups opt for the train despite its many deficiencies. The local railway officials are also concerned about operating on the hazardous route, fully aware than an accident could befall any day. Advocate Pradip Kumar Roy, spokesperson of a Kurigram-based concerned citizens' group, said the people demand extensive overhaul of railway infrastructure and introduction of an intercity train between Chilmari and Dhaka popularly referred to as \"Bhawaiya Express.\""

      "text": "The park also known as the Gymkhana Lake is bordered on its south side by the Morgan School in Deobhog, from where it stretches till the Mobarak Shah Road With the ever rapid growth of urbanization taking place in Narayanganj, it is difficult for locals to catch a breath of fresh air in one of the oldest industrial districts of Bangladesh. Sheikh Russel Nagar Park is a nice change of pace where people come to enjoy the natural scenic beauty filled with vegetation and to open their lungs to the clean and fresh air free of all the pollution.The park also known as the Gymkhana Lake is bordered on its south side by the Morgan School in Deobhog, from where it stretches till the Mobarak Shah Road. With the implementation of vegetation projects and other conservational efforts around the previously abandoned waterbody, the Sheikh Russel Nagar Park has now transformed into a modern eco-park, befitting of a popular recreational spot. The park resembles Hatirjheel, the mid-town drainage and sanitation project of Dhaka. There are walkways, plants along the paths, street lights, and foot lights throughout the area.  There is a meeting pavilion for visitors in the park, a viewing deck, and a walking bridge. There are three beautiful docks surrounding the 410 metre long and 150 metre wide lake. The park also has an open theatre for social events and gatherings. A few other things like toilets for men and women, a swimming pool, a fountain, and a bicycle lane are now being made.  Narayanganj City Corporation began the construction work of this place in November, 2016. Even though construction is not yet complete, it has become popular among people. On Friday evenings, the park is packed with nature lovers and their families and friends.  According to the Local Government Engineering Department of Narayanganj, the area allocated for the Gymkhana Park is 38.5 acre. In July of 2016, Narayanganj City Corporation awarded Ratna Enterprise the tender for building the park on a budget of Tk7.74 Crore.  According to Narayanganj City Corporation, Tk19.14 crore has already been spent to complete the second phase of construction. A third phase of construction worth Tk16.96 crore will be initiated shortly. Locals have welcomed the park and said that people are at last being able to get some fresh air. They do not want the space to be turned into a trade centre or a space for the homeless. Abdur Rahman, general secretary of the Citizens Committee told Dhaka Tribune: \"The park is a blessing for the public. This place was once abandoned and became a hub for various shady activities. This conservation of the lake has made the area beautiful.\" Considering Narayanganj's polluted atmosphere this park will help keep the ecological balance, said AB Siddique, District secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA).  He said: \"There is no space for children to play and no space for plants and trees either in Narayanganj. This park will give the kids a place to spend their time and ensure a fresh environment for people.\" Considering all this, Narayanganj City Corporation has welcomed this new addition to the city."

      "text": "Commuters, farmers, businessmen suffered a lot though central transport leaders called off strike The bus strike that crippled the southern and other districts around the country for the past three days was called off early Thursday after the government assured considering their demands. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal announced that the strike was called off around 1am on Thursday, after a four-hour-long meeting among the representatives of the Bangladesh Truck-covered-van Goods Transport Owner-Worker Unity Council, Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association and Bangladesh Bus-Truck Owners Association at his residence in Dhanmondi. Despite the minister's assurance, bus owners and workers continued the strike in several parts of the country on Thursday. In Jamalpur, normal transportation has not yet resumed on every route till filing of this report around 6pm. The workers of the Dhanbari area were restricting the movement of vehicles on the Jamalpur-Dhaka route in the evening. On condition of anonymity, one of the Jamalpur Bus-Minibus Workers Union leaders said they had discussed the issue with the transport workers, and plying of passengers on the route would soon return to normal. In Dinajpur, normal transportation services have resumed on the Hili-Bogra route since Thursday morning after the workers were assured that their demands would be met. Confirming the resumption of transportation services, Public Relations Officer Sohrab Hossain of the Hili Land Port said transporting of goods was hampered for the last five days, but normalcy returned as soon as the workers pull out their strike. In Jhenaidah, commuters were forced to use banned three wheelers as hundreds of buses were left in a frozen state at the Kaliganj central bus terminal as the strike was still in force. In Khulna, the same situation prevailed as no inter-district buses left the terminal.  Khulna Motor Workers Union General Secretary Md Ziaur Rahman Mithu said the Bus Owners-Workers Federation presented a draft proposal to the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges for amending the newly enacted Road Transport Act. In Chuadanga, no passenger buses and goods-carriers left the city on Thursday.  Local vegetable farmers and businessmen expressed fear of huge financial losses as they could not dispatch their goods to different parts of the country. In Naogaon, transport workers have continued their strike for the fourth successive day. When asked why they were continuing the strike, local bus driver Sumon said: \"We did not enforce the strike after consultation with the central leaders. The problem is ours, so we will not call off the strike based on their decision.\" In Narail, commuters had to suffer a lot as no buses left the station. Moreover, they had to count extra money and time for commuting in three wheelers. In Satkhira, although bus services remained suspended, a limited number of trucks were seen plying on the roads. Businessmen of the Bhomra port had to pay twice the usual amount to ship their goods due to the scarcity of trucks. In Tangail, transportation services remained suspended for the second consecutive day on the Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway. Three wheelers were charging extra and long route commuters were opting for trains due to the scarcity of buses. In Kurigram, commuters had to face distress due to the continued strike. Even the transport workers assaulted the drivers of the three wheelers near the central bus terminal.  One of the workers said they will not allow the plying of any transport from the terminal. Later, a police team went to the spot to handle the situation, said Kurigram sadar police station Officer-in-Charge Mahfujur Rahman. In Benapole, government and businessmen of the area had to face huge losses due to the halt in transportation. Benapole Sonali Bank Manager Rakibul Islam said the Benapole Customs was deprived of collecting almost Tk100 crore revenue as the import of goods came to a halt due to the strike and the amount will increase if the strike continues. In Sherpur, transport workers stayed off the road for the fourth consecutive day, causing immense sufferings to commuters. No long route buses and goods-laden vehicles were seen plying on the roads since morning. In Faridpur, activities at the river port came to a halt as the district's truck workers refrained from transporting goods in accordance with the strike. The strike has left several thousand porters and labourers at the port without work while causing suffering to passengers and businessmen.

      "headline": "How climate change impacts Bangladesh's forests",
      "authors": "Md Rashed Chowdhury",
      "text": "Climate vulnerability depends not only on climate change, but also on how we develop Recently, the country experienced several major cyclones (eg Sidr and Aila), indicating that climate change is already impacting Bangladesh, and future effects would further aggravate this already bleak situation. Although there will be stronger tropical cyclones (TCs) observed in the Bay of Bengal, the total number is not expected to vary much. The stronger TCs will have particularly serious impacts on our nation's forestry. The country's coastal forests, such as mangroves and coastal plantations -- including charland plantations -- will be at the forefront of climate change. Sea rise due to high temperatures may submerge coastal forests and settlements, resulting in climate refugees. In the winter, high evapotranspiration combined with low water flow will increase the salinity of the forest soil and coastal waters. These conditions adversely affect freshwater-dependent flora and fauna, in particular, and forest productivity and biodiversity in general. This will eventually shift the character of forest boundaries and vegetation as the species that provide dense canopy cover will be replaced by non-woody shrubs and bushes.    Climate change projections Climate change may affect the country's forest eco-systems, which may result in negative consequences for forest-dependent communities. However, like any other natural systems, forest eco-systems are generally able to tolerate some level of climate change and so will continue to persist in the short term.  In the long term, whether their resilience will be sufficient enough to tolerate future anthropogenic climate change, is not known. Using climate change, including adaptation, as a driver to undertake activities with multiple benefits can catalyze progress in achieving a country's sustainable development goals. Many countries are starting to take action towards adapting to climate change. Such actions need to be expanded and integrated into national and sectoral planning to ensure that sustainable development and adaptation are mutually enhanced. Climate change-based information has the following advantages on a longer time-scale adaptation planning:   * Enhancing the scientific basis for decision-making for adaptations  * Strengthening methods and tools for the assessment of adaptation  * Education, training, and public awareness on adaptation, including for young people  * Individual and institutional capacity-building  * Technology development and transfer; and promotion of local coping strategies  * Appropriate legislation and regulatory frameworks, which promote adaptive-friendly action  * An adaptive planning process that covers different time-scales and levels (eg national, regional) and sectors  We have also experienced the impacts of inter-annual time-scale climate variability El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). From our review, we are fairly confident that ENSO variations will continue to occur and influence global climate in the coming decades and centuries. Therefore, climate change projection combined with a future ENSO event may provide improved perspective for capacity-building efforts in the forestry sector of Bangladesh. Also, future vulnerability depends not only on climate change, but also on development pathways. The implementation of adaptation needs to be integrated into national and international sustainable development priorities, as well as into national and sectoral development plans in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has already started to take concrete action towards adaptation to climate change. However, such action needs to be expanded and integrated into national and sectoral planning to ensure that sustainable development and adaptation are mutually enhanced. Recommendations for improvement Future trends are becoming clear, insofar as there is a need for more quantified spatial specific information, especially on future changes in extremes. This information is needed for improved flood and drought risk analyses. Therefore, we propose a climate change micro-level downscaling analysis of the future climate scenarios for Bangladesh. The output of this downscaling exercise is necessary for future water availability, food security, flood risk analyses, and forest eco-systems. The other major issue that needs to be seriously addressed is the inter-annual variability ENSO. One of the biggest El Nino related threats is forest fire. Forest fires threaten many ecologically-important areas, including habitats for rare species like tigers, and the smoke they give off is a serious threat to local people's health. Improved longer-term projection based on El Nino variability is essential for adapting to forest hazards in Bangladesh. It is also important to improve our understanding of emissions from fires in the region, which would ultimately help improve climate models. It will also contribute to initiatives like the United Nations Collaborative Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation program.  Md Rashed Chowdhury is the Principal Research Scientist of the Pacific ENSO Applications Climate Center (PEAC), University of Hawaii, USA."

      "authors": "Ali Asif Shawon",
      "text": "The prime minister is in the process of evaluating the first year of her running cabinet  A reshuffle in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's cabinet is likely to take place as soon as January, government high-ups have said.  The prime minister is now assessing the performances of all the cabinet members during the first year of the current government to this end, they added. \"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already discussed this issue with President Abdul Hamid,\" a top official from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) told Dhaka Tribune, requesting not to be named. \"The cabinet reshuffle was scheduled a day or two before the Awami League National Council, but was put on hold. It is most likely to take place during the first week of January.\" Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader, who just got re-elected as the general secretary of the ruling Awami League, has also hinted at the possibility of a reshuffle in the cabinet at the beginning of the new year.  \"There may be changes in the cabinet in the coming year,\" he told the media on Sunday. \"The ministers who did not perform as they were expected to in their respective offices may be reshuffled. Those who failed to do their job will be removed.\" Quader, party chief Sheikh Hasina's second-in-command, further said the prime minister is aiming at separating the roles of Awami League leaders within the party and the government.  That is the reason why seven influential leaders of the party, who are also members of the cabinet, are not a part of the new, partially announced Central Working Committee of the ruling party.  If the prime minister is adamant about separating the party from the government, then some ministers, who are also central leaders of the Awami League, may be gradually dropped from the cabinet.  When contacted on Monday, Abdur Rahman, a newly-elected presidium member of Awami League, told Dhaka Tribune: \"Awami League President Sheikh Hasina is the only authorized person who can tell why some of the ministers are dropped and some retained in the new central committee. I strongly believe that her decision will strengthen our party as well as our government.\"    According to speculations by some government high-ups, cabinet members like State Minister for Shipping Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Enamur Rahman, Deputy Minister for Water Resources AKM Enamul Hoque Shameem, and Deputy Minister for Education Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury Nowfel may get promoted during the reshuffle. Khalid, Enamul Hoque and Nowfel, who were organizing secretaries in the previous central committee of the Awami League, were dropped from the new committee.  The government sources further said some cabinet members' portfolios might be changed in the upcoming reshuffle, but the chances of cabinet members losing office is very slim as they have had only a year to work.  Requesting anonymity, a cabinet member recently told Dhaka Tribune that the Prime Minister's Office sought information on the cabinet members' performance over the past one year. \"The PMO issued a letter asking us how many days each of the cabinet members had spent abroad last year,\" the cabinet member said. \"We think the PMO is working on our ACR as January 7 is this cabinet's first anniversary.\" Winning the December 30 general election last year, the new, 46-member strong cabinet, led by Awami League President Sheikh Hasina, was sworn in on January 7 this year, with Hasina as the prime minister for the third consecutive term.  Five months later, on May 19, State Minister Murad Hassan was moved to the Ministry of Information from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The prime minister also shuffled personnel at the Ministries of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives, and the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology. On July 13, the prime minister promoted State Minister for Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment Imran Ahmad to the rank of minister. On the same day, she appointed Fazilatun Nessa Indira as the state minister for women and children affairs. "

      "authors": "Reaz Ahmad",
      "text": "The government's market interventions have been largely ineffective Bangladesh's resilient farmers recouped the 2017 devastating flood-induced crop damages by growing more rice over the last few growing seasons including the current Boro. This high rice output brings much relief to the government that spent millions of Taka importing a record four million tons of rice in 2017-18 through public and private channels. But much to the misery of growers, the prices that they are being offered for their produces in the current marketing season is non-commensurate to their production costs.   For the past one week - news and pictures of aggrieved farmers taking to the streets demanding fair price for rice and different socio-cultural and student groups rallying supports for the same cause hogged the media attention big time and deservedly so.   Yesterday too, farmers blocked a highway in rice-rich northern region of Rangpur - spreading paddy grains on the road - demanding the government to purchase paddy directly from farms, and ensure a fair price.   Production projection Bangladesh's rice production is expected to increase for the second straight year in a row, thanks to good weather and increased yield due to continuing cultivation of hybrid and high-yielding varieties (HYV). Following the crop loss in 2017 due to Haor zone's flood and crop diseases, the country's rice growers bounced back with a higher production - nearly 35 million tons in 2018-19 making the country self reliant in staple production again.    According to the Ministry of Food, country's current stock of rice in public granaries is over one million tons, well above the comfortable food safety threshold level.   Farmers getting poor price  Polash Kanti Nath heads a farmers' organization goes by the name - Krishak Sangram Parishad (KSP).   He said, \"It costs around Tk700-Tk 800 to produce a maund of paddy but we can only sell it for Tk400. Even buyers are few in number.\" Another farmer Momtaj Uddin said: \"The government has promised to buy paddy directly from farmers, but we do not see that happening here. We are not getting a fair price for the paddy, so we are protesting.\"  And in Tangail, some college students came forward to help a local paddy farmer Abdul Malek harvest his crops after he set some of it on fire, protesting the steep fall in paddy prices and after not being able to afford the high labour costs for harvesting the paddy. Shahidul Islam runs a rice mill in Kushtia's Khwajanagar, one of the largest wholesale rice markets in the country. Talking to this correspondent over phone yesterday, Shahidul acknowledged that millers and traders are offering Boro farmers much lower a price this year compared to last year's prices. He said millers have already enough carryover rice in their stock and that's why there is no urgency to buy rice from the growers.  Lukewarm public procurement  On March 31 this year the government decided to procure over a million tons of paddy and rice from the farmers at a good price offers of Tk. 26 and Tk. 36 a kg respectively. Government's food department was supposed to provide the farmers with this price support from April 25 but eventually the public grain procurement process kicked start much later only in mid-May. Dr Akhter Ahmed of the Washington-based food policy think-tank International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) told Dhaka Tribune that government's late entry into the market and buying rice from traders and millers instead of farmers would not help offset the situation. He wondered if the government in West Bengal, India can buy paddy directly from the farmers why can't be it possible in Bangladesh.  Anwar Faruque, who served the agriculture ministry in Bangladesh for many years prior retiring as the ministry secretary, told this correspondent that with a paltry volume of public procurement the food department would not be able to make much impact on rice pricing in the market. \"Why shouldn't government procure three million tons of rice from farmers and give them the price support? If the public granaries suffer from space constraint, the government can always keep the procured rice in hired private godowns.\" Unwise tariff regime    Market is glutted with cheaper imported rice because of zero tariff still in place on rice import, said Faruque adding that \"Government said we lost 1.9 million tons of rice in Haor flood in 2017 and import tariff was cut from a whopping 28 percent to zero.\"  But after periodic reviews, he thinks, the government should have re-imposed tariffs on rice import thereby, giving much required protection to domestic rice growers.  Will exporting rice ease the solution? Agriculture Minister Dr Abdur Razzque told reporters yesterday that government would export rice to ease the situation. He said government is now in a position to even export over a million tons of rice. Dr Akhter considers entering into the rice export market is not that easy and such an intervention even if is conceived now its benefit would not trickle down to the farmers rather, it would only benefit the big millers and traders - who had purchased rice from farmers at a cheap rate and hoarded that for quite some time to make a windfall.  \"Countries like Thailand and Vietnam developed a place for them in a very competitive rice export market over a period of time. It'll not be so easy for Bangladesh to make a sudden inroad into that global rice market,\" explained Dr Akhter. If in tobacco, why not in rice? An expert, who has been following increasing instability in rice pricing in disfavor of paddy growers in Bangladesh, told Dhaka Tribune each year government facilitates fixing procurement price of tobacco from farmers for private tobacco companies.  \"Why can't it do it for the rice growers? It's understandable government will not be able to buy all 35 million tons of rice that Bangladeshi farmers grow a year but the least government can do is dictate the market by fixing floor price for rice for private buyers and sellers,\" said the expert, who works for an organization where he is not authorized to speak to the press on record. All the other experts that t Dhaka Tribune talked to were also of the view that the government needs to streamline its paddy procurement process so that farmers and not traders are benefited and it has to reign in the profit-mongering middlemen, millers who made most of the paddy profits depriving the principal stakeholder - the farmers."

As there is currently a fishing ban on our territorial waters and Signal 5 was hoisted at maritime ports for the last five days, it can be assumed that the boat did not capsize in our waters,\" he added. The dead bodies have been sent to Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital for autopsy.  \"The two rescued alive are receiving treatment at Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital.

State Minister of Foreign Affairs M Shahriar Alam informed of Bangladesh's decision to Japanese State Minister for Foreign Affairs Toshiko Abe during a meeting held on the sidelines of the 4th Indian Ocean Conference, at Male in Maldives, on Wednesday. Toshiko Abe expressed her country's gratitude to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for meeting all the family members of the Japanese victims of the terror attack. Shahriar thanked Japan for facilitating the very fruitful visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina earlier in May this year.  Referring to the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed last month in Tokyo, he expressed gratitude to the Japanese government for listing Bangladesh as a country for skilled migration.  It was highlighted that both governments will work closely to deliver on the MoU as per the agreement.  Shahriar Alam updated his Japanese counterpart on the latest status of over 1.1 million Rohingyas sheltered by Bangladesh, including Bangladesh's concerns about security at the camps. He underscored that Bangladesh needs the support of Japan for the repatriation of the Rohingyas safely and with dignity to Myanmar, and for their settlement at Bhashan Char. Toshiko Abe mentioned that Japan is particularly happy that Bangladesh has decided to name metro rail stations after the names of the Holey Artisan victims.  Both sides agreed on timely implementation of ODA, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here. Shahriar called for Japanese support for building a new railway bridge over the Jamuna River. The Japanese side reassured their support and cooperation to build the railway bridge.  The State Minister led the Bangladesh delegation to the 4th Indian Ocean Conference organized by India Foundation in association with the government of the Maldives and S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore from 3-4 September. He is also a member of the IOC Organizing Committee.  The theme of IOC 2019 is \"Securing the Indian Ocean Region: Traditional and Non-Traditional Challenges.\""

The ambassador made the request when he made a courtesy call on the premier at Ganabhaban in Dhaka on Wednesday, said PM's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim, reports BSS. Recalling the long history and close relations between the two countries, Malikzad said his country is keen to promote trade and business relations with Bangladesh. Afghanistan was one of the first countries that recognized Bangladesh after its independence, he said, appreciating Bangladesh's economic progress and graduation from the LDC to the status of developing countries. Welcoming the newly appointed Afghan Ambassador in Dhaka, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stressed strengthening the trade relations between Dhaka and Kabul, saying that Bangladesh gives value to relations with its neighbours. Bangladesh imports a huge amount of dry foods from Afghanistan every year and Afghanistan can import high quality medicine from Bangladesh, she said. Congratulating Sheikh Hasina for her party's victory in the last general election, the Afghan envoy underscored the need for strengthening cooperation between the two countries, especially between its chambers of commerce. Sheikh Hasina said people voted for her party as they benefit when the Awami League comes to power. She said her government is running the country with commitment to meet the basic needs of people, as dreamt by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In this regard, the prime minister highlighted her government's social safety net program for the marginalized people, saying financial support is being provided for promotion of education of poor families and distressed people under the program. Sheikh Hasina also drew a line between the economic progress of Bangladesh and Pakistan after the independence.  \"After the independence, the exchange rate of Bangladeshi Taka and Pakistani Rupee was 1.56 and 1.00. Now the rate is 1.00 and 1.66,\" she said. The Afghan envoy informed the prime minister that the two countries are waiting to sign five memorandums of understanding (MoU). He also informed the prime minister that democracy in his country is progressing and expressed his willingness to import more pharmaceutical items from Bangladesh. Principal Secretary Md Nojibur Rahman and PMO Secretary Sajjadul Hasan were also present."

As part of the demonstration, the Uber riders also staged a sit-in procession in the afternoon. The agitating riders alleged that the ride-sharing company suddenly decided to trim its base fare from Tk 30 to Tk 25 and per kilometer fare from Tk 12 to Tk 10. During the demonstration, which continued for around two hours from 11am in front of the Uber office, the aggrieved riders chanted slogans against the fare-cut and asked the authorities concerned to withdraw the decision. Md Russel, an Uber rider, told the Dhaka Tribune that the Uber authorities suddenly reduced the base fare by Tk 5 and kilometre fare by Tk 2. \"When we approached the local office about the reduction, they said that they have nothing to do as it was decided centrally,\" said the Uber rider. Threatening to go on tougher movement if the decision is not repelled, the riders said they would boycott the ride-sharing platform, if necessary.   The Uber riders announced to stage demonstrations in the Agrabad area on Wednesday.      At present, around 15,000 Uber riders are operating the port city."

      "text": "Ershad's political genius was unquestionable This is not an homage to late President Ershad, nor an appraisal of him, but a paean to his political genius that kept Bangladesh enchanted for the last four decades. His politics was of a kind that distilled the best of Kautilya in personal dealings and Machiavelli in politics. His politics, which was a potpourri of wheeling and dealing, bargaining, brinkmanship, and dumbfounding somersaults, kept all entertained. But above all, these essential Ershadian qualities also were reasons for his survival, politically that is, until the last day of his life. He survived his nine years as president, and years of political high-rolling thereafter, despite charges of criminal conduct including political killing, and imprisonment due to his unparalleled swashbuckling as a politician. No stigma would stick to him because he wore a Teflon suit all along.   I knew late General HM Ershad a little more than most other Bangladeshis, because of my job with the government as a deputy commissioner in the mid-70s. Not because my job required to work with him -- he was second to the strongman at that time, General Ziaur Rahman. But Ershad did not interject himself in the life of a civilian administrator such as me because the role he was given by General Zia. As chief of general staff in the early period of martial law in Bangladesh (1975-77), General Ershad was also made chairman of National Security Cell -- an agency that was entrusted with the task of prosecuting people under martial law (among other tasks).  My interaction with General Ershad that time was as head of the district coordination committee of martial law cases in Noakhali, which included the local police chief, an army representative with the rank of a major, and myself as deputy commissioner. Our job was to review cases filed under martial law and recommend those for prosecution to the National Security Cell. In my years of heading this district body, I never had to meet Ershad, nor had I any conversation with him.  I only received memos and letters signed by him in his capacity as NSC chief. In fact, I did not even know how Ershad looked. We knew of him, but never knew him. I never received even a phone call from him.  My first person-to-person contact with him was for a completely unexpected reason, over phone in Chittagong. The reason was installation of flood lights in Chittagong stadium, a fancy project that time that General Zia had asked me to undertake. The project was a pet issue with General Zia, who had this obsession with keeping people busy at night with sports, after lighting up Dhaka stadium at a huge cost. (Rumour had it at that time that flood lighting of Dhaka Stadium was spearheaded by General Ershad, who was also head of the National Sports Authority). When President Zia had asked me (as deputy commissioner I was the president of District Sports Association) that I initiate a project to similarly install flood lights in Chittagong Stadium, I initially demurred by saying that the cost would be prohibitive, and unlike Dhaka there were very few sporting clubs in Chittagong which could draw spectators for nightly sports. But General Zia was adamant. The project was drawn mainly to please President Zia with little hope of it ever getting funded because Chittagong Sports Association was a financially indigent entity. There was also no way I could ask for government funds for such a luxury project which the engineers estimated would cost around Tk5 crore (1979-80).   I did not move with the project anywhere when I received a phone call from General Ershad. I first thought the call was related to his visits to Chittagong Hill Tracts. But I was surprised. After his usual polite greetings, he broke into the subject. \"I understand you are going to install flood lights in Chittagong stadium.\"  Before I could proceed with my query as to how he came to know about this, Ershad said that he knew of a very well-qualified engineering company which had installed flood lights in Dhaka stadium, and he would be pleased if I could consider the firm for the Chittagong project.  He also added that the firm people would like to meet with me. My surprise knew no bounds. Here I was with what I considered to be a dead-on arrival project with nary the sign of a taka, Ershad was asking me to award the project to his nominee!   After I recovered myself from the shock, I replied to Ershad that I was glad he was showing some interest in the project because I could then rely on him to lobby the president for some funds. It was now Ershad's turn to be surprised. \"What, you have no funds and you are going with the project?\" he asked. I replied politely that we had not invited tenders for the project for that reason. To my astonishment, Ershad did not pursue the subject anymore. He ended his conversation then and there. But my surprise did not end there. Immediately after the phone conversation had ended, my assistant told me that a party from Dhaka was waiting outside to see me with a message from General Ershad. I immediately knew which party it could be, but what surprised me was the timing. Was the party waiting on queue?  The party consisted of three people. Two were contractors who had installed the floodlighting in Dhaka. Third was a banker who was rumoured to be a go-between. I received the party politely, but again had to shock them with the news of no funds. They left disappointed. General Ershad never took up the subject with me again. But the actual floodlighting of Chittagong Stadium did happen, much after Zia's death when Ershad became president. He knew when to stop, and when to start again.  My second person-to-person interaction with Ershad was a couple of years later, in May 1981, three weeks before Zia's assassination. The occasion was the so-called annual air-sea battle among the three branches of armed forces. Even though the event was strictly military, President Zia had chosen to invite a gaggle of his cabinet members including then Prime Minister Shah Azizur Rahman to the event causing a housing nightmare for the administration.  The local administration had to find lodging for about a dozen ministers and the prime minister in short notice in whatever rest houses and motels that were available since the prime accommodations including the Circuit House were taken over by the army for the president, chief of staff, and other military top brasses. It was the morning after I had my second person to person conversation with General Ershad when I went to the Circuit House to escort the president to the airport (as protocol required). While I was waiting in the lounge for the president, General Ershad presented himself there and took me aside. He told me that he had heard that the PM was rather upset by the lodging arrangement as though it was a surprise to him.  I was not sure if Ershad was mocking or really serious. \"Yes of course,\" I replied adding that the PM expected to be accommodated in the Circuit House. I wanted to further add the fact of Shah Aziz not being invited to the dinner hosted by Ershad last night, but I did not. Ershad was unruffled. He smiled and said in his suave manner: \"Please handle it, DC sahib. I know you can do it.\" He said in a way that the problem was mine and not his.  It was a district administration issue. He left immediately thereafter with his army colleagues, giving me another \"you can do it\" wink. He treated the subject like it had never happened.  I did not have to do anything to placate Shah Aziz because I knew that Shah Aziz knew the administration had nothing to do with the affront meted out to him and his colleagues. The only person he could complain to was the president himself, and Shah Aziz knew that it would be to no avail. Ershad also knew well that President Zia valued his relationship with the top brasses of the armed forces more than his kitchen cabinet.  General Ershad had perfected the art of concealing his true feelings on a topic or a person to a degree that his interlocutor could never guess his mind. He could be very angry, yet never show it. He could be totally equivocating and yet appear to be honest or even naive. That is why he could survive politically for years. Ziauddin Choudhury has worked in the higher civil service of Bangladesh early in his career, and later for the World Bank in the US."

      "text": "'So, the students who were trapped used the windows to escape with help from locals and fire service officials'  A fire which broke out at a campus of the Daffodil Polytechnic Institute in Dhaka's Kalabagan has exposed the building's lack of fire safety protocols which put hundreds of its students' lives at risk. The small scale fire that caused no casualties forced the students use windows to climb down from the second and third floor of the building with the help of outsiders who extended their helping hands with bamboos. Later, firefighters joined the locals and rescued the rest of the students trapped inside. The students could have suffocated from toxic fumes if the help had not come on time as there were no fire escapes in the building except for a narrow staircase. The fire originated from an electric short circuit around 11am and the flames were doused after one and a half hours, said Fire Service and Civil Defence officials. Abdullah Al Mamun, a fireman of the Mohammadpur Fire Station, said Daffodil Polytechnic Institute never conducted any fire drills to create awareness in case of a fire emergency. Seeking anonymity, a student of the Daffodil Polytechnic Institute, said: \"There aren't any emergency exits in our campus. As the fire originated from the main switch board installed beside the main staircase on the ground flood, the smoke quickly travelled up and prevented students from getting down. So, the students who were trapped used the windows to escape with help from locals and fire service officials.\"   \"We had found only one fire extinguisher for each floor, but when we tried to use them, we found them to be defective.\"  \"If a bigger fire breaks out in the future, there will be massive casualties and damages. The administration should take necessary fire safety measures as soon as possible,\" he added. According to Arif Miah, an office staff of the campus, the institution uses four floors of this five storey building and every floor is 2,500 square feet. Around 350 students attend classes regularly in this campus. Many students were in their classes when the fire broke out. Arif showed this correspondent five fire extinguishers which were all defective and lying beside the main switch board, where the fire had originated.  According to the Fire Service and Civil Defence, the building safety protocol dictates that at least two fire extinguishers have to be installed for every 1,000 square feet of a floor besides emergency exits and other fire safety equipment. At least one fire drill every month is mandatory for educational establishments, says the Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC). When contacted, the administrative office refused to make any statement regarding this matter."

The eviction drive will continue for the next three months. Mayor of Khulna City Corporation (KCC) Talukder Abdul Khaleque started the drive by evicting an illegal factory in Gallyamari area. During the drive, the KCC Mayor asked the person concerned to remove all listed illegal structures, and release government lands, saying the illegal land grabbers must leave the lands. Many rivers, canals, and water bodies in the region were occupied by land grabbers. Eviction drive  began to free rivers, canals, and water bodies from land grabbers for ensuring normal flow of water,  said deputy commissioner Md Helal Hossain.

The idea of moving Indonesia's seat of government from an urban conglomeration of nearly 30 million people with some of the world's worst traffic jams has stretched on for decades. Low-lying Jakarta is also prone to annual flooding and is one of the world's fastest sinking cities due to excessive groundwater extraction. Indonesia wants to move the capital from sinking Jakarta https://t.co/g0ejcImWZL On Monday, urban planning minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said the long-stalled relocation plan won approval from President Joko Widodo who favoured moving the capital away from Indonesia's most populous Java island. Jakarta, which suffers billions of dollars in annual congestion-and-flood linked economic losses, would remain the country's financial hub. \"Widodo decided on the option to relocate the capital,\" Brodjonegoro said after a cabinet meeting.  In a statement before the meeting, Widodo expressed support for the idea, but he did not give an alternate location or a timeline for any move. \"In the future, would Jakarta be able to carry the double burden of being both the centre of government and its business centre?\" he asked in the statement. \"If we prepare well from the very beginning, this great relocation idea could be realised,\" he added. During his re-election campaign, Widodo pledged to spread economic growth more evenly in the nation of 260 million.  He won a second term this month, according to unofficial poll results.  Local media have reported that a possible new capital would be Palangkaraya city on the island of Borneo."

      "authors": "Fahim Reza Shovon",
      "text": "VC says sorry for 'lacking' in his role; protest to continue Amid growing protests by students demanding justice for Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology's (Buet) slain student Abrar Fahad, the university authorities have banned student politics on the campus. This apart, Buet also suspended 19 of its students who have been named in the Abrar murder case. Buet Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Saiful Islam announced the decisions around 5:45pm yesterday, nearly four hours after the 2pm deadline the agitating students set for him to meet them, clarifying his stance on a 10-point demand. The meeting between Buet authorities led by the VC, and the protesters started at Buet auditorium around 5:30pm, on the fifth day of demonstrations that erupted after several now-expelled Buet Chhatra League leaders killed Abrar Fahad in the early hours on Monday. Earlier yesterday, several hundred students of the university gathered in front of Buet Shaheed Minar at 11am with placards, and chanted different slogans demanding capital punishment for Abrar's killers.  On Thursday afternoon, the students placing a charter of 10 demands threatened to lock down all the academic, and administrative buildings of the university, if the VC failed to meet them by 2pm on Friday.   The protesters, at that time, clarified that they demanded the banning of political party-affiliated student organizations on campus, not student politics as a whole. Several hours later, the VC agreed to sit with them to decide on their demands.  Abrar, a second year student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of Buet, was beaten to death at Sher-e-Bangla Hall. The killers-- all Buet students--beat him for his alleged involvement with Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, an unsubstantiated claim which is yet to be proven. VC says sorry for his role  During the meeting, the VC apologized to the students for \"lacking\" in the role he should have played immediately after the incident.  \"I did have some shortcomings. I beg apology,\" said the VC adding: \"I am extremely sorry as I could not appear on time.\" VC Saiful went on saying that the Buet authorities will bear all the expenses needed to run the murder case, as well as to compensate the victim's family.  Promising to take necessary measures to stop ragging by the students, he assured that the university authorities will write to the government seeking speedy trial of the killers.  The VC has been drawing the protesters' wrath since he did not show up on the campus until after 5pm on Tuesday, nearly 40 hours after Abrar was reported dead.  His finally made a public appearance, and issued a statement around 5:30pm that day, after the students set a 5pm deadline.  However, sources at his office claimed that the VC failed to make public appearance due to illness.  Protesters also demanded his resignation.  Criticism over the matter did not just stop there. The Awami League-led 14-party alliance, too, yesterday lashed out at him. The alliance's spokesperson Mohammed Nasim at a meeting in Dhaka said: \"We're hurt over the delay by Buet VC in reaching there (Sher-e-Bangla Hall). This is so unfortunate, something we cannot expect from a VC.\"  Protests to continue as campus still 'unsafe' Despite assurance from the authorities regarding meeting their demands, protesters announced to keep protesting on campus until the entire campus becomes safe for all students.  According to them, leaders and activists of some student fronts including Chhatra League are still residing at different dormitories of Buet.  For this reason, they did not even retreat from their decision of boycotting Buet admission test slated for October 14. The murder sparked protests not only in a number of higher educational institutions in Dhaka, but also in many universities, cities, and divisional headquarters across the country.  Abrar, a second year student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of the university, was beaten to death by some activists, and leaders of Bangladesh Chhatra League's Buet unit inside the university's Sher-e-Bangla Hall in the early hours of Monday. Abrar's father filed a murder case against 19 people-- all Buet students--with Chawkbazar police station on Monday evening.  Until yesterday evening, 18 accused were arrested. Of them, 17 have been placed on remand for different periods."

RAB said the animals were being used to extort foreign tourists and locals. Shaheen , 25 and Helal 22, were using the elephants to extort money from people. They were each sentenced to two years of imprisonment. Confirming the matter, RAB Executive Magistrate Sarwar Alam said: \"The elephants have been handed over to the Bangladesh National Zoo at Mirpur.\" RAB said Shaheen and Helal were using the animals to block the road in front of Karwan Bazar Hotel Super Star. The duo directed the elephants to put the trunks inside vehicles of foreign tourists in an attempt to scare them into handing over money. \"They were intimidating all the passengers. Passengers of other vehicles in the area were told to keep the money ready for collection beforehand\" the RAB executive magistrate said. At one point the foreign tourists called the police. Sarwar Alam said he and RAB-2 Superintendent of Police Muhammad Mohiuddin Faruqi instructed the elephant riders to leave the road.  However, they refused to cooperate. The elephant riders entered Karwan Bazar on the backs of the elephants; they damaged four private cars. The RAB followed them, instructing them to stop, but they would not heed the warnings and kept proceeding. They were finally detained from the Hatirjheel-Modhubagh area. \"After interrogating them we found out they have been roaming different parts of the capital for a long time extorting money from people,\" Sarwar Alam said."

      "headline": "The political philosophy of Bangabandhu",
      "authors": "Dr Rounaq Jahan",
      "text": "A leader who was always one with the people For our generation who witnessed the birth of Bangladesh, it is a daunting task to express in words the unique role played by the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman in the creation of the new state. It is even more challenging to analyze the political ideas underpinning his life's work. Whenever I think of Bangabandhu I first remember those exciting and memorable days of March 1971.  I consider myself to be very lucky that I was able to witness the events of March 1971 and Bangabandhu's role in creating history. Very few people are fortunate enough to see the making of history. I witnessed the transformation of our movement for autonomy into our struggle for independence. I witnessed how the main actor of this historic transformation, Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman, realized an impossible dream. There have been leaders in other countries who led their nations. But few could create history. Bangabandhu was one such rare grand actor of history. It is unfortunate that even after 48 years of our independence and 43 years after his assassination there is no well-researched comprehensive biography of Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman. Fortunately two recent books, based on his personal diaries, have been published which can serve as original source that help us understand his ideals and political philosophy.  The first book, The Unfinished Memoirs, published in 2012, throws light on his childhood, and early political life. Though The Unfinished Memoirs does not include events after the late 1950s it still illuminates his political thoughts very clearly.    The second book, Karagarer Rojnamcha (prison diaries) which was published in 2017, is based on his diaries when he was in prison after he launched the six point movement in 1966. Here again his political thoughts are made very clear. He discusses at length the different methods of suppression of people's movements pursued by an autocratic state. He highlights the importance of fundamental civil and political rights, particularly the need for ensuring freedom of expressions for sustaining democracy. In this article I quote extensively from his writings so that we can hear his own voice. To understand his political philosophy we should always keep in mind that Bangabandhu spent most of his life as a political player outside state power. He struggled against colonial and undemocratic state power, first against the British and later against the Pakistan state to establish the economic, political, and cultural rights of the Bengalees.  He exercised state power only for a limited period of time -- barely three and a half years after independence. His political discourse, as illustrated in these two books, is that of a leader fighting authoritarian state power, not that of a leader who was using state power to govern a country.  One of the remarkable features of his political life was his transformation from an ordinary rank and file worker of a political party to an unparalleled leader of millions of people. Bangabandhu possessed outstanding organizational capacity; at the same time he was a great orator. Generally we do not find such a combination of qualities in one leader.  In his Unfinished Memoirs Bangabandhu notes that he was more interested in party organizational work than in discussing theoretical and ideological issues. Though he was not a political theoretician, Bangabandhu had a few specific political ideals and goals and he worked consistently to achieve them. His values are best captured in three sentences which Bangabandhu penned on May 3, 1973. He writes: \"As a man, what concerns mankind concerns me. As a Bengalee, I am deeply involved in all that concerns Bengalees. This abiding involvement is born of and nourished by love, enduring love, which gives meaning to my politics and to my very being.\" The above quote makes it clear that Bangabandhu identified himself both as a human being and as a Bengalee.  This self-identification helps us explore the main features of his political philosophy, such as nationalism, secularism, socialism, and people-orientation.  Nationalism Independence, liberation, and democracy  From the beginning of his political life, Bangabandhu was proud of his Bengali national identity. He was involved in the Pakistan movement but he believed that Pakistan should be established on the basis of the Lahore Resolution which envisaged two Muslim majority independent sovereign states.  He perceived the nationalist movement not simply as a struggle to gain independence from the rule of an external colonial power but also as a struggle for the economic and political emancipation of the down-trodden masses from various forms of oppression.  He joined the Pakistan movement in the hope that poor Muslim peasants will be liberated from the exploitation of the landlord classes. He had always viewed the Bengali nationalist movement as a movement for the achievement of democracy as well as liberation of the oppressed people. Thus on March 7, 1971 he called upon the people to launch simultaneously the struggle for independence and liberation.      Prior to the establishment of Pakistan, when as a student in Kolkata, Bangabandhu joined the Muslim League. He belonged to the Shaheed Suhrawardy and Abul Hashem faction of the party which was known as the progressives group. In his Unfinished Memoirs he writes: \"Under Mr Suhrawardy's leadership we wanted to make the Muslim League the party of the people and make it represent middle-class Bengali aspirations. Upto that time Muslim League had not become an organization that was rooted in the people. It used to serve the interests of landlords, moneyed men, and Nawabs and Khan Bahadurs.\" After the creation of Pakistan, Bangabandhu returned to Dhaka and became involved in various progressive movements and organizations which championed the linguistic, cultural, and economic rights of the Bengalis. In 1948 he was imprisoned for participating in the movement demanding recognition of Bengali as one of the state languages of Pakistan.  He was also involved in other social and political protest movements, such as the movement of poor peasants against prohibiting inter-district trade in rice known as the \"cordon\" system. He supported the movement of the fourth class employees of Dhaka university and was again imprisoned in 1949.  Within a relatively short period after the establishment of Pakistan he became convinced about the need for establishing an opposition political party not only for championing the rights of the Bengalis but also to challenge the authoritarian rule of the Muslim League. In his Unfinished Memoirs he explained the rationale for the establishment of the Awami League in the following way: \"There is no point in pursuing the Muslim League any longer. This party has now become the establishment. They can no longer be called a party of the people ... if we did not form an organization that could take on the role of the opposition the country would turn into a dictatorship.\" In 1949, the Awami Muslim League (AML) was founded and Bangabandhu was elected the joint secretary of the party though he was still in prison. In 1953 he became the general secretary of the party. The demand for self-rule gained increasing popular support in East Bengal from the mid-1950s. In 1955 Bangabandhu became a member of the Pakistan National Assembly (NA). In one of his speeches in the NA we already find a strong articulation of various demands of the Bengali nationalists and his strong sense of Bengali identity. He said:  \"They want to place the word 'East Pakistan' instead of 'East Bengal.' We have demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word Bengal has a history, has a tradition of its own. You can change it only after people have been consulted. If you want to change it then we have to go back to Bengal and ask them whether they accept it ... what about the state language Bengali? What about joint electorate? What about autonomy? ... I appeal to my friends on that side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of referendum or in the form of plebiscite.\" In the council session of the party in 1955 the Awami League (AL) dropped the word \"Muslim\" from its name and Bangabandhu again became the general secretary of the party. In February 1966, Bangabandhu presented his historic six points demand which put forward a very radical notion of provincial autonomy leaving only limited powers in the hands of the central government.  In March of that year he became the president of the AL and began a country-wide campaign to popularize the six points which soon became the sole agenda of the party. Six points captured the aspirations of the nation and it was billed as the charter for the liberation of the Bengalis. Following the launch of the six points, Bangabandhu was again imprisoned and he was charged with treason by the Pakistan government in the Agartala conspiracy case.  In 1969, Ayub fell from power in the face of massive students' movement. Bangabandhu was released from prison and the students conferred on him the title of Bangabandhu (friend of Bengal). During the 1970 election campaign Bangabandhu started using nationalist slogans such as \"Bangladesh\" and \"Joy Bangla.\"  Thus, within a relatively short span of four years, between 1966 to 1970, Bangabandhu was able to unite the whole Bengali nation behind his demand for liberation and independence. I do not think any other nationalist leader had been so successful in mobilizing such a huge number of people within such a short period of time.  It is noteworthy that though throughout his life Bangabandhu was involved in movement politics and talked about people's emancipation from exploitation and oppression, he believed in peaceful non-violent political movements. From 1947 till 1970 the Bengali nationalist movement became stronger day-by-day under his leadership but he stayed within the bounds of democratic politics.  Whenever Pakistani rulers gave opportunities for election he participated in them, though the elections were often not free and fair and attempts were made to foil the election results. In Karagarer Rojnamcha he points out repeatedly that by limiting the democratic space an autocratic regime ultimately leads the country towards terrorist politics. He writes:   \"Newspapers arrived. I was alarmed that they [the Pakistani government] are trying to shut down democratic politics ... If anybody criticizes the government there will be cases against them under the proposed secret act ... I myself am facing five cases under article 124, section 7 (3) for making public speeches ... My fear is they are leading Pakistan toward terrorist politics. We do not believe in that politics. But those of us who want to do good for the people through democratic politics, our space is shrinking.\"      Secularism Non-communalism and equal rights for all citizens Though he was a Bengali nationalist, Bangabandhu never tried to create division and hatred between different identity groups. Many nationalist politicians use provocative languages and symbols that encourage violence between different groups. These days we are witnessing the rise of such nationalist leaders even in Western democratic countries who are trying to instigate intolerance and violence towards minority groups. But Bangabandhu's nationalist politics was different. He believed in co-existence and mutual tolerance of different identity groups and talked about equal rights of all citizens. He always stood against communal violence.  Though he was involved in the Pakistan movement he believed that in India, Muslims and in Pakistan, Hindus should enjoy equal rights as citizens and live together in peace and harmony. He talked about equal rights of all groups to practice their respective religions.  He witnessed the communal riots in Kolkata on August 16, 1947. He points out that Suhrawardy asked his supporters to observe the day in a peaceful way so that no blame could fall on the Suhrawardy government. But unfortunately, communal riots did break out in Kolkata and later spread to Noakhali. Bangabandhu saved both Muslims and Hindus from acts of communal violence in Kolkata. Later when Suhrawardy joined Mahatma Gandhi in efforts to bring back communal harmony, Bangabandhu joined them. After returning to Dhaka he joined Gonotantrik Jubo League and took up the cause of building communal harmony as his main mission. He was against all forms of communal violence, not simply between Hindus and Muslims but also between different Muslim sects and between Bengalis and non-Bengalis.  In his Unfinished Memoirs he strongly condemns the anti-Kadiyani riots that took place in Lahore in 1953. In 1954, when riots broke out between Bengali and non-Bengali workers in Adamjee jute mills in Narayanganj, he rushed to the area to calm the situation. In 1964 when Hindu-Muslim riots spread in India he started a civic campaign to prevent communal riots in East Bengal. Even in his March 7, 1971 speech he asked people to remain vigilant against the threat of communal violence. He said: \"Be very careful, keep in mind that the enemy has infiltrated our ranks to engage in the work of provocateurs. Whether Bengalee or non-Bengalee, Hindu or Muslim, all are our brothers and it is our responsibility to ensure their safety.\" In his personal life he followed the preachings of Islam. But Bangabandhu was against the political use of religion. He condemned the Muslim League's practice of using the slogan of Islam and not paying attention to the economic well-being of the people which he argued was the goal for which \"the working class, the peasants, and the labourers had made sacrifice during the movement for independence.\"  Socialism Equality, freedom from exploitation, and oppression   In his Unfinished Memoirs Bangabandhu writes: \"I myself am no communist, but I believe in socialism and not in capitalism. I believe capital is a tool of the oppressor. As long as capitalism is the mainspring of the economic order people all over the world will continue to be oppressed.\" By socialism he meant a system that would free people from exploitation and oppression and remove inequality. He visited China in 1952 which left a deep imprint in his mind. He found great differences in the living conditions of people in Pakistan and China which he attributed to the differences in the two political systems.  Bangabandhu believed that the government has a role to play in removing inequality and freeing people from exploitation. He admired the priorities set by the Chinese government in improving the socio-economic conditions of the people. He writes:  \"Everywhere we could see new schools and colleges coming up. The government has taken charge of education.\" He further writes: \"The communist government had confiscated the land owned by landlords and had distributed it among all farmers. Thus landless peasants had become land owners. China now belonged to peasants and workers and the class that used to dominate and exploit had had their day.\" He did not want to see inequality grow in Bangladesh. In the council session of the AL held during April 7-8, 1972, he reiterated his commitment to promote an exploitation-free socio-economic system and socialism was formally adopted as one of the ideals of the party. In the next council session of the party held in 1974 he, again, pledged to work for freeing the nation of exploitation and oppression. People Orientation People's issues, people's politics   Often we find leaders who lead people towards great goals but they do not become emotionally involved with the people. Bangabandhu was an exception. When I compare the speeches of various leaders of the world with those of Bangabandhu, one of his off-repeated expressions -- \"love for people\" -- stands out as unique. He often talked about his love for people and people's love for him in return.  He always prioritized the issues that are upper-most in ordinary people's lives. His politics was people's politics. During the campaign for Pakistan when famine struck, he worked in feeding centres for the famine victims. He worked to rescue the victims of communal riots in Kolkata. He participated in street rallies demanding food security for the poor in East Bengal. His political philosophy was not centred only around the goal of getting state power: He developed his political ideas by being involved with the concerns of the ordinary masses.  This people's orientation made him a pragmatist. In his diaries he constantly refers to issues that would affect ordinary people's everyday life such as the rise in essential commodity prices or tax increase or flood or famine.    At one level, Bangabandhu was a man of the masses. He learned about people's aspirations from them. At another level he was the leader of the people. He carried forward ordinary people's aspirations. He had faith in people. That is why he could call upon people on March 7, 1971 to join the liberation struggle with \"whatever little they have.\"  Four guiding principles of state We see the reflections of Banganabdhu's political philosophy in the four guiding principles of state adopted by our constitution: Nationalism, democracy, secularism, and socialism. He defended these four principles in various speeches delivered in the parliament, in the party forums, and in addresses to the nation. Bangabandhu used to articulate the goals of his life's work in two simple words. He would either say he wants to build again \"Shonar Bangla\" or he would say he wants to bring \"a smile on the faces of the poor and unhappy people.\" Bangabandhu never talked about GDP growth or other theoretical issues. He knew very well how precious a smile was and his goal was to achieve that priceless objective.   Rounaq Jahan is a Distinguished Fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), Dhaka, Bangladesh."

Hashara highway police outpost in-charge Inspector Md Abdul Based said vehicles were temporarily plying through the single lane on the highway's accident's spot, as another lane was blocked for development work. \"The maximum speed of a vehicle should be no more than 30kmph on that specific road. But, seeing the mangled microbus, we can assume that the bus hit the vehicle at a speed between 70-80kmp,\" he said. \"Besides, the microbus was travelling on the designated side, while the bus driver lost his control over the steering and rammed the microbus,\" the police official added. The Dhaka-bound microbus, which was carrying a groom's party from Louhajang upazila in Munshiganj, met a head-on collision with the bus of Swadhin Paribahan on the Dhaka-Mawa Highway in Shologhar area on Friday afternoon. Nine people, including five women and children, were killed and 13 others were injured in the accident. A case was filed against the bus driver with Sreenagar police station on Friday night. A five-member probe committee led by Additional District Magistrate Asma Shahin was formed to investigate the incident. Inspector Based said: \"Although the case was filed only against the driver, the bus owner will also be brought to book if he is found guilty in our investigation.\" Hashara highway police outpost Sub-Inspector (SI) Md Shahjahan, also the investigation officer of the case, said: \"We are conducting drives to arrest the bus driver.\" Meanwhile, all the nine deceased were buried after their funeral prayers on Saturday. The deceased are  Abdur Rashid Bepari, 70, Liza, 24, Tabassum, 6, Runa, 24, Renu, 12, Tahsan, 4, Keramat Bepari, 70, Mofizul Molla, 65, and the microbus driver Billal, 40. The  deceased were all residents of Louhajang, except for Billal,who hailed from Sreenagar. "

      "text": "Investment proposal of $12b received, employment for 1.5m people Construction work of Mirsarai Economic Zone is going on in full swing in Chittagong. The new economic zone is expected to create employment opportunities for 1.5 million people within the next 15 years and ensure export earnings of $15 billion, a top official at the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) said. Mirsarai Economic Zone, styled as Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Shilpa Nagar, is being developed on a contiguous 30,000 acres of land stretching to Feni's Sonagazi upazila. These zones have special economic regulations that differ from the rest of Bangladesh. An entrepreneur can enjoy various facilities from authorities for setting up an industrial unit within it.  Paban Chowdhury, Executive Chairman of BEZA told the Dhaka Tribune the development work was going on in full swing at Mirsarai Economic Zone.  \"Currently development work to the tune of Tk 4,000  crore is going on in the largest economic zone of the country. Till now, we have received investment proposal of $ 12 billion dollar from different enterprises of home and abroad for the economic zone,\" added Paban.   When visiting the zone recently, the correspondent found the under-construction industrial enclave abuzz with activity. According to officials of the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA), 16,000 acres of land have already been acquired for the zone, while the acquisition of an additional 7,000 acres of land is underway. Mirsarai Economic Zone, the largest industrial enclave and also Bangladesh's first multi-sector economic zone, will be developed in some 30 phases. Currently, the development work of the site is in progress on 1,950 acres of land, which is the first phase of the economic zone. The first phase started in 2016, and will be completed by 2021. Utility Services Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) is now constructing a coastal embankment (super dyke) and a slope protection embankment to protect the project area from flood, saline intrusion, erosion caused by tidal surge and natural disasters. In addition, the BWDB is constructing eight sluice gates on the rivers and canals passing through the economic zone to Sandwip Channel in the Bay of Bengal. The Roads and Highways Department (RHD) is constructing an 18km-long motorable pavement and a 10km access road to the project area. The Rural Electrification Board (REB) has already installed a power distribution line and a substation. The Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) is now sinking deep tube-wells and a water reservoir.  The Karnaphuli Gas Distribution Company Ltd (KGDCL) is working to upgrade an existing gas distribution network from 350 mmcfd to 500 mmcfd to facilitate adequate gas supply to bulk and industrial customers. On December 4, BEZA has signed a Land Lease Agreement with the Rural Power Company Ltd (RPCL) to establish a power plant with 1800 megawatt power generation capacity to ensure uninterrupted power supply. Local, foreign enterprises eager to invest Many local and foreign companies have already shown interest to invest in the economic zone. Well Group will establish a Composite Textile Mill in the economic zone at a cost of $72.412 million. This project will create employment opportunities for 2,834 people and annual export of $59.283 million. Ananta Group will also set up six new factories in the zone for producing fabrics and yarn. Ananta Group, one of the leading apparel exporters, has been allotted 250 acres land for 50 years. The company will invest Tk3,500 crore and is expected to generate employment for 25,000 people. Kunming Iron & Steel Holding Company Limited, a state-owned Chinese company, is going to invest the amount of $2.13 billion in Bangladesh for establishing the Iron and Steel Industries Park. BEZA has allotted 500 acres of land to Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) for setting up a readymade garment factory park in the economic zone. BGMEA sought the land from BEZA for relocating the factories randomly established at different places in Dhaka.  BGMEA will invest $2 billion for setting up RMG and garment accessories factories at this park to generate employment for 500,000 people. Bangladesh's leading industrial conglomerate Bashundhara Group is also going to set up an industrial park over an area of 500 acres of land in the zone. The group will invest $500 million for setting up an ultra-modern pulp, paper and board mill, where 10,000 people are expected to work. Additionally, BEZA has allotted 1,141 acres of land to the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA) in Mirsarai Economic Zone. BSRM Steel Re-Rolling Mills Ltd has been allotted 165 acres of land in the economic zone. Besides, Asian Paints was allotted 20 acres, Berger Paints 30 acres and Arman Haque Denims Ltd was allotted 10 acres of land.  Ferdous Wahid, assistant engineer (civil) of the Bangladesh Economic Zones Development Project (Phase 1), told the Dhaka Tribune that they have already achieved 50% progress in site development under the first phase. \"Construction is going on at full throttle, and we are hopeful of completing the project within the stipulated time,\" the official said. He said: \"We expect the economic zone to start its complete operation by 2030.\"  Mahbubul Alam, president of the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI), said Bangladesh's economy would get a boost after the completion of the zone. He said: \"A suitable site has been chosen for establishing the zone. The prime goal of setting up an economic zone is to create employment opportunities by accelerating industrial development.\" \"I think the economic zone will definitely attract the investors from home and abroad. With the completion of the economic zone, Chittagong will turn out to be a leading regional business hub, and we will be able to explore the full potential of our demographic dividend. Besides, it will present us with huge employment opportunities,\" the CCCI President said. BEZA has been working to set up 100 economic zones in all potential regions--including backward and underdeveloped regions--by 2030, and to create 10 million new jobs and fetch additional annual exports of $40 billion, BEZA officials said. It has already identified 74 locations across Bangladesh for the setting up of economic zones. On February 28, 2016, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina laid the foundation stones of 10 economic zones, including Mirsarai Economic Zone in Chittagong."

      "text": "Pointing out that health is an integral part of the development journey, she said it is essential for continued socioeconomic progress Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stressed the need for collective efforts for ensuring universal health coverage (UHC), saying that its benefits are global and fundamental to development. \"Benefits of universal health coverage are global and we need to work collectively,\" she said while delivering the national statement at the plenary session of the High-level meeting on Universal Health Coverage (UHC) at the Trusteeship Council in the UN Headquarters here on Monday afternoon. The premier added: \"Collaboration amongst stakeholders around a common goal like universal health coverage is fundamental to our development ... we should work together to achieve health for all.\" Pointing out that health is an integral part of the development journey, she said it is essential for continued socioeconomic progress. \"Ensuring Universal Health Coverage for all has assumed greater importance. It also helps ensure access to quality health services without adding financial hardship on the disadvantaged people in particular,\" she said. In Bangladesh, the premier mentioned that in the face of all constraints and limitations, the government has developed innovative ways to ensure universal health coverage for all. She said that government's comprehensive support to health sector today includes risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. \"We had also promised to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one third through prevention and treatment as well as to promote mental health and well-being by 2030,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said that when Awami League government assumed office in 1996, she accorded high priority to strengthening local community health services. \"Acknowledging the critical role of health services at the grassroots level, we introduced Community Health Clinics (CHC) in 1998,\" she said. These clinics, she said, are model of public-private partnership where the government provides skilled personnel, medicine and equipment and the local people provide the land for the clinic. In this connection, the prime minister said that the government had planned to construct 14,890 community clinics all over the country, especially in rural areas. \"So far 13,743 community clinics are functioning which provide services to approximately 600,000 individuals daily,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the clinics are accessible to 80% of the population and are located within 30 minutes walking distance of their residences. She said it is estimated that on an average 40 patients receive service from each clinic every day and 90 percent of them are women and children. \"Our efficient health planning and implementation has reduced maternal mortality to 172, infant mortality to 24 and under-5 mortality to 31,\" she said. The prime minister said in Bangladesh full vaccination coverage is now 82.3%, life expectancy is more than 72.8 years while fertility rate per woman has dropped to 2.1. \"We've made commendable success in elimination of tuberculosis and leprosy,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said that the government has already integrated the health-related SDG targets into the long-term development plans. \"Our 'Visions 2021' and 2041' have given top priority to health security. As per our election manifesto 2018, we are planning to expand the universal health coverage even further and make health service free for child under one year and for elders over 65 years,\" she said. Climate Action Summit Later, the prime minister delivered a statement at the Climate Action Summit at the General Assembly Hall in the UN Headquarters. She said the impacts of climate change have been devastating the lives of almost two billion people globally every year. \"Globally, frequency of extreme climate events is increasing. But in Bangladesh, casualties are reduced to almost nil from hundreds of thousands due to efficient early warning system,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. \"We have adopted adaptation and resilience building measures, including an 82-year Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, to deal with issues on climate change, natural disasters and water management,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the government has built 4,291cyclone shelters and 523 flood shelters in the coastal areas to give refuge during disasters. Some 56 thousand volunteers are available to warn and facilitate preparation for danger, she said. The premier said she is delighted to launch today the Risk-informed Early Action Partnership (Reap). It is an ambitious new initiative created by the United Kingdom, Finland and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Sheikh Hasina said she is pleased to announce that over 50 countries and over 20 other organizations are joining this partnership today at its launch. \"Reap aims to make one billion people around the world safer from disasters by 2025 by bringing together the humanitarian, development and climate communities,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh has shown how a strong early warning system and a coordinated approach in disaster management can make a big difference. \"So, we have happily joined this initiative to share our experiences with other vulnerable countries, as well as to learn from others in mitigating the risks of future hazards,\" she said. The prime minister arrived here on Sunday afternoon on an eight-day official visit to the USA to join the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA)."

Beijing has invited Prime Minister Hasina to pay an official visit from July 1-5, a senior official in Dhaka told UNB, saying that both sides are finalizing things for the important visit. The Chinese government also invited the Prime Minister to attend the annual meeting of the \"New Champions\" which is known as \"Summer Davos\" to be held in Dalian, July 1-3. It will be Sheikh Hasina's first bilateral visit to Beijing following her party's victory in the last parliamentary election. She will have meetings with President Xi, and Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and discuss ways to strengthen cooperation in broader areas. A good number of bilateral documents are likely to be signed during the visit. Prime Minister Hasina is expected to have an exclusive meeting, on July 2, with the founder and Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum (WEF) Prof Klaus Schwab in Dalian. She is also expected to be a panelist at a session on Cooperation in the Pacific Rim at the WEF Dalian. Beijing has already placed five specific suggestions for deepening Bangladesh-China strategic partnership of cooperation with an emphasis on strengthening 'strategic mutual trust'. \"First, we need to deepen strategic mutual trust, and then we need to deepen economic integration,\" Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Zhang Zuo said at Cosmos Dialogue recently.  Other suggestions put forward by him were to deepen interaction, have stronger cooperation on security, cultural exchange, and people's connectivity. He said that China wants to join hands with Bangladesh to become good partners with equality, and mutual trust. Summer Davos, themed 'Leadership 4.0: Succeeding in a New Era of Globalization', is bringing together leaders from every sector, and every part of the world to discuss how to cooperate on the challenges ahead. Globalization 4.0 represents fundamental changes in the global economy that are reshaping companies, communities, and countries at an unprecedented scale. These changes are driven by environmental challenges, regional competition, economic disparities, and technological disruption. They, in turn, require different forms of leadership, and collaboration adapted to this new era of globalization. Platform strategies, and systems leadership are key business concepts behind the sweeping technological changes propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Leadership 4.0 requires an understanding of how new champions, that are gaining economic influence, are disrupting. and transforming current industry models. WEF engages leaders who have the vision, and values to shape the future in this new context. The Annual Meeting of the New Champions is designed as the foremost global summit on innovation, and entrepreneurship with more than 1,500 participants, 100 working sessions, and community activities, along with the opportunity to engage in several new forum initiatives."

State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Md Enamur Rahman and other officials present at a roundtable meeting arranged by Brac at Spectra Convention Centre in Dhaka on Tuesday, December 24, 2019 | Courtesy He said to overcome the problem, the government looks for structural and infrastructural solutions, and it gives the highest emphasis on research. \"Because there is a huge misconception at all levels of people about lightning strikes, and only scientific research can help remove that misperception.\"         The state minister, however, said the palm tree plantation drive taken by the government is going on and it will continue to increase forest resources in the country and minimize casualties caused by thunderbolts.    He said the government will carry out a campaign at all levels to create public awareness about lightning strike as it causes huge casualties, not only in Bangladesh but all over the world.    Enamur said some 2,000 to 24,000 people are killed in the world every year in addition to some 50,000 who get injured in lighting strikes. He said 81 people were killed in Bangladesh in just four days in 2016.    At least 246 people were killed and 97 others injured in lightning strikes from February to September this year. According to official statistics, a total of 359 people were killed in thunderbolts in 2018. In 2015, the government declared lightning as a natural disaster."

      "text": "A document drawn up by the World Food Programme (WFP), the UN's food aid arm, shows the agency has supplied the Bangladesh government with detailed plans - including a timeline and budget - of how it could provide for thousands of Rohingya transported to the island within weeks The United Nations is making plans to help Bangladesh relocate thousands of Rohingya refugees to a remote island off its coast, documents seen by Reuters show. Dhaka says transporting refugees to Bhashan Char - a Bay of Bengal island hours by boat from the mainland - will ease chronic overcrowding in its camps at Cox's Bazar, which are home to more than 1 million Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority who have fled neighbouring Myanmar. A document drawn up by the World Food Programme (WFP), the UN's food aid arm, shows the agency has supplied the Bangladesh government with detailed plans - including a timeline and budget - of how it could provide for thousands of Rohingya transported to the island within weeks. It stresses that any relocation should be voluntary and done \"in accordance with humanitarian principles and code of conduct.\" The document, labelled as a \"Concept of Operations\" and dated March 12, outlines how the organization and its partners \"may facilitate the identification, staging, forward movement, reception, and sustainment of refugees\" on Bhashan Char, estimating an initial appeal for donor funding of between $8.6 and $19 million. More detailed operational planning would be needed it says, noting the Concept of Operations had been \"developed quickly and without the benefit of any recent on-site assessment.\" Gemma Snowdon, communications officer for WFP in Cox's Bazar, said the organization was part of \"ongoing discussions\" with the government over the future of the refugee response. \"The viability of safely relocating people to Bhashan Char needs to be thoroughly assessed and WFP is investigating the potential operational needs, financial costs, and challenges in several areas that we traditionally support in emergencies: food security, emergency telecommunications and logistics,\" she said. Refugee influx The numbers of refugees in the Cox's Bazar camps have grown dramatically since August 2017, when a Myanmar military-led crackdown that UN investigators have said was conducted with \"genocidal intent\" prompted some 730,000 Rohingya to flee. Myanmar has denied almost all allegations of atrocities made by refugees during what is says was a legitimate counterterrorism operation by its security forces.  Dhaka is struggling to cope with the influx and wants to start relocating thousands of refugees to the island, which it says has been secured with flood defence embankments and cyclone shelters. A senior UN official told reporters in Dhaka on Thursday the organization welcomed the fact the government had \"taken steps to identify alternative settlements.\" \"As you also know if you have been to Kutapalong and the various camps in Cox's Bazar area, it is clear that there is huge congestion,\" said Volker Turk, Assistant High Commissioner for the UN refugee agency. Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque, who is also the chairman of Cabinet Committee on Law and Order, told Reuters in an interview the government planned to start moving refugees next month. A group of Rohingya refugee people walk in the water after crossing the Bangladesh-Myanmar border in Teknaf, Bangladesh  | Reuters \"We are in talks with UN agencies and they have agreed,\" he said. \"Now we are working on other things like how to move them and other strategies. We are the host country. We will decide where to keep them. And we are doing everything to ensure their safety and security.\" The Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, Mohammad Abul Kalam told Reuters preparations were \"still going on\" and the site was not ready. Bhashan Char, a flat and featureless island that emerged from the sea 20 years ago, has never been inhabited. Housing with corrugated iron roofs and concrete floors and walls for about 70,000 people had been built, but there were only enough cyclone shelters for 17,000. In Cox's Bazar, local officials are compiling lists of the first refugees to be moved, District Commissioner Mohammad Kamal Hossain told Reuters."

      "authors": "Reaz Ahmad",
      "text": "Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), a simple technology, can help cut irrigation cost, stop rapid depletion of groundwater table and halve methane emissions  It takes 3,000 litres of water to produce one kilogram of rice. Dry season high yielding rice farming is heavily dependent on irrigation.  And there is a growing concern about irrigated rice fields emitting too much methane, second in importance after carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, responsible for global warming. Adoption of a simple technology called Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), can cut irrigation water use by a third, and halve the methane emissions from rice fields, experts told Dhaka Tribune.  In the practice of AWD, farmers do not maintain flooded rice fields all the time. Rather they are advised to use water more judiciously in an alternate wetting and drying pattern that helps them cut the cost of irrigation, save precious groundwater, where the water table has been falling at an alarming rate. This ultimately results in less emission of methane, harmful for the ozone layer of the earth's stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. It's a pity though, that for the past decade or so, AWD has been widely accepted as a water-saving, climate smart farming technology, but has not been adopted. Recently, an IRRI-led (International Rice Research Institute) initiative, the Northwest Focal Area Network, (otherwise known as FAN), demonstrated AWD to thousands of Bangladeshi farmers.    Success has come in the wake of the demonstration, and many rice growers have started appreciating the value of AWD. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) has also recently conferred the 'Innovation in Behavioral Change' award to the FAN project for its effort in reducing methane emissions in rice production.   Bangladesh and five other countries - Canada, Ghana, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States - joined forces with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in founding CCAC in 2012. The CCAC aims to catalyze rapid reductions in climate pollutants to protect human health, agriculture, and the environment.  Dr SM Mofijul Islam, a Senior Scientific Officer of the Soil Science Division of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI), has been working on rice field methane emissions for the past seven years.  \"In my study I found some 250 to 350 kilograms of methane being released from each hectare of rice field in a growing season. Our research shows if AWD is practiced, it not only saves water and cuts irrigation costs, but also more importantly, it potentially halves the emission of methane from rice fields,\" Dr Islam told the Dhaka Tribune. IRRI Consultant Dr. Ahmed Salahuddin, who has been spearheading the cause of promoting AWD in Bangladesh, told this correspondent that over the past three years they've demonstrated AWD in over 3,000 hectares of rice lands in the Greater Rangpur-Dinajpur, Rajshahi, and Naogaon regions. \"We found that farmers practicing AWD needed 35 percent less water, thereby cutting their rice production cost by 20 percent. This also helped up to 50 percent reduction in methane emissions. Furthermore, fields where AWD was practiced, were less prone to pest infestations and diseases, and overall output was higher by 10 percent,\" said Dr Salahuddin. IRRI, FAN, and the Gobeshona Network of International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) of Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), are now jointly spearheading the adoption of climate-smart technologies for agriculture in Bangladesh in a project called \"Mitigation Options to Reduce Methane Emissions in Paddy Rice.\"  In Bangladesh, dry season Boro rice is the biggest contributor to the country's yearly rice output in three rice growing seasons - Aus, Aman, and Boro. And other than Aus, the monsoon rice,    Boro is fully irrigated, and Aman is partly irrigated.  Farmers in Bangladesh use over 1.4 million shallow tube wells (STWs) to draw irrigation water from underground, and due to over-mining of groundwater, the water table has been falling over 0.6 metre a year, exposing the country to an ecological disaster.   According to BRRI-run Bangladesh Rice Knowledge Bank, \"The savings of irrigation water will have impact on the environment because of reduced withdrawal of ground water and a reduction in burning diesel. This may also reduce arsenic contamination in rice grains and straw.\" What is AWD?  Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) is a water-saving technology that farmers can apply to reduce their irrigation water use in rice fields without any yield penalty. In AWD, irrigation water is applied a few days after a well irrigated field dries out. Hence, the field is alternately flooded and non-flooded. The number of days of non-flooded soil between irrigations can vary from 1 day to more than 10 days, depending on a number of factors such as soil type, weather, and crop growth stage. How to implement AWD?  A practical way to implement AWD safely (without yield loss) is to monitor the depth of ponded, standing water in the field, using a perforated 'field water tube' (pani pipe). After irrigation, the water depth will gradually decrease. When the water level  drops to about 15 cm below the surface of the soil, irrigation should be applied to re-flood the field to a ponded water depth of about 5 cm. From a week before flowering to one week after flowering, the field should be kept flooded, topping up to a depth of 5 cm as needed. After flowering, during grain filling and ripening, the water level can be allowed to drop again to 15 cm below the soil surface before re-irrigation. AWD can be started one or two weeks after transplanting.   The Field Water Tube (pani pipe) The field water tube can be made of 30-cm long plastic pipe or bamboo, and should have a diameter of 10- 15 cm so that the water table is easily visible, and it is easy to fit one's hand inside the tube to remove soil. The tube has to be perforated with many holes on all sides, so that water can flow readily in and out of the tube. It has to be hammered into the soil so that 15 cm protrudes above the soil surface. The tube should be placed in a readily accessible part of the field close to a bund, so it is easy to monitor the depth of the ponded water. The location should be representative of the average water depth in the field (i.e. it should not be in a high spot or a low spot). Why is Curbing Methane Emissions So Important? With global temperatures rising due to climate change, the emission of methane - that traps about 25 times more of the sun's heat than carbon dioxide -plays a significant role in global warming. Wetland rice fields have recently been identified as a major source of atmospheric methane. Flooding a rice field cuts off the oxygen supply from the atmosphere to the soil, resulting in anaerobic fermentation of organic soil matter. Methane is a major end product of anaerobic fermentation. It is released from submerged soil to the atmosphere by diffusion and ebullition, and through the roots and stems of rice plants. Global estimates of emission rates from wetland rice fields range from 20 to 100 Tg/yr (teragrams per year), which corresponds to as much as 29 percent of total annual anthropogenic methane emissions."

      "text": "The main objectives of the project are to free the Chittagong metropolis from water logging as well as to protect the port city from tidal surge, high tide and flood In order to ensure flood control, address waterlogging and improve the drainage facilities in the Chittagong metropolis, the government has undertaken a big project involving Tk1,620.73 crore. The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) has recently approved a project titled 'Flood control, addressing water logging and improvement of drainage facilities of Chittagong Metropolis' to this end.  A senior Planning Commission official said: \"Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) under the Ministry of Water Resources will implement the project by June 2022 to be entirely borne from the state exchequer.\" He said that the main objectives of the project are to free the Chittagong metropolis from water logging as well as to protect the port city from tidal surge, high tide and flood by constructing retaining wall and flood wall on the right embankment of the Karnaphuli River. Moreover, steps will be taken to stop intrusion of salty water and speedy drainage of rain water in the city through construction of regulators and pump houses. Commenting on the project, Planning Minister MA Mannan said: \"Once the project is implemented, it would help addressing the water logging of the port city to a great extent.\"   The minister added that this project will protect Chittagong from flood and tidal surge and high tide. Another official at the Water Resources Ministry said that the rivers Karnaphuli and Halda are very important for drainage of water from the Chittagong Metropolitan City though the main industrial areas, Shah Amanat International Airport, railway areas near Pahartali, Kalurghat heavy industrial area are all situated near the Karnaphuli River. It is to be noted that the water flow of 23 city canals merges in the Karnaphuli River and three canals converges into the Halda River while the flow  of the remaining 14 canals go into the Bay of Bengal. Apart from this, excessive rain water and mixed impact of high tide and low tide at the Karnaphuli are one of the main reasons for water logging in the city. During high tide, water from the Karnaphuli River enters the city since there is no flood control embankment on the right side of both rivers Karnaphuli and Halda. Under these circumstances, Bangladesh Water Development Board formed a technical committee in December 2016 following request from the Chittagong City Corporation to address the problem side by side a study was carried out by Chittagong WASA. \"Based on that study and recommendations of the technical committee, the project was drafted and later was approved at the Planning Commission and subsequently at the ECNEC,\" added the Water Resources Ministry official. The main project operations include the construction of 2.7 kilometer retaining wall, 18.965 kilometer flood wall, installation of some 69 pumps, construction of 23 regulators, 1 kilometer slope protection and some 6 hectares of land acquisition. On July 15, 2018, the Pre Evaluation Committee (PEC) meeting on the project was held where the Planning Commission recommended for implementing the project."

      "text": "Hundreds of thousands more people in West Bengal state have also been given orders to flee At least two people died Friday as Cyclone Fani, the biggest in years, slammed into eastern India, sending coconut trees flying and cutting off power, water and telecommunications. The monster weather system made landfall at the holy city of Puri in the morning, with winds gusting at up to 200km per hour. In recent days authorities in Odisha state, where 10,000 people perished in a 1999 cyclone, evacuated more than a million people as they worried about a possible 5ft storm surge sweeping far inland. One man died of a heart attack in one of several thousand shelters set up, while another was killed by a falling tree on Friday, authorities said. Media reports put the death toll at up to six, but officials could not confirm this. Authorities in Bangladesh, where Fani was headed, said that 14 villages were inundated as flood dams broke due to a tidal surge.  Disaster management spokesman Mohammad Jahir told AFP that 400,000 people from Bangladeshi coastal villages have been taken to shelters. Hundreds of thousands more people in India's West Bengal state have also been given orders to flee. Local airports have been shut, while train lines and roads were closed. \"It just went dark and then suddenly we could barely see five metres in front of us,\" said one resident in Puri. \"There were the roadside food carts, store signs all flying by in the air,\" the man told AFP from a hotel where he took shelter. \"The wind is deafening.\" Another witness said he saw a small car being blown along a street by the winds and then turned over. After pounding Puri and Odisha state capital Bhubaneswar and heading north-eastwards, losing strength as it goes, authorities were battling to remove fallen trees from roads and to restore phone and internet services. On Saturday Fani was expected in West Bangal's capital Kolkata, a city home to 4.5 million people. \"We are monitoring the situation 24x7 and doing all it takes. Be alert, take care and stay safe for the next two days,\" West Bengal's chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted. The winds were felt as far away as Mount Everest, with tents blown away at Camp 2 at 21,000ft and Nepali authorities cautioning helicopters against flying. Meanwhile a baby was born near Bhubaneswar just as the cyclone passed through. \"We are calling her Lady Fani as she was born when the hospital was hit,\" a spokesperson for the hospital told the Press Trust of India. Cyclone Fani makes landfall in eastern India: Met Office https://t.co/XGL0Ldd19a 'Total destruction' Meteorologists have warned of the \"total destruction\" of thatched houses, the uprooting of power and communication poles, the \"flooding of escape routes\" and damage to crops in some areas. Some 3,000 shelters in schools and government buildings were set up to accommodate more than a million people in Odisha, with families including women and babies huddled on the floor. Ports have been closed but the Indian Navy has sent six warships to the region while India's biggest oil and gas producer ONGC evacuated almost 500 workers from offshore rigs. Measures were also being taken to protect the 850-year-old Jagannath temple in Puri, a Hindu holy town normally thronging with pilgrims. AFP correspondents in the resort said it was a near ghost town with trees already torn down and water levels rising even before Fani's awesome arrival. Electricity and water supplies were already cut for much of the city of 200,000 people. Metal shutters covered store fronts and sand blew up the streets from the nearby beach. Only a few police vehicles and tractors trying to pull trees or push aside collapsed walls could be seen. Media reports said hundreds of trees were uprooted at the nearby Chilika Lake just south of Puri in the first violent winds. \"We will just stay for the day until the cyclone has passed. We are not scared but we feel safer here,\" said Krishna Chandra Sahu, 43, sheltering with seven members of his family in a hotel. "

      "text": "USDA says, US-China 'trade war' also comes into play as supply of low-price yarn, fabrics gluts Bangladesh  Backward linkage factories - spinning, weaving, and knitting - in Bangladesh are running their businesses at a loss because of yarn dumping from India, and fabrics from China and Pakistan.  Although apparel industries seem to benefit more from dumping, it makes them more dependent and vulnerable as a supplier of low-priced garments for export, states a just published report by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).    It says, \"Due to the U.S. - China 'trade war,' yarn and fabric from China are exported to Bangladesh at a lower price. Textile industries are facing hard challenges and incurring business losses, as they can't compete with imported yarn and fabric at very low prices.\"  It also states that China is providing direct cash returns to exporters of about 15 to 20% on their export of fabric to Bangladesh.   In March 2019, the price of cotton yarn reduced due to lower cotton prices in the international market, along with ample supply of yarn and fabric from China, India, and Pakistan.  USDA says, the local textile millers are facing uneven competition due to abundant imports of cheap yarn and fabrics. Some of them are about to leave the market and are facing a challenge dealing with a huge stockpile of unsold fabric, it adds.  The phenomena is attributed to low-priced yarn and fabric imports increased through bonded warehouse import \"leakage,\" improper utilization declaration (UD) certification facilities of readymade garment (RMG) manufacturers, false declaration of product specification, and smuggling through the border with India.  Local RMG manufacturers are importing yarn and fabric from China, India, and Pakistan using a bonded warehouse (zero tariffs on import of raw materials for export value-added product) privilege.  \"The imported yarn and fabric with zero tariffs are then illegally sold to the local market which forces down prices in the domestic market and makes local weaving mills and spinners more competitive,\" states USDA report. Bangladesh has import duties of 32.4 percent for man-made fiber, 91.37 percent for fabric, 38.47 percent for yarn, and 32.4 percent for textile chemical dyes.  Export-oriented RMG factories can import yarn and fabric under a duty draw back incentive, which reimburses all customs duties paid on imported yarn, and fabric (but not taxes such as the VAT and Advanced Income tax).  Imports of all textile raw materials, including fabrics, have no quotas.   As a result of yarn oversupply in the domestic market, prices fell nearly 15-20 percent, while some textile millers and spinners suffered as a result, the report says also noting that \"Some millers planned to cut overseas purchases of cotton for yarn and fabric production as they were struggling in the market due to the flood of imported yarn and fabric from China and India.\"  Textile millers have urged the government to take necessary action in order to protect the textile industry.  Of 2.1 million metric tons of Bangladesh's yearly yarn demand, 70 percent is met by local millers, while the rest is imported mainly from India, China, Vietnam and Pakistan.  More foreign buyers of value-added apparel are purchasing from Bangladesh due to cheap labor cost, competitive prices, and an appreciated US dollar versus the Bangladesh Taka.  Reportedly, some high-end millers have increased production capacity to satisfy higher domestic and international demand says USDA report.  Bangladesh currently has 430 spinning mills, 802 weaving mills, 244 dyeing and finishing mills, 32 denim fabric mills, 22 home textile mills, and a total of 6,502 registered and 527 un-registered garment factories.  Sixty-five percent of these factories are located in Dhaka district.  Approximately 4,296 Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) members employ four million workers, of which 80 percent are women.  In first eight months of the current fiscal, ready-made garment (RMG) exports fetched Bangladesh approximately US$23 billion, up nearly 15 percent from last year.  In previous financial year (2017-18), the country earned US$ 31.6 billion from RMG exports, an increase of 8.77 percent compared to 2016-17 FY, and contributed 83 percent of total export earnings.  Ministry of Textile and Jute has projected that the RMG sector earnings would grow to US$35.62 billion and US$38.73 billion in 2019-20 FY and 2020-21 FY respectively.   The export growth was partially contributed to by improved workers' wages, compliance maintenance investment, workers' skill development, diversified value addition, increased domestic and foreign direct investment, and more international brands involved in the trade.  USDA also predicts, Bangladesh's cotton import to rise from 8 million bales (projected for 2018-19) to  8.5 million bales in 2019-20, on expectations of increased export market demand for value-added apparel products, increased capacities of existing mills, stable international prices of cotton, and favorable weather for world production.  Bangladesh imported cotton from 41 countries around the world in 2017-18. Among them, India (25%) and the U.S. (10%) take the largest share of volume, followed by Australia (9%), Mali (9%), Burkina Faso (8%), Benin (8%), Brazil (7%), Uzbekistan (6%), and others.  Nearly 80 percent of garments made in Bangladesh are sourced from cotton; the rest are made from viscose, polyester and other materials.  Local spinners supply 90 percent of raw materials for knitwear and 40 percent for the woven garments sector. "

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "The 57-member bloc says all international legal instruments will be used to hold perpetrators accountable The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has called upon the ad hoc ministerial committee, led by Gambia, to take immediate measures to launch a case of Myanmar's human rights violations against the Rohingyas at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on its behalf. It also affirmed its support for the committee on human rights violations against the Rohingyas in Myanmar, using all international legal instruments to hold accountable the perpetrators of the crimes, according to the final communique issued after the 14th Islamic Summit Conference held in Mecca, Saudi Arabia last Friday, reports UNB. Bangladesh is currently hosting more than 1.1 million Rohingyas in Cox's Bazar -- a vast population which is putting immense economic, environmental and diplomatic pressure on Bangladesh. The OIC's call came after Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the conference sought OIC's help in providing justice to the Rohingyas and ensuring their safe repatriation to Myanmar. Some 750,000 Rohingyas had fled brutal military atrocities in Myanmar's Rakhine state since August 25, 2017. Before them, over 300,000 others fled to Bangladesh after several waves of violence. The conference insisted on the importance of conducting international, independent and transparent investigations into the human rights violations in Myanmar -- including sexual violence and aggression against children -- and to hold accountable all those responsible for these brutal acts in order to give justice to the victims. The 57-member bloc also called for ensuring free and unrestricted access to humanitarian assistance by affected persons and communities. They also reiterated deep appreciation for the people of Bangladesh and the Hasina administration for opening their borders and giving shelter to the forcibly displaced Rohingyas, consistently supporting them with the country's scarce resources. The conference called on the member states to come up generously to share the increasing burden of Bangladesh. Myanmar urged to take steps The Myanmar military has been accused of torching Rohingya villages, killing Rohingyas and even raping Rohingya women -- allegations that rights groups say are tantamount to genocide. Even after signing of deals with Bangladesh and UN agencies on repatriation, the Rohingyas say the conditions in Rakhine are not safe enough for them return and there is no guarantee of citizenship and security. Meanwhile, violence in Rakhine is escalating due to fights between the security forces and the Arakan Army in the recent months and further complicating the situation. The OIC summit welcomed various mechanisms established at international level to improve the situation in Rakhine State, and reiterated its support to regional mechanisms -- particularly Asean -- in conducting the necessary needs assessment to identify areas of cooperation in order to create conducive conditions for the Rohingyas' safe, voluntary, and dignified return. The conference also condemned the inhumane situation in which the Rohingya Muslim community lives, and called for urgent action to end acts of violence and all brutal practices targeting this minority. It also urged giving them their rights without any discrimination or racial profiling. It emphasised that the Myanmar government is fully responsible for the protection of its citizens and underscored the need to stop the use of military power in Rakhine immediately. The conference urged Myanmar to take practical, time-bound and concrete steps to restore the citizenship of Rohingya IDPs and forcibly displaced Rohingya Muslims who were deprived of their nationality, with all associated rights, especially the right to full citizenship. It also urged the country to allow and facilitate the return in safety, security and dignity of all Rohingyas internally and externally displaced, including those forced into taking shelter in Bangladesh. It reaffirmed its commitment to the implementation of the resolutions of OIC summits and ministerial conferences."

      "text": "The Hidden Potential of Peatlands for Global Climate Mitigation People across the globe are calling for the protection of the planet's forests, creating hashtags such as #PrayForAmazonas as news of the recent fires were trending on Twitter. While it is true that our forests are an essential resource for carbon sequestration, our world's peatlands are the less known and often forgotten global carbon sinks.  Peatlands are terrestrial wetland ecosystems in which the production of organic matter is faster than its decomposition. This process results in the net accumulation of peat - a type of soil with very high organic matter content (often more than 30% by weight) as opposed to mineral soils which have a very low quantity of organic matter.   Peatlands exist in almost all countries and are a long disregarded ecosystem in the fight against climate change. Peatlands are the most widespread version of wetlands, representing roughly 50 to 70% of the global wetlands. They are invaluable ecosystems as they are the world's largest natural terrestrial carbon store. Worldwide, peatlands only account for around three % of the land surface but may store up to 644 gigatonnes of carbon which represents approximately 21% of the total global soil organic carbon stock. Despite being an essential resource for carbon sequestration, human activities such as artificial drainage for agricultural use, are degrading global peatlands - turning this helpful ecosystem service provider into the opposite - a carbon source, contributing further to climate change! Peatland types Temperate and boreal peatlands can be categorized in several ways. One of the most widespread ways to categorize them is - according to the source of water on which these ecosystems depend. The term \"Fens\" refer to peatlands which rely both on rainfall and groundwater while \"Bogs\" refer to peatlands which depend solely on rainfall. As a result of the vegetation which grows in such ecosystems, these ecosystems differ from one type to another. However, tropical peatlands lack much attention and have not been studied as well as non-tropical peatlands have been, and as a result, they have not been systematically categorised. As recent as 2017, the world's largest tropical peatland was discovered in the Congo Basin, meaning large areas that have been storing carbon for millennia may still be undiscovered.    How do peatlands lock away carbon? Peatlands are formed in areas where year-round waterlogged conditions exist. This waterlogging slows the natural process of plant decomposition, and the organic matter they are composed of do not fully degrade due to lack of oxygen and \"pile-up\", thereby locking away carbon. This process, over millennia, builds up to form layers of peat several metres in depth. Generally, 1 meter of peat takes 1000 years to accumulate. What other \"ecosystem services\" do they provide?  Peatlands provide environmental services of economic and social importance including carbon storage, protection against erosion, biodiversity, nutrient cycling and water management. Peat blankets often protect underlying soils from erosion. Peatlands host a broad diversity of species of plants and animals. Plants provide the structural foundation and are the source of organic compounds derived from photosynthesis, required for the sustenance of animals and microorganisms. Peatlands host plant species of high nature conservation value. Other life forms include an associated diverse range of fungi species, microorganisms, protozoan and algae. Furthermore, peatlands serve as migratory resting grounds for a wide range of bird species.  Peatlands provide safe drinking water. It is estimated that ten per cent of the planet's freshwater is stored in peatlands. Highlighting the need for both protecting and maintaining the health of this ecosystem is crucial for water security at present and in the future. Water that is derived from healthy peatlands is generally of high quality - having few pollutants and low nutrient levels, meaning it only requires simple treatment once it reaches a water treatment plant.  Near-natural peatlands can store large amount of water due to the spongy nature of peat. Heavy rainfall is initially absorbed and gradually released over a period of several days, the peatlands thereby act as a form of natural flood management infrastructure often minimising the risk of flood damage downstream. Coastal peatlands may additionally act as a buffer against salinity intrusion. Thus, peatlands are essential in the management of water catchments and when degraded can exacerbate flooding, which in many areas is likely to increase as climate change impacts increase. The protection and restoration of previously degraded peatlands can help to address climate change. Degraded peatlands often contribute significantly as a source of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change. A recent estimate of the monetary value of inland peatlands stands at around 11 trillion international dollars. Although peatlands are among the most valuable ecosystems on Earth, little is known about tropical peatlands. However, what we do know is that peat in the tropics occurs mostly in sub-coastal lowlands and forms from rainforest trees and other higher plants, but may also occur in swamp forests. As of 2008, tropical peatlands are estimated to be around 182 million ha, spanning South America, Asia and Africa, and account for almost half of global peatlands. These peatlands store about 40 to 90 gigatonnes of carbon and are becoming more responsive to global climate change and human influences.  Peatlands in Bangladesh?  Peatlands can be found in Bangladesh as well, although they are not usually classified as such since other wetland categories are more prominently used in Bangladesh. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) peat occupy around 60,000 ha in Bangladesh, while others have estimated this figure to range from 130,000 ha to 224,700 ha (1.6% of the total area). These peatlands can be found between the Ganges river floodplain and the Ganges tidal floodplain in Gopalgonj, Bagerhat and the adjoining parts of Khulna, Barisal and Jessore districts, in deep depressions in the Sylhet Basin and the Northern and Eastern Hills of Bangladesh. Peatlands as threatened ecosystems? Throughout Europe, over the last decades, peatlands throughout Europe and North America have been drained for agricultural use or forestry land reclamation or degraded through peat extraction. In the tropics degradation of peatlands not only caused by agrarian expansion but also result from infrastructure development, such as the construction of roads and highways for better transport networks. Mineral, oil and gas extraction may also cause substantial loss or degradation to peatlands in the tropics. In Bangladesh, peatlands are mostly converted to agricultural land for cultivating Boro rice, shrimp and vegetables where there is little scope for soil carbon storage.   As peatlands are degraded, they become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. For example, in 2015, Indonesian peat swamp forests had seriously damaging fires, that emitted nearly 16 million tonnes of CO2 a day as they burned. This level of emissions contributed more than the daily emissions from the entire US economy. Emissions from drained peatlands are estimated at 1.3 gigatonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to 6% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Peatland restoration can bring significant emission reduction and have been recognized by leading peatland scientists of the world as an effective, comprehensive climate change mitigation strategy. Conservation and restoration: not one solution for all Restoration measures of drained and degraded Northern Peatlands usually include rewetting and ditch blocking along with several other methods depending on the level of degradation, vegetation type and peatland type. Many near-natural peatlands are also conserved as protected areas, without much human interference. However, we must acknowledge that what works or has been working for high-income countries may not always work for countries of the global south. Cultural perception and societal priorities differ vastly from one country to another, from one continent to the next, while differences in economic growth, population density, dependence on ecosystems for livelihood further complicates the matter; a \"copy and paste\" approach, therefore, is not the way forward. What could be a possible way forward though, is for Governments to realize the importance of peatlands, beyond its monetary value and take necessary steps to understand peatlands as not exclusively as ecosystems but as social-ecological systems, thereby acknowledging the importance of humans as part of nature.  For Bangladesh, the national and local governments must act together with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as relevant research institutes to develop policies to protect and restore peatlands in Bangladesh. Such policies should not only be based on sound \"natural\" science but should also be based on a sound understanding of local communities. Bangladesh, being an agricultural economy and a country with very high population density, is a country where it is quite challenging to preserve vast areas of peat-forming ecosystems, without incorporating humans into the picture. Several models of community-based management have been tried and tested in the country, especially for wetlands and forests, which could be further developed for peatland management. However, given the lack of research on peatlands in Bangladesh, the first step would be to identify and locate peatlands all over the country, followed by different but inclusive restoration and management measures.    Under the Paris Agreement countries are encouraged to include peatland restoration in their commitments to global international agreements. The inclusion of peatland emissions from degraded peatlands and on the flip side carbon saving from peatland restoration are both eligible for consideration within Nationally Determined Contributions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Therefore countries must begin to include peatland restoration and re-wetting in their national climate action plans.

In Manikganj, ferry and launch services between Paturia, and Daulatdia have remained disrupted due to persistent heavy current on the Padma River. Swades Prasad, executive engineer of floating workshop at Paturia terminal, said: \"Of the 16 ferries, two are completely inoperable. Of the remaining 14, only four utility ferries, and two Ro-Ro ferries are in operation at present.\" Zillur Rahman, acting deputy general manager of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (Aricha), said: \"We were forced to suspend the operation of most of the ferries following the heavy current in the river.\" Visiting the area, this correspondent found around 500 vehicles stuck at the Paturia terminal waiting to cross the river. In Rajbari, a similar situation prevailed at the Daulatdia terminal, as terminal number 1, and 2 have remained shut due to strong current of the Padma River.  Rajbari Water Development Board (WDB) Engineer Arifur Rahman said: \"Debgram and Daulatdia area are at risk of erosion. If they are affected by the erosion the ferry terminals will be affected as well. In order to prevent erosion sand bags are being dumped in the banks of the river there.\" In Madaripur, as the water level of the Padma River started to recede, erosion on its banks has been taking an alarming shape in Shibchar upazila. Kathalbari Primary School was swallowed by the Padma River yesterday, and in the past week, a bridge, along with roads, shops, and numerous homes fell victim to the erosion. Shibchar UNO Md Asaduzzaman said: \"Relief materials will promptly be supplied to the affected, and alternative measures will be arranged for the students who have lost their schools.\"  WDB Executive Engineer Partho Pritom Saha said: \"To prevent erosion at Bandarkhola, Kathalbari, and Char Janajat unions sandbags are being dumped on the banks of Padma.\" In Narail, ever since the opening of Farakka Gates, the water level of the Modhumoti, and Noboganga rivers rose alarmingly, and new regions are being affected, waterlogging thousands of locals. Water levels of Padma, Mohananda recede in Chapainawabganj The water levels of Padma, and Mohananda rivers started receding in the district Saturday morning, reports UNB. According to the district WDB, the Padma water level fell by at least 5cm, and Mohananda by 2cm in the last 24 hours till yesterday morning. Padma was flowing 38cm, and Mohananda 16cm below the danger level. Abdur Rajib Raju, Durlabhpur UP chairman of Shibganj, said a large number of houses, and roads in ward 4 of his union are still under water. The water started receding two days ago, and if it continues the situation will improve soon, he added. Around 58,000 people in 16 unions of the district were stranded when Mohananda, and Punorbhaba rivers breached their banks. \"Some 11,300 hectares of cropland have been flooded,\" said Manjurul Huda, deputy-director of the Department of Agriculture Extension."

      "authors": "Mehedi Al Amin",
      "text": "Experts are hopeful, but cannot attest the long term effects of the project Bangladesh and India will both benefit from the opening of the Farakka barrage, as it will be favorable for ilish fish in general, said sector experts. India has redesigned a navigation lock at the Farakka barrage on the Ganges to ensure the smooth and safe migration of ilish during their three-month spawning season. This lock has now been redesigned to ensure the smooth and safe migration of ilish shoals during their mating season. A navigation lock is a device used to raise and lower boats and ships between stretches of water on a river. Inland Waterway Authority of India Vice-Chairman Pravir Pandey said the barrage gates will remain open for only eight metres between 1am and 5am each day, the preferred time when the ilish seek passage. The tentative completion date of the project is in June. Professor Monirul Islam of the Department of Fisheries at University of Dhaka said: \"It is important to note at which season India is going to open the barrage. In mating season it is forbidden to catch ilish in Bangladesh. If India opens the barrage at that time, then Bangladesh will suffer the consequences.\" \"It seems to me that India is doing this project experimentally. If this works out and India gets more ilish, then perhaps they will realize the value of cooperating with Bangladesh, and that it is wrong to block river flow,\" he added. Also Read- India to open Farakka for illish migration He said there is still a possibility that India might block the barrage after the ilish are on their side, but it would not do them much good. Ilish is a fish of the sea; after releasing eggs in the river, they will return to the sea. If that is blocked, the fish will not release any more eggs. Sector experts have said factors such as pollution, unplanned river islands and water politics may contribute to lessening the ilish population. However, not all experts are skeptical. Dr Md Niamul Naser, an ilish researcher from Department of Zoology at University of Dhaka, is viewing this as a positive turn of events. He said: \"The illish need the flow of water. If there is proper current in the river, the fish will be able to go as far as Rajshahi.\" \"Meghna has enough flow right now. If there is enough flow in Teesta, Surma and Kushiyara rivers, then there will be no issues. It is not as if it will be bad for Bangladesh if India gets ilish,\" he said. Department of Fisheries Deputy Director Dr Zillur, who is in charge of the Aquaculture Branch, said: \"We do not think Bangladesh will face any problems from this project. If the fish traverse the water bodies, then both countries will benefit from it.\" \"However, I cannot attest to the long-term effects of this project. Ilish is a natural resource; no single country owns them. They should be able to migrate in the way that is natural for them.\" When asked about the potential effects of India's project on Bangladesh, Department of Fisheries Director (Scientific Research and Fisheries Survey) Dr Monowar Hossain said: \"If the water flow is improved, then both countries will benefit from the project. Bangladesh will have no issues regarding ilish breeding.\""

The explosion occurred in the ground floor of a four-storied building, where the hotel was situated, around 2:30am on Sunday. Among the injured, 13 were taken to the burn unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) for treatment and the remaining were provided first-aid at Tairunnessa Memorial Medical College and Hospital, Gazipur Fire Service and Civil Defence Deputy Assistant Director Abdullah Al Mamun told Dhaka Tribune. Being informed of the blast, three units of Tongi Fire Service arrived at the scene. However, before their arrival, locals rescued the injured and took them to the hospital. Mamun said the explosion destroyed parts of the Banglar Radhuni Hotel and its adjoining Tripti Hotel, injuring at least 17 people at the restaurants. The nearby IFIC Bank suffered the most damage from the blast. Gazipur Deputy Commissioner SM Tarikul Islam told reporters that a five-member probe committee, including members from fire service, district police and administration, was formed to investigate the cause of the blast and to assess the damages caused. Officials also confirmed that the injured are mostly staff and a few customers of the restaurants. However, it was unclear what triggered the explosion, Deputy Assistant Director Abdullah Al Mamun added."

The northern state of Kachin was the worst affected, with 14,000 people forced from their homes near the banks of the Ayeyarwady river. Media published photographs showing submerged houses, vehicles and roads in Myitkyina, the state's capital. Flooding also forced 3,000 people in the western Rakhine state to relocate, the disaster management department said. They included some of the thousands displaced by fighting between the military and the Arakan Army insurgent group since late last year, according to Tun Aung Kyaw, secretary of the Arakan National Party, who visited a camp for several hundred displaced people near the ancient city of Mrauk-U. \"The whole camp is flooded and people are desperately in need of immediate shelter and food,\" he told Reuters by telephone. Myanmar has restricted access to the conflict zone for most international aid agencies. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a Facebook post it was helping the government respond to the flooding, while the Myanmar Red Cross, aid groups and private donors were also aiding the victims. \"We are working closely with authorities and stand ready to support the government's response,\" Knut Ostby, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator, said on Twitter."

      "text": "According to villagers, the disaster occurred due to continuous sand lifting by unscrupulous traders Erosion by the Jamuna river, due to illegal sand lifting, has hit Beltia and Gorilabari areas in Gohaliabari union since Wednesday, which is very close to the Bangabandhu Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge, in Kalihati upazila. The river has already devoured at least 28 dwellings, in areas under the union, in the last two days. According to villagers, the disaster occurred due to continuous sand lifting by unscrupulous traders.  The authorities dumped geo-bags but failed to prevent the erosion that left at least 28 families homeless. Although law prohibits sand lifting within a six-kilometre radius of a bridge, a syndicate of influential traders, having political connections, continued lifting sand near the bridge with powerful dredgers, the villagers said. Over 20,000 people in the union are under the threat of erosion, and are passing their days in panic. When Gorilabari village was visited yesterday, the villagers expressed grave concerns. \"Our tin-shed building, toilet, and tube-well were devoured by the river,\" said Fatema Begum adding that they are now living in somebody else's house. Not only Fatema but also Akbar Ali Akanda, Chand Miah Haji, Abdul Ali Mondol, Abdus Salam, Janab Ali Talukder, Abul Hossain, Korban Ali, Akbar Shikder, Ashraf Ali, Solaiman, Shafiq Uddin, Jahurul Islam, and Khaled Mondol of Gorilabari, and Beltia villages have lost their dwellings due to erosion. They have taken shelter in open spaces, and relatives' houses. \"Many people of the village have lost their houses in the erosion. I have lost my house,\" said Akbar Ali Akanda of the village. During the last rainy season, erosion by the river devoured at least 50 houses, and a 200-metre embankment in the village within a few days. This year, erosion started in Gorilabari village on May 30, and it devoured over a dozen dwellings so far, said Rashida Begum, an erosion victim of the village. Tangail-4 (Kalihati upazila) constituency MP  Hasan Imam Khan Sohel said work  for a permanent embankment in the area, to save the people from erosion, will start in December. \"Each erosion victim will get Tk, 6000, and two bundles of corrugated tins,\" he also said."

      "text": "A large number of houses, structures, trees, and crops on vast tracts of land were washed away by floodwaters, and strong river currents in different flood-hit areas The overall flood situation remained unchanged, but river erosion has taken a serious turn in Rajbari, and Shariatpur districts on Sunday . Local sources said erosion by Padma River has intensified in Rajbari, and is gradually receding in Shariatpur, causing immense sufferings to the people. A large number of houses, structures, trees, and crops on vast tracts of land were washed away by floodwaters, and strong river currents in different flood-hit areas. In Rajbari, erosion in the Padma River has taken an alarming turn, it already forced thousands of families, under the Sadar, Goalanda, and Kalukhali upazila, to leave their houses, due to rise in water levels, villages within the district are becoming more vulnerable. According to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), they are dumping sand bags in the river to prevent erosion in the area. But locals claimed that BWDB's efforts aren't enough as forceful current, and rising water level is washing the sand bags away. They hoped the authority would take more effective measures to prevent erosion, which eroded at least 19 points of the district. Goalanda's Bhakla Union Parishad Chairman Md Amjad Hossain said: \"Not only the houses, but acres of croplands are underwater. BWDB initiatives are praiseworthy, but not enough to avert the erosion.\"  Arifur Rahman Angkur, Sub-Divisional Engineer BWDB's Rajbari office, said: \"We are dumping Geo bags to lessen the casualties. We will take more measures if needed.\" In Shariatpur, at least 20 establishments, including a mosque, 5 business centres, and houses were devoured by the Padma River, and it is threatening more areas in Naria upazila of Shariatpur district due to a wild rise in water level, causing severe river erosion in the past couple of days. Around 200 meters of the river protection dam has collapsed in the district on Thursday, making hundreds of residents, around the riverbank, to shift from the spot instantly. Locals said, the water level of the Padma was increasing since Thursday but has receded on Sunday.  Member of Parliament (MP), Deputy Minister for Water Resources AKM Enamul Haque Shamim, State Minister Zahid Faruque, and Director General of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) Mahfuzur Rahman, visited the area Sunday. They said there was no negligence with the construction of the protection dam. The damage was a result of increased current, and rise of water level in the river. It is to be noted that last year, more than 6,000 houses, around 1,000 business centres, and many other establishments were washed away due to devastating erosion of the Padma River in Naria upazila."

The arrests were made by Chandpai range officials around 4am on Tuesday. The suspects are residents of Gaurambha area under Rampal upazila of Bagerhat district. A huge numbers of deer-hunting snares were recovered from the spot after the arrests, said the officials. Sundarbans East Forest Zone Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Md Mahmudul Hasan confirmed the matter to Dhaka Tribune.  He said: \"The forest department officials keep a watchful eye on Ras Mela bound pilgrims each year. \"On Tuesday, as the alleged deer-poaching team was approaching the area on three trawlers, officials of the Chandpai range caught them and recovered the deer snares.\" Ras Mela, a religious festival of the Hindu community, takes place on the full-moon night of the Bangla months of Karthik or Agrahayan every year. In the Sundarbans, it is celebrated each year at Dublar Char."

      "text": "The US is among Bangladesh's top trading partners The economic and commercial ties between Bangladesh and the US will continue to grow rapidly if issues related to the investment climate, intellectual property, and the workforce are addressed. \"I am confident [about the growth of ties],\" said Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the US and Foreign Commercial Service, Ian Steff.  He visited Dhaka from May 11-13 to participate in a 2019 Trade Winds Indo-Pacific Forum and Mission -- plus to promote US-Bangladesh trade and investment, reports UNB.  He encouraged Bangladesh to realise the full potential of the bilateral commercial relationship by removing remaining trade barriers and improving the ease of doing business.   Trade between the US and Bangladesh has doubled to more than $8 billion over the past decade, the US Embassy said on May 7, 2019. During his first visit to Dhaka, Steff met government officials and discussed intellectual property rights as well as other investment climate issues.  \"US and Bangladeshi business leaders are increasingly expanding their commercial ties and partnerships -- as evidenced by growing trade between our two nations and the strong participation of companies in our trade mission,\" he said.  On May 13, he met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Private Industry and Investment Advisor Salman F Rahman and Energy Advisor Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury--as well as Commerce Secretary Mofizul Islam--to discuss ways to expand economic ties.  Bangladesh, with its population and economic growth, offers US companies a market of incredible potential with tens of millions of increasingly affluent consumers.   Trade Winds Indo-Pacific is the US Department of Commerce's first major trade mission to Bangladesh in recent history. The trade mission began on May 6 in New Delhi and concluded on May 13 in Dhaka.   The Trade Winds event facilitated meetings between 12 representatives of US companies and more than 40 business-to-business meetings with Bangladeshi companies.   Trade Winds, now in its 11th year, has directly supported more than $3.4 billion in US exports in over 40 countries; in 2018, US exports of goods and services to the Indo-Pacific region were more than $476 billion.   In 2017, the mission brought 100 companies to Southeast Europe and accounted for more than $3 billion in US exports.   Trade Winds has helped US companies conduct over 4,000 pre-vetted, business-to-business meetings and over 6,000 government-to-business meetings around the world."

      "text": "The prices of garlic and ginger have fallen by Tk10 to Tk15 per kg in the wholesale market Onion prices still remain high in retail market selling at Tk50 to Tk60 per kg although the prices have decreased in the wholesale market.  On Tuesday, at Karwanbazar wholesale market, five kg of local onion sold at Tk190 and the imported one at Tk170, while three days ago they were Tk220 and Tk180 respectively. At wholesale rate, per kg local onion costs Tk38 while the imported one Tk34.  But in retail market, per kg local onion was selling at Tk60 and the imported onion at Tk45 to Tk50, Dhaka Tribune found while visiting different kitchen markets in the capital.  Md Masud, a trader at Karwanbazar, said: \"There is no sign of the price going down as Eid-ul-Azha is drawing near. Besides, flood is another reason for high price of onion.\"  Another importer and trader of the market Abdul Karim claimed that in the last three days, the price remained stable and feared that it would increase as the transportation cost would be high because of inclement weather.  Meanwhile, prices of garlic and ginger have fallen by Tk10 to Tk15 per kg in the wholesale market. But in the retail market per kg garlic is selling at Tk230 to Tk250 which is Tk180 to Tk130 in the wholesale market. Similarly, per kg ginger is selling at Tk200 to Tk220 in retail market which is sold at Tk140 to Tk180 in the wholesale market.  Asked about price gap between retail and wholesale market, Md Matin, a trader at Panthapath, said: \"We cannot preserve onion because of bad weather. So, to minimize our loss, we have to sell at higher prices.\"  He also blamed short supply for the price hike. Government plans to sell onion through TCB The government is considering measures to rein in the price spiral of onion. \"Prices of onion increased due to supply shortage as imports from India slowed down. In addition, rain has had negative impact on the supply chain,\" said Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi. The minister made the comment while briefing journalists at his secretariat on export performance of the just concluded fiscal year yesterday. To monitor prices, especially those of onion and garlic, ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the government already directed the deputy commissioners, said Tipu. \"We have come to know that the Indian government has withdrawn incentives against export of onion, which may be a reason for the price hike. I have already asked the commerce secretary to check it and take necessary steps,\" said the minister. \"We are closely monitoring the prices of essentials and if needed, onion will be sold at open market through Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB),\" said Tipu.

      "text": "The storm also pummelled much of France, with some 20,000 people still without electricity on Monday after suffering power cuts in the northwest of the country and rail traffic disrupted Britain on Monday grappled with the fallout from Storm Dennis, with several major incidents declared due to flooding and hundreds of warnings still in place after it battered the country over the weekend. The second severe storm in a week to hit Britain brought high winds of more than 140km an hour and more than a month's worth of rain in 48 hours in some places, leading officials to issue rare \"danger to life\" warnings. The storm also pummelled much of France, with some 20,000 people still without electricity on Monday after suffering power cuts in the northwest of the country and rail traffic disrupted. \"This is not yet over,\" warned James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, which is responsible for flood protection in England. \"We still have many flood warnings in force and we may still see significant flooding in the middle of this week from larger rivers,\" he told BBC radio. Bevan said more than 400 homes in England had been flooded while at least 1,000 agency staff were working around the clock alongside emergency officials \"to protect and support those communities which have been hit.\" Major incidents declared More than 600 warnings and alerts - a record number - were issued on Sunday, extending from the River Tweed on the border of England and Scotland, to Cornwall in southwest England. After a day of torrential rain, major flooding incidents were later declared in south Wales and parts of western England. Some five \"severe\" warnings - denoting lives could be endangered by the flooding - remained active Monday on two rivers in Worcestershire and Herefordshire in west central England. Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue service on Sunday airlifted to hospital one man pulled from the River Teme, who was in a stable condition on Monday. But emergency responders suspended the search overnight for a missing woman also swept away by the floodwater near the town of flood-prone town of Tenbury, according to police. \"The search has continued this morning, including the use of the police helicopter,\" said Chief Superintendent Tom Harding, from West Mercia Police. \"Sadly, however, due to the circumstances of the length of time in the water and other conditions we believe that this will now be a recovery rather than rescue operation.\" Two rivers in south Wales burst their banks, prompting rescue workers to launch operations in several places to evacuate people and their pets trapped in their homes. Police said a man in his 60s died after entering the River Tawe, north of the Welsh city of Swansea but later clarified that the death was not \"linked to the adverse weather.\" On Saturday, the coastguard said the bodies of two men were pulled from rough seas off the south coast of England as the storm barrelled in. One is thought to have been the subject of a search triggered when a tanker reported that one of its crew was unaccounted for. 'More extreme' In northern England, the defence ministry deployed troops in West Yorkshire, which suffered badly from flooding caused by last weekend's Storm Ciara. There are fears rivers there could burst their banks later on Monday. Newly appointed environment secretary George Eustice said the government had done \"everything that we can do with a significant sum of money\" to combat increased flooding. \"We'll never be able to protect every single household just because of the nature of climate change and the fact that these weather events are becoming more extreme.\" France was also affected by the storm, especially northwestern Brittany where the Finistere and Morbihan regions were temporarily placed on orange alert for rain and flooding, according to the national weather service Meteo-France. Electricity provider Enedis said it had deployed 450 staff to restore power to 30,000 homes in Brittany. Power cuts also hit parts of northern and central France. The storm interrupted two high-speed TGV train services, one stopped by a fallen tree and the other by a power failure, the national rail company SNCF said."

      "text": "Despite the coronavirus precautions, voters were enthusiastic Early voting in South Korea's parliamentary election began on Friday with coronavirus patients casting ballots at disinfected polling stations and candidates bumping fists instead of pressing the flesh as they appeal for support. The election could decide the control of parliament and shape President Moon Jae-in's ability to implement his agenda in the final two years of his administration, including looser fiscal policy aimed at creating jobs, raising the minimum wage, and continued re-engagement with North Korea. The National Election Commission set up eight polling stations for more than 3,000 coronavirus patients receiving treatment as well as 900 medical staff at treatment centres in hard-hit areas, including the capital, Seoul, and Daegu city. The election is on April 15 but officials are hoping that people will take advantage of early voting to reduce the numbers crowding polling locations that day. Polling stations were disinfected on Thursday and all voters were required to wear a mask, use sanitizers and wear plastic gloves. Officials checked temperatures and anyone higher than 37.5 Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit) was directed to special booths. Despite the coronavirus precautions, voters were enthusiastic. \"It was a little uncomfortable since I had to put on plastic,\" said Kim Ju-yeon, 22, who voted at a polling station at Seoul Station, referring to the gloves she had to wear. \"But because voting is a must, the experience was reassuring.\" There are 3,500 stations for voters to cast their ballots during two days of early voting starting on Friday. Moon cast his ballot at a polling station near the presidential office, known as the Blue House. \"There might be a long line of voters on the election day. I hope the early voting distributes that number,\" Moon said after voting. The government is also considering how some 46,500 people who have not tested positive but are in self-quarantine - most of them returnees from abroad - can cast their ballots. \"We are in consultation with related ministries on how to ensure the right to vote for those in self-quarantine on April 15,\" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters on Friday. Kim said the people in self-isolation could not take part in the early voting because of the risk they might be infected. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 new coronavirus cases on Friday, bringing the national tally to 10,450. The national death toll rose by four to 208. Candidates who began campaigning early this month have been wearing masks and exchanging fist bumps with voters in small meetings, shunning handshakes and big rallies. \"We're refraining from large rallies as much as possible and also limiting personal contact,\" said Lee Nak-yon, a former prime minister running for the parliament. The head of the main opposition United Future Party, Hwang Kyo-ahn, was spotted disinfecting residential areas. "

      "text": "At the same time, political parties aside from the ruling Awami League party have been clamouring against the use of EVMs, claiming it is not secure and is even 'unconstitutional.' In the face of immense public pressure, authorities deferred the Dhaka city corporation polls, but political pressure has failed to remove Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) from the election. Election day was scheduled for January 30 - a holiday for Saraswati Puja - which prompted an outcry from rights groups which called it discriminatory. The Election Commission refused to change the date initially, offering a tottering defence, but later rescheduled elections for February 1. At the same time, political parties aside from the ruling Awami League party have been clamouring against the use of EVMs, claiming it is not secure and is even \"unconstitutional.\" Chief Election Commissioner KM Nurul Huda said on December 25 that EVMs would not be used if there were objections, but later said they would be used.  EVMs were deployed in limited fashion in the 2018 General Elections, and saw only half the votes cast with them in six constituencies. Voter reactions were mixed, with complaints about the machines showing technical glitches. Though the EC said on January 21 that the army will not be deployed for the polls, Colonel Kamal Uddin, director of the project implementing EVMs, said army personnel familiar with the EVM technology will be present at every centre to help the presiding officers. The EC has deployed 35,000 EVMs in 2,468 polling centres for use in the Dhaka polls.  File Photo: Voters cast their votes via EVMs | Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune Twice the machines Colonel Kamal said that each centre will have double the machines. \"We are doubling the EVMs at each centre to instantly move from any machine that shows problems.\" Authorities declined to reveal the cost of the EVMs being used. The machines were purchased from Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory (BMTF). In September 2018, it was reported that the government has approved Tk3,825 crore for the procurement of 150,000 machines at a cost of Tk2 lakh each. In 2011, the EC purchased EVMs from the BMTF at Tk46,501 apiece, which were considered more vulnerable and were subsequently destroyed. Colonel Kamal said returning officers and presiding officers are already being trained to use the EVMs. A demonstration is set for January 27 and the EC has scheduled a mock vote for January 30 to familiarize voters with the technology. Hack-proof EVMs? Colonel Kamal confidently said: \"The EVMs are very secure. As for hackers, if they have guts and are tech savvy, they can try hacking the EVMs. EVMs are not even connected to the internet.\" However, hacking is not limited to the internet. Experts have pointed out that EVMs are still vulnerable to manual tampering. Components can be compromised, but the complexity of the process makes wide scale tampering unfeasible. He also said the EC's decision to widely use EVMs stemmed from responses to  city corporation elections in other districts.  Brig Gen Mohammad Sidul Islam, director general of the EC's NID Wing, said: \"Voters can only cast ballots in their own constituency. No other EVM will accept his ballot. On election day, the presiding officer inserts an SD card into the EVM, with voter data of that particular constituency . Anyone not on the list will be unable to vote and anyone listed in one constituency will not be able to vote in another. The EC said around 70 staff are working round the clock to tweak and upgrade the EVM system in whatever minute way possible, before the machines are rolled out."

It is a moral duty of all to stand by them at this critical moment.  \"However, some landlords are pressurizing them to vacate their houses which is completely unethical and illegal. I would be remiss if did not extend a helping hand towards them,\" said the CMP Commissioner. The CMP Commissioner informed that they have launched a hotline service (01400-400400, 018-8080 80) so that medical professionals could seek assistance from the police and lodge any complaint against their landlords in this regard.

      "text": "At least 42 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim violence this week Days after the violence in Delhi's northeast, many families are still searching for relatives who went missing during the riot. Some located their relatives' bodies in hospitals, which have reported 42 deaths till Friday, the Times of India (TOI) reports. Shami Ahmed, like most people TOI spoke to at the morgue in the past few days, hesitated to reveal full names of the deceased. \"My nephew Babbu said he would take his auto and not ply in the locality to avoid the violence.\" Two hours later, they had learned Babbu had been found in a pool of blood, and taken to hospital, where upon reaching he died, Shami said.  A distressed woman was yet to locate her missing husband. \"Dilshad is nowhere to be found,\" a frantic Farha said. \"He left home Tuesday morning and there has been no contact with him since. We have five children. I am at my wit's end.\" Most families have already checked hospitals, the emergency block and the morgue, assuming they would find their relatives, but to no avail. Authorities say situation calmer The situation in northeast Delhi after days of clashes over the controversial citizenship law is relatively peaceful on Saturday, sources told NDTV. The ban on large gatherings, however, is still on in neighbourhoods where mobs clashed.  The Indian Home Ministry has said the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has cleared most of the debris from public places. The authorities said traffic is normal at most northeast Delhi areas and people have started going to work. A few shop-owners have pulled up their shutters amid the scorched urban landscape scarred by petrol bombs and damaged by bricks. The worst affected areas, however, have fallen silent as most of the residents have left. The authorities said these areas will take some time to return to normal. People should \"not believe in rumours and fall prey to evil designs of miscreants and groups interested in precipitating communal tension,\" the Indian Home Ministry said. What happened Indian police said on Friday they had detained 512 people and were keeping a heavy presence in northeast New Delhi, days after the worst bout of sectarian violence in the capital in decades, reports Reuters. At least 42 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim violence this week, police said, amid mounting international criticism that authorities failed to protect minority Muslims."

      "text": "It is the most similar to Earth of any planet discovered by the Kepler space telescope, in terms of its size and estimated temperature Nasa has found an \"intriguing\" planet that could be home to life in old data from a retired space telescope, reports The Independent.  The Earth-sized exoplanet orbits around its star's habitable zone, meaning that the temperature is mild enough to allow a rocky planet to support liquid water. The distant world was discovered when scientists were picking through old observations that came from the Kepler space telescope, which stopped its work in 2018 but provided a vast trove of data from the stars before it did. The planet had previously been discarded by a computer algorithm that misidentified it. But as part of new research, scientists were able to have another look at the information in the Kepler data and see that it really was a previously undiscovered planet. In fact, it is the most similar to Earth of any planet discovered by the Kepler space telescope, in terms of its size and estimated temperature. While other exoplanets may be more similar in size or temperature, no world has been discovered that has quite such a combination of those two qualities, as well as lying in the habitable zone. The planet is 300 light-years from us, just a little larger than our Earth and receives about 75% of the light that we get from our own Sun. That means the temperature could be similar, too, allowing for the conditions required for life. Scientists are concerned, however, that its star is a red dwarf, unlike our own more stable Sun. Such stars are known for throwing out stellar flare-ups that could destroy any potential life before it takes hold on the planet. Scientists now hope to learn more about the planet, including any information about its atmosphere and to get more specific knowledge of its size and conditions."

      "text": "Over a lakh people living in the upazilas fear that if an erosion occurs again in the locality, it will be difficult for them to settle and earn their livelihood Thousands of people in Shariatpur are living in constant fear of an upcoming erosion even as they struggle to cope with the ongoing lockdown in light of the deadly Covid-19 outbreak that challenges their livelihood. The flood control embankment construction project on the Padma river, flowing through Naria and Zajira upazilas of the district, has come to a halt with the recent outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic that has led to a nationwide lockdown. Over a lakh people living in the upazilas fear that if an erosion occurs again in the locality --which is highly likely as it happens every year-- it will be difficult for them to settle and earn their livelihood. The poverty-stricken locality had hardly any respite from the damage caused by the last erosion and yet there is now a threat of another. Over six thousand people --who lost their homestead and belongings in the last erosion-- settling in on others' land either through pity or rent are in a huge crisis. Roksana Begum, a resident of Naria upazila, lost everything to the river last year and now, when she and her husband both are jobless, the pandemic is making each day of their lives harder as the days go by. She said: \"We made a shed on a neighbour's land temporarily. We were hoping to get back to our normal life after the flood control embankment project was completed. But now erosion is coming towards us in one way and coronavirus has come in another. \"We have no money or anyone to help us. Either we will die of the disease or of poverty. It does not make much difference to us,\" Roksana added in sheer despair. Thousands of working class people, who lost everything in the regular erosion in the area like Roksana are facing the same difficulties. They are without work, income, food and scope for treatment.  Despite government-allocated ration goods, said another resident of the area seeking anonymity, people have been sleeping on hungry stomachs as they are not getting help or it would be correct to say that their goods are being looted by local representatives and political activists.  Mohadeb Das, a kitchen shopkeeper of Hindupara, said he used to own a large store. However, after the river devoured it, he was managing well with his single-shed kitchen shop by the riverside.  He said: \"I was waiting to see the embankment project completed. But now no one comes to my shop because of the disease and the river is closing in every day to consume my shop, my only means of livelihood again.\" Rashida Begum, who rented her neighbour's house after losing her home in the erosion, said: \"We were well off, with our daily jobs and income. It was not much but enough for a couple like us. \"But due to the coronavirus, we lost our jobs and did not have any help or rations from the authority. We do not know what will we do,\" said Rashida, who has been suffering from acute poverty due to the outbreak of the pandemic. Denying the allegations, Kazi Abu Taher, Deputy Commissioner of Shariatpur, told Dhaka Tribune that there was not a single house in his locality which had not been given proper help and not a single person was there who was hungry or had been deprived of rations. According to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), the flood control embankment project, stretching for 8.9 kilometres, was initiated in 2018 and was expected to be completed in 2021 at a cost of Tk1,097 crore. However, 33% of work remaining for the project has now come to a halt as workers have left for their homes with the outbreak of the pandemic. Stating that the project would be completed in due time, BWDB Executive Engineer Ahsan Habib said: \"The project is still ongoing in fractionally. Even if it gets halted overall, we will speed up the construction work later to complete it in due time.\""

      "text": "Shuvo told the visiting journalists that he immersed himself in robotics related subjects from an early age dreaming of making robot one day Shuvo Karmakar is a tenth-grader from Kalupara village in Agoiljhara upazila of Barisal, attending Gaila Secondary High School. He spent about Tk 25,000 to make an artificial intelligence (AI) robot named \"Robin\", that can communicate in both English and Bangla.  The thought of creating Robin came after Shuvo saw robot Sofia.  He made sure the robot could speak Bangla unlike Sophia. The cost of making Robin was much less than Sophia, said Shuvo to local journalists. Shuvo told the visiting journalists that he immersed himself in robotics related subjects from an early age dreaming of making robot one day. So he gathered knowledge about robotics and programming from the internet. He learned that the word 'robot' derived from the Czech word 'robota,' that means forced labour, slave of man, or the machine that can work continuously and spontaneously and would be an alternative for various human activities.    When his friends played outside, he remained home in front of the computer, going from one website to another to learn robotics and programming.  He started to make Robin on May 25, 2018, and it took him about eight months to complete in January 2019, spending around Tk 25,000. The robot was named Robin after a superhero of a cartoon show in the USA.  To make Robin locally and affordably, Shuvo managed to acquire hardware from local shops in Dhaka and Barisal, and from online. After completion, he enriched Robin with several useful features like self-learning and using machine-learning algorithms to process information. It can also tell the names of its maker, and top leaders and officials of the country. A sensor in Robin can detect fire emergencies and send location information to the nearest fire service office via Google Maps. Robin is also a treasure of information for interacting with children to teach them the basics of different subjects. It can also  provide valuable insight to farmers about producing and caring for crops. Shuvo is now working on improving Robin by giving eyesight and movement on legs instead of working on wheels.   \"If I get enough support, I can improve Robin more to reach further heights in the field of robotics, by making a robot even better than Sofia,\" said Shuvo. Shuvo received an award from Dr Dipu Moni on July 5, 2019, and at the National Children's Prize held in 2018.  He was also honoured with an award from Science and Technology Affairs Minister Yeafesh Osman at The National Science and Technology Fair on June 26, 2018, and different prizes from upazila, district, and divisional shows and competitions. Businessman Santosh Karmakar and Dipti Karmakar, father and mother of Shuvo, said he is the older of their two children, and family members are happy and proud of Shuvo.

      "text": "Concern as cyclone Amphan is set to make landfall on Bangladesh coast on Wednesday evening Hundreds of Rohingyas who were recently rescued from the Bay of Bengal are safe and in a cyclone shelter at Bhashan Char at the time, the state minister for disaster management and relief said on Wednesday. Addressing an online press briefing from his office at the secretariat in Dhaka, Dr Enamur Rahman said: \"There are 120 cyclone shelters in Bhashan Char. However, all the Rohingya people currently living in the char have been taken to one of them.\" Bangladesh Navy personnel are taking care of them, he said, adding that all necessary facilities were being provided to the refugees. Some 308 Rohingyas were sent to live in Bhashan Char, an island off the coast of Noakhali, earlier this month after they were rescued from boats in the sea during their failed illegal attempt to travel to Malaysia on different occasions. The government plans to keep the refugees, who were among the 1.1 million living in the sprawling and cramped camps outside the town of Cox's Bazar, there permanently. Meanwhile, different quarters have expressed concern over the authorities moving the Rohingyas on the \"flood-prone island\" to storm shelters as cyclone Amphan, the strongest recorded in the region, is set to make landfall on Bangladesh coast on Wednesday evening. The eastern edge of the storm headed for Bangladesh and neighbouring India is also expected to batter Bhashan Char island. \"Each block has a cyclone centre and they have been moved to the centre,\" Bimal Chakma, a senior official of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission, told Reuters. The United Nations has called for the refugees to be moved to the camps in Cox's Bazar. Although the Cox's Bazar settlement, the world's largest refugee camp, is expected to escape the worst of the storm, the danger level has been raised to nine from six, signifying a severe threat. Heavy rain and high winds lashed the flimsy shelters, built on hills prone to landslides, and red flags were raised to warn refugees to stay inside. Aid workers say the cyclone could hamper efforts to control the novel coronavirus outbreak in the camps, which reported their first infections last week. \"It is already a huge challenge to contain the spread of coronavirus amongst the Rohingya refugees living in over-crowded camps, sharing water and toilet facilities,\" said Dipankar Datta, the country director of charity Oxfam in Bangladesh. Water-borne and other infections were also a threat, he added in a statement. Bangladeshis and Rohingya are among thousands of volunteers trained in emergency response measures who received life-jackets and torches. \"We are using megaphones and the mosque microphones to warn people,\" said Sabbir Ahmed, a 24-year-old Rohingya volunteer. Refugees have been told to head for madrasas and schools if the storm destroys shelters, he told Reuters by telephone, adding: \"If it hits the camps there will be huge destruction.\""

In her remarks, educationist Rasheda K Choudhury recalled that Sir Abed not only used to dream of a prosperous future for all but also tirelessly worked towards attaining it. \"He fought radicals all his life in order to empower women in society. There was even a time when a school run by Brac was set afire, but Sir Abed was relaxed about that.  \"I hope those groomed by Sir Abed will take the responsibility of taking his vision ahead and implement it fully,\" she added.  Chandra Shekhar Saha, executive member of National Crafts Council, said: \"Sir Abed never wanted any children to be deprived of schooling. He dreamt of making education an enjoyable exercise.\"  Sukhendra Kumar Sarkar, former treasurer of Brac University, noted that Sir Abed was a visionary who used to plan the future in advance. He added, \"Other than fighting poverty, education and health for all were the other two top priorities of his.\"  Among others, former cultural affairs minister and eminent media personality Asaduzzaman Noor, Martha Chen of Harvard University, Erum Mariam of Brac University, Majeda Khanam of Brac, and Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman, Brac's incumbent chairperson, were present at the event."

      "authors": "Reuters",
      "text": "Scientists say it will take several months to get results from trials testing the BCG vaccine to fight Covid-19 There is no vaccine against the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, that is spreading rapidly around the world. But scientists in several countries are testing a century-old tuberculosis (TB) vaccine to see if it might boost the immune system to reduce respiratory symptoms in people who get new coronavirus infections. Researchers in Australia and Europe are testing whether the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, introduced in the 1920s to fight tuberculosis, might be deployed to combat Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  Clinical trials are focused on two groups at high-risk for Covid-19: health care workers and the elderly. Here is what scientists know, and what they are trying to find out: How can a TB vaccine help with other infections? The BCG vaccine contains a live but weakened strain of tuberculosis bacteria that provokes the body to develop antibodies to attack TB bacteria. This is called an adaptive immune response, because the body develops a defence against a specific disease-causing microorganism, or pathogen, after encountering it. Most vaccines create an adaptive immune response to a single pathogen. Unlike other vaccines, the BCG vaccine may also boost the innate immune system, first-line defences that keep a variety of pathogens from entering the body or from establishing an infection. One study in Guinea-Bissau found 50% lower mortality rates in children vaccinated with BCG than in kids who did not get this vaccine. That is a much bigger drop in deaths than could be explained by a reduction in TB cases. Some studies have found similar reductions in respiratory infections among teens and the elderly.  What scientists do not know Scientists do not have data yet on the effect of BCG vaccination on coronaviruses in general or SARS-CoV-2 in particular. There are also many BCG vaccines, with different capacities to protect against various TB strains. Scientists need to determine which BCG vaccines might have the best ability to boost the innate immune system to fight Covid-19. Who should get the BCG vaccine right now? Scientists say it will take several months to get results from trials testing the BCG vaccine to fight Covid-19.  In the meantime, people should not rush to get it because it has not been widely tested in adults and might be harmful. Also, a run on the BCG vaccine to fight Covid-19 might cause shortages for children who need it to prevent TB. "

Subhankar Sarkar, an Indian citizen, asked if the prime minister possessed citizenship documents under Right to Information Act, on February 17. In response to his question, Under Secretary of the Indian Prime Minister's Office, Praveen Kumar wrote: \"Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is a citizen of India by birth in terms of Section 3 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and as such the question of his having a citizenship certificate which is for citizenship by registration does not arise.\"  Amid ongoing turmoil over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across India, the statement has created quite a stir. Ever since the right wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government passed the CAA, protests against the controversial citizenship law have continued across India, with every citizen worrying over how to prove citizenship. Even Modi fails to show the citizenship certificate.  At least 42 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim violence in northeast New Delhi, amid mounting international criticism that authorities failed to protect minority Muslims. The clashes began over a citizenship law that Modi's Hindu nationalist government introduced in December providing a path to Indian citizenship for six religious groups from neighbouring countries - but not Muslims. Critics say the law is discriminatory and comes on top of other measures such as withdrawal of autonomy for Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir, that has deepened disquiet about the future of India's 200 million Muslims. Critics of the government however blamed this week's violence on members of Modi's BJP, which was trounced in local Delhi elections at the beginning of the month.  The violence morphed into street battles between Hindu and Muslim groups, with the police largely ineffective in ending the violence."

      "text": "He proposed a three-point plan for India's current economic slowdown and social unrest Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has spoken out against the recent predicaments unravelling in India including the economic slowdown, social unrest, and global coronavirus epidemic. Over the past few weeks, Delhi has been subjected to extreme violence over religious disputes following the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which provides access to citizenship for religiously persecuted minorities, excluding Muslims.  Singh, in an op-ed in The Hindu, even criticized people who use past instances of such violence in India's history to justify the present violence in the country, adding that: \"Every act of sectarian violence is a blemish on Mahatma Gandhi's India.\" Singh suggested that the Indian government implement a three-point plan which includes taking measures to contain the coronavirus threat, withdrawing or amending the Citizenship Act, and creating a holistic fiscal stimulus plan to boost consumption demand.  By removing religious stipulations from the Citizenship Act, India would be ending the toxic social climate and foster national unity, as well as reviving the economy. India's economy is currently facing an economic slowdown due to a lack of new private investment, since investors are unwilling to take on new projects over the looming uncertainty of volatile social tensions.  The lack of investment translates to a lack of jobs and incomes, which in turn means a lack of consumption and demand in the economy. This lack of demand further suppresses private investments, leading to a vicious cycle.  Singh, a renowned economist, stated that no amount of tweaking of tax rates, showering of corporate incentives, or goading will propel Indian or foreign businesses to invest, when the risk of eruption of sudden violence in one's neighbourhood looms large. Furthermore, the fear of the coronavirus epidemic reaching India threatens to dampen economic growth, further exacerbating the dire situation of the Indian economy. Despite the ambiguity of the situation, Singh proposes that India launch a full-scale, mission-mode operation to counter the threat immediately. Moreover, Singh has said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi must convince the nation that he is cognizant of the dangers and reassure the nation that he can help tide over this period of violence and uncertainty as smoothly as possible. He must also provide details of a contingency plan for the threat of the coronavirus scare. He adds that the virus contagion and the slowing down of China can potentially open up an opportunity for India to unleash reforms to become a larger player in the global economy and vastly improve prosperity levels for millions of Indians. \"It is time to confront the harsh reality of the grave risks we face as a nation and address them squarely and sufficiently.\" "

      "text": "Being able to separate coronavirus from other common sicknesses such as cold or allergies may save people from unnecessary anxiety The coronavirus (Covid-19) has become an epidemic, infecting more than 100,000 people worldwide. While the chances of any individual person catching the virus are still low, it is natural that people may feel worried every time they get a sore throat or the beginnings of a bad cough. Therefore, being able to separate coronavirus from other common sicknesses such as cold or allergies may save people from unnecessary (or otherwise) anxiety.   If you have itchy eyes or runny nose you probably have allergies or a specific kind of cold \"The issue with seasonal allergies is that they affect the nose and eye,\" says Dr. Greg Poland, a professor of medicine and Infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic and director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. \"They tend to be nasal, and most symptoms are localized to the head, unless you also experience a rash.\" Coronavirus and flu symptoms tend to be more systemic \"The flu and the novel coronavirus, these affect other systems and the lower respiratory tract,\" Poland says.  He adds \"You probably won't have a runny nose, but what you might have is a sore throat, a cough, a fever or shortness of breath. So, it's a subtly different clinical diagnosis.\" He says it's very unlikely that allergies would lead to a fever. They generally don't cause shortness of breath either, unless the person has a preexisting condition like asthma. Allergy symptoms occur frequently, and are usually mild Dr. Greg Poland says that if you have similar symptoms around the same time each year then you probably have seasonal allergies. Over the counter medication and other regular health precautions may help you feel better in that case, reports CNN. Coronavirus and flu symptoms can retire you to bed rest \"If you have an acute case of coronavirus or flu, you will feel so tired, so achy, you'd basically be driven to bed. Everybody would see the difference,\" Poland says. \"Allergies may make you feel tired, but they're not going to cause severe muscle or joint ache.\" Mild flu and cold symptoms usually sort themselves out Proper rest and care will usually heal you from normal illness within a few days.  Coronavirus and severe flu symptoms could get worse over time If you have the flu or coronavirus you may get worse when you expect to get better. \"What would increase the suspicion of coronavirus would be if you were short of breath,\" says Poland. \"People can also develop pneumonia from the flu, which has a similar presentation, so either way you're going to want to seek medical attention.\" Allergies, cold, flu and coronavirus could have similar early symptoms Dr. Greg Poland says that initial stages of cold, allergies, flue and coronavirus can look very similar. That is why it is important to notice if the symptoms persist, especially if you are in an at-risk group, reports CNN. \"We're worried about older people, people with asthma or other lung diseases, people with heart disease or diabetes, and also pregnant women,\" he says. Coronavirus cases are usually situational Poland says if you think you have coronavirus any doctor is bound to ask you some contextual questions such as: \"You're like a detective, trying to accept and put together pieces of data,\" he says. \"If someone who hasn't left the middle of Kansas thinks they have the coronavirus, I would say take a Tylenol, have plenty of fluids and rest.\" Just because it isn't the coronavirus, doesn't mean it isn't serious The influenza virus has killed several times more people than the coronavirus during the same time period. And yet it is often dismissed as something far less dangerous. Analyzing data on the impact of these diseases may provide better understanding of their seriousness.  Conclusion While unnecessary anxiety of having the coronavirus is best avoided, it is a good idea to stay cautious, take preventive measures, be mindful of your medical history, and routinely check for symptoms."

A Dhaka court on December 2, 2019 issued the warrant against them in a case filed by Arab Bangladesh (AB) Bank. Following the court order, police on Wednesday conducted a drive at their residence in Gulshan 1 in the capital. Gulshan police station officer-in-charge (OC) MdKamruzzaman said they were trying to arrest them. According to banking sources, Latif Siddique's family members formed two companies - Dhaleshwari Limited and Majestica Holdings Ltd -- for printing press and real estate business. Laila Siddque, wife of Latif Siddique, is the chairman of the two companies, Anik Siddiqui, their son, is the managing director of those companies while Raina Farzin, their daughter, is the director of those companies, as per the sources. They took Tk55.62 crore from AB Bank, Tk56 crore from state-owned Janata Bank and Tk31 crore from Padma Bank. Majestica Holdings Ltd is among the top 300 defaulters' list, which was disclosed in parliament last year. Latif Siddique, the former MP from Tangail-4 seat, was in charge of the textiles and jute ministry in the Awami League's 2009-13 term. Dhaka Tribune reporter was trying to reach Anik Siddiqui over phone but he did not receive the phone. Talking to Dhaka Tribune, Tarique Afzal managing director of AB Bank, said: \"Now we are strict against all defaulters.\""

      "authors": "Sazzadur Rahman Sazzad, Panchagarh",
      "text": "Near about 500,000 to 1,000,000cft (Cubic Feet) topsoils are being used to make 3 to 4 million bricks every year Large-scale use of topsoil from vast areas of farmlands for brick manufacturing in Panchagarh has been inflicting catastrophic damage on agriculture as well the environment. Vast agricultural lands have been losing fertility as well as crop yield capacity for over decades due to the loss of topsoil--which is the outermost layer of soil with the highest concentration of organic matter. Farmers in the district have long been victims of exploitation and have been manipulated by local brokers to sell their fertile-most soil to brick kiln owners. In this way, around 52 brick kilns have been set up around the farmlands of Debiganj, Boda, and Atwari upazila, which are using fertile topsoil of thousand hectares of arable land to make millions of bricks every year. Collection of topsoil from farmlands surrounding brick kilns begins after the Aman harvest and continues for the next one and a half months, locals say. As most nutrients and organic properties along with beneficial microorganisms reside on the top part of the soil when removed, the soil becomes infertile; the bare chemical-infested soil residue washes into the adjacent water bodies, resulting in scores of environmental and health hazards. On a field visit, this correspondent saw numerous trucks filled with the soil, and the farmlands dug 10ft to 15ft under.  Near about 500,000 to 1,000,000cft (Cubic Feet) topsoils are being used to make 3 to 4 million bricks every year. Even though removing topsoil is a punishable offence, locals say neither the brick kiln owners nor the authorities abide by the law. They allege local political influencers are behind these atrocities. Dhananjay Rai, a resident of Debiganj's Nayanpara village, said he sold per bigha of topsoil from his land at Tk26,000. Jagadish Chandra Rai, manager of MML Bricks Kiln in Boda upazila, said they need 250,000 to 500,000cft soil each season to make 500,000 to 800,000 bricks. He said: \"We never face any objection from anyone regarding the use of topsoil. We never force farmers, in fact, they are willing to sell soil from their lands for the profits.\" Md Shamim Iqbal, upazila agriculture officer (UAO) of Debiganj, said: \"Due to this trend of diminishing topsoil at such a rapid rate, farmable lands and crop yields will decline in future as well as having devastating environmental impacts.\" Boda UAO Al Mamun Or-Rashid said the brick kiln owners are using a syndicate of brokers to manipulate the farmers to sell their lands. Touhidul Bari Babu, head of the Geography and Environmental Science department of Panchagarh Govt Women's College, said: \"The situation is truly alarming as fertilizers can longer make the soil fertile without putting a stop to the damage of nutrients in the soil.\" Md Abu Hanif, deputy director of the district's Department of Agricultural Extension, said: \"We can only build awareness among farmers so they stop selling topsoil. But, we are unable to take legal action against the brick kilns.\" Sabina Yasmin, deputy commissioner of Panchagarh, was unwilling to comment on the matter, while Debiganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer Prottoy Hasan said they will take measures to ensure proper awareness among farmers and legal actions against the offenders."

      "text": "Instead of being termed as a punishment house, the jail seems more like a skill development centre with all kinds of skills being taught to the inmates It is a common perception that jails are punishment centres where criminals are tortured and beaten up to change their criminal activities and bring change in them. However, the Kushtia Jail presents a different picture. Instead of being termed as a punishment house, the jail seems more like a skill development centre with all kinds of skills being taught to the inmates. The jail authorities here focus on making the prisoners self-reliant and help them channel their time and energy towards positive contribution to the society.  Established in 1968, the Kushtia Jail has the capacity to house 600 inmates. However, the jail currently houses 950 inmates, including 40 females. The initiative - which was started on June, 2017, by the Superintendent of Jail Md Zaker Hossain - is solely funded by the jail and works as a self-sufficient project where each inmate teaches another, said officials from Kushtia jail. The prisoners are engaged in many skillful activities including fabrication unit, weaving, handicrafts, dressmaking, power-loom, electrical and music training. In the fabrication unit, inmates make various items like Sari (a local garment worn by Bangladeshi women), Lungi (A garment worn by local Bangladeshi men), and monochords (one chord musical instrument) which are sold at the sales centre of the jail. Similarly, prisoners at the weaving unit manufacture handloom items like blankets, bedsheets, pillow covers, towels, fabric pieces, and hand-crafted products. Moreover, the prisoners take music and Arabic lessons every morning lessons from the districts' most esteemed teachers. They get to pursue their inner passion, organize regular cultural programs and even perform in front of guests visiting the prison. Prison authorities say, they identify the illiterate inmates as soon as they arrive at the prison, make a list, assess and enlist them to different groups to make the learning experience better and coherent, in order to help them achieve their goals in line with their interests. At the same time, a library has been set up inside the jail. The initiative has been taken to give prisoners a chance to read books. However, there is a lot of work left to be done in the library due to lack of funds. Sohel Rana, a prisoner who is sentenced to life at Kushtia Jail, is said to have helped 900 illiterate inmates so far to learn the basics. From 2017 to till date, 3,288 people have been taught to sign their names by him. Nahid Hasan, Nasim, Channu Miah, Fazle Rabbi, Nur Mohammad, who served at the jail in different times, said they were trained in electronics and now, as free citizens they are working as professional electricians and earning good money to support their families. Nur Mohammad, a resident of Chourhash area of Kushtia municipality, said that he too, like his other inmates, he feels dignified and empowered after getting back to his normal life. He said: \"I am a professional electrician and earn Tk600 each day. It feels good to be self reliant.\" Rubel Hossain of Sadar upazila said he is grateful to the jail authorities for his new life and said: \"I now work at a telecom shop and earn Tk10000 each month.  My life has changed.\" Parul's husband, Ismail, serves at the prison, and she said that he was previously  illiterate but can now can read and write. When contacted, Superintendent of Jail Md Zaker Hossain said their focus is on making the jail a correctional centre, rather than punishing them for which they are already convicted. \"We are working day and night to make the prisoners self-reliant so that they can live their lives as responsible citizens after finishing their terms here.\" \"The prisoners are getting half the amount of what their manufactured products are sold for and that can help them to re-initiate their learning when they get out,\" he added. Deputy Commissioner Md Aslam Hossain said: \"We are discussing with the concerned authorities to see if the prisoners can be helped  with loans that can help to kickstart their business after leaving the prison.\""

      "text": "Residential areas like Bashundhara and Gulshan showed AQI scores of 118 and 88 respectively Dhaka has ranked 14th worst on the world Air Quality Index (AQI) as extreme air pollution makes it one of the most polluted cities. On the real-time rankings, Dhaka showed an average AQI score of 99 at 10:02am on Wednesday, according to IQAir, which monitors global air quality. Dhaka's air quality was classified as \"moderate.\" Residential areas like Bashundhara and Gulshan showed AQI scores of 118 and 88 respectively. India's Delhi, China's Chengdu, and Vietnam's Hanoi occupied the first, second, and third spots in the list of cities with the worst air quality with AQI scores of 191, 168, and 163 respectively. A numerical value between 151 and 200 indicates that everyone may begin to experience health effects. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. Air quality between 201 and 300 is classified as \"very unhealthy.\" If the score is between 301 and 500, then it is classified as \"hazardous.\"  The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants -- Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh has been struggling with air pollution for a long time. Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Brick kilns, vehicles run on fuel containing higher levels of sulphur, as well as construction work, have all been identified as major sources of air pollution. Air quality further declines during the dry months -- from October to April -- but improves during the monsoon."

Jojo Rabbit is indeed a nod to the remarkable power of humour Rainer Maria Rilke, one of the most gifted German poets who is frequently quoted in Jojo Rabbit, appealed to his readers to \"let everything happen\" to them, to delight in the humbling embrace of all beauty and terror. And Taika Waititi's coming-of-age drama Jojo Rabbit is the rare convergence of these two profound, albeit opposite truths of life. Jojo Rabbit is a World War II satire revolving around a German boy named Jojo who joins a Hitler Youth camp and starts having qualms about the Third Reich afterwards when he discovers his mother has hidden a Jewish girl named Elsa in the crawlspace of their house.

What this miracle of a film does so effectively is that it attempts to take the power away from the fascist narrative and exposes its idiocy through comedy. It sheds light on the buffoonish petulance of the likes of Hitler, but does not reduce the horrors of the Holocaust, rather emasculates its perpetrators with the help of a stellar cast and a balanced script.    Thomasin McKenzie plays a Jewish girl named Elsa in Jojo Rabbit, following her acclaimed performance in 2018's Leave No Trace| IMDb Jojo is a lonely young boy whose father has gone to war, never to come back. He has in turn filled the absence of his father with blind fanaticism. Hitler heils has certainly helped him drown out the noise within his troubled mind. However, upon finding Elsa, constrained by his innate nobility and ostensible cowardice, Jojo slowly begins to question the Nazi juggernaut. Telling this story from a child's perspective is arguably what makes the film work.     Thomasin McKenzie, who plays Elsa, has delivered another brilliantly understated performance following her acclaimed role in Leave no Trace. Elsa - a creative Jewish girl - does not give in to rage; her resilience rises above the oppression inflicted upon her people. She is caged, yet appears to be the embodiment of the strength that keeps the spirit of resistance alive.  On the other hand, Scarlett Johansson, in the vibrant role of Jojo's single mother, manages to pull off one of her career-best performances to this date, by playing an elegantly witty character who is unafraid to go beyond the mere aesthetics of resistance and the good old convenient life for a just cause.   Scarlett Johansson has earned her first two Oscar nominations - Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress - the latter for Jojo Rabbit| IMDb The depiction of Nazis as good people is bound to make certain critics blast this film, much like the fate in store for the Oscar-winning German film The Lives of Others. In light of the current political divide, there is merit to this discussion.   In August, 2017, neo-Nazis paraded the streets of Charlottesville, chanting anti-Semitic slogans. The US President Trump later famously addressed \"the very fine people\" on both sides, pandering to some of his white supremacist base. Consequently, he established a moral equivalence that in all objectivity does not exist.  Thankfully, Taika Waititi is more tactful than that. He succeeds at finding the tricky balance between the evils of fascism and the allures of resistance. There is an astonishing poignancy beneath the surface of humour, and whenever it swells into a crescendo, the transition feels seamless.  As World War II approaches its end in the latter half of Jojo Rabbit, we as audience members find ourselves not laughing along with Hitler. Rather, we are laughing at him, chipping away at his racial hatred. Therein lies the brilliance of Jojo Rabbit. "

      "text": "Locals fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands The Kopotakkho River embankment suddenly collapsed Tuesday night, flooding 1,000 bighas of farmlands and fish enclosures in three low-lying villages in Assasuni upazila of Satkhira. Moreover, around 50 families have also become waterlogged in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishti Nandan villages under Pratapnagar union. Locals say the 100-ft dam was already in a risky state, so it naturally could not sustain the strong pressure of tidal current and collapsed into the bottom of the Kopotakkho River. Many local residents have started volunteering to repair the embankment with whatever materials currently available. They fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands. Contacted, Pratapnagar Union Parishad Chairman Jakir Hossain held the water development board responsible in this regard, saying it was their negligence that led to the collapse of the embankment every year. \"Despite repeated complaints and appeals seeking sustainable protection of the embankment, the water development board failed to acknowledge the urgency of the issue. \"Now, due to this recklessness, farmlands and fish enclosures on around 1,000 bighas of lands have been flooded in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishtinandan villages. Moreover, almost 50 families have become waterlogged.\" Contacted, Md Arifuzzaman, of the local water development board, after visiting the site said he had arranged sandbags for the temporary emergency repair of the damaged embankment to minimize the extent of damage and protect remaining lands. \"The higher authorities will be notified promptly so that the necessary steps may be taken to permanently repair embankment.\""

      "authors": "AFP",
      "text": "At least 266 people have been arrested for posting coronavirus-related information in 10 Asian countries Hundreds of people have been arrested across Asia for posting purported false coronavirus information, according to an AFP investigation, deepening concerns that growing government efforts to combat \"fake news\" will target the wrong people and silence dissent. From teenagers to a TV star, people have been wrongly detained under vaguely worded cybercrime laws or broad state-of-emergency powers ushered in since the outbreak began, rights groups say. \"Governments are using the 'fake news' label to dress up their rights-abusing efforts to censor views and statements that are at odds with whatever strategy they have taken to deal with the Covid-19 crisis,\" said Phil Robertson, Asia deputy director for Human Rights Watch (HRW). \"It's insane frankly. In many cases it's people being dragged out of their homes to the lock-up, put in pre-trial detention, in crowded spaces where they're more likely to get Covid-19.\" At least 266 people have been arrested for posting coronavirus-related information in 10 Asian countries, from Thailand to India and Mongolia, according to an AFP tally based on police reports. They include a local politician in India who claimed on Facebook that the government was downplaying virus fatalities, and a Malaysian TV personality made to pay a fine of several thousand US dollars after he posted a YouTube video criticising a hospital's handling of the pandemic. Authorities say criminalisation is needed to curb the online flood of dangerous fake cures and conspiracy theories that the World Health Organization (WHO) has called an \"infodemic.\" But HRW and other campaigners point to cases where opposition figures or journalists have been targeted - as well as questioning the fairness of arresting ordinary people who may not even realize they are spreading misinformation. A middle-aged woman in Sri Lanka spent three days in custody this week after posting a prank message on Facebook saying the president had tested positive for Covid-19, police said. In Cambodia, a Facebook pundit who posted a quote from Prime Minister Hun Sen was charged with incitement to commit felony and is facing up to two years in jail, according to a court warrant seen by AFP. Officials say Hun Sen was joking when he told motorbike taxi drivers to sell their vehicles if they cannot make money in the pandemic. 'Rumour mongering' Cambodian authorities have also detained four opposition politicians, according to HRW, while a local rights group and police sources said a 14-year-old girl was among more than a dozen people arrested. She was released soon after questioning with no charges. The surge in arrests in Asia focused on coronoavirus misinformation has come after various countries toughened laws or introduced new ones on so-called fake news. \"Regulating misinformation by either introducing new legislation or by expanding the scope of existing laws has been the trend in Asia for the last few years,\" said Masato Kajimoto, a journalism researcher at the University of Hong Kong. The pandemic has accelerated this because a crackdown can be perceived as protecting public health, rather than infringing on freedom of speech, he said. In Thailand, a state-of-emergency decree passed in late March criminalised sharing misinformation online about Covid-19 that could \"instigate fear.\" This is on top of the Computer Crimes Act, which has a five-year maximum jail penalty and is often used to stifle dissent online. The Philippines also recently adopted an emergency law giving it more powers to combat the pandemic, including arresting people who share false information about the disease. Nearly 100 people in India have been arrested for spreading virus misinformation under existing penal laws and the disaster management act - with punishments including up to one year in prison. \"While India lacks any specific fake news law, there do exist provisions of laws that can be used for 'rumour mongering,'\" said Apar Gupta, director of the Delhi-based Internet Freedom Foundation. \"It is fair to state that these laws are broadly phrased and can result in arbitrary action, given India's slow judicial system that also generally displays a prosecutorial bias,\" he said. Karuna Nandy, an Indian Supreme Court lawyer, told AFP that such arrests were particularly alarming in a lockdown, when courts are mostly shut."

      "headline": "Government troops seize highway in Syria as Turkey-Russia talks end inconclusively",
      "authors": "Reuters",
      "text": "In Ankara, talks between Turkey and Russian ended without agreement on stopping clashes in which 13 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Syria in one week Government forces seized control of a highway in northwest Syria for the first time since 2012 on Tuesday as they pressed their campaign to eradicate the last rebel strongholds in Idlib province and the Aleppo countryside, a war monitor said. In Ankara, talks between Turkey and Russian ended without agreement on stopping clashes in which 13 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Syria in one week. Relief agencies meanwhile said an exodus of hundreds of thousands of civilians from the afflicted areas was the largest such movement in nine years of war and a new humanitarian crisis was unfolding. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government forces had seized the entire length of the M5 highway after driving rebels from their last foothold on the road. The M5 runs from Aleppo in the north to the capital Damascus then on to southern Deraa. They took control of the highway after capturing a western suburb of Aleppo from insurgents. The latest advances by President Bashar al-Assad's Russian and Iranian-backed troops came after 13 Turkish soldiers were killed in the Idlib region in the past week, prompting some of the most serious confrontations between Ankara and Damascus of the war. Ankara deployed thousands of soldiers to stem the Syrian offensive. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels downed a helicopter believed to belong to the Syrian government in the town of Nairab, Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber reported on Tuesday. Since the new push began, government forces have recaptured more than 600 square km of territory and in recent days have taken control of dozens of towns and villages. Last week they recaptured the crossroads town of Saraqeb, on the M5. Turkey has several military personnel stationed there to prevent further Syrian advances after eight of its soldiers were killed by Syrian shelling. A Russian delegation arrived in Ankara on Saturday days after the attack to hold talks aimed at stopping clashes. On their final day of talks, a second Syrian attack on Turkish troops in the Taftanaz area killed five more troops. Ankara has said that it retaliated to both attacks, destroying several Syrian targets. It said would drive back Assad's forces unless they withdraw by the end of the month. It also told the Russian team that attacks against Turkish posts must stop immediately. The Russians left Turkey after talks ended on Monday, a Turkish diplomatic source said, with no apparent agreement. The Kremlin said on Tuesday all attacks on Russian and Syrian forces in Idlib had to stop.  Air raids Rescue teams in the region said Russian and Syrian war planes bombed several towns in Idlib, with most air raids on towns in western Aleppo, including a residential area in the city of Daraat Izza. At least 13 civilians were killed overnight in the air strikes, they said. The rapid advances by Assad's forces in Idlib have driven nearly 700,000 people from their homes towards the closed-off Turkish border in the past 10 weeks. Most of those displaced are women and children. \"This is, from our initial analysis, the largest number of people in a single period since the Syrian crisis began almost nine years ago,\" Jens Laerke, spokesman for the United Nations' OCHA humanitarian agency, told reporters in Geneva. \"So it's the fastest growing displacement we have ever seen in the country. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Andrej Mahecic said the harsh winter weather was making their suffering worse and shelter was hard to find. \"Even finding a place in an unfinished building is becoming nearly impossible,\" he said, adding that mosques were full. Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot absorb any more. It said it will halt new migrant waves from Idlib and its military will remain there. One Turkish politician urged President Tayyip Erdogan to go further. \"There will be no peace in Turkey until Assad is brought down from his throne. Turkey must start plans to enter Damascus now, and annihilate the cruel ones,\" said Devlet Bahceli, chairman of Erdogan's nationalist partner party. Witnesses and rebels said on Tuesday a new column of Turkish reinforcements, including tanks, rocket launchers and armoured vehicles, crossed the border into Idlib overnight. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels have also begun an new offensive against the government forces near army-controlled Saraqeb and Nairab to push troops away from Idlib city, where more than one million people live. The battle for Idlib is a crucial stage of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of combatants and civilians, made millions refugees in their own country or overseas, and fractured the wider Middle East since it broke out amid the Arab Spring in 2011. Forces arrayed against Assad, Syria's ruler for nearly 20 years, have failed to dislodge him but he now presides over a devastated country. Moscow's military intervention in 2015 helped swing the war decisively in Assad's favour. Despite being on opposing sides, Turkey and Russia collaborate for a political solution to the conflict."

      "authors": "Anir Chowdhury",
      "text": "We must remain united in tackling the coronavirus The Covid-19 is wreaking havoc on the world. Bangladesh is yet to be hit hard, but if the rest of the world provides any indication, the threat of the coronavirus is serious, real, and exponential.  And an exponential crisis deserves an exponential response. The number of calls coming into the national information hotline 333 and Shastho Batayon 16263 has gone up tenfold in the last few days, crossing 100,00 per day. How do we handle such volume with a few call centre agents and a few doctors who used to handle these calls? Enter an uber-doctor model where the calls will be routed to hundreds of doctors who have registered their availability to take calls. This will not only calm a lot of panicked callers but also will reduce pressure on our healthcare system. This is the beginning of Bangladesh's exponential response to dealing with the coronavirus challenge. As calamitous as coronavirus is, it is forcing us to rethink how we live, work, and learn. Beyond the imminent healthcare challenge, as we face the possibility of small and large lockdowns -- both self-imposed and state-imposed -- for indefinite periods of time, like many megacities and advanced countries are going through now, citizens are asking important questions. How do my children continue their education during the outbreak? How does food get transported to cities? How do medicines get delivered across the country? How do we make payments for goods and services? How do we make goods? Bangladesh's quest for digitization is well-documented. It has been a cornerstone of the government's transformation drive since 2009, and remarkable achievements have been made. Sometimes, breaking the status quo, and bringing true change, requires a crisis. While this crisis may not be in any way welcome, it forces us to adopt an alternative, often at breakneck efficiency. Innovations during World War II occurred at an astonishing pace for the two opposing sides. With the added competition, the need to rebuild and retaliate brought out incredible innovations such as nuclear power, penicillin, jet engines, radar, and the first computer. All these have changed our lives for the better. The coronavirus threat is accelerating our adoption of a digital lifestyle. It is also greatly increasing the speed with which certain initiatives are getting done. The coronavirus has naturally increased the necessity to have trained medical professionals to test and combat it. As I write this, there are 2,000 doctors who are being certified to fight the coronavirus using the government's e-learning platform MuktoPaath. Under normal circumstances, this would have taken weeks of correspondence, the formation of committees to approve content, delivery of most of the content through old-style physical classrooms, and procurement of a fraction of the content in audiovisual format for e-learning. A process spanning 9-12 months. Optimistically! Compare that with the two days that it took in the time of coronavirus. All digital with no cost to the exchequer. Simultaneously, the government's information 333 hotline was made \"corona-ready\" in one day and is now being used as a mass initial triage tool for high-risk cases. Call the number, and you immediately get asked a series of questions about whether you are high risk or not. This has been possible for two reasons. One, we are using tools and technologies that already exist by just integrating and repurposing them. Two, all types of public agencies, private companies, civil society organizations, academia, startups, student groups have come together to fight together.  Bangladesh is probably unique in the way a crisis unites the entire society. It happened in 1971 and it happens during every flood and every Rana Plaza-like incident. Over 30 healthcare organizations have immediately responded to the government's call to action to find healthcare response. Tens of education companies are working with the government to scale up e-learning. Over 50 innovative logistics and e-commerce companies are coming up with how food, medicines, and other necessities will move across the country.  The telecom industry is doing its part by working very closely with the government to identify high-risk cases. Suddenly, Bangladesh, a country notorious for its lack of speed and initiative, is being forced to be effective and efficient, and each sector is working parallelly to fight the coronavirus. On March 20, the country saw its first digital press conference. In an unprecedented event, 100 participants including tens of journalists came together, not physically, but over video conference, with the session conducted by the ICT Minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak. Certainly a model in the time of social distancing. All of these initiatives are being made possible because of the great leaps Bangladesh has made in digitization, where the technological and human building blocks -- much like those of a child's lego set -- are coming together to create an avalanche effect.  I am confident that this avalanche effect will continue to grow, and Bangladesh will successfully navigate the threat of the coronavirus and come away as a better, more impactful nation.

      "headline": "What happened to the Hippocratic Oath?",
      "authors": "Julian Francis",
      "text": "Many hospitals have been turning away patients for fear of Covid-19, with tragic consequences It was shocking to read, a few days ago, that a doctor was not able to manage to get her father, a senior government official with kidney complications, admitted in hospital unless he had been tested for Covid-19 and had a certificate.  According to the reports which I read, she tried to get him admitted to as many as a dozen hospitals, government and private. Without the appropriate ICU treatment, he died. It would appear that these hospitals, collectively, caused the patient's death.  If the country was not in the middle of a pandemic, I would have suggested that this sort of case -- many others similar to this have been reported in the media -- should be investigated by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council as it is empowered by a 1980 act of parliament to \"look after public interest by maintaining proper medical and dental standards.\"  In any case, some way should be found to reprimand the various hospital authorities concerned and the individual doctors who were responsible for hastening the unfortunate death of this man. In addition, it has been reported that dialysis patients who go to hospitals once or twice a week for dialysis are being turned away if they do not have a certificate to say that they are not infected by coronavirus.  Doctors in Bangladesh, on qualification, sign up to a Bangladesh version of the 1948 World Medical Association's \"Declaration of Geneva.\" This is a modern version of what is known as the Hippocratic Oath, which is the promise that doctors make to keep to the principles of the medical profession.  This appalling attitude of doctors reminds me of the many government doctors who refuse to be posted in rural areas at the beginning of their careers. They fail to see that rural experience could broaden their education, including widening their knowledge of medicinal herbs and plants. On another medically related matter, it is good to learn that finally the low cost rapid test kits for coronavirus, developed by Gonoshasthaya Kendra (GK), have been handed over to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) for performance trial. It is understood that progress has only been possible by intervention at the highest level.   There are many in the medical and pharmaceutical fields who have not forgiven Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury, the founder of GK, for his role in the formulation of the National Drug Policy in 1982 which then banned the importation of over 1,700 locally and internationally produced drugs which were either dangerous, or combinations of similar or incompatible ingredients, or because they could be produced by local companies instead of being imported.  A list of essential drugs, in their generic forms, was drawn up for use in all systems of the health care system. This action was met with howls of protest from the transnational drug companies, who feared a serious loss of profits if more countries followed Bangladesh's example. Later on in 1994, the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade liberalized international trade and therefore made such \"restraints on trade\" illegal, thus favouring the interests of large transnational companies. They then became free to flood the Bangladesh market with non-essential pharmaceutical products. A contributory factor to the demise of the drugs policy in Bangladesh was the failure of the Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA) to support it. Many doctors opposed the legislation from the outset, seeing it as a threat to their professional freedom; those who owned a pharmacy had a financial interest in prescribing lavishly. Fast forward to 2020, Covid-19 and the promotion of Remdesivir for treatment of coronavirus. Not yet approved, as far as I am aware, anywhere in the world, clinical trials are reported to have shown that on acutely ill patients, recovery time of 15 days has come down to 11 days. Many companies, including in Bangladesh, are surging ahead to produce the drug, but at what cost?  Figures per treatment have been reported to vary between $390 and $4,500. This is both confusing and mind-boggling, to say the least. I am lost for more words!  Julian Francis has been associated with relief and development activities of Bangladesh since the War of Liberation. In 2012, the government of Bangladesh awarded him the 'Friends of Liberation War Honour' in recognition of his work among the refugees in India in 1971, and in 2018 honoured him with full Bangladesh citizenship."

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "Teesta deal remains uncertain; Indian foreign secretary says NRC, CAA will have no impact on Bangladesh; Modi's Dhaka visit would fully exemplify India's strong sentiment of goodwill  Visiting Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla has said within 2020, New Delhi expects to finalize deals with Bangladesh regarding water sharing of seven common rivers, except the Teesta River. He said both the countries need to expedite harmonization the data of water flow of the rivers so that water sharing can be finalized as early as possible. Shringla made the statement while addressing a seminar on Bangladesh-India relations as the keynote speaker at a Dhaka hotel on Monday, reports BSS. Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) and Indian High Commission in Dhaka jointly organized the seminar titled \"Bangladesh and India: A Promising Future.\" The Indian foreign secretary, however, appeared to be uncertain about the deal on Teesta River saying an agreement on water sharing of this particular stream could only be finalized on the basis of consensus of all the stakeholders, an apparent reference to India's West Bengal state. Prime Minister's International Affairs Adviser Dr Gowher Rizvi attended the program as the chief guest. Shringla, who previously served as Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka, however, said the Indian side was working on concluding the process of the agreement as early as possible. \"We know this is an emotive issue on both side of the border but there is no diminution of the commitment of our government,\" he told the seminar. In August last, Bangladesh and Indian agreed on preparing a framework on interim water-sharing agreements on seven rivers -- Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla, Feni and Dudhkumar. Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Riva Ganguly Das and BIISS Chairman Fazlul Karim also spoke at the program, among others. The Indian foreign secretary said India and Bangladesh recognize there is ample room for progress on each of the rivers that both the neighbours share while serious dialogue has resumed between the officials responsible for water sharing matter since August 2019. \"Let me assure our friends here that we remain committed to finding the best possible solutions to sharing scarcities and hardships fairly during the dry season,\" he said. He said good arrangements to share waters of the 54 transboundary rivers in fair and environmentally sustainable manner lies in broader national interests of the two nations. India sees no NRC, CAA impact The visiting Indian secretary said the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will have no impact on Bangladesh, reports UNB. \"These are purely internal to India,\" Shringla said. \"Let me clearly state here what our leadership has repeatedly confirmed at the highest level to the government of Bangladesh: this is a process that is entirely internal to India. Therefore, there'll be no implications for the government and the people of Bangladesh. You've our assurance on that count,\" he explained. Modi's visit India's top foreign ministry bureaucrat said Narendra Modi's Dhaka visit later this month would fully exemplify \"India's strong sentiment of goodwill, trust and respect for Bangladesh\". Indian Prime Minister Modi has been specially invited to participate in the inaugural ceremony of Mujib Year later this month. \"We are looking forward to this visit ... because Bangabandhu is just so iconic - as a globally-recognized statesman and iconic symbol of liberation for Bangladesh and for our subcontinent,\" he said. In India, he said: \"There is a special resonance to his name. He is as revered and as remembered in India, as he is here in Bangladesh.\" Rohingya issue The Indian foreign secretary said there is also often interest and sometimes \"uninformed speculation\" about their position on the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine State of Myanmar, and its impact upon Bangladesh. \"Let me clearly say that India is deeply appreciative of the spirit of humanism that motivated Bangladesh to offer shelter to nearly one million displaced people. And we fully recognize and sympathize with the enormous burden that you're facing. \"As the only country that's an actual neighbour of both Bangladesh and Myanmar, we're committed to offering the fullest support for any mutually-acceptable solution that'll enable the earliest possible return of displaced persons to their homes in Rakhine State and to a life of dignity,\" he said adding that this should be done in a manner that is \"safe, secure and sustainable\". Border killing Responding a question why border killings still took place after both border guards agreed to use non-lethal weapons the Indian foreign secretary attributed the incidents to cross-border criminal activities.  He claimed that the casualty figures of Indians was equal to that of Bangladeshis but acknowledged that the border killing issue was consistently coming up in Bangladesh-India relationship. \"It is the responsibility of border forces on both sides to ensure that the border is respected and the place is kept safe stopping criminal activities,\" Shringla said adding that \"every death on the border was something that was a problematic issue. Shringla suggested improving security, creating zero criminal activities, more cooperation, more joint patrolling and common border management plan, and bringing deaths zero level along the frontier. Trade issues Shringla said they are also working more closely to simplify and expand trade as easier and simpler trading systems offer them scope to generate wealth and create jobs on both sides. He said there is enormous untapped potential for businesses to establish footholds in each other's market. \"And we, as governments, must make extra efforts facilitate our businesspersons and entrepreneurs doing business in each other's country.\" Shringla arrived in Dhaka on a two-day visit on Monday morning and upon arrival at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, he was received by his Bangladesh counterpart Masud Bin Momen."

Momen was talking to reporters at International Mother Language Institute after a meeting of sub-committee of celebration of the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Tuesday, reports UNB. Chief coordinator of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Birth Centenary Celebration National Implementation Committee Dr Kamal Abdul Naser Chowdhury and former foreign minister AH Mahmood Ali were present at the meeting, among others. The minister said Bangladesh has adopted a \"balanced policy\" without any deviation from the path shown by father of the Nation - \"friendship to all and malice towards none\". \"We have good relations with everybody,\" he told reporters mentioning countries like India, China and the USA.   When asked about escalating tensions between Iran and the USA and any possibility of third world war, the foreign minister said: \"Hope not, I do not think there will be a third world war.\"  Momen hoped that Bangladesh nationals in Iraq will remain safe since there are some targeted attacks. In this globalized world, he said peace and stability are must and there will be negative impacts if the peace and stability are hampered in any part of the world. He said they are in touch with Bangladesh Mission in Iraq and Bangladeshis so far remain safe. Earlier, Bangladesh Ambassador in Baghdad Abu Maksud M Forhad assured Bangladesh nationals living in Iraq of providing all sorts of support and urged them not to get worried and lose their mental strength. In a video message, he said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is in touch and enquiring about their condition round the clock. He said they will remain available round the clock for any support that may be required. The video message was issued for Bangladesh nationals amid escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran following the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani near Baghdad airport on January 3. Over 200,000 Bangladesh nationals are believed to be living in Iraq. On Friday, the Bangladesh Embassy in Baghdad requested Bangladeshi expatriates in Iraq to stay alert and maintain caution considering the current security situation in the Middle-Eastern country. The embassy will remain open 24/7 to extend consular services to the expatriates. Everyone has been requested to extend cooperation. Between 2009 and November last year, 75,748 Bangladeshis went to Iraq for work, according to the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training."

      "text": "Out of the funding EUR18.5 million will help the most vulnerable groups among refugees and host communities in Bangladesh The European Commission is releasing EUR31 million in humanitarian aid to address the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh and Myanmar. European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic has said the Rohingya crisis is in its third year and it is more important than ever to maintain their support and not forget those that remain dependent on humanitarian aid to survive, reports UNB. The European commissioner said: \"We are committed to supporting both refugees and host communities in Cox's Bazar, as well as to the vulnerable Rohingya in Myanmar.\" \"It will ensure that those most in need continue to receive life-saving assistance, while being protected from the effects of flood and other hazards.\" Out of the funding announced on Wednesday, EUR18.5 million will help the most vulnerable groups among refugees and host communities in Bangladesh, according to the European Commission. This will be done by providing critical health care, food assistance and education in emergencies. Another EUR3.5 million will go towards building the local communities' capacities to prepare for and manage natural disasters.

Protection is also at the core of this support, with a specific focus on registration and documentation. Another EUR2.5 million will boost the local preparedness system in case of conflict or natural disasters. Humanitarian aid  In 2019 alone, the European Union provided close to EUR27 million in humanitarian aid for vulnerable Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshis in Cox's Bazar and other parts of the country, as well as EUR9 million to address the immediate needs of displaced and conflict-affected communities in Myanmar. September 2019 marked two years since the massive influx of over 700,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar to Bangladesh, following violence in Northern Rakhine. In total, almost one million refugees are living in camps in the Cox's Bazar district and are fully reliant on humanitarian assistance. Since 2017, the European Union has provided over EUR150 million in humanitarian aid to respond to the Rohingya crisis both in Myanmar and in Bangladesh. File photo: Rohingya refugees stretch their hands to receive aid distributed by local organisations at Balukhali makeshift refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, September 14, 2017 | Reuters This includes basic humanitarian assistance for Rohingya populations, both for those who have been living in displacement in Bangladesh for many years and for the newly arrived, and host communities living close to the refugee settlements. The EU provides shelters, health care, water and sanitation support, nutrition assistance, education, and protection services. Approximately 600,000 remaining Rohingya people in Myanmar's Rakhine continue to suffer from a protracted human right crisis, with very limited access to basic services and viable livelihood opportunities due to strict movement restrictions and denied citizenship and rights. In 2019, a new conflict between the Burmese army and the Arakan Army, an ethnic Rakhine armed group, has caused new displacement of ethnic Rakhine population. The total number of new internally displaced persons in Rakhine State has risen to 70,000 spread over 106 sites."

The holy fasting month of Ramadan begins next week. Saudi Arabia in mid-March stopped people performing their five daily prayers and the weekly Friday prayer inside mosques as part of efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus. On Thursday, the Prophet's Mosque in the holy city of Medina said it was banning events which dispense evening meals in the mosque to those in need during Ramadan to break their daily fast. The kingdom has reported 6,380 cases of Covid-19, the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, and 83 deaths so far."

      "text": "The official death toll since the outbreak in the country has risen to 22,745 Deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy rose by 575 on Friday, up from 525 the day before, while the number of new cases declined slightly and scientists warned that infections were now mainly happening among family members. The daily tally of new cases stood at 3,493, down from a previous 3,786, with both deaths and infections extending the broadly stable situation in place over the last 12 days. This plateau is considerably lower than the peaks reached around the end of March, but the downtrend has not proceeded as was widely hoped in a country that has been in lockdown for almost six weeks. \"Probably most of the infections that have occurred since the lockdown have occurred within families,\" Giovanni Rezza, a director of Italy's top health body, the Superior Health Institute (ISS), told a news conference. Nuclear physicist Paolo Branchini, who has been focusing on the trend of cases and deaths in Italy, told daily Corriere della Sera on Friday that the lockdown initially put a lid on infections but had now \"exhausted its beneficial effect\". Branchini said that because the main source of infections was now within families, the only way to reduce deaths and cases further was to put all people who tested positive in dedicated centres away from their relatives. The official death toll since the outbreak came to light on February 21, has risen to 22,745, the Civil Protection Agency said, the second highest in the world after that of the United States. However, the Italian authorities acknowledge that the true number of fatalities is much higher. The Superior Health Institute said a survey on a sample of nursing homes suggested more than 40% of residents who died from February 1 to April 15 had either tested positive for the new coronavirus or had symptoms consistent with the disease. Restive regions The government has said its tough restrictions on movement and the closure of most businesses will continue at least until May 3, but there is not yet any clear plan over to what extent, or how gradually, it will then be lifted. In the meantime, some of Italy's 20 regions are threatening to take autonomous action. Luca Zaia, the head of the northern Veneto region which has made particular progress in bringing the outbreak under control, said on Friday he wanted to relax restrictions before May 3. \"The lockdown doesn't exist anymore,\" Zaia told reporters, in reference to the government having allowed a few types of business to reopen over the last week. In response, the chief of the southern Campania region around Naples, Vincenzo De Luca, said if northern regions did not respect all the curbs in place, Campania would \"close its borders\" and refuse entry to non-residents for any reason. The outbreak remains heavily concentrated in the northern regions of Lombardy, around the financial capital Milan, and neighbouring Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna. The number of officially confirmed cases in Italy on Friday totalled 172,434, the third highest global tally behind those of the United States and Spain."

The suicide bomber wanted to target rally of a religious group, but blew himself up when police stopped him, Abdul Razzaq Cheema, Quetta police chief, told reporters. Last month, 13 people were killed in Quetta when blast ripped through a mosque during evening prayers. Mineral-rich Balochistan province is at the centre of the $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is part of Beijing's massive Belt and Road infrastructure project. Violence in Balochistan has fuelled concerns about the security of projects such as a planned energy link from western China to Pakistan's southern port of Gwadar."

      "authors": "AFP",
      "text": "The patient, who revealed his identity this week as Adam Castillejo, 40, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003  A second patient has been cured of HIV after undergoing stem cell transplant treatment, doctors said Tuesday, after finding no trace of infection 30 months after he stopped traditional treatment. The so-called \"London Patient\", a cancer sufferer originally from Venezuela, made headlines last year when researchers at the University of Cambridge reported they had found no trace of the AIDS-causing virus in his blood for 18 months. Ravindra Gupta, lead author of the study published in The Lancet HIV, said the new test results were \"even more remarkable\" and likely demonstrated the patient was cured. \"We've tested a sizeable set of sites that HIV likes to hide in and they are all pretty much negative for an active virus,\" Gupta told AFP. The patient, who revealed his identity this week as Adam Castillejo, 40, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and had been on medication to keep the disease in check since 2012. Later that year, he was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a deadly cancer. In 2016 he underwent a bone marrow transplant to treat blood cancer, receiving stem cells from donors with a genetic mutation present in less than one percent of Europeans that prevents HIV from taking hold. He becomes only the second person to be cured of HIV after American Timothy Brown, known as the \"Berlin Patient\", recovered from HIV in 2011 following similar treatment. Viral tests of Castillejo's cerebral fluid, intestinal tissue and lymphoid tissue more than two years after stopping antiretroviral treatment showed no active infection. Gupta said the tests uncovered HIV \"fossils\" -- fragments of the virus that were now incapable of reproducing, and were therefore safe. \"We'd expect that,\" he said. \"It's quite hard to imagine that all trace of a virus that infects billions of cells was eliminated from the body.\" Ethical dilemma  Researchers cautioned that the breakthrough did not constitute a generalised cure for HIV, which leads to nearly one million deaths every year. Castillejo's treatment was a \"last resort\" as his blood cancer would likely have killed him without intervention, according to Gupta. The Cambridge doctor said that there were \"several other\" patients who had undergone similar treatment but who were less far along in their remission. \"There will probably be more but they will take time,\" he said. Researchers are currently weighing up whether or not patients suffering from drug-resistant forms of HIV might be eligible for stem cell transplants in future, something Gupta said would require careful ethical consideration. \"You'd have to weigh up the fact that there's a 10-percent mortality rate from doing a stem-cell transplant against what the risk of death would be if we did nothing,\" he said. Commenting on The Lancet study, Sharon Lewin, an infectious disease expert at the University of Melbourne, said the findings could provide comfort to patients. But she advised caution. \"Given the large number of cells sampled here and the absence of any intact virus, is the London patient cured?\" she said. \"Unfortunately in the end, only time will tell.\""

      "text": "A spat between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic escalated when United States President Donald Trump angered China by referring to the pathogen as the 'Chinese Virus' Coronavirus disease or Covid-19 is an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus. It is now an officially declared global pandemic. The number of coronavirus cases globally stood at 202,270 with 8,212 deaths, across 167 countries and territories at 5pm Wednesday, according to a tally compiled by Dhaka Tribune from official sources. A lot of explanations have been advanced regarding the source of the coronavirus. Understandably, public-health officials want to pin down the virus's source so that they can prevent new outbreaks.  A lot of conspiracy theories are also making the rounds. The question essentially boils down to one point: was Covid-19 developed in a laboratory, and is it being used as a biological weapon? A related question is whether the virus was made in the laboratory purposefully, or did the virus made in the laboratory accidentally escape the laboratory.  The lab-escape theory is so far the more widely accepted conspiracy theory.  Chinese authorities maintain that Covid-19 likely originated at a market in Wuhan where people were selling wild animals. But Iranian, Russian, and some Chinese media outlets claim that the emerging public health crisis comes from US biological weapons.  A spat between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic escalated when United States President Donald Trump angered China by referring to the pathogen as the \"Chinese Virus.\" The two countries have sparred over the origin of the virus for days, with a Chinese official promoting theories claiming it was brought to China by the US army and Washington officials using terms seen as stigmatizing a nation.  \"The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus,\" Trump tweeted on Monday night. Some skepticals including politicians in the US and China have both suggested that the Covid-19 may actually be a bioweapon that was manufactured in a lab.  The only difference between their conspiracy theories is who's being accused of doing the manufacturing. On the one corner are some people in the US who are hinting or in some cases openly claiming that China put together this virus.  Steve Mosher, a social scientist, wrote on February 22 an opinion piece for the New York Post entitled, \"Don't buy China's story: The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab.\"  In the piece, Mosher summarises why he believes Covid-19 may have been accidentally spread by China's National Biosafety Laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where researchers have studied bat coronaviruses.  Mosher says that the lab is less than 10 miles away from the seafood market where a clustre of Covid-19 cases was first discovered. Mosher believes that the said lab is located in the Institute of Virology in Wuhan, where the dangerous pathogens were purportedly kept and looked at as potential bioweapons.  There were reports that in the 2003 SARS outbreak, the SARS-CoV virus escaped from virology labs in China. He says Chinese virologist and bioweapons expert Major General Chen Wei's visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology with military scientists in January was an exercise in damage control. But not only in China, there are at least six same kind of facilities in the US in Georgia, Maryland, Texas and Montana.  According to the Federation of American Scientists website, seven others may be planned, under construction, or possibly finished in various cities such as Massachusetts, and Virginia. These labs also study and house a range of dangerous pathogens.  Not to be outdone, some in China have made similar suggestions, except that it's the US that built the virus and released it in China.  One of the most popular topics on the Chinese microblog Weibo was a one-minute clip of a US congressional hearing this week on how the country was dealing with the coronavirus. In the video posted by the People's Daily, Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is asked whether there may have been deaths attributed to influenza that could actually have been the result of Covid-19.  Redfield responds in the affirmative: \"Some cases have been actually diagnosed that way in the United States today.\" Redfield's answer was enough to add fuel to a conspiracy theory that has been gaining traction over the past two weeks in China - that the coronavirus did not originate in China but may have come from the US instead. \"The US has finally acknowledged that among those who had died of the influenza previously were cases of the coronavirus. The true source of the virus was the US!\" one commentator said.  \"The US owes the world, especially China, an apology,\" another said. \"American coronavirus,\" one wrote. The theory has gained traction over the past few weeks, after a respected epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, said in a passing remark at a press conference on February 27 that although the virus first appeared in China \"it may not have originated in China.\" Zhong later clarified his statement, saying that the first place where a disease is discovered does not \"equate to it being the source.\"  China's ambassador to South Africa said last week on Twitter that the virus was not necessarily \"made in China.\" So till now it looks like conspiracy theorists on both sides haven't really provided any compelling evidence that SARS-CoV2 was produced in a lab, whether in the US, in China, in Iran or in the other world."

The students started their demonstration in front of the university's academic building A around 11am to press home their four-point demand. The demands are: resignation of the current student adviser Md Omar Faruk, appointment of the next student adviser from a list of names prepared by students, cease of involvement by the Physics department head Dr Shamsun Nahar and the student adviser Md Omar Faruk in any academic activities of the victim student's batch, and an appropriate explanation from the department head as to why she failed to take actions during the incident being present at the scene. Earlier on February 29, during the golden jubilee celebration at the university, a local college teacher threatened a physics department student. At the time both the department head and student adviser were present but failed take any action. Later on March 2, when the students of the department presented their four point demand before the department head, an altercation broke between the two party. As a result on March 4, the department head issued a notice suspending all exams sine die.  Regarding the matter, School of Physical Sciences Dean Dr Md Sajedul Karim said: \"I have had discussions with the students who are protesting. I have conveyed their demands to the teachers concerned. The situation may be resolved with everyone's cooperation.\" However, physics department head Prof Dr Shamsun Nanhar Begum could not be reached for a quote on this matter. "

      "text": "Soleimani's remains and those of five other Iranians - all Guards members - killed in the US drone strike had arrived at Ahvaz airport before dawn Mourners flooded the Iranian cities of Ahvaz and Mashhad on Sunday, weeping and beating their chests in homage to top general Qasem Soleimani who was killed in a US strike in Baghdad. Soleimani's remains and those of five other Iranians - all Guards members - killed in the US drone strike had arrived at Ahvaz airport before dawn, news agency ISNA said. With them were the remains of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary umbrella group, who was also killed in the US strike. Soleimani's remains arrived in Mashhad in the afternoon and are due to be flown to Tehran for more tributes on on Sunday evening. Today, Khamenei is expected to pray over Soleimani's remains at Tehran University before a procession to Azadi Square. His remains are then due to be taken to the holy city of Qom for a ceremony at Masumeh shrine, ahead of a funeral tomorrow in his hometown Kerman. 'Death to America' \"Death to America,\" mourners chanted as they packed Ahvaz's streets and a long bridge spanning a river in the southwestern city to receive the casket containing Soleimani's remains. As Shia chants resonated in the air, people held portraits of the man seen as a hero of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and for spearheading Iran's Middle East operations as commander of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force. In the northeastern city of Mashhad, scores took to streets around the Imam Reza shrine and, addressing the US, chanted \"Be afraid of your own shadow.\" Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike on Friday near Baghdad airport, shocking the Islamic republic. He was 62. The attack was ordered by President Donald Trump, who said the Quds commander had been planning an \"imminent\" attack on US diplomats and forces in Iraq.  Soleimani's assassination ratcheted up tensions between arch-enemies Tehran and Washington and sparked fears of a new Middle East war. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed \"severe revenge\" and declared three days of mourning. 'Terrorist in a suit'  Iran's top diplomat Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that \"targeting cultural sites is a WAR CRIME.\" For Iran's army chief, Trump's threat was an attempt to distract the world from Soleimani's \"unjustifiable\" assassination. \"I doubt they have the courage to initiate\" a conflict, said Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi. Iran's communications minister, Mohammad Javad Jahromi, branded Trump a \"terrorist in a suit\" and said in a tweet that he is \"like IS, like Hitler, like Genghis (Khan)! They all hate cultures.\" US-Iran tensions escalated in 2018 when Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark accord that gave Tehran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program. A year on, Iran began hitting back by reducing its nuclear commitments with a series of steps every 60 days, the most recent deadline passing on Saturday. Cyber attack  In possible act of retaliation, hackers claiming to be from Iran breached the website of a little-known US government agency and threatened more cyber attacks. The website of the Federal Depository Library Program was replaced with a page titled \"Iranian Hackers!\" that displayed images of Khamenei and the Islamic republic's flag."

      "headline": "How to not kill your kids during coronavirus lockdown",
      "authors": "AFP, Paris",
      "text": "Child protection professionals have real worries about the risks with families locked up 24/7 together for an indefinite period \"I've put the kids in the freezer, so everything's cool now.\" Parents may be joking on social media about their childcare hell as more and more countries go into lockdown with the coronavirus.  But child protection professionals are not laughing. They have real worries about the risks with families locked up 24/7 together for an indefinite period. \"You will no doubt want to throw your children out the window at some point. That's normal,\" psychologist Moira Mikolajczak told AFP. \"What isn't normal, is to do that,\" she warned, as she urged parents to give themselves a break and \"not try to be Superman or Superwoman\". While governments across Europe from Ireland to Greece have been having schools send lessons and activity ideas by email to occupy bored children, social media is full of testimony from parents frazzled at having to be both teacher and playmate to their kids. Grassroots groups, however, are trying to step into the gap with the French feminist collective #NousToutes (\"All of Us\"), which campaigns against domestic violence, mobilizing with WhatsApp support groups and practical tips on how \"not to blow your top.\"  \"Being locked down gives us the chance to spend lots and lots of time with our children,\" the group said, tongue ever so slightly in cheek. But when \"we have to work from home and we are all stuck together in a small space, tensions can escalate.\" 'Step away!' Its WhatsApp groups already have 4,000 members dispensing support and tips on how to stay zen. First among them is \"step away when you feel the tension mount (even if that means locking the toilet door).\" Parents should also watch funny videos with their children, \"and program in 'off' times when you can be on your own... while someone else looks after the children.\"  The main thing is to try to avoid \"words or gestures... that can hurt and wound... because we can behave in ways that we will regret immediately.\" Mother-of-three Sarah, whose kids range in age from seven to just two months, is \"staying relaxed\" so far. \"Yesterday I took an hour for myself in my room, without a child hanging from me, and I did a meditation session via Instagram,\" the Parisian told AFP.  \"It's going OK, but it's worrying for the long haul,\" she said as France neared the end of its first week in total lockdown. If it is tough for the parents, it's no walk in the park for the children either - they too have been ordered home across large swathes of Europe and now in parts of the US. \"When we got into the living room when Mummy is working, there can be arguments,\" said 10-year-old Estheban. \"I am having to be a mother, a teacher, a cook, a cleaner and do my job as an executive in a bank from home at the same time,\" said Virginie, who has two sons aged 11 and six. While most parents will cope, said Mikolajczak, Professor of Emotion and Health Psychology at the University of Louvain in Belgium, some will not. \"We can predict increases in parental burnout,\" she said, and sometimes there could even be \"neglect and violence.\" 'Relax the rules' Governments have the same worry, with the French children's ministry warning of a \"higher risk of mistreatment... and since it will be happening at home, it will be hard to spot.\" \"Stay at home parents are more vulnerable to burnout,\" Mikolajczak said, an effect likely to be exacerbated by the fact they are there against their will. \"Western families are also not used to living on top of each other,\" she added. Added to which families can no longer turn \"to grandparents for help nor go out\" somewhere to blow off steam. Mikolajczak said structuring the children's day can really help with moments when they will play or work on their own.  And she urged parents to \"be flexible and not afraid to relax some rules\". \"Let it go,\" said Etienne, the father of two girls aged 10 and six, who has adopted the refrain from Disney's film \"Frozen\" to get him through the crisis. In these exceptional times you cannot juggle everything, he said. \"At the beginning when the schools closed, I put myself under pressure. I didn't know what to do. I had no time for myself nor the kids. \"Then the penny dropped. I stopped working and since then it's going a lot better,\" he said."

      "authors": "Shohel Mamun",
      "text": "40% of expatriate employees stuck in China; Robots to be used in Padma bridge works  Chinese companies working in Bangladesh are worried about not being able to meet deadlines of the development projects, including several mega projects, that they are implementing in Bangladesh. Many of the projects are at risk of failing to maintain respective deadlines as around 40% of Chinese staff working in Bangladeshi projects have been stuck in China for more than a month. This includes staff who are currently at the coronavirus epidemic centre in China, none of whom are allowed to leave. According to the Chinese Enterprises Association in Bangladesh (CEAB), more than 15,000 Chinese staff members, under 400 companies, are involved in development programs in Bangladesh. CEAB Vice President Ke Changliang told the Dhaka Tribune that around 6000 Chinese staff could not return to Bangladesh because of the outbreak, resulting in slow progress in the development works. On February 2, Bangladesh suspended visa on arrival for Chinese citizens indefinitely amidst the coronavirus epidemic. The China government now wants the suspension to be withdrawn as the situation has almost been brought under control in China. Otherwise, meeting the deadlines for completion of development projects will be a challenge, suspects Chinese officials. Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming on Wednesday urged Bangladesh to withdraw the suspension as soon as possible. During a press briefing held at Padma Bridge Rail Link Project office in Dhaka's Keraniganj, Li said around 95% of the spreading of the virus is now happening from other countries as China has almost controlled the outbreak of the disease. \"Up to now, no Chinese national here and no Bangladesh national here or in China have been infected by the coronavirus,\" he added. According to CEAB, the total amount of investment in Bangladesh contributed by China is nearly $10 billion which created job opportunities for more than 100,000 people in Bangladesh. But these efforts have been negatively impacted due to the COVID-19 epidemic, a global health emergency. Bangladesh government may soon adopt stricter health and quarantine measures on equipment and materials imported from China. Moreover, the application of more rigorous public health regulations on Chinese employees working in Bangladesh, such as medical examination, will make it harder for them to obtain work permits. Ke Changliang said: \"All of these issues have caused certain distress to normal production speed and operation of Chinese enterprises in Bangladesh.\" \"Despite the internal and external challenges, all Chinese companies, especially contractors like CREC, Power China, CCCC, and CCECC, are doing their best to maintain workflow to avoid the suspension of the projects,\" he said at the press briefing. Importing robots for Padma Bridge construction work Although 86% of the construction work is already done, completion of the Padma Bridge project by June 2021 has become a challenge as importing the materials from China remains almost closed since the coronavirus outbreak began. Despite the outbreak currently being under control,  business entities are not in full operation in China yet, creating a shortage of material. China Major Bridge Engineering Company (CMBE) executing Padma Bridge project and China Railway Group Limited (CREC) implementing Padma Bridge Rail Link Project are looking for alternative ways to tackle this situation. These include importing four robots from China and training the local people for specialized tasks. Liu Jianhua, director of Padma Bridge project said: \"We are trying to import four robots for strengthening the execution and to deal with the shortage of manpower.\" Wang Kun, director of Padma Bridge Rail Link Project said: \"To ensure continuity of work, we are trying our best to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus.\""

      "text": "Five, including a BGB official, died in the confrontation Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has filed cases against 19 individuals, including four deceased and 70 unidentified persons, in connection with Tuesday's clash over the transporting of timber in Khagrachhari's Matiranga upazila. 40 BGB East Khedachhara Checkpost Havildar Ishak Ali filed the case with Matiranga police station as the plaintiff under charges of obstruction of public service and murder. Matiranga police OC Shamsuddin Bhuiyan confirmed the matter after accepting the case. Legal action will be taken after police investigation, he said. Locals are worried about the case filed against 70 unnamed individualsye Mostafa Kamal of Ichachhara village in Matiranga, said locals are tense about the matter. \"We have no idea how and when we face harassment.\" Another local, Hanif Miah, said the BGB dispute was between deceased Shahab Miah and Mofiz Miah's relatives. \"There was no involvement of the villagers. BGB is doing this [filing case] to harass locals.\" Meanwhile, Bangladesh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Md Javed Patwari visiting Khagrachhari on Thursday, asked the public to trust the police. \"Cases have been filed and an investigation will be launched,\" he said. \"The perpetrators will be brought to justice through proper investigation no matter which party filed the case,\" the IGP said, afte ran inauguration program of the Police Officers' Mess. On Tuesday, five people, including a BGB member, were killed in Gazinagar of Matiranga, when a clash erupted between the BGB men and some villagers over transporting timber. The deceased are BGB Palashpur zone soldier Md Shaon, villagers Shahab Miah and his sons Ahmed Ali and Ali Akbar, and Mofiz Miah. According to witnesses, Ahmed Ali was carrying timber cut down for power lines in a trolley around 11.30 am on Thursday, when a BGB patrol team stopped and questioned him. This led to an altercation between the villagers and BGB. At one point, the BGB started firing their guns, killing Shaon, Shahab, Ahmed, and Akbar on the spot, while bullet-stricken Mofiz died on his way to the hospital. The BGB, in a press statement issued the same day, claimed that the villagers had surrounded a BGB patrol team when they tried to stop timber trafficking, prompting the border troops to fire a blank round. They also claimed that the villagers snatched weapons from the BGB men and started firing indiscriminately, killing five. However, locals who witnessed the incident rejected all such claims. BGB said Mofiz Miah killed Shaon while locals claim that he was killed by another BGB personnel for protesting the incident. Meanwhile, a three member committee has been formed by the Deputy Commissioner's Office to investigate the incident. The committee is scheduled to file a report by Sunday."

To transform these plans into reality Green Delta Insurance Company Limited and its distribution channel partner OXFAM Bangladesh and local associate Sancred Welfare Foundation (SWF) have insured 316 Farmers of Tahirpur, Sunamganj area under Index-Based Crop Insurance recently as a pilot basis, says a press release. Several integrated plans and activities have been going on for a while now, at the direction of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina under the supervision of the Financial Institutions Department of the Ministry of Finance to stand by the farmers who are at risk of financial loss in flood-prone Haor areas. To mitigate the risks of the farmers of the Haor area arising from excessive rainfall and river flood Green Delta will provide this insurance service to the farmers from April 28 to May 28 while converting the crop losses into fatal financial risks for them. In case of crop damage under this insurance, the insured farmers can get the insurance claim depending on the extent of excess rainfall and the height and stability of the floodwater causing by river flood. In the case of river flood, if the water level if above 6.8 meters and in case of excess rainfall if it rains 125 millimeters in 3 consecutive days the insured farmers will receive maximum Tk12,000 depending on total loss and duration of the flood. In August last year, Green Delta Insurance Company, with the support of Oxfam and SKS Foundation, provided index-based crop insurance to 650 farmers in Fulchhari and Saghata areas of Gaibandha."

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "It expects correction on his narrative, understanding about Bangladesh The Embassy of Bangladesh in Washington, DC has categorically rejected the remarks on Bangladesh made by US Senator Chuck Grassley, saying what the senator said was farthest from the truth. \"The Embassy clearly states that the remarks made by Senator Grassley are not only biased and motivated but also absolutely contradictory to the 2019 Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF),\" the Bangladesh embassy said in a statement, strongly protesting his remarks. It said the embassy is surprised to see that Senator Grassley had stated in his op-ed that citizens of Bangladesh live under an authoritarian regime and face persecution for faith and religious beliefs, reports UNB. Bangladesh is a secular democracy, where people from all faiths live in peace and harmony, the embassy said. The statement further said the embassy is extremely disappointed to see that instead of appreciating the democratic government of Bangladesh for sheltering more than 1.1 million Rohingyas from Myanmar, who were persecuted in their own country for their religion and ethnicity, Senator Grassley has opted for complete subjectivity to criticize the government [of Bangladesh] that actually saved their lives. An op-ed, titled \"Religious freedom under attack - US can promote and protect liberty globally,\" by Chuck Grassley, senator for Iowa, appeared on his official website (https://www.grassley.senate.gov/) on Tuesday. The embassy said it expects that Senator Grassley would correct his narrative and his understanding about Bangladesh based on facts and realities on the ground. A few examples of religious freedom and harmony in Bangladesh were also shared. These are as follows: Bangladesh is a country where festivals of major religious communities (Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists) are public holidays, the president of Bangladesh hosts reception for members of each religious community on the day of these festivals and prime minister of Bangladesh promotes a national slogan \"Religion unto individual, festivals unto all.\" People from all faiths celebrate the festivals together, which is truly reflective of the spirit of secularism and non-communalism, added the embassy. Verses from the holy books of all major faiths are recited at the beginning of all important official programs, it said. The embassy said that Senator Grassley is welcome to visit Bangladesh and see for himself the values of democracy, freedom, openness, inclusiveness, and religious harmony that exists in Bangladesh."

      "text": "Further east, Iran has the third highest case load after China and Italy, with nearly 13,000 confirmed cases, according to WHO data The World Health Organization will start testing for coronavirus in rebel-held northwest Syria later this week, the agency's regional head said on Monday, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about the spread of the pandemic to a region where the health system has been wrecked by a long civil war. Only about half of medical facilities in the wedge of rebel-held Syria are operational. Nearly a million people recently displaced by violence are living in make-shift housing or crowded camps. \"We are hoping ... to have the machinery and the tests sometime this week so we can start testing,\" said Dr Rick Brennan, emergency director for the region, told Reuters. \"And we are very concerned. All of the surrounding countries have documented cases.\" Syria's government has started testing in areas in the rest of the country, although has not yet reported a case to the WHO. Turkey to the north confirmed its first case last week and Iraq has at least 93 confirmed cases. Further east, Iran has the third highest case load after China and Italy, with nearly 13,000 confirmed cases, according to WHO data. However, Brennan, who just returned from a mission to Iran last week, said that the number of cases reported could represent only about a fifth of the real numbers. The reason was that testing, as is the case even in some wealthy European countries, was restricted to severe cases. \"We've said the weakest link in their chain is the data,\" he said. \"They are rapidly increasing their ability to test and so the numbers will go up,\" he said. Iran's response to the pandemic has drawn strong criticism, both from government critics, and a UN official last week. However, Brennan was generally upbeat about Tehran's response. \"There's a great commitment and they are taking it seriously from the highest level of government.\" Iranian authorities say they have been especially hard hit by global supply shortages for tests and protective equipment, blaming the impact of US sanctions. Brennan described visiting new centres with dozens of beds where everything from the bed sheets, to the oxygen masks had been made locally. However, he said that some of the locally-produced personal protective equipment was exposing medical workers to risks. He acknowledged that some health care workers had been infected, although the cause of infection was not clear. \"We are impressed that Iranians have acknowledged their weaknesses and are working on them,\" Brennan said.

      "text": "The monsoon rains will be here soon and the possibility of an early flood is very likely, said the farmers The boro season has come to an end with acres of golden ripe crops in three districts of the country. Farmers in Sunamganj, Brahmanbaria, and Natore are happy with the high yield but the shortage of farm workers is making the final production uncertain. The monsoon rains will be here soon and the possibility of an early flood is very likely, said the farmers. But the deadly Covid-19 pandemic  is forcing the nation into a lock down and agriculture which needs combined effort with a number of inputs can be most affected, say farmers. Despite the Department of Agricultural Extension providing machines and assistance, the vastly agriculture dependent communities of the country are suffering the most. This can be disastrous for the economy if not handled properly.  Early flood predictions worry farmers in Sunamganj This year farmers were expecting a good yield from the 2,19,300 hectares of haor (Backswamp) lands in Sunamganj. The vast paddy fields took on a golden shade this month and are ready to be harvested and threshed. However, a certain turning point of the event jolted the whole scenario as the recent pandemic has almost brought the whole world to a standstill, including agriculture. The farmers of this district are in great peril as they need seasonal migrant farmworkers from other districts  to help them harvest their crops from other districts. This year, helping hands are scarce because they are not able to access the needed workers due to lockdowns across the country meant to curb the spread of the deadly virus. The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) has predicted the district will experience heavy rains at the end of this month. This might cause  early flooding that can waterlog the entire crop, while farmers need three more weeks to reap their crops, said Judge Miah, a farmer in Sadar upazila's Lalpur village. Ajman Hossain, Jaban Ali, and Shamsur Rahman among other farmers of the area, said thousands of farmworkers used to come to this area in the harvest season but this year they are few and far between. \"It has started to rain already and acres of land are full of ripe paddy. We don't know how we are going to process this huge crop before the rain starts coming down full swing,\" said Shamshur Rahman. Deputy Director of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Md Safar Uddin, said they have provided 126 Combine Harvester Machines and 212 Reaper Machines to assist farmers and facilitate the whole operation with less manpower. Contacted, Md Abdul Ahad, Deputy Commissioner of the district, assured Dhaka Tribune they are strictly maintaining all possible precautions to prevent farmers from being affected by Covid-19, and said: \"We will provide more machines and farm workers if needed. There are 30,000 workers currently assisting the farmers in their fields, and paddy in 18,000 hectares of land is being handled successfully, to the best of my knowledge. Farmworkers scarce, Brahmanbaria farmers using other resources To cope with the scarcity of farmhands, farmers from Brahmanbaria are depending on the unemployed who returned to their village homes before the nationwide lockdown. On a field visit, hundreds of inexperienced hands like garment workers, hotel assistants, chefs, day labourers, fishermen, vendors, and even students, could be seen helping farmers with their harvest. They say this way they can help the farmers and provide for their families with the money they get in return for their work. Md Maharram Bhuiyan, a hawker from Chittagong, who was trying to harvest paddy with a farmer said: \"This field needs tremendous labour which I do not have. But in order to earn my daily meals I have to do it, no matter what.\" According to the DAE's office, around 17,000 farm workers from other districts join the farmers each year. However, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, only 1,500 workers could come this season. Asked about the situation, Brahmanbaria DAE's Deputy Director Md Rabiul Haque Majumdar, said: \"It is a positive endeavour that unemployed youths are joining in to assist the farmers. It serves them both. But if the farmers need more assistance we have to provide additional farm workers from other districts maintaining proper health protocols.\" Brahmanbaria DC, Hayat-Ud-Doula, said around 40 Combine Harvester Machines will be provided to the farmers and all possible steps will be taken to help the farmers.  Natore DAE expects high yield despite scarce manpower Officials from Natore DAE are expecting a good boro yield of around 4 lakh tons, said the district's DAE office. To facilitate the harvest they provided 17 Combine Harvesters and 2 Reaper Machines, confirmed Subrata Kumar, deputy director of the organisation. \"We have a high quality boro paddy yield on 58,000 hectares of land this season. Seasonal migrant farm workers are far less this year but if the farmers ask for it we will certainly arrange hired workers to reap the crops properly,\" he said. He said hundreds of workers are coming from various areas to assist the boro farmers who have asked for 30 more machines to ease the process. UP Chairman Asadujjaman and an Awami League leader of Naldanga upazila, said: \"We have prepared a list of AL activists in every district who will be assisting  farmers in the fields. With the machines and the provided help, we don't think we will face any problems with the crop this season."

      "authors": "Mahzabeen Faruque",
      "text": "To combat this pandemic, we need to work together Bangladesh has already been hit hard with the global pandemic and experts and analysts are saying that management and duration will determine the depth of this crisis. After reading many articles and publications and teaching international business at a private university, outlined are my modest understanding and beliefs. Sadly vagrant or homeless people are part of our society and economy. Daily wage earners account for the chunk of what our economy is all about. This is a densely populated country.  We struggle every day to commute from Dhanmondi to Gulshan and albeit we talk about being digital, the mere effort of conducting an online video chat with co-workers from every nook of the country takes a nerve-wracking toll on the very essence of our souls.  Needless to say, we have our own epidemic -- dengue -- that chases us every monsoon season, and even during other times of the year. Not to mention a couple of days of heavy rain threatens us with a predicted flood.  We have a healthcare facility that is prickly and very much centralized to Dhaka only. Now this pandemic which has no cure yet, couldn't make the matter any worse for us. The West or the \"more sanitized\" countries are already failing in protecting their civilians in spite of having a much better health care system than ours.   Thus what right do we have to overestimate our power in combating this in regard to the public health sector when we have an approximate total of 1200 ICU beds (private and public sectors) for 170 million people according to World Economic Forum and World Bank data.  Like any other system, our policy-makers with sheer optimism are optimizing whatever resources we have to stem out the root cause. But leaving everything up to the policy-makers will be like living in a fool's paradise. We as citizens have a very big role to play. If these crises go beyond our control, there may be emotional, social, and economic unrest that we cannot fathom. The dire economic condition has already been discussed in many forums.  However, the differences in the social class system will be conspicuous. There are people in society who are privileged enough to have the disposable income to showcase how they are passing their leisure time and then there are daily wage earners who look at their empty pockets and stare at those tall buildings and wonder about the indifference.  Such indifference may lead to depression, anger, and in extreme cases civil unrest. Hence the flow of communication should be a continuous process to all levels of society for assurance that all is still not lost.  The official authorities are already doing their part in communicating about Covid-19. However, we as communities have a significant role to play in mitigating the crisis. As a nation, I do not believe we still fully understand its authenticity and implication.  Going for mass gathering for religious or social purposes shows that the significance and consequences of the pandemic have not registered in the minds of the people.   If the literate society has trouble in wrestling the idea of the preventive measures that need to be taken for Covid-19, then booing the underprivileged and illiterate society, when all they are doing is going out to look for work, is nothing but living in a bubble mindset of utter cluelessness. The utmost challenge is to shorten the crisis. The longer the crisis, the more difficult it will be to recover from the damages and scars it will inevitably leave behind in the economy.  According to an article in WEF, 90% workers are working in the informal sector. Due to the pandemic, work has stopped and people are out of work and thus no income. Most importantly, in rural areas, most people live on daily wages, and \"being quarantined\" is an extravagance to them.  There are people who live on remittance too. The pandemic has made many workers go out of work in the domestic market as well as abroad. When their livelihood and survival is at risk, it will take sufficient motivating factors to convince them to stay at home to avoid being infected.  It is essentially required that people are given the food delivery support and cash incentives until the curve is flattened, and the government is taking proper measures to ensure that.  Meanwhile, if we the privileged ones look after our own people who have over the years given their laboured skills for our comfort, then much pressure will be minimized from the economy to bounce back.  We are a small country with a distinctly huge population and a fragile infrastructure, hence we cannot afford a misstep in our policy-making.  To combat this pandemic and manage the foreseeable economic crisis, not only the government but the NGOs, business sectors, and other relevant organizations should work together with cohesion and strong linkages.  Not to mention \"us\" as citizens also have a strong role to play. We can have the intermittent opening of some manufacturing sectors or services, if not all. We have seen how the developed countries are doing it and we can learn and customize according to our needs and resources.  We are a country known for its strongest survival instincts and resilience; there is no doubt in my mind that we can fight this one too. Mahzabeen Faruque is Lecturer at State University. "

      "authors": "Belal Chowdhury",
      "text": "This translation marks the writer's second death anniversary on April 24.  (Translated by Khademul Islam)  Ah, those days, it made no difference to us whether it was night or day--we didn't know, and didn't care to know! The only thing that mattered was spending twenty-four hours of the day at the Coffee House on College Street (in the then Calcutta). Though formally it was supposed to open at 9:00 in the morning, an insistent clamor to open the main gate would commence from 8:30 onward, and by 9:15 it would inevitably begin to loosen and then open. Some of us insiders who knew what to do would then slip in early and grab the seats at our favorite tables. At the entrance, by the foot of the stairs leading up to the cafe, would be Ismail, the man from my own side of Bengal, from whom we would buy ten-plus-ten totaling twenty sticks meaning two packs of Charminar cigarettes, which were our invaluable props as we sought the precious philosopher's stone inside the cafe. As the day wore on, all sorts of people would drop by. Some were stooped from the weight of their learning, while others were wracked by drugs. Everybody from the hangman to the racetrack addict - who would not drop by there? At that time, we were the most senior of the Coffee-House-ians. Until the gates closed at 10:30 at night, who had time for anything else? No sooner would one group depart than the next one would breeze in; all were our devotees and hangers-on. Ah, life then was so light and sublime and so full of promise! The days blew by in a swirl of good times and laughter. If Baruna left our table, the slot would be filled by Namita. Almost five feet tall and shapely and chocolate-colored, Namita had us all buzzing around her like a swarm of bees. We would table-hop incessantly; now this table, then that table, and time would fly by with nobody knowing how or where.  Especially if it was a winter day. When on one such day came our very own Babu Shri Chandan Majumdar, who was good-looking, well-spoken, and a Coffee House regular, because, really, what was one to do with one's life except write poetry? With a broad, beguiling smile he informed us that his kaka (paternal uncle) S... and his mother had been repeatedly pressing him to bring the gang one day over to the family home, and that today was that very day! That both his Mama and mother kept hearing so many tales from him about us, the Coffee House crowd, that everybody in his household, from old to young, felt as if they had come to know us intimately. His mother, listening to these tales, in fact, was quite taken with a certain wretch named Belal Chowdhury, and now harbored a store of affection for this fellow far in excess of what she displayed for her own sons and daughters. And also, he said, it would be quite special if Namita and the Mitras could also come along, though of course he knew that those two had families and duties, people to take care of. Whereas among the rest of us there was one truly free male named Belal--if he could be made to tag along then we were assured of not only a chicken-and-rice dinner being laid out but also the prospect of some extra cash, say, a little twenty-rupee handout.  No way! I took a firm stand against such an idea. That would not be allowed to happen. I would announce to his folks from the very first that I had no need of anything. And even if there was, I would ask for it myself.  The afternoons then were honeyed. And now that there was no way to back out of this outing, it made sense to waste as little time as possible in hitting the road given that it would afford us more time for play and fun. Led by Chandan, by the time we descended from the Bangaon train line at some cow-shit, fly-blown station, the winter afternoon shadows were beginning to darken and deepen. Dense banks of trees lined the path to Chandan's village, as an equally dense, deep blue dusk began to fall. The moment we entered the neighborhood his house was in, however, a deep voice suddenly brought us to an abrupt halt.  Aha, the voice intoned: from which direction has the Sun God risen today? Otherwise how can it be that at this time of the day do we get to see our Chandan Babu in our lowly little village, and that too with his friends and boon companions. Are you fellows feeling all right, your bodies fit to do battle, is that the... It was Chandan himself who stepped forward and introduced the voice to us as his Mama (maternal uncle). Who knew about so much and yet had not the slightest air of affectation about him or a jot of righteousness, talking and mingling with us like some genial lord of the manor: Baba, all of you are very lucky fellows, you have blossomed forth on a very auspicious day. So what if it's a cold Kartik night with its sweet air blowing around us--today it's also a Kartik full moon night. The goddess Parvati's son, the six-faced one who is the commander of the heavenly forces in his abode, will enchant us tonight with his playful frolicking and fancies.  But, Chandan Babu, listen, why don't you hurry on ahead in the meantime to the house and give my didi Audity advance notice of our guests? By the time you get everything ready I will have shown them the moonrise over on the other side of Dudh Sayerer beel, and then bring them around. This did not sit well with me. No matter how dear a Mama he was of Chandan I didn't feel like going even one step forward with this gentleman. But what choice did I have? In the tenth circle of Hell even the gods become ghosts/And we all know who's to blame for it. Even though Chandan and I grumbled a bit about it, I noted that the others were all for experiencing the Kartik moonrise over on the other side of Dudh Sayerer beel. After walking a considerable distance, I felt as if I no longer even had the energy to listen to the howling and barking of distant foxes and jackals. Mama was striding in front of us like Vasco de Gama, while muttering some incantations under his breath. To be perfectly truthful, our collective knowledge of Sanskrit was so meager that the Shiva-like cries of those jackals seemed clearer and more ominous. But Mama was our indisputable leader. Drawing up his dhuti tightly around him and clutching at his sacred paita thread, he was murmuring mantras so obscure and unfathomable that it was impossible for any of us to understand a single word of it. Then, all of a sudden, he stopped at a spot and raising a forefinger at the distant forest line, he said, look, look at this scene. Are you destined in this life to ever see this again? Fill your heart with it. If not over a bamboo grove, the moon has certainly risen over the tops of the mango orchard, and even if Kajala didi is not here to sing this sloka to you all, at least the Mama who is before you will always be with you. And look, look, take a good look across this vast plain to see what a real full moon night can be--oh, what a flood of shimmering light falls down on us! But you know,  all this while there were jackals, now it seems that packs of wild dogs have joined them in the baying and howling. Even then I would urge you to take a last look at the moonlight cascading down over the tree line. It was not for nothing that Abanindranath had written: here is one moon/over there is another moon/O brother the moons twine/the moon over the hinchay bush... The way Chandan's mama that night, in that remote cow-shit, fly-blown sheltered nook, in leading us to see the moonrise, flayed us with the moon that even today after all this time it seems to me that we are still trapped in some charmed circular maze, going round and round in a trance...

      "text": "Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court rejected Gupta's curative petition A court in Delhi on Monday stayed the execution of the four convicts in the 2012 Delhi gangrape and murder case, ANI reported.  Akshay Thakur, Vinay Sharma, Mukesh Singh and Pawan Gupta were scheduled to be hanged at Tihar Jail in Delhi on Tuesday at 6am. The court deferred the matter after one of the convicts, Pawan Gupta, filed a mercy petition before India's President Ram Nath Kovind earlier in the day. His lawyer had requested the court to stop the execution citing the petition. Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana rapped his lawyer for filing the curative and mercy pleas so late. \"You are playing with fire, you should be cautious,\" said the judge, adding, \"One wrong move by anybody and you know the consequences.\" Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court rejected Gupta's curative petition. He had sought commutation of his death penalty to life imprisonment. The four convicts were given the death penalty - first by a trial court in September 2013, which was upheld by the Delhi High Court six months later and the Supreme Court in May 2017.  The death warrants were first issued for January 22, and then postponed to February 1 because of the mercy pleas filed by two of the convicts.  Gupta was the only one among the four convicts who had not availed of the legal remedies. His counsel had told a sessions court in Delhi earlier this that he could not avail any legal remedy as his earlier lawyer did not meet him during the seven-day period granted by the Delhi High Court. The four men, along with two others, raped and brutally assaulted a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in a moving bus in Delhi on the night of December 16, 2012.  The woman succumbed to her injuries two weeks later at a hospital in Singapore. The gangrape triggered huge protests in the Indian capital and across the country.  One convict died in prison, while a minor convict was sent to a detention home for juveniles and was released in December 2015."

      "text": "'All the dairy farmers in the district will turn paupers if this situation continues' Hundreds of dairy farmers in Satkhira are counting huge losses as they are forced to dump over 50,000 litres milk every day for lack of demand at every level amid the virtual lockdown in the country after the coronavirus breakout. As the dairy farmers have no alternative source of income, particularly after this pandemic, farm owners in the district are even failing to arrange feed for their cattle. President of Tala Milk Production Samity Dibas Chandra Ghosh said around 1,000 dairy farms in the district, including 400 at Jiala Nalta village and 50 farms in Athari village in Tala upazila, produce over 50,000 litres of milk every day. \"All the dairy farmers in the district will turn paupers if this situation continues...the milk dumping must be stopped as soon as possible for their survival,\" he said. Local dairy farm owners said Milk Vita used to collect 8,000 litres milk while Akij Group 600 litres from them and they used to supply the rest of the milk to different sweet-making factories in Satkhira and Khulna. As soon as the pandemic broke out, all the sweetmeat shops and factories were either shut or cut production, forcing the dairy farm owners to sell milk at Tk10 per litres only, they added. Amid the deteriorating scenario, dairy farmers have sought government help just to survive.  Tala Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Iqbal Hossain said they have already brought it to the notice of the higher authorities concerned. Asked about the dire state of the dairy sector in the district, Deputy Commissioner SM Mostafa Kamal said they have decided to purchase milk through Milk Vita from the farm owners with the fund allotted by the Prime Minister for children's food. He also informed that he personally urged the Chairman of Milk Vita to collect milk from the district for producing food for babies and children. Meanwhile, the district administration has decided to keep the sweetmeat shops in the district open by maintaining social distancing, the DC said hoping that it will reduce the loss of the dairy farmers. Fisheries and Livestock Minister SM Rezaul Karim has recently assured that the government would provide all kinds of support to continue the production of fish, meat, milk and eggs during the coronavirus pandemic. He came up with the assurance in a video message prepared by the Ministry's Livestock and Dairy Development Project to create awareness among people. The minister urged all to keep milk, egg, fish and meat in their menu as that help boost the immunity of people."

      "text": "The three time Grammy winning singer died from heart complications on Friday Bill Withers, a soulful singer best known for the 1970s hits Lean on Me, Lovely Day and Ain't No Sunshine, has died at age 81 from heart complications, his family said on Friday. Withers produced nine albums, most of them written and recorded in the 1970s, starting with Just As I Am, which included Ain't No Sunshine, which won him the first of three Grammy Awards, according to his official website.  His musical career ebbed in the 1980s as he left \"the hype and the hoopla\" of the spotlight for a more private life, it said. \"A solitary man with a heart driven to connect to the world at large, with his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other,\" Rolling Stone magazine quoted the family as saying a statement. \"As private a life as he lived close to intimate family and friends, his music forever belongs to the world.\" Withers was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, among his several honors, and made a rare public appearance to accept the tribute.  His death drew a flood of tributes, including one from Democratic U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who said he often played Withers' Lovely Day at events during his now-ended presidential campaign. \"In this time of death and pain, I hold onto him,\" Booker said in a statement. \"He gave us lifetimes of light and that flame will never be extinguished.\" Booker's former campaign rival, Senator Kamala Harris of California, called Withers a legend whose song \"Grandma's Hands\" reminded her of her own grandmother and other mother figures. \"Let's all continue to live by his cherished lyrics during these times and lean on each other,\" Harris said in a statement. William Harrison Withers Jr. was born on July 4, 1938, in Slab Fork, West Virginia, a coal country town of 200, the son of a miner who died when Withers was 13. He joined the Navy at 17 as his \"ticket out,\" according to his website. After his military service, he moved to Los Angeles where he worked in an aircraft parts factory, taught himself to play the guitar and made a demo tape that launched his career."

      "authors": "Mizanur Rahman and Ali Asif Shawon",
      "text": "Sultana Pervin came under fire after approving a questionable mobile court raid at Ariful Islam's home The government has appointed a new deputy commissioner (DC) in Kurigram district, removing Sultana Pervin. She came under fire following the questionable arrest, incarceration, and torture of Dhaka Tribune journalist Ariful Islam by a mobile court raid she approved. A circular from the Ministry of Public Administration announcing Sultana's removal from the post and attachment to the ministry was issued on Monday. Another circular, issued on Monday, said Mohammad Rezaul Karim, deputy secretary of the ministry, will replace Sultana as the new Kurigram DC and district magistrate. The ministry has also withdrawn three executive magistrates from Kurigram connected to the incident, by issuing another circular. The officials are - Senior Assistant Commissioner Nazim Uddin, and assistant commissioners Rintu Bikash Chakma, and SM Rahatul Islam of Kurigram. All three orders were effective immediately, said the circulars. Meanwhile, State Minister for Public Administration, Farhad Hossain, told Dhaka Tribune: \"There are allegations against them [the four commissioners] and they have been made officers on special duty [OSD]. \"We will initiate divisional inquiry, and punitive action will be taken against them if they are found guilty after investigation,\" he added. However, the High Court on Monday asked state lawyer, Deputy Attorney General Debashis Bhattacharyya, to collect and submit all documents related to Ariful's conviction and bail by March 23. The bench of Justice Md Ashraful Kamal and Justice Sardar Md Rashed Jahangir issued the order on Monday. Supreme Court Bar Association President, advocate AM Amin Uddin, and advocate Ishrat Hasan with Barrister Syed Sayedul Haque Suman, stood for the writ. During the hearing, the court made a comment stating that a single person does not represent the whole country. The state will not take responsibility for someone's mistake. On Sunday, the High Court ordered the state to submit before it a copy of the conviction and one-year imprisonment sentence of the journalist, issued by a mobile court. During the hearing, the bench also asked the state to respond to some questions over the mobile court's judgment. Responding to a question about whether the drive was conducted by a mobile court or a special taskforce, the state lawyer informed the court that it was a special taskforce and there were 13 people including six from police, five from Ansar battalion, one from the department of narcotics, and one executive magistrate. The drive was conducted around 11:45pm of March 13, 2020, and they found 450ml of local liquor and 100gm of cannabis, with a price of approximately TK150 and Tk1,000 respectively, the DAG informed the court. The DAG told the court that everything was done by law. Advocate Amin Uddin said to the court that a mobile court cannot hand out punishment this way. Mobile courts are appreciated and operations of all mobile courts are not being questioned, he said. Drawing an example of an abuse of power, he said a mobile court had punished a teacher earlier by asking him to \"perform squats holding his ears\" at an examination hall for using a mobile phone. Over the Kurigram incident, the lawyer mentioned that this too was an abuse of power. The way the mobile court operated has proven a mala fide intent. \"One can hand out punishment if a journalist commits an offence, but not in this way.\" The senior lawyer also appraised the role of the media in the country. The court asked the lawyer to bring in journalist Ariful as petitioner if possible and told the state lawyer that there is a gray area regarding how bail was granted to the journalist. Earlier on Sunday, advocate Ishrat Hasan filed the petition on behalf of online news portal Bangla Tribune's Executive Editor, Harun-Ur-Rashid. On March 14, Ariful Islam, Kurigram district correspondent of Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune , was sent to one-year in jail, soon after the mobile court, set up at the Kurigram DC's office, ended the trial proceedings. The mobile court in the dead of night jailed the journalist for a year, after law enforcement led by magistrates picked him up from his home in Kurigram town. The mobile court brought an allegation against the journalist that drugs and alcohol were recovered from his possession, which his family termed absurd. DC's comments contradictory with documents The Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sultana Parvin on March 14 told Dhaka Tribune that a task force was set up to apprehend the journalist as a routine drive against narcotics.  However, her comments in the documents, placed before the court by the state lawyer, contradict that statement. In the witness record, one of the witnesses, Md Arif, stated that Ariful was apprehended by mobile court and the task force while he was drinking liquor and smoking cannabis. Meanwhile countrywide processions were organized by journalists and civil society to seek justice and protest the abuse of power and torture of journalists. They were held in Comilla, Khulna, Natore, Nilphamari, Jhalakati, Joypurhat, Naogaon, Narsingdi, Thakurgaon, Rangpur, Netrokona, Sirajganj and Tangail, according to our correspondents. Our district correspondents Masud Alam, Comilla, Hedait Hossain Molla, Khulna, contributed to this report."

We have therefore made the assessment that Covid-19 can be characterised as a pandemic,\" he told a news conference. The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, halting industry, bringing flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of sporting events and concerts. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, its \"highest level of alarm,\" on January 30 when there were fewer than 100 cases of Covid-19 outside China and eight cases of human-to-human transmission of the disease.  BREAKING \"We have therefore made the assessment that #COVID19 can be characterized as a pandemic\"-@DrTedros #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/JqdsM2051A Now there are more than 121,000 cases in 121 countries and territories, while over 4,400 people have died, with the numbers expected to climb. China remains the hardest-hit overall with more than 80,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths. The WHO no longer has a category for declaring a pandemic, except for influenza. WHO officials have signalled for weeks that they may use the word \"pandemic\" as a descriptive term, but stressed that it does not carry legal significance. The novel coronavirus is not the flu. Under its previous system, the Geneva-based agency declared the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak a pandemic. It turned out to be mild, leading to some criticism after pharmaceutical companies rushed development of vaccines and drugs."

      "text": "Locals fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands An embankment of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) has collapsed in Kola village of Satkhira's Assasuni upazila, flooding over 1,500 bighas of land, fish enclosures on Friday. Four villages of Pratapnagar and Shriula unions went underwater as the 120 ft BWDB embankment of Zone-2 suddenly collapsed, locals said. Many local residents have started volunteering to repair the embankment with whatever materials currently available. They fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands. On a field visit, thousands of villagers were seen to have volunteered to construct a temporary embankment while the district administration is said to have been busy controlling the coronavirus outbreak in the area. Moreover, the Kopotakkho River embankment collapsed earlier on April 8, flooding 1,000 bighas of farmlands and fish enclosures in three low-lying villages of the same area, waterlogging around 50 families in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishti Nandan villages under Pratapnagar union.  Locals say the 100-ft dam was already in a risky state, so it naturally could not sustain the strong pressure of tidal current and collapsed into the bottom of the Kopotakkho River. Contacted,  Pratapnagar Union Parishad Chairman Jakir Hossain held the water development board responsible in this regard, saying it was their negligence that led to the collapse of the embankment every year. \"Despite repeated complaints and appeals seeking sustainable protection of the embankment, the water development board failed to acknowledge the urgency of the issue.  \"Now, due to this recklessness, farmlands and fish enclosures on around 2,500 bigha of land have been flooded in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishtinandan villages. Moreover, almost 50 families have become waterlogged after two back-to-back incidents of flooding.\"  Md Arifuzzaman, of the local water development board, after visiting the site said he had arranged sandbags for the temporary emergency repair of the damaged embankment to minimize the extent of damage and protect the remaining lands.  \"The higher authorities will be notified promptly so that the necessary steps may be taken to permanently repair embankment.\""

      "text": "Nusrat's family to this day remain under police protection as they continue to receive threats from prime accused Sirajuddaula's cohorts and followers A year had passed since the murder of Nusrat Jahan Rafi, an alim examinee of Sonagazi Islamia Senior Fazil Madrasa in Feni. But her family still awaits implementation of the verdict against the accused in her murder case. On April 6 last, the 18-year-old was set on fire in broad daylight on the roof of the madrasa by people loyal to principal Sirajuddaula, when she refused to withdraw a sexual harassment case her family filed against Sirajuddaula.  After battling for life for four days, she succumbed to her critical burn injuries at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital on April 10, which sparked nationwide outrage and public demand for swift justice against the perpetrators.  On October 24, following a trial all 16 accused were proven guilty, and a Feni court awarded them death sentence under Section 4(1)/30 of the Woman and Children Repression Prevention Act 2000. However, Nusrat's family till this day remain under police protection as they continue to receive threats from Sirajuddaula's cohorts and followers. \"I cannot sleep, thinking of the pain Nusrat had gone through when she was burnt alive,\" said Nusrat's mother, Shirin Akhter. \"We were happy with the verdict and we know the whole country is with us, still I don't understand why the sentence is not being carried out yet?\" she asks with agony. Nusrat's brother Mahmudul Hasan said they constantly receive threats and also have been targeted in social media by the wellwishers of the convicts ever since the murder took place. He said: \"My sister gave her life to fight for her honour and it seems like it has no end.\" The Public Prosecutor of the court Adv Hafez Ahmed said the prompt prosecution of the case could not have been possible without Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's direct involvement and her assurance of providing proper justice to the girl. \"We are satisfied with the verdict. But the ongoing trial should soon be addressed and justice should be given to the family as they are waiting for long,\" the lawyer added. The convicts are prime accused SM Sirajuddaula, who orchestrated Nusrat's murder, Nur Uddin, Shahdat Hossain Shamim, Maksud Alam, Saifur Rahman Md Zobayer, Sakhawat Hossain Jabed, Abdul Kader, Absar Uddin, Kamrun Nahar Moni, Umme Sultana Popy, Abdur Rahim Sharif, Eftekhar Uddin Rana, Imran Hossain Mamun, Mohammad Shamim, Ruhul Amin, and Mohiuddin Shakil."

      "text": "The amount was 3,448 tons in 2016, 3972 tons in 2017 and 5,080 tons in 2018 Ilish catch in Shariatpur has increased substantially over the last couple of years thanks to the government's efforts, including its ban on catching brood and mother Ilish. Last year (2019 calendar year) fishermen netted 5,240 tons of Ilish, a 61.72% rise from 3,240 tons in 2015, according to the local office of the Department of Fisheries (DoF). The amount was 3,448 tons in 2016, 3972 tons in 2017 and 5,080 tons in 2018, it said. Shariatpur Fisheries Officer Abdur Rouf said that they worked hard for protecting the brood and mother Ilish during the reproductive season following the instruction of the prime minister and the ministry concerned. The district administration helped them a lot, he said. This increase is the outcome of the government plan, he said and added that the procurement of Ilish there was increasing every year.  Local fishery officials said the drive against netting mother Ilish was the main reason behind the success. Last year 1,366 people were panelized in 293 such drives, they informed. According to the DoF, fishermen catch Ilish in  a 69-kilometre area (covering 15,840 hectares of land) of the Padma and the Meghna rivers in Shariatpur.  About 16,355 people are directly involved with Ilish catching, said the DoF. Sirajul Islam, 45, catches Ilish fish in the Padma river. He said that the increased catch of Ilish brought smiles to the fishermen there. \"I experienced huge catches of Ilish in the region when I was young. But the availability of the fish was declining gradually with the passage of time,\" Shirazul said. \"However, the decline in production saw a u-turn and started to rise in the last couple of years,\" he said and added that it became possible due to the strict policy of the government. The fisherman said that they were getting good prices in the market for their catches.  Manik Hossain, an Ilish trader, said the increased production of Ilish raised the income of traders and fishermen and helped them overcome existing financial crisis. The Ilish netting season starts from July and continues until October. The authorities oversee and protect netting of brood Ilish between November to June.  March and April are the banned months for catching any kind of fishes in  20 kilometres of Shariatpur region, as it is the reproductive period for the Ilish.  During the banned period, the government helps the fishermen by providing 20-30 kg of rice to each of them."

While talking to reporters, Tabith said: \"Use of technology has increased everywhere. I want to make Dhaka an 'intelligent city' which is a new trend around the world.  \"I want to use modern technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), to make DNCC a smart city.\"  Mentioning BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's present situation, he said: \"Please assist me, support me and stand beside me. I want your empathy. I promise you, I will never betray you. I promise that my thoughts and plans will be modern and for the future, not something backdated.\"  Responding to a question on whether he would, if elected, be able to implement his pledges while representing BNP, Tabith said that he would, as he would have the support of the city dwellers on his side.

In his manifesto, he also highlighted the importance of improving the public transport and the waste management system of DNCC, adding that he will reset the running holding taxes by mass hearing.  Tabith also said that, if elected, he will initially have \"rent controllers \"in all the wards of DNCC, so that the house rent rates are fixed through coordination between the house owners and the tenants; every two years a \"rent commission\" will fix the highest and lowest house rent rates in DNCC.  Tabith, in his manifesto, also promised to build at least ten public toilets in every ward of DNCC.  He said that, if elected, he will build three toilets at every main bus stop in Dhaka North for all, including physically challenged people. \"If I get elected as mayor, I will firstly take 60 days work plan for DNCC,\" he added.  Among others, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal President ASM Abdur Rab, Nagarik Oikya Convener Mahmudur Rahman Manna and Gonoshasthaya Kendra founder Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury, were also present during Tabith's manifesto unveiling."

      "text": "The choi plants are used predominantly in Khulna, Bagerhat, Jessore, and Satkhira Although the use of Chilli (Pepper) in sub-continental food was not noticeable until the Portuguese came to India in the 15th century, yet, the conquest of the hot spice in our palates is persistent and actually thriving till date. The Bangladeshi culinary tapestry, which stemmed from the coalescence of distinctive cultures adapted throughout the establishment and influence of different colonies in India, is famous for its distinctive taste, be it pungent, savoury or sweet. Given the enclosures, with abundant crops and fish, Bengalis adapted a unique spice called Choi Jhal (Piper Chaba), which enabled them to complement their curries with hot, vinegary and aromatic taste, all at once. Choi Jhal, an exquisite spice Choi Jhal, is one of the most popular and unique spices in the south-western region of Bangladesh. The chopped stems, roots and skin of the plant are used while cooking food, especially meat and fish. The choi plants are used predominantly in Khulna, Bagerhat, Jessore, and Satkhira. Choi is a creeper which grows around larger trees. Leaves and stems of the Choi look like betel leaves. Betel and Choi are two species of the same family, Piperaceae. It is a relatively expensive spice in Bangladesh, and the roots are usually more expensive than the stems because of their stronger aroma. How it is used in curries Choi Jhal is mainly used as a taste enhancer. It makes the food hotter and spicier. In Bangladesh the use of Choi Jhal is unique, because the twigs, stems or roots of it, not the fruit, are used as spice.  Curries of beef, mutton and fish can be prepared with Choi Jhal but it is not much popular with vegetables. Commonly a little amount of the dried up Choi Jhal twigs, stems or roots are thrown into the boiling curries, ten to fifteen minutes before the cooking process ends. The softened roots enrich the aroma and flavour of the curry. Though it highly prescribed to use it with garlic and fenugreek, it is suggested by some esteemed cooks not to use it with ginger. Economic prospect of Choi Jhal in Khulna Over the course of time, Choi Jhal became almost extinct from other areas but farmers of the south-western region, Khulna, the third largest city of Bangladesh are cultivating the exquisite spice and earning much with their implicit imports and exports. Nabadip Mollik, a farmer from Dumuria, made it possible to easily commercialise the spice with its original qualities intact, by producing ground Choi Jhal. He said: \"The spice is exquisite and costly but the raw products lose its qualities. With our ground spices it is far easier to use.\" Additional Deputy Director, Md Nazrul Islam at Khulna Agricultural Extension Office(KAEO) said demand for the spice is increasing exponentially. \"Not only curry but pickles made of Choi Jhal is delicious as well,\" he said. Choi Jhal has been treating different kinds of diseases and it has a number of herbal uses, specially the antimicrobial and antioxidant active ingredients, the results of this kind of compounds exhibited good to excellent applications, said KAEO Deputy Director Pankaj Kanti Majumdar."

Police also detained three people in connection with the human trafficking from the spot. However, police did not disclose the identities of the Rohingyas and the detained human traffickers.

A case was filed against the three human traffickers with Ramu police station.\" Earlier on February 11, a total of 20 Rohingyas died and several others were rescued after a trawler, carrying around 100 Rohingyas, capsized near Saint Martin's Island in the Bay of Bengal.  They were heading to Malaysia by sea illegally, according to law enforcement agencies.  The camps at Ukhiya and Teknaf in Cox's Bazar currently shelters more than 1.1 million Rohingyas who fled persecution in Myanmar.  Taking advantage on the desperation of these Rohingya people, several gangs of national and international human traffickers often lure them into making dangerous journey to aboard by sea illegally for better lives.

The Indian Health and Family Welfare Ministry has proposed the draft amendment to the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements Act, 1954), for magic remedies and drugs promoting fair skin, enhancing sexual performance, treating stammering, infertility in women, premature ageing and greying of hair among others, reports NDTV. The draft amendment has made several additions to the list of diseases, disorders, conditions covered in the Act. The Act already states that medicines, \"magic remedies\" and products to cure any of these 78 diseases, disorders, conditions named should not be advertised. The new additions include ads for drugs for improving sexual performance and skin tone and treating premature aging, AIDS, greying of hair, stammering, sterility in women, among others.  Under the Act, the first conviction is punishable with imprisonment of up to six months or fine or both; and a subsequent conviction can result in imprisonment of up to a year or fine, or both. The amendment proposes to increase the penalties. For the first conviction, the proposed punishment is imprisonment of up to two years and fine up to Rs10 lakh. For subsequent conviction, the imprisonment may extend to five years with a fine of up to Rs50 lakh. The ministry said the amendment is being made in order to keep pace with changing time and technology. It has been decided that suggestions, comments and objections from the public and stakeholders will be sought. They may be forwarded within 45 days from the date of issue of this notice. The draft bill also proposes an expansion of definition of an advertisement. It says: \"Any audio or visual publicity, representation, endorsement or pronouncement made by means of light, sound, smoke, gas, print, electronic media, internet or website and includes any notice, circular, label, wrapper, invoice, banner, poster or such other documents.\"  "

On the occasion, Meherpur Deputy Commissioner (DC) Mohammad Ataul Gani started the day's activities by hoisting the national flag atop the Mujibnagar Memorial Museum in the morning. DC Ataul urged everyone to stay at home to combat the Covid-19 pandemic to continue the economic growth of the country. On behalf of the Public Administration Ministry, State Minister for Public Administration Farhad Hossain and Meherpur district administration, Ataul Gani later placed a wreath at the Mujibnagar Memorial. Meherpur-2 MP Shahiduzzaman Khokon, Meherpur district police, district freedom fighters' unit, Meherpur district Awami League and other socio-political organisations also placed wreaths at the memorial. They also paid homage to the four national leaders there. The day was observed remembering the oath taking of the Bangladesh government-in-exile during the Liberation War in 1971 at Baidyanathtala of Meherpur in Kushtia on April 17, 1971. The then government formally announced the proclamation of independence at the program."

This is not unique for Bangladesh,\" a spokesperson at the US Embassy in Dhaka said on Sunday, reports UNB. The spokesperson said this is a temporary measure and the US citizens will return to Bangladesh again once the situation improves globally.  The spokesperson also said the US Embassy in Dhaka will remain open.  The US Department of State and US Embassy in Dhaka have arranged a special chartered flight for US citizens who wish to return and their families.  The special flight will be departing from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday. The spokesperson said the aircraft will be full, but did not specify the exact number of returnees. The size of the commercial aircraft was also not disclosed.  The special flight will include a Dhaka to Doha, Qatar leg followed by a connecting flight to Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC, said the US Embassy in Dhaka. Passengers will remain on the aircraft in Doha.  All passengers must agree to reimburse the US government for the flight by signing a promissory note for approximately the amount of a full-fare economy flight, or comparable alternate transportation, to the designated destination that would have been charged immediately prior to this crisis, said the Embassy.  The note must be signed and presented before boarding. No cash or credit card payments will be accepted at the airport.    \"You will be responsible for any arrangements or costs (lodging, onward destination or local transportation, etc) beyond Washington, DC.  The US Embassy is unable to book any onward travel for you. The exact departure time and routing of this chartered flight are subject to change,\" said the Embassy.  Asked why US is shifting its citizens to the US despite the risky situation there, the Embassy spokesperson said it is true that the US has been hit very hard but everybody takes their own decision. In the US, over 120,000 cases of Covid-19 and more than 2,000 deaths due to the viral infection had been recorded as of Sunday evening. "

      "text": "Fifty times stronger than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl can be lethal from as little as two milligrams Myanmar has made Southeast Asia's largest-ever seizure of synthetic drugs in raids that revealed the \"unprecedented\" production of opioids in an area notorious for pumping out heroin and meth, the UN said Monday. Between February and April, authorities swooped on labs in the lawless Kutkai area of Shan State, seizing nearly 200 million meth tablets, 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of crystal meth, some 300 kgs of heroin, and 3,750 litres of methyl fentanyl. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime described the haul as one of the largest and most successful counter-narcotics operations in the history of the region. \"What has been unearthed through this operation is truly off-the-charts,\" UNODC Southeast Asia and Pacific representative Jeremy Douglas said in a statement. The production network could only have been possible with the backing of serious transnational criminal groups, he added. The raids unearthed \"unprecedented\" methyl fentanyl, the sign of a new trend of synthetic opioid production emerging \"on a scale nobody anticipated\", said Douglas. Fifty times stronger than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl can be lethal from as little as two milligrams -- the equivalent of a few grains of sand. It has fueled an opioid crisis in the US which killed 32,000 people in 2018.  Myanmar is under pressure to stem the deluge of drugs from its freewheeling border regions. Shan State is part of the \"Golden Triangle\" -- a wedge of land cutting into Myanmar, Laos, China and Thailand and virtually untroubled by authorities despite its multi-billion-dollar trade. Myanmar is the world's second-biggest producer of heroin after Afghanistan, and is now widely thought to be the largest global source of meth, fueled by the flood of pre-cursor chemicals from China. Cheap, caffeine-cut \"yaba\" pills -- Southeast Asia's favorite high -- are pushed regionally, prices tripling as they cross borders into Thailand and Malaysia. The more addictive crystal meth, or \"ice\", is smuggled to Tokyo, Seoul or Sydney, where it sells for around $150,000 a kilo on the streets. \"Made-in-Myanmar\" drugs are trafficked south through Thailand, north into China and west towards Bangladesh -- a cascade of stimulants overwhelming regional policing efforts and seeding a crisis of addiction, corruption and money laundering. Thirty-three people were arrested in the operations with authorities vowing to bring to justice criminal groups, traffickers and accomplices. Colonel Zaw Lin from Myanmar's anti-drugs police acknowledged the challenges ahead, but said the traffickers' \"days of operating... are numbered.\""

      "text": "The government is very serious about recovering rivers from illegal occupation The government has taken a massive plan to recover canals, wetlands and small rivers across the country and re-excavate those to increase their navigability and water reservation capacity, groundwater recharge and thus preserve the biodiversity. These activities will be done under a project titled \"Re-excavation of small rivers, canals and wetlands inside 64 districts project (1st Phase),\" reports UNB. According to an official document, some 4,086.622km of 88 small rivers, 352 canals and eight wetlands will be re-excavated under 561 packages in 375 upazilas and two city corporations. The amount of excavated soil will be 15.15 crore cubic metres, 62.32 square metres of turfing while that of plantable tress 13.41 lakh. The objective of implementing this project is to ensure removing water-logging from 5.20 hectares of areas and securing those from flood and climate-change onslaught, boosting food production of 3.50 lakh metric tonnes through irrigation in 1.30 lakh hectares of land, fish farming in 15,000 hectares, preservation of bio-diversity in 25,000 hectares, flood control in 3.65 lakh hectares, improving roads and communication in 4100 kilometres and easing river communications through 1,800 kilometres of waterways. Meanwhile, the government started removing illegal structures from the banks of small rivers, canals and wetlands on December 12 last year. So far, it has removed 5,574 illegal structures and recovered 593.12 acres of land from illegal occupants. \"If the project is implemented, it will be possible to maintain the normal flow in small rivers and canals besides saving water reservoirs,\" the document states. It further mentions that the formulation of another project titled, \"Re-excavation of small rivers, canals and wetlands inside 64 districts project (2nd Phase),\" is underway. Under this project, the government will re-excavate five rivers, canals and wetlands in each upazila. Through this project, it will be possible to re-excavate 13,885.363km of rivers, canals, and wetlands, according to the document. A senior official at the Water Resources Ministry said the government is very serious about recovering rivers from illegal occupation. As the government is emphasizing the plying of passengers and transportation of goods through waterways, there is no way to increase the navigability of the rivers -- small or big -- across the country. \"The government has already taken various projects to improve passengers and goods' transportation through the waterways within the country,\" he said. He also mentioned by the \"Re-excavation of small rivers, canals and wetlands inside 64 districts project (1st Phase and 2nd Phase),\" will be very much helpful in preserving water during monsoon for the dry season. \"With this, we will also be able to recharge the groundwater which is very much essential for preserving the biodiversity for the future generation,\" the official added. Bangladesh is a riverine country with waterways crisscrossing much of its landscape.  According to experts, re-excavation is very important as business and internal movement of people are largely dependent on waterways, particularly during monsoon. "

      "text": "Gender equality is a core principle of EU, though it is still not a reality, speakers say European Union (EU) Ambassador to Bangladesh Rensje Teerink  has praised Bangladesh for performing better than The Netherlands and Luxembourg in terms of Global Gender Gap Index. She made the comment while attending an International Women's Day program arranged by European Union at a city hotel in Dhaka on Sunday, reports BSS. Teerink said not only in Bangladesh but in many countries of the world, women are facing different types of social and economic challenges. \"There are so many taboos in The Netherlands. Only 34% women are actually financially independent there. If a married woman does any job, she has to face different types of criticism, including not spending time with their children and sending their kids to daycare centres\", she said. The ambassador said Bangladesh is doing well in the field of women empowerment. As women still face a lot of challenges here, these should be addressed, besides making the people aware about gender equality, she added. At the function speakers said gender equality is a core principle of the European Union, though it is still not a reality. While sharing the views, they said in business, politics and society, to reach full potential the use of talent and diversity is a must. They said women face too many hurdles and barriers on their way and added in Europe and beyond, women continue to be targets of gender-based violence, stereotypes and hate speech. Even if Europe is a good address for women, one in three women in the EU are subject to physical and sexual violence, they said. The speakers said even though more women graduate from universities, they earn on average 16% less than men do. Only 8% of CEO's of the EU's largest companies are women, they mentioned. The function was told that this is not what EU stands for. Everyone, regardless of his or her gender, should be able to live free from violence and pursue his or her chosen path in life. A change is needed and the moment is now. Everyone needs to remember: progress towards equality between women and men is neither inevitable nor irreversible, speakers at the program said. The EU adopted the EU's Gender Equality Strategy, setting out concrete actions for the next five years, including on pay transparency. The strategy is also the EU's contribution to the \"Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action\" - the first universal commitment and action plan to advance on equality between women and men. The EU will continue to support, promote and protect women's rights and women empowerment, while tackling gender-based violence, including in fragile, conflict and emergency situations."

Now the district is becoming quite popular for Bamboo Chicken, a rich and healthy dish native to the region. The mouth watering dish is traditionally known as Huro Chumo (Chakma dialect) to the indigenous people of the area. Now it has turned the heads of many people in and outside Rangamati for its unique taste and flavour.  What one needs to cook Bamboo Chicken To prepare this delicious dish one needs one or half a kg medium sized chicken(sliced), onion, ginger, garlic, and green chilli paste. Add turmeric, cumin seed,  coriander powder with oil and salt  to your taste. You also need banana leaves. Finally, the most important thing. You need to cook all this in a hollow and sturdy fresh bamboo stem, large enough to hold all of the above.  Hence the name Bamboo Chicken.  Cooking the dish  First, one needs to mix the chicken and spices with oil and salt to taste. Then all this is put into the bamboo pipe and the mouth of the bamboo pipe needs to be closed securely with banana leaves. Next, the now full bamboo pipe is cooked in an open charcoal oven. Every few minutes, the pipe needs to be turned so the chicken is tender and cooked evenly. Finally, when the green bamboo stem turns white, the dish is finally cooked, says chef Debobrota in Rangamati. Debobrota added that bamboo chicken is generally eaten with rice, and bread made of wheat flour. Teenager Uchingcha Rakhaine of Rangamati town, said: \" Bamboo Chicken is the traditional food of the hills. We often eat this delicious dish.\" Yasin, a tourist, currently in Rangamati, said: \" I just tastes Bamboo Chicken for the first time, and it is really very tasty!\""

      "text": "The move followed highly publicized complaints from some governments and hospitals that they received PPE from China that they considered faulty The United States has asked China to revise new export quality control rules for protective equipment needed during the coronavirus pandemic so they are not an obstacle to timely supplies, a spokesman for the US State Department said on Thursday. China tightened restrictions on exports of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) last Friday, calling for shipments of the items to be subjected to a mandatory customs inspection. It was a bid by China to balance the global demand for PPE to help treat the rising number of cases of the new coronavirus, while ensuring that manufacturers and sellers do not flood the market with uncertified or shoddy products. The move followed highly publicized complaints from some governments and hospitals that they received PPE from China that they considered faulty. \"We appreciate the efforts to ensure quality control. But we do not want this to serve as an obstacle for the timely export of important supplies,\" a State Department spokesman said. \"The US Government has raised these concerns with (China). We have requested that China revise its new requirements to allow the expeditious export of vital PPE to the United States,\" he said. The United States is heavily reliant on medical supplies produced in China, a major strategic and trade rival, something that has been highlighted in the pandemic, in which the United States has been the worst-affected country. Earlier on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal cited US businesses and diplomatic memos as saying that China's export restrictions had left US-bound face masks, test kits and other medical equipment stranded. It cited suppliers and brokers as saying that large quantities were sitting in warehouses across China unable to receive necessary clearances. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke by phone with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and stressed the \"high importance\" Washington attached to China's facilitation of medical supply exports to meet critical demand in the United States. The US-China Business Council trade lobby group president Craig Allen told reporters on Thursday it had \"had a very good set of discussions with a relatively high level of the Chinese government over the last few days ... and the Chinese government is making allowances and working with our companies to ensure that they're able to ship out.\""

      "authors": "Reuters",
      "text": "Kuwait's cabinet also decided to extend a suspension of government and private agencies for two weeks The government of Kuwait imposed a nationwide curfew on Sunday starting from 14:00 GMT and running until 1:00 GMT to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, state news agency KUNA said, citing the cabinet. Kuwait, which went into virtual lockdown on Thursday, has taken some of the most drastic steps in the region to curb the virus' spread. The Gulf Arab country, which has reported 176 cases of the virus, said violators of the curfew could face up to three years in jail or fines of up to $32,157. The Kuwait National Guard will aid police in imposing the curfew. The decision was made due to \"some manifestations of non-compliance with precautionary measures,\" Deputy Prime Minister Anas al-Saleh said, according to KUNA. Kuwait's cabinet also decided to extend a suspension of government and private agencies for two weeks. It had already announced on Thursday an extension to a suspension of schools and universities until Aug. 4 - the first among its neighbours to impose such lengthy education closures to limit the spread of the sometimes deadly disease. After a late-night cabinet meeting on Saturday, the minister of trade and industry said the country's strategic food reserves were \"secure and plentiful\", KUNA said. He urged people not to stockpile food and said there was no need to panic. Last week, the cabinet approved a bill to increase the budget of ministries and governmental departments by 500 million dinars for the 2020/21 fiscal year due to the coronavirus outbreak. It also established a temporary fund for receiving financial contributions from institutions, companies, and individuals to support the government's efforts to fight the virus. The country's stock market has been battered by the virus outbreak as well as a historic plunge in oil prices. Its main index has lost nearly 30% of its value since the start of the year."

      "text": "In an exclusive interview with Dhaka Tribune's Humayun Kabir Bhuiyan,  Danish Ambassador to Bangladesh Winnie Estrup Petersen discussed a wide range of bilateral issues with particular emphasis on cooperation to help enable green growth How do you describe the current bilateral relations between Bangladesh and Denmark? How could it be further enhanced? In one word, I would describe it as excellent. Our partnership has been growing over the years. Yes, I am proud that we have a good partnership. We cooperate with each other in a wide range of sectors, especially climate change and agriculture. The existing strategic cooperation between the labour ministries of the two countries is aimed at improving occupational, health and safety conditions for Bangladeshi workers through exchange of knowledge and experience. A number of Danish companies, businesses and NGOs are present in Bangladesh. Denmark also works closely with Bangladesh in several international forums. For instance, both countries are members of the Human Rights Council and look forward to opportunities to work together. Our relations are wide and deep and I am a proud Ambassador of Denmark in Bangladesh. With continued cooperation on the issues of mutual interest, the relationship will transform and only deepen as Denmark shifts its bilateral focus from aid to trade, which will result in increased emphasis on green growth and issue of sustainability in Bangladesh.  I reckon in every relation, there are areas for dialogues. As our bilateral ties are rooted in strong foundations any issues can be addressed through dialogue and consensus. What are the new areas of cooperation by which both countries can be benefited? I think we are looking to explore green growth in several sectors, especially the readymade garments industry. By green growth, I mean each company will manufacture its products organically, resulting in the use of less water and thus less pollution. To simply put it into words, Danish companies are coming to Bangladesh to offer green solutions for local manufacturers. Dhaka is a densely populated business hub of the country. Unprecedented fire hazards over the past several years have drawn quite a bit of attention. Hence, Danish firms are collaborating with Bangladeshi organizations to set up small fire fighting stations equipped with easy-to-use fire fighting devices. There is another option for efficient fire fighting we are considering --e.g., motorbikes equipped with fire fighting instruments, for quick responses to fire incidents. It is a flexible and good technology.  We are also looking forward to cooperating with Bangladesh with respect to wind energy.  Denmark has expertise in developing cities that are more liveable, green, energy efficient and adaptable to traffic regulations.  We are identifying Danish expertise, technologies and innovations that may benefit both countries. Are you satisfied with the current trade volume between Dhaka and Copenhagen? How can this be increased? I am pleased with the present-day trade volume between the two countries and yet more can be done. Trade between the two countries is clearly in favour of Bangladesh. We would like to see increased Danish trade with Bangladesh. Is Danish investment in Bangladesh satisfactory? What does Bangladesh need to do more to attract higher Danish investment? There are about 40 Danish companies engaged one way or another in Bangladesh, which is  rather an impressive figure from a small country like Denmark. Bangladesh is a good market with an impressive growth trend. The Bangladesh economy needs more foreign investment in strategic areas to continue its growth momentum in the coming years. There are opportunities to bring Danish investment and businesses to Bangladeshi market. However, Danish companies face steep challenges mostly related to predictability of policies and legislation. Danish companies work best in a rule-based business environment. Business climate has to be well-regulated. Danish companies are not accustomed to dealing with bureaucratic red tape and they have a zero tolerance to corruption. Do you think the international community is doing enough to solve the Rohingya crisis? What do you think the solution is to this protracted crisis? As long as the crisis is not resolved, we have not done enough. As things stalled in the United Nations Security Council, the international community, including Denmark, is exploring alternative routes, which include proceedings at the Human Rights Council, International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court.  Denmark, a big contributor in terms of providing humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya people in Cox's Bazar, is working with the Bangladesh government and other global partners to provide the necessary support in addressing current and emerging challenges centering on the crisis."

In a post on Bernie Sanders official Facebook page on Wednesday, an image showed \"healthcare is a human right\" written in Bengali.  This is not the first time that the Sanders campaign made an effort to reach out to the Asian American communities, which were long ignored by most presidential candidates in the past.    Earlier, the Sanders campaign uploaded a video showing the plight of low-income earning Bangladeshi American families living in a community building run by a corrupt rental agency in Jamaica, a middle-class neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. New York remains a state where the majority of America's Bangladeshi community calls home. The Bangladeshi American community is also well-represented in neighbouring New Jersey, Maryland, DC, Florida, and, of course, California. It has a formidable presence in Michigan (especially in cities like Detroit and Hamtramck)."

      "text": "End-of-life vessel, carrying 1500 tons of toxic waste from oil extraction process, heading to Chittagong Environmental rights activists have urged Bangladesh to stop the import of a toxic ship for scrapping at breaking yards the Chittagong. Floating storage and offloading tanker J. Nat, which was used by offshore oil and gas companies, left Indonesian water on April 18 even though local activists warned Indonesian authorities about the toxicity of the vessel, says the NGO Shipbreaking Platform. \"Official documents indicate that the tanker has more than 1500 tons of hazardous waste from the oil extraction process onboard, including 1000 tons of slop oil, 500 tons of oily water and 60 tons of sludge oil contaminated with high concentration of mercury,\" reads a statement by the Platform released on Apr 29.  The vessel likely also contains high amounts of mercury in its structures as well as in ballast waters, it added. As most of the shipbreaking yards use the blow torch method to cut vessels, the high concentration of mercury in the steel hull of J. Nat risks the inhalation of mercury vapour, says the Platform. Exposure to it, even at low levels, has been linked to central nervous system damage, kidney and liver impairment, reproductive and developmental disorders, defects in foetuses and learning deficits, according to the statement.  \"Mercury is a naturally occurring element present in virtually all oil and gas fields. Concentrations are especially high in the South American and East Asian regions,\" it quoted Ingvild Jenssen, executive director and founder of NGO Shipbreaking Platform. Citing a recent court judgement on the illegal import of another oil and gas unit -- North Sea Producer, the rights body said the Bangladesh Supreme Court denounced the fraudulent documents claiming the vessel was toxic-free, when it was contaminated by radioactive substances. The court had then called for full transparency on toxic material in end-of-life vessels brought in to the country.   \"In light of the recent judgment on the North Sea Producer, there is no scope to give any authorization for import, beaching, and breaking of the J. NAT. It is public knowledge that Bangladesh will not be able to deal with the hazardous waste flow downstream. The vessel will simply flood our shores with toxic substances and expose our workers to deadly risks,\" the statement quoted Syeda Rizwana Hasan, director of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association. With many units to be decommissioned in the next few years, it is high time that the oil and gas industry collectively seeks sustainable solutions for the recycling of its floating units, said the Platform's founder Jenssen.  \"All actors involved in the oil and gas supply chain, directly or indirectly, have the responsibility to not cause harm to workers and the environment in developing countries.\""

The first phase of the annual congregation -- the second largest of its kind after Hajj -- on the outskirts of Dhaka, was mainly participated by the followers of Maulana Zubair, the head of Tabligh Jamaat in Bangladesh.  The second phase of the Ijtema, spanning three days is scheduled to begin on January 17 at the same venue, after a four-day break. Followers of Indian alem Maulana Saad Kandhalvi will participate in the closing phase of the annual congregation, where he will conduct the Akheri Munajat.  Muslim devotees from different walks of life, in great numbers, started thronging the Ijtema venue from the dawn, in order to attend the Munajat. Failing to board a vehicle on the way to the Ijtema grounds, many opted to commute on foot.  The venue was brimming soon after the Fajr prayers, with roads and lanes leading to the grounds packed with crowds of devotees despite the cold weather. Even parts of the Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway were occupied by devotees joining the Munajat.

Devotees outnumbering transportation vehicles, causing misery Traffic from Airport Road in the capital to Joydevpur Chowrasta, Mirer Bazar of Gazipur Sadar upazila to Tongi, Abdullahpur up until the Bypass Road were suspended for nearly six hours since the Fajr prayers. However, the movement of vehicles started around 12 noon, after the Munajat ended, causing a large number of crowds to pour into nearby roads and highways.   Very few vehicles operated in proportion to the huge crowd leaving the Ijtema premises for their destinations outside Tongi, leading to immense suffering for the devotees. They were left walking towards their destined locations. Cashing in on the situation, transport workers charged exorbitant fares from the devotees.    They were charging up to Tk100 from Azampur, Uttara to Motijheel, Sayedabad, Gulistan, Sadarghat, Azimpur, New Market and Gabtoli. Similar fares were being charged by the driver's assistant of a BRTC bus, for the same distance.   In addition, a large number of motorbikes added to the troubles of devotees leaving the Ijtema premises.  Meanwhile, Bangladesh Railway arranged a special rail service engaging 16 trains to carry passengers to and from Tongi, on the occasion, as it does every year. Plus, every inter-city train crossing Tongi Railway Station stopped there for five minutes.    Schedule set for next year's Bishwa Ijtema The faction of Tabligh Jamaat, led by Maulana Zubair, has fixed the dates for the two phases of Ijtema to be held in January 2021.  Md Mejbah Uddin, a leader of the faction, informed reporters that the first phase of the three-day-long congregation will start on January 8, while the second and last one will be held from January 15. Prior to that, a five-day Jor Ijtema, a gathering organized ahead of the two-phase Bishwa Ijtema, will be held from November 27 this year.  Dowry-free mass marriage  Unlike last year, this year's first phase of Ijtema ended with a dowry-free mass marriage ceremony. On Saturday, the second day of the three-day phase, 101 couples were married without dowry.  The brides and grooms were listed for the event on Thursday, upon their consent.   The second mass marriage is scheduled for the second day of the closing phase of the annual gathering.  A mass marriage is held on the second day of each phase of the Ijtema every year, but it did not take place in 2019 following a Tabligh Jamaat factional feud. "

On the real-time rankings, Dhaka showed an average AQI score of 161 at 10:09am on Sunday, according to AirVisual, which monitors global air quality. Dhaka's air quality was classified as \"unhealthy.\" Residential areas like Bashundhara, Baridhara DOHS, and Gulshan 2 showed AQI scores of 168, 157, and 158 respectively. Thailand's Chang Mai, China's Shenyang, and India's Delhi occupied the first, second, and third spots in the list of cities with the worst air quality with AQI scores of 194, 191, and 174 respectively. A numerical value between 151 and 200 indicates that everyone may begin to experience health effects. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. Air quality between 201 and 300 is classified as \"very unhealthy.\" If the score is between 301 and 500, then it is classified as \"hazardous.\" The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants -- Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh has been struggling with air pollution for a long time. Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Brick kilns, vehicles run on fuel containing higher levels of sulphur, as well as construction work, have all been identified as major sources of air pollution. Air quality further declines during the dry months -- from October to April -- but improves during the monsoon."

      "text": "India will also provide 150 ambulances to Bangladesh on the occasion Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join the birth centenary celebrations of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on March 17 through a recorded video message. \"We'll have a virtual form of our Prime Minister's presence and India as well through him,\" Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla told a group of visiting Bangladeshi journalists at Hyderabad House in Delhi on Wednesday. Indian Prime Minister Modi was scheduled to visit Bangladesh on March 17 to attend the birth centenary celebrations, but postponed it due to the coronavirus outbreak. Following the detection of coronavirus cases for the first time in Bangladesh, the year-long programs chalked out to celebrate the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during the \"Mujib Borsho\" have been rescheduled in consideration of public health. The grand inaugural ceremony of the birth centenary celebrations scheduled for March 17 at the National Parade Ground has been put on hold due to the prevailing situation across the world caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The ceremony will be held later. In the video message, the Indian prime minister will also announce some advancement in bilateral relations between Bangladesh and India, sources at the Indian External Affairs Ministry have confirmed. In the video message, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also showcase Bangabandhu's life, they added.  Indian Foreign Secretary Vardhan Shringla at the Hyderabad House in Delhi on Wednesday, March 11, 2020 | Courtesy Bangladesh to get defence supply from India soon  For the first time in the country's history, the Bangladesh Armed Forces will get the first installment of defence supplies from India soon, according to a top level source at the Indian External Affairs Ministry.  As part of the first phase of the defence pact, the Indian prime minister will officially announce the handing over of some sports utility vehicles (Tata Hexa) to the Bangladesh Army. The $500million pact was signed between the two neighbours when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina paid a four-day visit to Delhi in July 2018.  Traditionally India supplies defence equipment to Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and of late to Afghanistan. India has also extended $600million defence related Line of Credit (LoC) to Vietnam and another LoC to Mauritius in the past.  Defence diplomacy is emerging as a key element in India's foreign policy, with Delhi eyeing a supply of defence equipment to friendly countries in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, according to experts. Indian to give 150 ambulances As a token of friendship, India will provide 150 ambulances to Bangladesh, 100 for the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujib and 50 others representing the 50 years of relationship between India and Bangladesh, Shringla said. On the donation of ambulances, Shringla said they were a gift from Modi who would make the formal announcement. He said these were not ordinary ambulances but had systems in place so that victims facing trauma could access a nearby ambulance by calling a designated number immediately."

      "text": "At least 38 people have so far been rescued from the rubble of the 80-room Xinjia hotel in coastal Quanzhou city Around 70 people were trapped after the collapse of a hotel used as a coronavirus quarantine facility in eastern China on Saturday evening, officials said.  At least 38 people have so far been rescued from the rubble of the 80-room Xinjia hotel in coastal Quanzhou city, said the local government. Footage circulating on microblogging platform Weibo showed rescue workers combing through the building's wreckage in the dark and reassuring a woman trapped under heavy debris as other wounded victims were carried into ambulances. The hotel's facade appeared to have crumbled into the ground, exposing the building's steel frame, and a crowd had gathered around the area as the evening wore on. Officials have yet to confirm whether anyone died in the accident. Quanzhou authorities said over 700 rescue workers had been deployed to the scene along with ambulances, excavators and cranes.  Representatives from Beijing are also en route to Quanzhou to assist in relief efforts, Xinhua news agency reported. Quanzhou has recorded 47 cases of the COVID-19 infection and the hotel, which opened just two years ago, was recently repurposed to house people who had been in recent contact with confirmed patients, the People's Daily state newspaper reported. China is no stranger to building collapses and deadly construction accidents, which are typically blamed on the country's rapid growth leading to corner-cutting by builders and the widespread flouting of safety rules. At least 20 people died in 2016 when a series of crudely-constructed multi-storey buildings packed with migrant workers collapsed in the eastern city of Wenzhou. Another 10 were killed last year in Shanghai after the collapse of a commercial building during renovations."

A group of hackers named Team Donz claimed responsibility for hacking the website between late Friday and early Saturday. On Friday, a photograph of Manirampur Executive Magistrate and Assistant Commissioner (Land) Sayeema Hasan, taking a photograph of the elderly men holding their ears as punishment for not wearing masks, surfaced on Facebook that generated the criticism of netizens. News of the hacking surfaced on Facebook early Saturday when many users shared a screenshot of the webpage where the photograph of the incident was featured on the website. The hackers replaced the cover photo of the domain page with a photograph of Sayeema punishing the senior citizens. The hackers also added a notice on the noticeboard that read: \"In spite of being a literate person, the assistant commissioner of land acted like an illiterate person,\" which was later removed around 12:20am. Confirming the matter on Saturday afternoon, Jessore district's Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Shafiul Arif said: \"The webpage was hacked and our IT team fixed it at midnight.\" The domain page is run under the National Web Portal of Bangladesh (Jatiya Tatthya Batayan). Contacted, Sayeema was not available for comment, despite repeated attempts over the phone. Earlier on Saturday, Sayeema was withdrawn from her workplace after widespread criticism on social media, confirmed Public Administration Secretary Sheikh Yusuf Harun. Punishment gone wrong Following the government's directive for people to stay inside their houses to curb the spread of coronavirus, many government officials and law enforcement agencies have been conducting drives in different areas of the country. A mobile court, led by then executive magistrate Sayeema Hasan, conducted drives in different areas of Manirampur on Friday afternoon. During the drive, she asked the three elderly men, including a van driver and a vegetable vendor, at Chinatola Bazar, to hold their ears in public as punishment. She also captured photographs of the punishment. Her photograph capturing moments with the humiliated elderly individuals later went viral on social media and drew significant criticism."

Shirin Begum, Shariyat's wife alleged they are living in fear of security, while the police failed to pay heed to their concerns. \"We have been shunned-off by the village arbiters for 15 days. They are also influencing the locals so they do not interact with us.\" \"My children were forced to stop going to school as we receive death threats every day,\" she added.

We are watching over their concerns as soon as they arise.\" \"The family is regularly paying visits to Bayati Shariyat,\" he added. Meanwhile, Tangail Qawmi Ulama Parishad on Thursday held a press conference, and demanded death sentence for Shariyat Bayati over his anti-Islamic remarks. They urged the government to pass a blasphemy law that ensures death penalty to Shariyat and other anti-Islamists. They have asked singers, actors, and directors not to endorse anti-Islamic content. Bayati Shariyat Sarker, a folk singer, was arrested on Saturday over his alleged anti-Islamic remarks at a program, and sent to jail on Tuesday after a three day remand. Cultural activists from all over the country, including Dhaka, Manikganj, Rajbari, Rajshahi districts are holding processions, human chains and demonstrations asking for Bayati's prompt release."

      "text": "Seventeen people are also missing, seven injured, and some 3,500 have been forced out of their homes following a series of landslides and building collapses At least 30 people have been killed in two days of intense storms in southeastern Brazil, the Minas Gerais state Civil Defense office said on Saturday. Seventeen people are also missing, seven injured, and some 3,500 have been forced out of their homes following a series of landslides and building collapses, Civil Defense officials said. Television footage showed images of overflowing rivers, flood neighborhoods and trees and utility poles knocked over by the rushing water. Several highways have also been cut by the flooding, and scores of bridges have been knocked out. Most of the victims were killed in landslides or buried in destroyed homes. At least two children were listed among the dead. The heavy rain and flooding is also hitting the nearby states of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo. Rainfall in the region has been the heaviest since records were first kept 110 years ago, the National Institute of Meteorology said. In one 24-hour period, the Minas Gerais state capital Belo Horizonte recorded 172 millimeters of rain. Forecasters said the rain is expected to taper off on Sunday, but authorities warn that the danger of landslides remains high, especially in the Belo Horizonte area. The deluge coincided with the first anniversary of the dam collapse in the Minas Gerais town of Brumadinho that killed 270 people. Eleven people are still listed as missing. An accumulation of water and a lack of drainage caused the tailings dam rupture on January 25, 2019, according to a report commissioned by the mining firm Vale."

On the real-time rankings, Dhaka showed an average AQI score of 136 at 10:06am on Wednesday, according to AirVisual, which monitors global air quality. Dhaka's air quality was classified as \"unhealthy for sensitive groups.\" Residential areas like Gulshan and Bashundhara showed AQI scores of 143 and 155 respectively. Pakistan's Lahore, India's Mumbai, and Nepal's Kathmandu occupied the first, second, and third spots in the list of cities with the worst air quality with AQI scores of 228, 177, and 174 respectively. A numerical value between 101 and 150 indicates that sensitive groups may begin to experience health effects.  A value between 151 and 200 indicates that everyone may begin to experience health effects. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.  Air quality between 201 and 300 is classified as \"very unhealthy.\" If the score is between 301 and 500, then it is classified as \"hazardous.\" The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants -- Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh has been struggling with air pollution for a long time. Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Brick kilns, vehicles run on fuel containing higher levels of sulphur, as well as construction work, have all been identified as major sources of air pollution. Air quality further declines during the dry months -- from October to April -- but improves during the monsoon."

      "text": "Farmers are unable to derive enough profits from their regular jhuming while the poppy fields are offering much more to them The cultivation of opium has been surging in Bandarban despite regular drives by joint forces comprising Bangladesh Army, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and other law enforcement agencies. Almost 25 acres of the poppy crop  were destroyed in different upazilas of the district. Even so, the reason behind the increased interest in poppy cultivation is somewhat surprising for some locals, as this correspondent found during a visit to the area. Most recently, on February 19, the Bangladesh Army destroyed an acre of poppy field in Ruma. On February 16, BGB destroyed three acres of poppy field in Thanchi's Ko-Ong area and just the previous day, on February 15, the army destroyed another acre in Ruma upazila's Tuikkajhiri area, according to law enforcement sources. Bangladesh Army Ruma zone Commander Lt Col Md Goulam Akbar, psc, explained how poppy plants are being used in making the deadly opium and as the drugs are sold at high prices, he said, locals are getting more interested day by day in investing more in poppy cultivation than in their yearly Jhum yields. \"Despite all the challenges we are patrolling even in the most inaccessible parts of the hill tracts to free the region from drugs and we will continue our drives as long as it is necessary,\" said Commander Akbar. On February 4, the security forces in a joint drive led by East Bengal Regiment (EB) Commander Md Ashiqur Rahman destroyed 12 poppy fields across 10 acres of hilly slopes in Saikot and Khulen Khumi areas. The farmers made good their escape. Shoihlaching Marma, a local journalist in Ruma, said that poppy plants grew more in quantity in winter, and as this year's winter was colder, cultivation reached a peak.   Uhlaching Marma, chairman of Ruma upazila, said the local authorities were taking different measures to discourage the farmers from growing poppy, including arranging meetings to raise awareness about the consequences of the illicit cultivation.  \"Jhuming\", an age-old practice of the indigenous people of the hill tracts, is now facing a challenge because of the flawed transportation system that bars farmers from selling their produce and earn an easy livelihood, said Lu Pru Ong Marma, a Ruma resident. Farmers are unable to derive enough profits from their regular jhuming while the poppy fields are offering much more to them. This factor might be making the farmers inclined to take risks and despite the drives, cultivation is on the rise this year, the local added. Members of the Arakan Liberation Party (ALP), which is a Rakhine political party in Myanmar, and its armed wing, the Arakan Liberation Army (ALA), somehow cross the border near Ruma, Thanchi and Alikadam upazilas and cultivate the illicit plant with help from locals, smuggling it back to Myanmar, said local sources. The profits gained from these drugs are the main source of income for the insurgent militant group, locals say. Md Shamsul Alam, upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) of Ruma, said the authorities had directed the local representatives to warn residents about the aftermath of such illegal cultivation and would arrange regular meetings to raise awareness about the problem. He said: \"Despite our warnings, if anybody tries to break the law, they will face punishment.\""

      "text": "The state government said two had died while undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad The government of southern India's Telangana state on Monday announced that six people who had attended a religious congregation in Nizamuddin area of New Delhi have died of the coronavirus. A statement issued by the Chief Minister Office said the victims had attended the three-day religious congregation and contracted Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The state government said two had died while undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad, one each in Apollo Hospital and Global Hospital. Two other deaths were reported from Nizamabad and Gadwal. It also added that special teams under district collectors have identified those who came in contact with these people, and they were shifted to hospitals.  The authorities also urged people who attended the prayers in Delhi to contact officials. \"Telangana health department requests those who attended the congregation at Markaz to voluntarily report at hospitals,\" it said, adding that the government would conduct tests and offer treatment to them free of cost. Thousands of Indians and hundreds of foreigners had attended the conference that took place on March 9 and 10 in the densely populated Nizamuddin area of Delhi. Ten of the 17 confirmed cases in Tamil Nadu on March 30 were also of people who had participated in the congregation. India has recorded 1,251 cases of the coronavirus, with 32 deaths, but health experts say the country of 1.3 billion people could see a major surge in cases that could overwhelm its weak public health system."

      "text": "Tea workers in Moulvibazar suffering in bitter cold At least six children died from pneumonia in Khagrachhari between January 1 and 13, according to local medical professionals.  Due to the cold wave that has been sweeping across Bangladesh for over a week, there has been a rise in pneumonia and cold-induced diarrhoea infection in the hill district,  particularly in the rural areas.  Confirming the death toll, Dr Rajendra Tripura, paediatric specialist at Khagrachhari Sadar Hospital, said the hospital had received many patients whose health had deteriorated because of primary treatment being neglected.  Newborns and children are the worst sufferers of cold-related diseases - pneumonia and diarrhoea - in the district, hospital sources said. Most of these children are aged between 6 and 18 months.  Children with severe cases of pneumonia have been getting admitted to the hospital. Many of them are in critical condition.  The hospital staff are overwhelmed with the growing number of patients coming in, sources have said.  Dr Nayanmoy Tripura, resident doctor at Khagrachhari Sadar Hospital, said at least 1,200 people had been treated for pneumonia and diarrhoea in the hospital since the advent of winter.  Medical professionals have advised local citizens, especially guardians of children, not to panic and instead arrange proper medical care in time.  Moulvibazar tea workers suffer in bitter cold A bitterly cold weather has gripped the seven upazilas of Moulvibazar, making life miserable for tea workers, especially the elderly and children. Due to dense fog, the sun remains invisible for most of the day in Sreemangal and Kamalganj.  \"The bitter cold leaves us shivering even inside the house,\" said Koloti Ghatuar, an elderly woman working at Kurma tea garden, beside the Dhalai River. The temperature was recorded at 11 degrees Celsius in Sreemangal on Tuesday, said Anisur Rahman, assistant meteorologist at the local met office. Dr Zakir Hosain, resident medical officer at Kulaura Upazila Health Complex, said the number of patients suffering from cold-related diseases had increased in the last few days.  Workers of Harincherra tea garden went to the local union parishad office for warm clothes, but did not get any help, said Swapan Nayek, a Sreemangal resident. The impoverished people of the tea garden areas are the worst sufferers as they can hardly afford any warm clothes, according to Rajghat Union Parishad Chairman Bijoy Benarjee. Around 400,000 workers of 92 tea gardens in the district are suffering, yet they have not received any help from the tea garden owners, complained Makhon Lal Karmakar, president of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union.  But Bangladesh Cha Sangsad Vice-Chairman Shafwan Chowdhury said tea garden owners had provided support to tea workers this winter, though on a limited scale. District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Ashraf Ali said the authorities had distributed Tk10 lakh and 43,200 blankets among cold-stricken people in the district, and allotted Tk2 lakh to help the poor buy winter clothes for children."

      "text": "Surging waters broke through embankments surrounding an island in Bangladesh's Noakhali district, destroying more than 500 homes A powerful cyclone pounded eastern India and Bangladesh on Wednesday, killing at least 14 people and destroying thousands of homes, officials said, leaving authorities struggling to mount relief efforts amid a surging coronavirus outbreak. The populous Indian state of West Bengal took the brunt of Cyclone Amphan, which barrelled out of the Bay of Bengal with gusting winds of up to 185 km per hour (115 mph) and a storm surge of around five metres. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said at least 10 people had died in the state, and two districts been completely battered by one of the strongest storms to hit the region in several years. \"Area after area has been devastated. Communications are disrupted,\" Banerjee said, adding that although 500,000 people had been evacuated, state authorities had not entirely anticipated the ferocity of the storm. With rains continuing, she said the hardest hits areas were not immediately accessible. Federal authorities said they could only make a proper assessment of the destruction on Thursday morning. \"We are facing greater damage and devastation than the Covid-19,\" Banerjee said, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has so far killed 250 people in the state. In West Bengal's capital city, Kolkata, strong winds upturned cars and felled trees and electricity poles. Parts of the city were plunged into darkness. An official in the adjoining Hooghly district said thousands of mud homes were damaged by raging winds. In neighbouring Bangladesh, at least four people were killed, officials said, with power supplies cut off in some districts. Authorities there had shifted around 2.4 million people to more than 15,000 storm shelters this week. Bangladeshi officials also said they had moved hundreds of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, living on a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, to shelter. But officials said they feared that standing crops could be damaged and large tracts of fertile land in the densely-populated country washed away.  \"Fortunately, the harvesting of the rice crop has almost been completed. Still it could leave a trail of destruction,\" said Mizanur Rahman Khan, a senior official in the Bangladesh agriculture ministry. Cyclones frequently batter parts of eastern India and Bangladesh between April and December, often forcing the evacuations of tens of thousands and causing widespread damage. Surge and high tide Surging waters broke through embankments surrounding an island in Bangladesh's Noakhali district, destroying more than 500 homes, local official Rezaul Karim said. \"We could avoid casualties as people were moved to cyclone centres earlier,\" Karim said. Embankments were also breached in West Bengal's Sundarban delta, where weather authorities had said the surge whipped up by the cyclone could inundate up to 15 km inland. The ecologically-fragile region straddling the Indian-Bangladesh border is best known for thick mangrove forests that are a critical tiger habitat, and is home to around 4 million people in India. On the Sundarbans' Ghoramara island, resident Sanjib Sagar said several embankments surrounding settlements had been damaged, and some flooding had started. \"A lot of houses have been damaged,\" he told Reuters by phone. Anamitra Anurag Danda, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation think-tank who has extensively studied the Sundarbans, said that embankments across the area may have been breached. \"The cyclone surge coincided with the new moon high tides. It is devastation in the coastal belt,\" he said."

As we saw people running from the distance, we informed the higher officials and requested backup. Locals took him to hospital after the incident.\" Pabna Acting Superintendent of Police (SP) Gautam Kumar Biswas said that a three-member probe committee was formed to investigate the incident. \"The probe committee will look if there was any negligence from police members. The committee headed by Additional SP Shamima Akhter has been guided to submit the report within seven days,\" added SP Gautam. On December 20, a woman was reportedly raped in Gopalpur village of the Pabna Sadar upazila. Two days after the woman's family filed a case against the prime accused Ariful Islam, younger brother of Maligachha Union Parishad Chairman Shariful Islam, and seven others."

      "text": "Is this unprecedented or is history repeating itself? \"War is Peace/Freedom is Slavery/Ignorance is Strength\" runs the slogan of the \"Party\" ruling fictional Oceania in George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984. The motto illustrates the seductive appeal of Doublethink -- the ability to juxtapose mutually contradictory themes or ideas simultaneously. Seven decades after its initial publication, Orwell's grim vision of a dystopia envisages a society run by a repressive totalitarian state through intrusive surveillance and coercive censorship; the stamping out of even the mildest form of disagreement or dissent; relentless barrage of counter-factual propaganda; promotion of perpetual war and unabashedly eulogizing and extolling the cult of personality. Orwell partially based his work on the nightmarish horrors of Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Terms such as thoughtcrime, unperson, Ministry of Truth, and Big Brother have entered the popular lexicon and become emblematic of oppressive societal control by the state through bureaucratic, technological, and economic means.  The wave of populism that seems to have swept the world is often pointed out to be the beginning of dystopia. Populism rests on the twin pillars of disconnect and discontent of the masses with the extant political, economic and social system, and the polarization and fragmentation of the body politic of the nation.  The populist movement basks on a binary, exclusionary principle of the righteous versus the damned; us versus them; hard working patriotic populace versus the corrupt elite; the son of the soil versus the foreigner. The perception of an imminent threat or danger captures the public's imagination. The populist leader, like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, plays upon these fears and magnifies them. By whipping the crowd to a feverish frenzy, through nonstop agitprop, he consolidates their support, and converts it to favourable tangible electoral outcome, which in turn helps him to acquire the reins of power of the state. Once in power, he chips away at the old system and shows scant regard for convention and long-established tradition, in a bid to centralize power and shore up his authority. Sooner rather than later, key components of a functioning democracy such as transparency, accountability, stakeholder consultation, and engagement, are diluted or are dispensed with, on the spurious plea of efficacious governance or averting a national catastrophe.  The media is coaxed, cajoled, or coerced into pliant submission; segments of the intelligentsia and civil society are brought on board by the lure of lucre and plush appointments; the independence of the judiciary is diluted and compromised. Dissenting voices and conscientious objectors are singled out, vilified and ostracized by a baying mob which supports the populist leader to the hilt. The progressive dumbing down of the populace is accompanied by an exponential decay in the civil and democratic rights of the citizens and the journey to dystopia has started in earnest. Look no farther than the Third Reich, under Adolf Hitler, for corroboration of this denouement. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, Orwell's dark musings of an undesirable future appears eerily prophetic in an era of nihilism, anarchism, sectarianism, racism, casteism, ethnocentrism, bigotism, religious radicalism, corporatism, majoritarianism, populism, nativism, protectionism, hyper nationalism, and unilateralism. The prevalent mood of cynicism stands in stark contrast to the brief period of heady optimism following the end of the Cold War, courtesy of the implosion and spectacular collapse of the mighty monolith called the Soviet Union. A false dawn It was erroneously believed that the \"benign\" forces of free market capitalism, rules-based free trade-centric globalization, western style liberal democracy, and technological advancement, under the aegis of Pax Americana, would usher in an era of unrivaled peace and prosperity for all humanity and make the world a truly global village. Yet, within a brief span of three decades, it increasingly seems to be a false dawn. The global hegemon, instead of displaying robust leadership, has been assailed by self-inflicted contradictions. The lone superpower of the world, the United States of America, rallies to the chant of \"Make America Great Again\" which in itself is problematic as it shows a loss of confidence and serious self-doubt in its manifest destiny. The locomotive of global growth in the world seems unduly perturbed by the rise of China, which in essence is an upper-middle-income country, whose per capita income is still only about a quarter of that of high-income countries. The country that invented the global trade order, WTO, and championed free trade, now is trigger-happy at lashing punitive tariffs and starting bruising trade wars with trusted partners and allies; not to mention, renegotiating trade agreements and distancing itself from multilateral institutions and initiatives.  A country founded by immigrants wanting to escape the ravages of a sectarian, war-weary old world now talks of fencing its borders; a country possessing the mightiest military in recorded history wastes time, energy, and resources picking up a fight with Iran, which by all accounts is a regional power at best in the Middle East (ranking way behind Israel and Turkey); a country which boasts of technological behemoths like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and is still a magnet for the best and brightest in the world, worries about losing its competitive edge to rivals; a country which has a proud and long-running democratic tradition loudly champions petty dictators and autocrats.  The United States of America was supposed to be a shining beacon of hope for the rest of the world to admire and emulate. Yet, it has become subsumed with angst, torpor, and inherent self contradictions. The only country limiting the US's boundless potential is the US itself. A lot has been written and speculated about the most powerful man in the world by virtue of being the elected leader of the lone superpower. President Donald Trump basically exhibits the traits of a dyed-in-the-wool third-world demagogic populist leader which includes his penchant for indulging in diplomacy by Twitter; reliance on transactional diplomacy; belittling heads of states of allies; intolerance towards criticism (a genuine South Asian trait); dismissing unflattering reports and coverage as fake news; engaging in perilous brinkmanship with puny regional rivals; a constant showman's urge to steal the thunder and be in the spotlight; the desire to be surrounded by \"yes men\" and sycophants; the overt reliance on immediate family members for state-related affairs; the politically incorrect statements and lack of diplomatic finesse; the penchant for vitriolic statements and stoking of sectarian divide; the impatience with nuanced, multifaceted arguments and complex reasoning; the tendency to run roughshod over bipartisanship and common consensus. Yet, it is an incontrovertible fact that he retains the fervent support of large swathes of decent, ordinary Americans who feel cheated by the system at Capitol Hill and are disenchanted with the status quo; who are struggling to make ends meet; whose livelihoods are threatened by outsourcing, rash of cheap imports, and automation and lopsided trade agreements; flood of unskilled and semi-skilled immigrant workers who take up the bulk of blue collar jobs; ballooning cost of health care and education; tired with America's never-ending engagement in military conflicts in remote corners of the globe and the funds that flow out of taxpayers' money to shore up tottering regimes.  It would be a disservice to dismiss Trump as merely a populist leader. He has, by the perfect sleight of hand (despite being a privileged insider), posed as an outsider, to arrive at the epicentre of power -- skillfully playing to the anxiety and fears of the ordinary Caucasian American. Lessons from Ancient Rome America has been long compared to the other superpower of yesteryears, Ancient Rome. Indeed, the Founding Fathers had been keen students of the Roman Republic and drew inspiration from it to devise a host of checks and balances and separation of power between the executive, legislative, and the judiciary.  The decline and fall of the Roman Empire is keenly studied by American scholars and strategists to draw lessons from, in order to avert a similar fate for American global hegemony. Hence, it is not surprising that Trump's ascent to power and mannerisms have often been compared to eccentric and notorious Roman emperors.  Case in point, he has been compared to the infamous second emperor of Rome, Caligula, who loved to put on a spectacle, reveled in insulting and humiliating people, and treated the then elites, the senatorial class, like dirt. He despised traditional Roman values and practices and wanted to mold Rome in his own image. Yet he was wildly popular with the ordinary Romans, who were grateful for the games and circuses that Caligula lavishly funded at his own expense. Caligula had the unstinting support of the Roman mob till his last day before his assassination.   On the other hand, supporters of Trump could compare him to the legendary Gracchi brothers, during the Roman Republic era, who, despite being born in a wealthy aristocratic family, went into collision course with the elites who ruled Rome. By taking on the side of the urban poor masses of Rome -- the plebeians -- they swept to power and enacted sweeping land and other economic reforms (which in today's parlance could be called pro-poor).  Both brothers ended up being killed by a vengeful elite, resentful at its loss of power. However, that set in a chain of instability and violence, which sounded the death knell of the Republic and paved the way for autocratic control. Which emperor Trump resembles is a matter of debate amongst classicists and historians. However, one thing is certain: America will not be the same after Trump. Trump joins a spate of maverick leaders who have had a brush with populism, who draw strength from polarization and divisiveness and are considered as a threat to the established political order, yet cannot be beaten outright in elections -- Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Narendra Modi of India, Rodrigo Duterte of Philippines, Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom and, to a certain extent, Vladimir Putin of Russia (who is more of a nationalist leader, emulating the footsteps of past Russian Tsars and Tsarinas such as Peter the Great and Catherine the Great). All of these leaders can be considered as Novus Homo in the political arena who have upset the apple cart and jettisoned the existing power brokers, and are seen as an embodiment of the voices of the overlooked, neglected, and marginalized stratum of the population. In a desire to get rid of sheer lawlessness, endemic corruption, and weak  governance, they have reposed their trust in these leaders.  Often, religious revivalism has gone hand in hand with populism to raise these leaders to the crest of popularity and mass adulation. The common man has derived vicarious pleasure as these leaders have proceeded to displace the effete elite and the chattering classes to ignominious oblivion. Populism thus can be seen as the revenge of the masses against the elite and the intelligentsia and is often viewed as an anti-intellectual, revisionist movement.  Inevitably, there have been accusations of derailment and displacement of democratic practices and concomitant increase in authoritarianism. Europe, too, is brimming with populist leaders such as Marine Le Pen of France, Viktor Orban of Poland, Matteo Salvini of Italy, and Geert Wilders of Netherlands, to name a few. It is feared that the wave of populism may have a cascading effect on other countries with dysfunctional democracies and weak institutions.  A long history However, contrary to popular perception, populism and its inherent dangers is not a new phenomenon. It too has a long history. Ancient Athens has been hailed as the birthplace of western democracy. In fact, the very word democracy is derived from the Greek demokratia (popular government) combining demos (common people) and kratos (rule or strength). The Ancient Athenians were among the handful few, who pioneered directly representative government based on free male citizen suffrage, two and a half millennia back.  However, the system was not truly democratic as it excluded women and slaves. It was also vulnerable to the threat of demagogues (yet another Greek term) who adroitly manipulated the emotions of the mob. Socrates, the father of Western philosophy was highly skeptical of the benefits of democracy and wary of the danger of demagogues usurping power through popular support.  Socrates asserted that voting in an election required skill, rational thinking, and prior education and should not be based on intuition and emotion. He routinely attacked the democratic government of the day and eventually paid a steep price for it as he was sentenced to death in 399 BCE for disturbing the peace and corrupting the impressionable youth of the city state.  No wonder, that his most famous disciple, Plato, looked down on democracy with barely concealed contempt and envisaged an ideal state as run by a philosopher king who would be aided by a select handful of elites. Athenian experiment with democracy soon petered out due to bitter infighting and foreign Macedonian occupation. Republican Rome was determined to resist the rule of autocratic tyrants and kings. Yet the late republic's history was a violent and chequered one as it was marked by increasing conflict between different factions vying for control of the most powerful city in the world, with mob support. Populist leaders like Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus (the Gracchi brothers), Clodius Pulcher, Lucius Cataline, and even the great Julius Caesar all chose to entice the Roman mob with promises of land redistribution, the waiving off of debt, and provision of free bread, circus, and games.  Wave after wave of populist leaders bred conflict and civil war and irreparably damaged the republican institutions of Rome. It was with weary resignation that Republican Rome voluntarily transitioned to Imperial Rome, under the rule of Augustus in 27 BCE. The intellectual raison d'etre behind the enduring appeal of populism, despite the inherent dangers of chaos and dystopia, can partially be found in the works of Thomas Carlyle, Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, and Max Weber. Carlyle, a nineteenth century British polymath, in his collection of lectures, later published as On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History, he famously stated that the world's history is nothing more than a collection of biographies belonging to great men.  He posited that great leaders throughout history were destined to lead and deserved to do so because of their inherent abilities. This in effect reduced the surrounding institutions and structures to little or no import. Great leaders arose at a time of great need, when the society or nation was facing a grave existential crisis. This laid the modern foundation for the Cult of Personality and the Messiah Complex.  Then there is the German philosopher, Nietzsche, who had the most outsized influence in history with his concept of the Ubermensch or Overman/Superman that he introduced and fleshed upon in his seminal work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra. An Overman is one who is able to influence and affect history indefinitely. He is one who is willing to risk all for the sake of upliftment and enhancement of humanity. An Overman does not shy away from creating and propagating his own values, independent from the rest of humanity who are prone to follow herd-instinct.  One of Nietzsche's claim to infamy is that his works influenced later day Anarchist movement and Nazism. (Hitler greatly admired his work and fancied himself as an Ubermensch). Max Weber, a German sociologist and political economist, introduced his concept of charismatic authority in the Essay, \"The Three Types of Legitimate Rule.\" The charismatic leadership style relies on the charm and persuasiveness of the leader. Charismatic leaders are driven by their convictions and commitment to their cause. Charismatic leadership, according to Weber, is found in a leader with extraordinary characteristics of individual, whose mission and vision inspire others. All the three theories have a common thread running through them -- that of a larger than life figure, who is capable of exerting great influence on the society and reshaping history. Despite the criticisms, these theories are able to explain somewhat the hypnotic appeal of populist leaders in a post-modern age of mechanization, standardization, regulation, automation, virtual reality, and low sense of self-worth and absence of clear direction.  In a time of uncertainty and confusion, people flock to leaders with firm opinions and explicitly stated convictions who do not shy away from being politically incorrect or scapegoating a minority for the ills that afflict them. The peril of dystopia is ignored for the warm comfort of firm, decisive leadership.  Ibn Khaldun, the brilliant medieval Arab scholar, believed that history repeated itself in a cyclical manner. If so then the experiment with Western style liberal democracy may have run out of steam and the age of populist dystopia may have begun. Only time will tell.

In Noakhali, a Chhatra League leader died of bullet wounds,  injured in an ambush by suspected Islami Chhatra Shibir activists at Palwaner Pool market in Begumganj upazila. The deceased Rakib Hossain was a joint secretary of Chhatra League's Amanullapur union unit. He died under treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). Police conducted a drive on Sunday night shortly after the incident and detained four people, said Begumganj police station OC Harun-Or-Rashid Chowdhury. The detained Faruk Ahmmad, 42, Masud Alam, 30,  Akram Hossain, 24, and Ibrahim, 30, were produced in court on Monday afternoon.  Police are trying to arrest the others involved and a case will be filed soon, said OC Harun. \"Some Chhatra League men were staying at a tea stall when Shibir activists shot and hacked at them indiscriminately. Rakib and Habib were transferred to hospitals in Dhaka when their condition deteriorated after the incident. Rakib had to undergo surgery as bullets penetrated his kidney, liver, and stomach. Habib is currently receiving treatment at a private hospital in Dhaka,\" said Union Parishad Chairman Arifur Rahman, also president of Awami League's Amanullahpur unit.  Three other Chhatra League members were also injured, hacked with sharp weapons. In Khulna, another injured Chhatra League leader died after being severely beaten by a rival group over establishing supremacy.  The deceased Hadiuzzaman Russel, 28, was general secretary of Chhatra League's Koyra Upazila unit. Koyra police station OC Robiul Islam said: \"A dispute arose between Russel and his cousins on Sunday afternoon, over the positioning of an under construction bridge across Batikata canal. Russel was mercilessly beaten by his cousins following the altercation. The incident left him seriously injured.\" Russel succumbed to his injuries on the way to Dhaka while being transferred from Khulna Medical College Hospital, added the OC. Locals said there was a long standing feud between Russel and his cousins over establishing supremacy in the area."

      "text": "The deal has been signed by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar The United States signed a deal with Taliban insurgents on Saturday that could pave the way toward a full withdrawal of foreign soldiers from Afghanistan and represent a step toward ending the 18-year-war in the nation. But while the agreement creates a path for the United States to gradually pull out of its longest war, many expect the talks to come between the Afghan sides may be much more complicated. The deal was signed in the Qatari capital Doha by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on hand to witness the ceremony. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper called the accord a good step but just the beginning. \"Achieving lasting peace in Afghanistan will require patience and compromise among all parties,\" said Esper, who met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul where they announced a joint declaration in parallel to the US-Taliban accord. The United States said it is committed to reducing the number of its troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 - from the current 13,000 - within 135 days of signing the deal, and working with its allies to proportionally reduce the number of coalition forces in Afghanistan over that period, if the Taliban adhere to their commitments. A full withdrawal of all US and coalition forces would occur within 14 months of the deal getting signed, if the Taliban hold up their end of the deal, the joint statement said. \"We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home,\" said US President Donald Trump in a White House statement. The accord represents a chance to make good on a longstanding promise to get troops out, as he seeks re-election in November. But security experts have also called it a foreign policy gamble that would give the Taliban international legitimacy. Ghani said he hoped the Doha deal paves the way towards lasting peace, telling a news conference in Kabul: \"The nation is looking forward to a full ceasefire.\"  The Afghan government said it stood ready to negotiate and conclude a ceasefire with the Taliban, and it affirmed its support for the phased withdrawal of US and coalition forces subject to the Taliban's fulfilment of its commitments. It also said that it remained committed to preventing militant groups from using its soil to threaten the security of the United States, its allies and other countries. Separately, Nato pledged to adjust the coalition troop levels in the first phase too, bringing down Nato's numbers to about 12,000 from roughly 16,000 troops at present. \"We went in together in 2001, we are going to adjust (troop levels) together and when the time is right, we are going to leave together, but we are only going to leave when conditions are right,\" Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who was in Kabul on Saturday, told reporters. Today is a monumental day for Afghanistan. \".. it is about making peace & crafting a common brighter future.\" We stand with #Afghanistan. #AfghanPeaceProcess https://t.co/eoP0xftZaa Hope for an end to bloodshed Hours before the deal, the Taliban ordered all its fighters in Afghanistan \"to refrain from any kind of attack for the happiness of the nation.\" \"The biggest thing is that we hope the US remain committed to their promises during the negotiation and peace deal,\" said Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline Islamist group. For millions of Afghans, the deal represents some hope for an end to years of bloodshed. \"Peace is extremely simple and my country deserves it. Today is the day when maybe we will see a positive change,\" said Javed Hassan, 38, a school teacher living on the outskirts of Afghan capital, Kabul. Hassan's children were killed in a bomb blast carried out by the Taliban in 2018. Since then, he has been writing letters to world leaders urging them to end the Afghan war."

      "text": "Hundreds of thousands of Muslim devotees braved a cold spell to take part in the final prayers on the banks of the Turag in Gazipur's Tongi on Saturday The 55th edition of Bishwa Ijtema is expected to end with the second phase's Akheri Munajat or final prayer on Sunday on the banks of the river Turag at Tongi. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim devotees braved a cold spell to take part in the final prayers on the banks of the Turag in Gazipur's Tongi on Saturday, amid heightened security measures. On the second day of the first phase's Ijtema, the second largest congregation of the Muslim community after Hajj, Islamic scholars delivered sermons on different aspects of Islam in the light of the holy Quran and Hadith on Sunday. The Muslim devotees have thronged the Ijtema ground under the open sky while more than 1,500 foreign devotees from 35 countries, including from Jordan, Libya, Africa, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Palestine, the USA, Turkey, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, England, joined the Ijtema from the first day of the second phase. People from all corners of the country started streaming into Tongi since Saturday evening to join the Akheri Munajat. Many made the journey to the venue on foot as a large part of Dhaka Mymensingh Highway was closed to traffic. Md Anwar Hossain, commissioner of Gazipur Metropolitan Police, said the plying buses will remain closed on Dhaka-Mymensingh highway from Gazipur Chowrasta intersection to Mohakhali in the capital from 4am for smooth movement of the devotees. Buses from northern districts will remain halted at Konabari in Gazipur while all link roads towards Tongi will be closed during the Akheri Munajat, he added. Besides, around 8,500 members of law enforcement agencies have been deployed for ensuring security in and around the Ijtema ground. Four more Muslim devotees have died at the Bishaw Ijtema venue in Friday, January 17. The total death tolls of the devotees in the 55th Bishwa Ijtema stood at 5 so far, , including 13 in the first phase. They passed away in their respective tents between Friday morning and Saturday evening, said Md Manjur Rahman, deputy commissioner of Gazipur Metropolitan Police. Bangladesh Railway (BR) has scheduled special trains for easy transportation of devotees on the occasion of the first and second phase of 55th Biswa Ijtema. Earlier, the first phase of the Ijtema was held on January 10 to 12 at the same venue. Followers of Moulana Zubair joined the first phase of Ijtema while the second phase is alloted to the disciples of Moulana Mohammed Saad Kandhalvi, a Delhi-based member of the Tabligh Jamaat Supreme Council. Tablig Jamaat has been organizing the Biswa Ijtema on the bank of Turag river since 1967. Now, Ijtema is being held in two phases since 2011 to ease the accommodation problem."

      "text": "More than 500 fish enclosures were submerged, locals said, and they fear an untimely flood through the damaged embankments due to the high tidal waves A large portion of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) embankment of 35/1 polder in Sharankhola upazila of the district has been collapsed after being hit by the extremely severe cyclonic storm Amphan. Acres of low-lying areas of several villages, fish enclosures, and streets became waterlogged as the flood embankments were destroyed by the storm on Wednesday night, said Sharankhola UNO Sarder Mostafa Shahin.  More than 500 fish enclosures were submerged, locals said, and they fear an untimely flood through the damaged embankments due to the high tidal waves.   The villagers are seeking prompt action from the authority and in this situation, they demanded its immediate mending. Contacted, Md Nahiduzzaman Khan, executive engineer of Bagerhat Water Development Board, said, \"We are preparing to install ring dams where the embankment was harmed,\"  The upazila administration has already been directed to assess the losses following Amphan and it will soon be notified, said Bagerhat District Administrator Mamunur Rashid."

      "text": "The new charge of \"sexual battery by restraint\" will form part of a separate trial he faces in Los Angeles  Disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was charged by Los Angeles prosecutors on  Friday with  sexually assaulting a third woman, as authorities there build their own case against the convicted rapist. Weinstein, 68, is already in prison in New York state after being sentenced to 23 years in jail for rape and sexual assault. The new charge of \"sexual battery by restraint\" will form part of a separate trial he faces in Los Angeles over allegations he assaulted multiple women in local hotels, with extradition proceedings under way. \"We are continuing to build and strengthen our case,\" said Los Angeles prosecutor Jackie Lacey. \"If we find new evidence of a previously unreported crime, as we did here, we will investigate and determine whether additional criminal charges should be filed,\" she added. The new charge alleges Weinstein sexually assaulted an unnamed woman in Beverly Hills in May 2010 -- just within the 10-year statute of limitations.  He has already been charged with the rape and sexual assault of two other women on consecutive nights in 2013.  Two additional Los Angeles cases against Weinstein are no longer being pursued as those accusers did not want to testify. It is not known when the trial will begin, but Los Angeles prosecutors confirmed Friday they have initiated a request for Weinstein's transfer. \"Upon his arrival, he will be arraigned on the amended complaint. Once a court date is set, the public will be notified,\" a statement read. If convicted in all the California cases, Weinstein could face an additional 29-year prison sentence. For decades a towering figure in Hollywood whom Meryl Streep famously called \"God,\" the \"Pulp Fiction\" producer was expelled from the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences that awarded his films several Oscars after a flood of accusations broke. Tinseltown A-listers Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek were among nearly 90 women to have come forward alleging decades of vile predatory behaviour by Weinstein. Weinstein has repeatedly denied wrongdoing."

The girl was abducted to a tea garden and raped by three men Friday night. Police arrested Koilash Doshad, 25, and Jaharlal Mridha, 29, who are guards at the Bharaura Tea Garden in the upazila. A case was filed in this regard and the girl was admitted to Moulvibazar Sadar Hospital for medical attention, said Sreemangal police station Inspector Md Sohel Rana. According to the case statement, an auto-rickshaw driver along with two accomplices abducted the girl from near a mass burial site located at Sreemangal town. They took her the Bharaura Tea Garden and raped her there before releasing her.  The prime accused auto-rickshaw driver is on the run, said the inspector. Girl held captive, raped for 18 months A 19-year-old girl was held captive for 18 months in Bishwanath upazila of Sylhet, during which she was raped by a village doctor (Kabiraj) with help of his wife, police say. Police arrested Md Komruddin, 50, and his wife Sumi Begum, 38, being accused in a case filed by the girl's mother. Bishwanath police station OC Shamim Musa said they will seek a five-day remand from court today in order to interrogate the couple. According to the girl's parents, the girl was handed over to the care of Md Komruddin in August, 2018 so that he may treat her various illnesses. They paid him Tk10,000 for his services.  However, according to the agreement Komruddin did not return their daughter after six months and threatened their parents to stay silent on the matter. On Thursday, they decided to file a case with the Bishwanath police station."

      "headline": "Pakistan struggles to combat devastating locust plague",
      "authors": "AFP",
      "text": "The crisis is so severe that the government has declared a nationwide emergency and urgently appealed for help from the international community Pakistan's farmers are struggling to combat the worst locust plague in nearly three decades as insect swarms decimate entire harvests in the country's agricultural heartlands and send food prices soaring. Heavy rains and cyclones sparked \"unprecedented\" breeding and the explosive growth of locust populations on the Arabian peninsula early last year, according to the United Nations. The insects have since fanned out and wreaked havoc on farms from East Africa to India before making their way into Pakistan from the desert on the country's southwestern border with Iran.  The crisis is so severe that the government has declared a nationwide emergency and urgently appealed for help from the international community.  Officials in southern Sindh province fear the infestation will devastate the supply of cotton, the local cash crop, ahead of its harvest in the coming months.  Local surveys of the damage are continuing, but the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture says nearly half of all crops have been destroyed near the port city of Karachi. \"I have not seen an infestation like this one in my career,\" said Shehbaz Akhtar, an agricultural official charged with locust eradication efforts in the village of Pipli Pahar in central Punjab province. 'Combat operation' Local authorities had \"launched a combat operation\" to clear the area of infestation with pesticide sprays, he said.  Clouds of the noxious gas envelop the nearby fields each morning, where villagers gather the husks of dead insects for an official bounty of Rs20 rupees per kg bag. \"We spray twice a day here,\" says Fayyaz Azeem, clad in a face mask and thick industrial gloves on top of a tractor discharging pesticide into rows of crops. But the process is slow and time-consuming, and by the time locusts are killed off in one field they have often already destroyed the next. The pesticides used by officials are also dangerous for consumption, so even when the locusts are dead the remaining crops have to be discarded. Some farmers have been forced to opt for more desperate solutions while waiting for their fields to be sprayed and have attempted to scare off the swarms by shouting and banging pots.  A team of Chinese experts has arrived in Pakistan to survey the crisis, food security ministry chief Muhammad Hashim Popalzai told AFP. Beijing could also offer aerial spraying - a much faster and more efficient method of pest control - and Pakistan may also import pesticides from China. Earlier reports circulating online suggested China was planning to send thousands of ducks to Pakistan to devour the scourge. Pakistani officials said no such plans were being considered. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has also set up meetings between India and Pakistan to prevent the swarms from spreading, Popalzai said. 'What can I do?' Agriculture accounts for 20% of Pakistan's GDP but the sector has already struggled for years in the face of drought and dwindling water supplies. The country is also experiencing 12-year inflation highs, with the cost of sugar nearly doubling and flour prices jumping 15% in the past year. Years without a locust attack meant the government \"had become complacent\" about the risks of a new infestation, said Pakistan Farmers Bureau president Zafar Hayyat. Though he applauded the steps being taken to fight the plague, Hayyat warned of the risk that swarms would return mid-year after the next locust breeding season.  For many farmers in Pipli Pahar, the extermination campaign has already come too late.  Sitting in the corner of a wheat field with her cow, Rafiya Bibi watches the flurry of pesticide spraying around her.  The locusts have already destroyed her crops of canola, sunflower, chili and tobacco, which she had bought after borrowing 45,000 rupees from the government. With no harvest, she has no way to repay the loan."

      "headline": "33 Turkish soldiers killed in Syria's Idlib",
      "authors": "AFP",
      "text": "Dozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment At least 33 Turkish soldiers were killed as violence escalates in Syria's Idlib province after an air strike blamed on Damascus, with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemning \"indiscriminate\" attacks by the Assad regime and Russia. Dozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment, Rahmi Dogan, governor of Turkish Hatay -- bordering Syria -- said Friday. The heavy losses in northwestern Idlib come after weeks of growing tensions between rebel supporter Ankara and Damascus ally Moscow. Stoltenberg \"urged all parties to de-escalate this dangerous situation and avoid further worsening of the horrendous humanitarian situation in the region\", his spokesman said Friday. In a phone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the NATO secretary general \"condemned the continued indiscriminate air strikes by the Syrian regime and its backer Russia in Idlib province\", according to the spokesman. Turkey has urged the Syrian regime to withdraw from Turkish observation posts in Idlib, while Moscow has accused Ankara of aiding \"terrorists\" in Syria. Under a 2018 deal with Russia meant to bring calm to Idlib, Turkey has 12 observation posts in the region -- but several have come under fire from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hastily convened an emergency meeting in Ankara after the Idlib attack. Erdogan's top press aide, Fahrettin Altun, said Turkey's military retaliated against all known positions of the regime after the air strike. In a statement, Altun called on the international community to fulfil its responsibilities to end the violence in Idlib and the regime's \"crimes against humanity\". The latest attack means 53 Turkish security personnel have been killed in the province this month. There was a flurry of diplomatic activity as Turkey's presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin spoke with US national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, state news agency Anadolu reported without giving detail. More civilians killed  Jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels on Thursday re-entered Saraqeb, a key Idlib crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government's devastating offensive. The counteroffensive could, however, be short-lived as Russian-backed Syrian troops continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities. Seven civilians, including three children, were killed in regime and Russian bombardment of Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December. The UN Security Council, where Moscow has systematically vetoed truce initiatives, met again Thursday amid growing concern Idlib is witnessing the nine-year-old war's worst humanitarian emergency. State news agency SANA acknowledged there were \"fierce clashes\" between the army and \"terrorist groups on the Saraqeb front\".  An AFP correspondent accompanied the rebels into Saraqeb, where he found a ghost town of bombed out buildings. The counterattack temporarily reverses one of the key gains of the government since its offensive against the country's last rebel enclave in December. Refugee fears  The cash-strapped government had been keen to fully secure the M5, a highway that connects Syria's four main cities and passes through Saraqeb. The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes were carried out by Assad government ally Russia, heavily criticised by the West for the high civilian death toll from its bombing campaign. State media accused the \"terrorists\" of launching car bombings and other suicide attacks against government forces attempting to retake the town. It said the army had inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, despite the military support it said they had received from Turkey. Some 950,0000 civilians have fled the government offensive, raising fears in Ankara of a new influx of refugees. Turkey already hosts the world's largest number of Syrian refugees -- around 3.6 million people -- placing an increasingly unpopular burden on public services. The country's ruling party spokesman Omer Celik told CNN Turk broadcaster Friday Ankara was not in a position to \"hold\" refugees any longer and called on the European Union to do more. More than half a million of those displaced since December are children, tens of thousands of whom are sleeping rough in northern Syria's harsh winter. UN powerlessness The Turkish president vowed Wednesday Ankara would not take the \"smallest step back\" in the standoff with Damascus and Moscow over Idlib. Erdogan warned the Syrian government to \"stop its attacks as soon as possible\" and to pull back by the end of the month. The UN has repeatedly warned the fighting in Idlib could potentially create the most serious humanitarian crisis since the civil war's start in 2011. Nine out of 15 members of the Security Council on Wednesday urged Secretary General Antonio Guterres to step up his involvement in efforts to restore peace in Idlib. Russian vetoes, often backed by China, have chronically crippled UN action in Syria."

      "headline": "Recalling Bangabandhu as his centennial approaches",
      "authors": "Muhammad Zamir",
      "text": "He knew the value of a peaceful environment Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released from his internment in Pakistan in the first week of January 1972 and eventually returned to Dhaka, the capital of independent Bangladesh, amidst a rapturous welcome on January 10, 1972. On the way he stopped over in London and New Delhi. It was his commitment and his vision that enabled him to safely guide our ship through troubled waters amidst a devastated post-war scenario. It was his significant contribution that facilitated our growth towards democracy and institution building. Bangabandhu's magnanimity and belief in the people of Bangladesh was reflected in his optimism. It was also this spirit that would inspire him to face up to the many difficulties that he would have to overcome in the coming months -- arranging relief and rehabilitation for the more than 10 million Bangladeshis who had sought refuge in India during the war in 1971, restoring economic activity, infrastructural connectivity, agricultural process, educational institutional facilities and health care. It was a daunting task but handled efficiently by Bangabandhu and his team in cooperation with the United Nations. A statesman and gifted orator, Bangabandhu in his speech on January 10, 1972 at Suhrawardy Uddyan was masterly in his advice for the victorious people of Bangladesh. At this first opportunity, he warned that none should \"raise\" their \"hands to strike against non-Bangalis.\" At the same time, he displayed his concern for the safety of the \"four hundred thousand Bangalis stranded in Pakistan.\"  There was a nuanced connotation in his approach to the problem. This eventually assisted in the safe repatriation to Bangladesh of the unfortunate Bangalis who were stranded in different internment camps in Pakistan. While re-affirming that he harboured no \"ill-will\" for the Pakistanis, he also pointed out that \"those who have unjustly killed our people and assisted in this crime will surely be tried.\" Later, on April 17, 1973, after the completion of investigations into the crimes committed by the Pakistan occupation forces and their auxiliaries, it was decided to try 195 persons for serious crimes, which included genocide, war crimes, breach of Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, murder, rape, and arson.  It was also decided that the trials of such persons and others associated in planning and executing such crimes would be held in accordance with universally recognized judicial norms. This argument and the related judicial process were to be central till his murder in August 1975. Unfortunately, his death also resulted in the setting aside of the entire judicial process. Fortunately, under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the trial process has been activated and is being completed. Subsequently, Bangabandhu did not hesitate to exhibit his and Bangladesh's closeness and support for Islam, Arab countries, and the OIC during the 1973 war between Egypt and Israel. His personal initiative resulted in the dispatch of a Bangladeshi Army Medical team and cartons of Bangladeshi tea for Egypt and Syria.  This was greatly appreciated by members of the OIC and resulted in Bangladesh being invited to be a member of the OIC during its Summit meeting in Lahore in February, 1974. Bangabandhu believed in the sovereign equality of all nations and laid particular stress on the promotion of close cooperation with India in the fields of development and trade \"on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.\" He also believed in development and utilization of resources \"for the benefit of the people of the region.\"  It was this approach that led him eventually to persuade India to agree to the establishment of a Joint Rivers Commission comprising of experts from both countries \"to carry out a comprehensive survey of the rivers systems shared by the two countries and to formulate projects concerning both the countries in the fields of flood control and then to implement them.\" Consistent with this principle of brotherly relations, Bangabandhu signed the historic \"Land Boundary Agreement (LBA)\" with the then Indian Premier Indira Gandhi on May 16 in 1974 to settle the land boundary dispute between the neighbours. Bangladesh quickly ratified the agreement that year but India failed to do so. Indian Parliament however took 41 years to subsequently unanimously pass the LBA on May 7, 2015 -- thanks to the persuasion of Sheikh Hasina. Bangabandhu's persistent interest in foreign policy eventually led to Bangladesh being recognized as an independent state by nearly 120 countries within three and half years. In addition, Bangladesh also secured the membership of the UN, the Commonwealth, OIC, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and some other international bodies. Like Bangabandhu, who was conferred with the \"Joliot Curie Award\" in 1973, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has also received recognition through numerous awards bestowed on her by international agencies for her government's socio-economic achievements that has helped to reduce poverty, create higher functional literacy, better health care, induce gender empowerment and facilitate accountability -- so important for good governance. We are now also on the way towards meeting the requirements pertaining to SDG goals. Through these achievements, during this important year of 2020, when we are observing the special centennial anniversary of the birth of Bangabandhu, Sheikh Hasina has proven that Bangabandhu was correct when he stated: \"Only a peaceful environment can enable us to enjoy the fruits of the hard-earned national independence and gather all our strength and resources to fight poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, and unemployment.\" Muhammad Zamir is a former ambassador and an analyst specialized in foreign affairs, right to information and good governance.

Badargonj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Nabirul Islam confirmed the matter to Dhaka Tribune around 8: 30pm on Wednesday. The 30-year old man, who returned from Malaysia to the upazila recently, went to Narayanganj where he stayed for one month. Few days ago, he came back from Narayanganj and started suffering from fever, cough, and respiratory problems, prompting health authorities to collect samples. They were later sent to Rangpur Medical College Hospital for testing.  On Wednesday, his reports came back positive, said UNO Nabirul Islam. The UNO also added that 10 houses around the patient's residence and a residential quarter of Badargonj Upazila Health Complex, where his brother lives, were put under lockdown. With this, Rangpur reported three Covid-19 cases so far, according to health authorities. "

      "text": "The students gave an ultimatum of a month to the university authority and if their demands are not met within, they will increase their movement to save the campus Students of Chittagong University on Thursday formed a human chain and brought out a rally protesting the indiscriminate felling of trees and razing of hills on the campus. Carrying placards demanding stoppage of the illegal tree felling and hill razing, students formed the human chain in front of the Shahid Minar. Later, they brought out a rally and paraded around the campus. Protesting students said Chittagong University is known for its panoramic beauty surrounded by hills and forests. But some unethical businessmen are cutting down trees and razing hills for transportation. \"From now, students will intercept the vehicles laden with felled trees,\" said Ritu Roy of Institute of Forestry and Environmental Science. The students gave an ultimatum of a month to the university authority and if their demands are not met within, they will increase their movement to save the campus, they said. The students also submitted a memorandum with a seven-point demand to the Proctor of the university demanding punishment for the responsible people who are behind this crime. Meanwhile, a two-member team from Department of Environment (DoE) visited the campus and found evidence of felling trees. Based on the evidence, the DoE served a show-cause notice to the Estate Department and Security Department of the university, timber traders Md Hanif and Md Bazlu. According to a media report, more 7,000 trees have been felled in the last four years on the campus. "

      "text": "Some 1,100 kilometres of roads, and 200 bridges and culverts under local government have been damaged Cyclone Amphan wreaked havoc on southwestern Bangladesh, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. It lashed the West Bengal-Bangladesh coastline on Wednesday evening and prevailed till the early hours of Thursday. Hundreds and thousands have been displaced, homes destroyed, trees uprooted, embankments smashed, electricity and telephone lines, dykes and croplands damaged, and numerous villages inundated by the cyclone's tidal surges. The government has estimated the damage from cyclone Amphan is to the tune of Tk1,100 crore with some 26 districts hit, said State Minister for Disaster Management, Enamur Rahman.  Some 1,100 kilometres of roads, and 200 bridges and culverts under local government have been damaged, said official sources. The Water Development Board reported that 150 kilometres of embankments were seriously damaged while another 84 dams developed cracks,\" state minister said. 3,000 electric poles damaged in south-western regions  Three thousand electric poles of the power division have sustained damage in the southwestern regions of Bangladesh, where cyclone Amphan first made contact, said West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited (WZPDC) Managing Director, Engineer Shafiq Uddin.  \"We will start repair work as soon as possible,\" he added. WZPDC Executive Director Engineer Abu Hasan said: \"Two transformers of the Kushtia power grid short circuited around 10pm on Wednesday, cutting power to the district. The electricity supply remained suspended till Thursday. We are trying to tap into the closest alternative source to supply Kushtia with electricity.\"  Engineer Altaf Hossain, senior general manager of Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board, Khulna, said: \"A total of 316,000 customers lost electricity in eight upazilas of the district. We have 600 workers on the ground who will start repair work as soon as possible.\" 70km embankment damaged in Khulna Seventy kilometres of the 121km embankment that was built to protect Khulna from typhoons and cyclones, have been either completely or partially damaged.  Palash Kumar Banarjee, executive engineer for the water development board, Khulna-2, said: \"10km of the embankment completely collapsed, while 60km of the embankment are partially damaged.\"  As a result, low lying unions are completely submerged in saline water, putting thousands of people in jeopardy, he added. Mostajibul Hoque, an affected local of Koyra upazila, said: \"Since Aila last wreaked havoc on the embankments, the WDB hasn't been able to repair the damage completely in the last decade. Without a sustainable embankment, lives will always be at risk.\"  Khulna 6 MP, Akhtaruzzaman Babu, said: \"Koyra upazila was severely affected and inundated when 10km of the 121km-long embankment collapsed. Another 40km of the embankment were partially damaged as well. Approximately Tk50 crore worth of fish was washed away in the flood.\" Satkhira farmers count crores in losses   Satkhira farmers have suffered huge losses in crops and fish as the cyclone levelled fields and tidal surges flooded fish enclosures. Satkhira Deputy Commissioner SM Mostafa Kamal held a press briefing on the loss to lives and property in the district. He said: \"As many as 12,257 fish enclosures and ponds on 13,477 hectares in 12 unions of seven upazilas have been flooded. Fish, including 1,677 tons of whitefish and 2,531 tons of shrimp, worth over approximately Tk176 crore, was washed away.  Also, approximately Tk137 crore of crops, fruits and vegetables on over 5,000 hectares was also lost in the district, he added. 1,500 shrimp enclosures flooded in Mongla  1500 shrimp enclosures have been flooded by recent tidal surges in Mongla of Bagerhat. Also, 125 homes were completely damaged and 325 homes partially damaged, while numerous trees were uprooted.  Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Rahat Mannan said: \"Risky embankments in Kanainagar, Kalatala, and Sundartala have collapsed, flooding many houses and fish enclosures.\" Magura suffers Tk100crore in damage It is initially estimated that cyclone Amphan has caused a total damage of over Tk100 crore in loss of homes, domestic animals, and crops. Magura Deputy Commissioner Dr Ashraful Alam said: \"Cyclone Amphan has caused huge losses in the district which is yet to be calculated accurately. But we estimate it is over Tk100 crore.\"  "

      "text": "More than 600 disembarked near state capital Sittwe Myanmar shipped hundreds of recently released Rohingya inmates back to the country's restive western borderlands on Monday, after fears that its overcrowded prisons could become hotbeds for runaway coronavirus outbreaks. Men, women and children belonging to the stateless and long-persecuted Muslim minority were among nearly 25,000 prisoners freed last week by a presidential pardon to mark the country's April New Year celebrations. A Navy vessel transported the group from Yangon to western Rakhine state, where most Rohingya live under tight movement restrictions and in conditions Amnesty International has condemned as \"apartheid.\" More than 600 disembarked near state capital Sittwe, while another 200 were taken further north to townships on the border with Bangladesh, state immigration department chief Soe Lwin told AFP. \"They will be quarantined,\" he added, without giving further details. Myanmar's biggest prisoner release in years came as coronavirus fears gripped the country, with calls for low-risk inmates to be released from what Human Rights Watch describes as Myanmar's \"horribly overcrowded and unsanitary\" jails. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that prison populations are particularly vulnerable to the spread of the disease. Myanmar has only 111 confirmed Covid-19 cases but experts fear the real number is many times higher because of the low numbers tested and the country's chronically underfunded healthcare system."

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "Fighting climate change plays a key role as rising temperatures create more amenable conditions for diseases to spread The novel coronavirus will not be the last pandemic to wreak havoc on humanity if people continue to ignore links between infectious diseases and destruction of the natural world, environmental experts have warned. \"I'm absolutely sure that there are going to be more diseases like this in future if we continue with our practices of destroying the natural world, deforestation and capturing wild animals as pets or for food and medicine,\" Dr Enric Sala, marine ecologist and part of National Geographic's Campaign For Nature, told The Independent. The World Health Organization has reported 8,778 deaths and 209,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The virus is thought to have initially passed from animals to humans at a \"wet market\" selling produce, seafood and live animals in Wuhan, China in December but this is not yet confirmed. Researchers in China have suggested that pangolins, mammals known as 'scaly ant-eaters', are the probable animal source of COVID-19, according to scientific journal Nature. China has since issued a ban on consumption and farming of wild animals, and wildlife markets. However, environmentalists warn of a broader issue: Humanity's voracious destruction of diverse ecosystems which brings us in closer contact with wildlife than ever before. David Quammen, author of 2012 bestseller, Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, became interested in infectious diseases while researching Ebola and has been warning about the risk of pandemics ever since. He told The Independent: \"Our highly diverse ecosystems are filled with many species of wild animals, plants, fungi and bacteria. All of that biological diversity contains unique viruses. \"When we tear down tropical forests to build villages, timber and mining camps, kill or capture wild animals for food, we expose ourselves to those viruses. \"It's like if you demolish an old barn then dust flies. When you demolish a tropical forest, viruses fly. Those moments of destruction represent opportunity for unfamiliar viruses to get into humans and take hold.\" Dr Samuel Myers, principle research scientist at Harvard's Department of Environmental Health and director of the Planetary Health Alliance, told The Independent: \"Human incursions into wildlife habitat bring people into closer proximity with wildlife populations. \"What we know is that other animals are an enormous reservoir of pathogens, many of which we haven't yet been exposed to.\" Vector-borne diseases - those from living organisms that can transmit infectious pathogens between humans, or from animals to humans - account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases and cause more than 700,000 deaths each year, according to WHO. They have increased over time. Around 30 new infectious diseases emerged during the 1950s, according to a study in journal Nature. By the 1980s, that number more than tripled.  We have previously seen the spread of other zoonotic diseases like HIV, Ebola, SARS, MERS and Zika. Dr Myers said: \"The HIV epidemic and Ebola were thought to have emerged from bushmeat hunting. MERS and SARS came out of live animal 'wet markets'.  \"At the live markets in Wuhan, for example, there was an extraordinary number of exotic species alive in cages, all in proximity to each other and to humans in a way that you would never find in the natural world.\" He added: \"It's a combination of the size of the human ecological footprint and globalization. Once a pathogen has made that jump from animals to humans, it has the capacity to spread around the globe very quickly with air travel.\" Regulation and education on the dangers of consuming wildlife plays a part in mitigating the risk. Quammen said: \"There are people all over the world desperate for protein who eat wild animals. It's not something I want to demonize as a Chinese vice. \"There are so many of us hungry for resources that as we reduce the wild down to these tiny remnants, we offer ourselves as a target of opportunity for viruses.\" Dr Sala said: \"When it comes to populations that depend on the exploitation of nature for their day-to-day living, alternatives have to be provided. \"Governments have a key role in setting policies that protect the nature world and regulate or ban wildlife trade. Companies can help. The world already produces enough food for 10 billion people, only we waste a third of it.\" Fighting climate change plays a key role as rising temperatures create more amenable conditions for diseases to spread. Dr Myers said: \"We're aware that malaria is being found in higher latitudes, and higher altitudes, like in the Kenyan Highlands where we never used to see temperatures as warm.\" The decimation of the natural world extends far beyond infectious disease outbreaks, Dr Myers points out. \"We're seeing impacts on the quality and quantity of food we produce; exposure to noncommunicable diseases like heart disease, cancer and respiratory disease along with mental health impacts, population displacement and conflict,\" he said. With biodiversity loss and a growing global population - expected to rise by 2 billion to 9.7 billion by 2050 - seeking food sources, the question of the next pandemic is not if but when, experts warn. \"If we get [COVID-19] under control, then we can be glad that human ingenuity and will managed to control this one. But after we celebrate for five minutes, we should start thinking about the next one,\" David Quammen said. Sweeping change is needed including making the crucial link between human health and conservation of the planet. Dr Sala said: \"They are not disconnected. There is no sustainable human health without a healthy ecosystem. These infectious diseases we have experienced over the last 20 years are best proof of that. \"Keeping the wild places intact, banning the hunting and traffic of wildlife species, many of which are endangered, would not only be practical but beneficial in terms of human health and economics. \"For governments and policy-makers, it is going to be very clear that investment in protecting our natural world is the most cost-effective one they can make.\" "

      "text": "Habiganj workers demand govt food relief from starvation Workers at 23 tea gardens in Sylhet have been abstaining from work due to the fear of coronavirus transmission for the last five days. Hundreds, among the 10,000 permanent workers and 50,000 temporary workers, demonstrated with a sit-in protest on Tuesday at their respective tea fields, demanding protective gear for work, said Raju Goala, president of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union in Sylhet. Answering a query, he told Dhaka Tribune that the workers are prepared to work as per the premier's directives if Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is provided to them with their salary for the last five days, when they abstained from work. He added that they will go for a large movement if the demands are not fulfilled. Sylhet Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Abul Kalam Azad said Tk12 lakh and 521 tons of rice have so far been allocated for marginal communities in the district to fight the coronavirus crisis so far. However, the allocated resources were not for the district's tea workers. \"Over video conference on Tuesday, the premier instructed to keep all tea gardens of the country operational,\" added the ADC. The tea worker's leader Raju Goala, said: \"People in other occupations in the country are in quarantine, but there were no clear guidelines for tea workers. To avoid risk of virus transmission, workers are abstaining from work. \"Although poor people in the district are receiving government support, none is allocated for tea workers.  \"Most of the workers are hired on a temporary basis. They routinely work at places other than the gardens. They could not work at these other places due to the virus outbreak and the authorities do not have any specific guidelines regarding how workers will not starve, but yet be safe,\" added Raju. In Habiganj, hundreds of tea workers demonstrated in Chunarughat upazila demanding government relief.  During a three hour protest in front of the upazila parishad until 12pm yesterday, they chanted 'Du Mutho Bhat De (give us two fistfuls of rice) as a slogan. Tea worker Koilash Munda said: \"We will die of starvation before catching coronavirus. No one has come to our aid so far.\" Nipen Paul, joint secretary of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union central committee, said: \"Tea workers were not given leave. We asked workers of some of the gardens to abstain from work. We couldn't arrange government allocations for workers by contacting the upazila administrations. I have heard that workers protested for food in Habiganj.\" Debashish Das, manager of Deundi Tea Garden in the upazila, said: \"We haven't received any instruction from the authorities to allow leave for the tea workers and we haven't put pressure on them to come to work either.\" He added that no worker from his tea garden received any government relief. Chunarughat Upazila Nirbahi Officer Shattyajit Roy couldn't be reached for comment over phone."

With one day of the celebrations gone, the local flower markets in different districts -- from which florists also sell flowers to the traders in capital Dhaka -- have already reported a slump in retail flower sales.  Also, the absence of buyers -- who are mostly students -- because of the ongoing SSC and equivalent examinations will play a role in this, fear the businesses. In Bogra, flower sellers are concerned as flower sales have fallen compared to previous years. Bogra Flower Merchant Association General Secretary Laxman Das Amit said: \"We have received a smaller amount of flowers from the wholesalers as the prices are high.\" \"Also, as both Pohela Falgun and Valentine's Day will be observed on the same day, we are expecting a fall in our business, otherwise these occasions are generally the most profitable days for us every year, now we have only one day for both,\" he told our district correspondent Nazmul Huda Nasim. In Meherpur, flower demand and price have both gone up; however, florists are expecting a one-third drop in their sales target, reports our correspondent Ashraful Islam. Local trader Tutul said: \"This year, the Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun have fallen on the same day, which is also Friday. So, a dip in sales is very likely.\" In Sirajganj, flower sellers are already experiencing a loss in business. Usually, they sell around 70,000 flowers during the Pohela Falgun-Valentine's Day celebrations every year, but there is doubt whether they would sell even one-fourth of that today. Local merchants said they would surely face a slump because most of the schools and coaching centres are also closed due to the SSC exams, reports our district correspondent Aminul Islam Khan Rana. In Comilla, florists have also reported a slump in sales, and a hike in prices, despite a rise in demand. Apart from citing the same reasons, they said the prices have gone up as they could not import flowers due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, reports our correspondent Masud Alam. Still, there is hope Meanwhile, in Chuadanga, florists expect to sell flowers worth of Tk30 lakh between today and the International Mother Language Day, which would be observed on February 21, reports our correspondent Mehedi Hasan. Local flower merchant Akul Hossain said roses, tuberose, marigold, gerbera daisy and gladiola flowers are trending and are on high demand in the market. \"We hope to make a good profit during Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun. \"Hopefully, the sale will also be high on February 21.\" Demand for flowers along with the cost has also gone up in Nilphamari ahead of Pahela Falgun and Valentine's Day. Local florist Ajgar Ali said he sold flowers worth Tk1.25 lakh since February 1 and expects his sale to go up today, reports our district correspondent Md Taieyb Ali Sarker."

      "text": "The private and public sectors must work together to pull the country out of this crisis Some regrettable politics is taking place in the name of distribution of relief for the poor. Firstly, the government has not provided a strong and adequate stimulus package to help the poor and the ultra poor to fight the novel coronavirus epidemic. Secondly, even where it has sanctioned relief materials, only those who are well-connected or are known to the powerful local officials are getting the relief; and also, relief materials are getting stolen by the powerful government officials and local leaders of the ruling party. Many of them have already been arrested for this crime as well.  This is a matter of great disgust. Even though the coronavirus is a novel epidemic, we are not observing novel tactics in fighting it from the government's side. All the tools and tactics that are being used are from the olden days. The government is just treating this like any other natural calamity like a flood or a cyclone.  As such, relief distribution, too, has boiled down to photo opportunities for the government officials. One upazila chairman, Mahiuddin Biswas, has even gone so far as hitting a poor person who did not want to take a photo while taking relief. But corona is an ongoing problem, not a cyclone that you can solve merely by giving out some token relief materials after the calamity. The work that is to be done now is not merely damage control, it is situation management.  And without a medium-term strategic approach to fighting this crisis, we have no hope of coming out of it. When the photo session is over, the government officials are leaving, even when hundreds in their relief distribution area are still not taken care of. This is adding insult to injury for the poor people who are calling their local aid centres and hearing that government aid has already been distributed in that area. It is heartening to see that the government has declared that those who steal relief materials will face court cases along with administrative punishment, but we are still to see that in action comprehensively.   We have seen some government officials getting punishment for stealing relief, but this is not enough. If the government can really bring all the wrongdoers to books for stealing relief goods along with those who fail to adequately distribute relief in their area, that would be a great step forward. What we need now is a medium-term national plan for re-emerging from this disaster that has already gotten a grip on much of the country. Both the private and the public sectors must do their part to help the country get out of this disaster.  The relief materials need to be distributed properly, without scope for stealing or wasting otherwise by only distributing to the well-connected.  Even the amount that the government can do at this time of crisis is limited. As such, it is necessary for a comprehensive plan-of-action so that we make proper use of the resources we have. The relief distribution needs to be need-based. Even the middle class and lower middle class people, who are too shy to ask for help in these dire times, need to be paid attention to, and be brought under the social safety net through relief operations that transcend the lower classes and access the middle class.  In these scenarios, the best method for distributing relief materials would be to access the homes of the people, alongside distributing relief on the streets. Some initiatives like this have been taken by the home minister and the mayors of Dhaka City North and Dhaka City South, among others, and I really appreciate their efforts.  This is how it should be done, but there also needs to be a comprehensive plan to tackle this crisis in the medium term, if we are to come out of the crisis any time soon. Without that sort of comprehensive planning, it will be hard for us to spring out of this disaster strong. Anupam Debashis Roy is an editor and organizer of Muktiforum."

      "text": "According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) of the district, at least 3500 hectares of land have been used for cultivating tobacco in six upazilas  Despite knowing of the adverse effects of tobacco, farmers have continued cultivating the crop across Nilphamari district as the produce yields them a good price compared to other crops like paddy and maize. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) of the district, at least 3500 hectares of land have been used for cultivating tobacco in six upazilas . However, a group of people who deal with tobacco in the district said the figure was almost 10,000 hectares. Agricultural officers have said they are discouraging farmers not to grow this crop as it is harmful for both health and soil. However, the farmers are not paying heed to them as tobacco cultivation brings them huge profits every year. They also added several tobacco companies, including multinational companies, were luring tobacco growers with seeds, fertilisers as well as technical support free of cost. This correspondent visited several villages- Itakhola, Kochukata, Tupamari, Panchapakur, Gorgarm , Charcharabari and Kanaikata Bamondanga - of Sadar upazila and observed that farmers, including women and children, were passing busy times in the tobacco fields. Farmer Nazrul Islam of Charcharabari village of Sadar upazila said tobacco companies had set up many purchasing centres and warehouses of tobacco in the district for the advantage of farmers . They are collecting produce from the fields directly. Even supervisors and officials of tobacco companies are regularly assisting them with various facilities. Farmer Arzina Begum of Kanaikata Bamondanga village of Kishoreganj upazila said she had cultivated tobacco on two bighas of land that cost her Tk 8,000. She added, \"Akij company provided me with fertilizer, seeds free of cost.\" Another farmer, Mukta Akhtar, said: \"I have cultivated tobacco on two bighas of land, costing me Tk 10,000. I would sell the crops at Tk30,000-35,000. \"Had we cultivated rice, potatoes and green chillis, we would not be able to make much profit,\" she added. Some farmers of the district alleged that agriculture offices were not sincere in encouraging farmers to grow other crops. Farmers do not get advice from agriculture officials when their seed beds and crops get damaged. Nilphamari Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) Deputy Director Nikhil Chandra Biswas said: \"Profit in cultivating tobacco is more than the cost. For this reason, farmers, disregarding health risks, are cultivating tobacco in huge quantities. As a result, families of tobacco growers are getting exposed to various diseases and cropland is losing fertility gradually.\" \"However, we are trying to create awareness among farmers,\" he added."

      "text": "The alarm was raised at President Ram Nath Kovind's residence in the centre of Delhi after the daughter-in-law of a sanitation worker living in the workers' quarters tested positive About 500 people entered self-isolation at India's presidential palace on Tuesday after a worker's relative tested positive for the coronavirus in the latest alarm close to public figures as the pandemic spreads through densely populated South Asia. India's 1.3 billion people have been ordered to remain indoors for 40 days under a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the virus so that the country's hospitals are not overwhelmed by a flood of infections. Indian authorities have confirmed 18,985 cases of Covid-19, including 603 deaths from the respiratory disease, a relatively low toll compared with Western countries with much smaller populations, though health officials say a lack of widespread testing may mean many more cases have not been reported. The alarm was raised at President Ram Nath Kovind's residence in the centre of Delhi after the daughter-in-law of a sanitation worker living in employee quarters there tested positive for Covid-19, officials said. Neither Kovind, 74, nor his aides were required to self-isolate as they would not have come into contact with lower-level workers on the premises, officials said. But the families of palace workers living in 114 apartments on the grounds were ordered to stay inside, while the seven members of the sanitation worker's family were moved to a quarantine facility. No one on the premises is known to be infected so far.  \"It may be clarified that to date no employee of the President's Secretariat has tested positive for Covid-19 and the Secretariat along with the Local Administration are taking all the preventive measures required under the government guidelines,\" Kovind's office said in a statement. Under India's constitution, the president is a titular head of the republic only with the prime minister and his cabinet holding the executive powers. An employee of India's parliament has also tested positive, but did not come to work, an official said, as the administrative wing of the legislature reopened on Monday as part of a staggered exit from the lockdown. While the total number of confirmed infections is still increasing, Indian health officials said the speed of transmission was slowing thanks to the lockdown, which at the moment is due to be lifted on May 3. The \"doubling rate\" - the number of days it takes infections to multiply by two - had increased to 7.5 days, up from 3.4 days before the lockdown, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said. \"This is an extremely positive trend,\" he said."

      "text": "HC wants sentence copy, answers to five questions The government is set to withdraw Kurigram Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sultana Pervin, as evidence on the detention and torture of journalist Ariful Islam was found to be true.  The development came amid widespread criticism from various quarters regarding the detention and sentencing of Ariful in the early hours of Saturday, for reportedly possessing narcotics and alcohol. Ariful's family has called the allegations against him \"absurd.\" The decision on the DC's withdrawal was disclosed on Sunday after Ariful, Kurigram correspondent of  Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune, was freed on bail around 12:30pm. Worryingly, Ariful was beaten so badly that he was taken directly to a local hospital following his release.   In another development on Sunday, the High Court ordered the state to submit to it a copy of Ariful's conviction which was delivered by a mobile court. Briefing the media at the Secretariat in Dhaka, State Minister for Public Administration, Farhad Hossain, said his ministry will soon withdraw DC Sultana, as an investigation into the incident found most of the allegations against her to be true.  \"Departmental action will also be taken against her [Sultana Pervin],\" he said, adding that not only the DC but all those involved with the incident will be brought to book. Earlier in the day, Ariful was granted bail by Additional District Magistrate Sujauddowla, upon giving an undertaking of Tk25,000. The journalist was released to the custody of Kurigram Press Club President Ahsan Habib Nilu.  Immediately after his release, Ariful was taken to Kurigram General Hospital and hospitalised around 1:30pm with numerous bruises on his body.  \"Ariful has injury marks on his body, especially on his hands, legs, back and head,\" confirmed Orthopaedic Senior Consultant Uttam Kumar Roy.  In addition to protests from journalists across the country regarding Ariful's conviction, The Editors' Council  on Sunday expressed grave concern over recent reports of indiscriminate attacks, abuse and torture of journalists.  At the hospital, Ariful told reporters that the authorities concerned had lied to him about his bail petition. \"An employee of the jail came to me on Saturday night and told me to sign a paper as my family had filed a bail petition,\" the journalist said. \"Today [Sunday], I came to know that my family did not do so.\" 'They threatened my life' Arif said several people led by Senior Assistant Commissioner (Tax) Nazim Uddin broke into his home and started beating him.  \"They blindfolded me and tied up my hands and feet before shoving me into a car,\" Ariful said. \"They proceeded to take me to an isolated place and Nazim kept saying 'Say your prayers now, you are about to meet your maker.' \"I begged them to spare my life. I desperately told them that I have two children and my parents have passed away. Don't kill me or my children will become orphans too,\" said Ariful. Writ on Ariful's conviction The bench of Justice Md Ashraful Kamal and Justice Sardar Md Rashed Jahangir has sought a copy of Ariful's conviction upon hearing a writ petition seeking a court order to declare the conviction illegal. The court also fixed today to issue its order in this regard. Advocate Ishrat Hasan and Barrister Syed Sayedul Haque Suman stood for the writ while Deputy Attorney General Debashis Bhattacharyya represented the state. The court also asked the deputy attorney general to phone the Kurigram DC for all the information regarding Saturday's mobile court, to be sent by email before today's hearing. The bench wanted answers to the following queries:  1.   Was the drive conducted by a mobile court or a special taskforce? 2. There are some rules and regulations regarding entering anyone's house at night (from sunset to sunrise). In this case, were these rules followed and what measures were taken? 3. A huge force of 40 people went to the journalist's house to catch him. Did they go there to arrest a wanted terrorist? According to the journalist's wife, 40 to 50 people took part in the raid. Surely, they must have considered the matter to be very important. Why did they consider the matter to be very important? 4. Before conducting any drive, an executive magistrate of a mobile court needs to take notes on the information source. Who informed the mobile court? 5. According to the Mobile Court Act, an incident needs to take place in front of the executive magistrate to warrant action. In this case, what kind of incident took place? Humiliating people nothing new for Nazim Kurigram Senior Assistant Commissioner (Tax) Nazim was accused of humiliating several people in his previous workplaces.   On November 11, 2018, he was transferred from his post as assistant commissioner (land) of Cox's Bazar Sadar upazila to Rangamati's Langadu upazila after a video showing him humiliating an elderly man went viral on social media.  The mobile court raid Around 12:30am on Saturday, a mobile court set up at the Kurigram DC office jailed Ariful Islam for a year, after law enforcement led by two or three magistrates picked him up from his residence. The officials claimed to have recovered drugs and alcohol from the residence. Among the magistrates was Nazim, said Ariful's wife Mostarima Nitu. At least a dozen Ansar members accompanied the magistrates.  \"They did not search the house, nor did they recover any drugs,\" she said, claiming that Ariful is not even a smoker. Journalist Ariful had filed a report about a renovated pond in Kurigram town that was named after the deputy commissioner. He also produced another report recently about irregularities regarding appointments at the DC's office.   Our Lalmonirhat correspondent  contributed to this report"

      "text": "The organizations said such measures pose threat to the safety and well-being of the refugees as well as Bangladesh host communities and aid workers Some 50 undersigned organizations have urged the Bangladesh government to lift ongoing mobile internet restrictions and halt the construction of barbed wire fencing around the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar in light of the growing Covid-19 pandemic. In an open joint letter to the Bangladesh prime minister, the organizations said such measures pose threat to the safety and well-being of the refugees as well as Bangladesh host communities and aid workers. Posted on Human Rights Watch website on Wednesday, the letter was signed by Amnesty International, Arakan Rohingya National Organisation, Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, British Rohingya Community UK, Canadian Burmese Rohingya Organization, Harvard Law School International Human Rights Clinic, among others. The letter said that as the Covid-19 pandemic spreads to Bangladesh, unrestricted access to information via mobile and internet communications is crucial for slowing the transmission of the disease and saving the lives of refugees, humanitarian workers, and the general population of Bangladesh. \"Lifting restrictions will not only enable community health workers to quickly share and receive the most reliable and up-to-date guidance during this evolving pandemic but will also help in coordination with community leaders. We urge you to ensure refugees, local communities, and aid workers alike can freely access mobile and internet communications, in the interest of protecting human rights and public health,\" the letter noted. It also mentioned that since September 2019, Bangladesh authorities have prevented Rohingya refugees from obtaining SIM Cards and directed telecommunications operators to restrict internet coverage in Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar District.  \"These restrictions should be lifted in light of the government's recommendation to those experiencing Covid-19 symptoms to contact the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, hotline. Without a phone or SIM Card, abiding by this instruction is impossible,\" it added. Furthermore, the signatory organizations mentioned that without access to mobile and internet communications, aid workers and others will be forced to deliver critical health information in person, heightening their risk of exposure to Covid-19 and slowing the effectiveness of the response. Bangladesh government has so far reported 6 deaths and 56 infected by Covid-19.  The fast spreading coronavirus, which was first reported in China's Wuhan, has infected more than 936,100 people and claimed above 47,200 lives across 203 countries and territories and two international conveyances, according to Worldometer. Globally, a total of 194,578 infected people have also recovered from Covid-19, a pandemic announced by the World Health Organization (WHO). Read the full letter here"

      "text": "In light of lockdowns and social distancing measures, most farmworkers are isolated in their homes The sudden outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic is worrying farmers ahead of the Boro paddy harvest season in Jessore, with farmers facing a shortage of workers to bring home their ripe crops in hundreds of acres of land.  In light of lockdowns and social distancing measures, most farmworkers are isolated in their homes, as a result, the upcoming harvesting season is threatened by impediments to harvesting. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) of the district has announced that it will help farmers by providing them with harvester machines at nominal value to harvest crops with less manpower. However, most farmers are unaware of DAE's plan to assist, so they are coming up with awareness campaigns to relieve farmers of their worries, according to district DAE sources. Farmers said the Boro harvest season has begun and they have to begin harvesting their crops in the next 15-20 days. They are facing a manpower shortage and they are not themselves allowed to work due to the lockdowns in place. They fear that their crops will either rot or the annual flood in the upcoming monsoon will ruin their year-long toil. According to the Agricultural Department of the district, over 54,615 hectares of lands are booming with Boro paddy and due to pleasant weather, this year farmers are expecting a good yield. The deputy director of the district DAE, Dr Md Akhtaruzaman, said the authorities had also taken up a scheme to provide 44 harvesters and 18 reapers to the farmers to lessen the need for manpower. He said: \"The Combine Harvester and Reapers will significantly reduce the work and cost of farmers. It can harvest around 1.5 bigha land per hour.\" The official added that the DAE was ready to provide additional farmworkers from other districts if needed, making sure of course that measures were also taken to prevent a spread of the coronavirus virus as well. When asked about the aid promised, most of the farmers said they did not know about the assistance but did appreciate the move. Dr Md Akhtaruzaman said: \"The scheme will only cost Tk250 in every two bigha land. And even if we face a shortage of machines we will employ farmworkers from Satkhira and other districts after consulting medical professionals regarding the necessary safety measures.\""
