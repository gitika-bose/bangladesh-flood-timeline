      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-30 00:00:00      \nClimate-induced flooding is expected to imperil about 300 million worldwide Coastal areas currently home to 42 million Bangladeshis will be vulnerable by 2050 to flooding made worse by climate change, no matter how aggressively humanity curbs carbon emissions, scientists have warned. In the second half of the 21st century and beyond, however, choices made today will determine whether the global coastlines on maps today will remain recognizable to future generations, reported the journal Nature Communications. Destructive storm surges fuelled by increasingly powerful cyclones and rising seas will hit Asia hardest, according to the study, reports AFP. It is estimated that one-fourth of Bangladesh's land will be reclaimed by sea, as per the study. Bangladeshi environment and climate professionals agreed with the study as the knowledge of rising sea level is not new but reiterated the implifloocations of water salinity. \"Bangladesh will face major risk from rising sea level which may impact increase in water salinity. But, we should understand the research methodology. Climate Central did the report based on global context. Results may vary if research is conducted on one specific coastal area of Bangladesh,\" said Prof Syed Hafizur Rahman, of Department of Environmental Science at Jahangirnagar University. \"Considering the history of thousands years of Bangladesh, and the local geo-math, it may not be possible to say such type of impact will hit the coastal areas or southern part of the country by 30 years of 50 years specifically,\" he added. \"The weather patterns have been changing gradually, visible by the change in temperature. The significant rise in sea level could affect the coastal people. But we should not be nervous as we can still deposit sediments in the coastal areas,\" said Prof Kazi Matin Uddin Ahmed, of Geology Department at Dhaka University.  In an article titled \"The future of Bangladesh regarding climate change\" published recently in a Bangladeshi magazine, the author Prof Md Khalequzzaman, of Geology Department of Lock Haven University Pennsylvania, analyzed that the coastal areas have been moving 80km towards the sea in Bangladesh over the last 200 years.   It is happening mainly in the south-eastern part of the country including Bhola, Noakhali and Barisal due to the alluvial sediments deposited by the rivers. Therefore, Bangladesh is surviving against the rising sea level. But, due to continued water-logging in the coastal part, construction of dam to protect the area may increase salinity in fresh water in coastal areas. Over two-third at risk in Asia More than two-thirds of the populations at risk are in China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand, reports AFP. In each of several dozen major cities - including Bangkok, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taizhou, Surabaya, Dhaka, Mumbai, Ho Chi Minh City and Osaka - millions will find themselves in flood zones. Using a form of artificial intelligence known as neural networks, the new research corrects ground elevation data that has up to now vastly underestimated the extent to which coastal zones are subject to flooding during high tide or major storms. \"Sea-level projections have not changed,\" said co-author Ben Strauss, chief scientist and CEO of Climate Central, a US-based non-profit research group.  \"But when we use our new elevation data, we find far more people living in vulnerable areas than we previously understood,\" Strauss told AFP. With the global population set to increase by two billion by 2050 and another billion by 2100 - mostly in coastal megacities - even greater numbers of people will be forced to adapt or move out of harm's way.

Of them, 10 people died in the last 24 hours, according to the Health Emergency Operation Center and the Control Room of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) report. 95 people drowned in the affected  areas during the 17 days. Hundreds of thousands of people across Bangladesh have been displaced as many rivers and all four of the country's major basins continued to rise due to incessant downpours and the rush of water from upstream. Thousands of people have been affected in the districts while rising water levels of the major rivers left people stranded in water-logged areas, putting them at risk of water-borne diseases. According to the control room data, 14,781 people have fallen ill due to flooding, water-borne diseases and other natural disasters between July 10 and July 26.   During the period, a total of 5571 people were infected with diarrhoea, 1,610 infected and one killed from respiratory tract infection (RTI), eight injured and seven killed from lightning strikes, 56 infected and eight killed from snake bites, 23 injured and 95 drowned. Additionally, 1,905 people were infected with skin diseases, 479 with eye inflammation, and 434 sustained injuries relating to the flood. 4,695 were infected and three were killed for other reasons that has not been specifically cited in the report. According to the Control Room data, the flood has affected 28 districts--Shariatpur, Rajbari, Manikganj, Munshiganj, Netrokona, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Khagrachhari, Bandarban, Rangamati, Feni, Bogra, Gaibandha, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Kurigram, Jamalpur, Sherpur, Brahmanbaria, Tangail, Sirajganj, Habiganj, Faridpur, Chandpur, and Madaripur. A total of 325 unions out of 2,117 unions in 74 upazilas in the 28 districts have been affected by the floods. There are 1,324 shelter centres with 2,451 medical teams currently working in the areas."

Flood water has increased in Chapainawabganj due to torrential rains and water level in the Padma has risen by 3cm in the last 12 hours. In the Pankha point of Chapainawabganj, the water level is 27.09 cm which is just 0.41 cm lower than the danger level as recorded by the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) on Tuesday. Many people in Chapainawabganj are marooned due to the rise of water which has also destroyed 8000 hectares of cropland.   The flood situation in Kushtia has worsened stranding around 50000 people. The water level at the Hardinge bridge point had crossed 10.25m yesterday, which is above danger level.  In Natore, around 6000 residents in three unions of Natore's Lalpur upazila have been marooned by the floodwaters.  The floods occurred due to the rise in the water level of the Padma River, where three unions - Bilamaria, Lalpur, and Iswardi, went under water, damaging 22 hectares of cropland, inflicting heavy losses on the farmers. People of the area are currently suffering from lack of drinking water and food. In Rajbari, the water level rose and was flowing 7cm above the danger level causing water to flood the city and stranding many people.  In Rajshahi, the water level is just 41cm below the danger level, according to the BWDB.  In Tangail, the water level in the Dhaleshwari River has risen and crossed the danger level by 7cm causing problems for people and many croplands have gone underwater.  In Pabna, the water level is almost at danger level and many croplands have gone underwater.   Water levels at 74 river stations, monitored by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) have seen a marked rise while 18 stations recorded a drop in levels, reports BSS. Among the 93 monitored stations, the water level at one river station has been registered steady while water levels at three river stations-the Padma at Goalundo, the Padma at Sureswar and Gorai at Kamarkhali- are flowing above the danger level, a bulletin issued by the FFWC said yesterday. All the major rivers are on a rising trend expect the Surma-Kushiyara, the bulletin said, adding that the trend of the Ganges and Padma rivers may continue rising in the next 72 hours. The reason for the floods in Bangladesh and India at the same time occurred due to torrential rains and not because the gates of the Farakka Barrage were opened, a source at the   Indian High Commission in Dhaka told Dhaka Tribune adding that it was a regular practice for India to open the gates during this time of the year. AFP reported on Tuesday that the death toll in eastern India from the torrential late monsoon rains has risen to nearly 140, as hospitals and schools were inundated with dirty rainwater.  The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the current monsoon has been the heaviest since 1994, classifying it \"above normal\", and this year's season has been longer than usual. Over the last four days, 111 people have died in Uttar Pradesh state and a further 28 lost their lives in neighbouring Bihar, government officials told the news agency.  Residents of Patna - the capital of Bihar, home to two million people - used lifeboats to escape heavily water-logged homes. Although the rains have ceased, large swathes of the city remained submerged, with schools and shops closed.

Dhaka wants to move 100,000 refugees to Bhasan Char - a Bay of Bengal island hours by boat from the mainland - to ease overcrowding in its camps at Cox's Bazar, home to more than one million Rohingya Muslims who have fled neighbouring Myanmar. \"We want to start relocation by early next month,\" Mahbub Alam Talukder, the Relief and Repatriation Commission chief based in Cox's Bazar, told Reuters, adding that \"the refugees will be shifted in phases\". Also Read - Inside the Bhashan Char plan for Rohingyas \"Our officials are compiling the lists of the refugees who are willing to move there,\" he said, adding that as many as 7,000 refugees had by Saturday agreed to shift. Some human rights groups have expressed concern over that plan because the island is remote and prone to devastation from cyclones. Many refugees oppose the move, which some human rights experts fear could spark a new crisis.  Densely populated Bangladesh has been grappling with large refugee numbers, with local communities turning hostile towards Rohingya after a second failed bid to send thousands back to Myanmar in August.  The number of refugees in Cox's Bazar has swelled since August 2017, when a Myanmar military-led crackdown that UN investigators have said was conducted with \"genocidal intent\" prompted some 730,000 Rohingya to flee. Also Read - What do Rohingyas think about Bhashan Char? A UN human rights investigator who visited in January said she feared a new crisis if Rohingya were taken to the island. \"There are a number of things that remain unknown to me even following my visit, chief among them being whether the island is truly habitable,\" said Yanghee Lee, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar. Shah Kamal, secretary of Bangladesh's Disaster Management Ministry, said the government was in talks with U.N. agencies to move the refugees to Bhasan Char, which it has been developing for the past three years. The photo, collected from project official Atikul Islam's Facebook page, shows the housing project for Rohingyas under construction in Bhashan Char, Noakhali, Bangladesh  \"There is no reason to be concerned about floods because we have built storm surge embankment, with all other facilities,\" he said. \"No one will be moved there against their will.\""

The floods worsened in Gaibandha, Kurigram, Jamalpur, Bogra, Sirajganj and Tangail yesterday, while the situation has improved somewhat in Lalmonirhat, Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Habiganj, and Moulvibazar.   In Gaibandha, fresh areas of five upazilas flooded yesterday, following the collapse of an embankment dam near the district town.  The district town was inundated when gushing water breached  city embankments in 20 places. The Brahmaputra River was 150cm above the danger level, and the Ghaghot River rose 94cm above the danger level, said Mokhlesur Rahman, Water Development Board executive engineer. About 4 lakh people still remain waterlogged in the district. The district's rail links to the north, remained suspended for the second consecutive day. At least 94km of the Gaibandha-Balashi road were flooded.  At least 361 schools across the district shut down and eight went under water. Some of them are being used as shelters but they lack food, drinking water, and sanitation facilities. The flood claimed the lives of two people including a child. The deceased were identified as Shohag, 5, of Sadar upazila, and Anwarul Islam, 32, of Sundarganj upazila.  In Bogra three upazilas were flooded, affecting almost 47 villages and more than 14,000 homes in Sariakandi and Sonatola upazilas. 240 houses were damaged partially or completely in Sariakandi, Sonatola and Dhunot upazilas. The Jamuna River is currently 127cm above the danger level. In Jamalpur, the Jamuna River is currently at a recording breaking 166cm above the danger level. With the embankment dam collapse in Madarganj upazila, at least 15 villages flooded. So far, the floods in Jamalpur have claimed the lives of four children. 1,590 homes were damaged partially, and 475 were destroyed completely in 47 unions of 7 upazilas, waterlogging close to 56,900 people. In Kurigram, 4,536 people have been affected, of whom, 3,840 people have taken shelter at 409 storm shelters. A total of 899 hectares of agricultural lands have been flooded.  In Tangail, with the Jamuna River rising 91cm above the danger point, 10 new villages were flooded, when an embankment dam collapsed in Bhuapur upazila yesterday. In Sirajganj, when the newly constructed ring dam collapsed two days ago, the flooding worsened as the Jamuna River rose 91cm above the danger point. In Madaripur, the Padma River rose significantly yesterday, flooding 50 houses in Shibchar upazila. At least eight schools, two upazila health complexes, and the union council building are at risk.

This has marooned thousands of people and disrupting road communications in different areas. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) on Friday warned water levels in rivers could rise further while reports suggests erosion of bank lines in some areas including Manikganj worsened further the deluge situation, reports BSS. \"All the major rivers are in rising trend . . . all the major rivers may (continue to) rise in next 72 hours,\" said the FFWC in its latest bulletin. But the centre predicted a \"rapid rise\" of the water levels in rivers in northeastern Sylhet region, southwestern greater Chittagong ranging from Feni to Hill Tracts and southwestern Barisal region in the next 24 hours. Disaster Management and Relief Minister Dr Enamur Rahman in a media briefing, said preparedness was underway to handle the situation while a central control room at his office kept a constant contact with officials in the affected areas. The minister said gushing waters from upstream region overnight triggered erosion in central Manikganj on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka while effort was underway to save people and infrastructure there. He acknowledged that erosion in Manikganj sent a visible signal that the deluge could engulf more areas but added government machineries including the Health Ministry, armed forces and non-government organizations chalked up coordinated plans to face any situation. Also Read - Heavy rainfall inundates Dhaka, disrupts city life  \"The district and upazila administrations by now started distributing food among the victims while supplies of other required materials including medicines are underway,\" a spokesman of the Disaster Management Ministry said. According to officials and residents, continued rains swelled water level in Bandarban's Sangu River cutting off the district's communication lines with rest of the country and affecting as well its internal communication systems. They said a portion of the Chittagong-Rangamati road near Ghagra's Kalabagan area collapsed due to the torrential downpour; a landslide and culvert collapse halted communication on the Rangamati-Bandarban road. Swelling waters in the Jamuna River affected thousands in the Lalmonirhat and Kurigram districts marooning several thousands and inundating scores of villages and localities. The Water Development Board opened all 44 sluice gates of the Teesta Barrage to avert flood-related casualties as the rise of the Teesta already flooded nearby regions and waterlogged a few thousand people. The inflated water in the Surma and several small rivers submerged settlements and roads in areas of Sunamganj bordering India with officials saying the flash flood breached over 10,000 homes in the district. Numerous primary schools suspended their classes considering the security of the children in view of heavy rainfall and deluge in Sunamganj. A landslide caused by excessive rainfall collapsed a dam in Jamalpur also flooding several villages there while officials said unless repaired immediately, the gushing waters would submerge more areas there. Bangladesh Meteorological Department officials said the shared information they received from their counterparts in the Indian met office suggested that heavy rainfall could lash Bangladesh's northwestern, northeastern and southeastern parts of Bangladesh and their adjoining regions in India's Assam and Meghalaya states in next 24 to 48 hours. \"At places the downpours could be more than heavy,\" a Met office spokesman said."

UNHCR provided tents to the families who were affected by torrential monsoon rains and floods earlier this month. The first batch of the emergency tents was handed over to BDRCS at a ceremony held at UNHCR's warehouse in Cox's Bazar on Thursday. The tents are fire resistant and worth approximately $2million, said a press statement by UNHCR.  Head of UNHCR operations and Cox's Bazar sub-office, Marin Din Kajdomcaj, said: \"We received a plea from BDRCS to help thousands of displaced villagers across Bangladesh, following non-stop heavy rains and rising river levels, earlier in this month.\" \"We had pre-positioned some emergency shelters in Cox's Bazar and Chittagong warehouses, as a part of contingency preparation under Rohingya refugee response program,\" he added. \"UNHCR is ready and feels happy to make this small contribution by extending support to these families in their time of need,\" Kajdomcaj concluded. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief reported that as of now, 2.3 million people were affected in 20 of Bangladesh's 64 districts due to this flood caused by torrential monsoon rains. "

The first-ever forecast-based finance scheme will cover more than 275,000 people to mitigate flood impact through early action.  These will include cash transfers along with existing government interventions.

Erratic monsoon and downpours are causing severe floods,\" said Richard Ragan, WFP representative and country director in Bangladesh, in a press release on Thursday.  \"WFP is using a combination of cash and food to urgently meet the basic needs of more than a quarter million people whose homes and agricultural lands have been inundated.\" Around 5,000 households (25,000 people) received Tk4,478 ($53) through mobile money transfers in Kurigram as part of the project. Cash was distributed to the most vulnerable, including families headed by disabled people, the elderly and single women.    Also Read- 300k hectares of cropland damaged in flood The assistance helped people pay for basic needs such as food and other urgently needed goods and services. WFP is supporting more than 250,000 people in three north-western districts with energy-boosting biscuits that will sustain them for three days as an immediate response to the floods. The biscuits are often used in emergencies as they are nutritious, easy to transport and do not need cooking. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief reports that 2.3 million people have been affected in 20 of Bangladesh's 64 districts. WFP is closely monitoring the floods in coordination with the government and we stand ready to assist further, should the situation deteriorate."

Water was flowing about 1769cm above danger levels at no less than 23 stations of 13 rivers yesterday, according to data compiled by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). According to the centre, the situation is said to be a flood if the water flows at or up to 1m above the danger level, while it becomes a severe flood if the water flows more than 1m above. All four of the country's major basins continued to rise due to incessant downpours and the rush of water from upstream, the bulletin says. While the flooding may worsen in Kurigram, Jamalpur, Gaibandha, Bogra, Sirajganj and Tangail districts, the situation may improve in Lalmonirhat, Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Habiganj, and Moulvibazar districts by morning today, it adds. The FFWC usually monitors 93 river stations across Bangladesh. Among those, water levels at 63 river stations rose, while 29 fell, and one remained steady as of yesterday. All the major rivers were  rising except the Surma-Kushiyara it said, adding that the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Ganges-Padma rivers may continue rising this morning and the Atrai river at Baghabari and the Padma river at Goalondo point may cross danger levels by morning today , according to the forecast.

In Jamalpur, 300,000 people living in 47 unions of three municipalities are currently suffering due to floods caused by the steep rise in the water levels of the Jamuna, Brahmaputra, Jhenai, and Zinziram rivers. Jamalpur WDB Executive Engineer Nabakumar Chowdhury said: \"The Jamuna is currently flowing 135cm above the danger level at Bahadurabad Point. \"The newly flood affected areas of the district are: Madarganj upazila's Gunritala, Adar Bhita union and municipality, Islampur municipality, Melndah upazila's Mahmudpur, Nagla and Kulia areas, and vast areas of Sarishabari upazila's Doail and Kamrabad unions.\" In Sunamganj, the flood situation remains unchanged though heavy rainfall has stopped in the district.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-24 00:00:00      \n4.7 million people in 18 districts suffering from food, water, and communication crisis The monsoon flood triggered by heavy rainfall, and increased water flow from upstream, has caused extensive damage to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people across the country, displacing many from their homes. Though many flood-hit people are returning to their homestead, inundated roads, and waterborne infectious diseases keep compounding the sufferings of the affected population. At least 4.7 million people have been affected by the flood in 18 districts, with a larger population affected in Kurigram, Tangail, Gaibandha, Bogra, Sirajganj, Sherpur, Sylhet, and Sunamganj districts, according to the disaster situation report prepared by the Emergency Operation Centre of the Department of Disaster Management, published on Monday.  The data includes both partial, and full damages.  A total of about 321,939 hectares of agricultural land are submerged in floodwater, putting farmers in the affected districts in trouble. At least 1,434km of embankments have been damaged as well. About 4,968km of road have been damaged, and in some places, inundated roads are making it extremely difficult for the villagers to commute, especially when they need to travel to the nearby health complexes for treatment. People are also suffering from a crisis of safe drinking water, as 50,430 tube-wells are out of commission due to the flood in these districts. So far, the government has allotted 24,150 tons of rice, Tk3.27 crore in cash, 102,000 packages of dry food, and 8,000 tents as relief materials, in the current fiscal year, which began on July 1. Rivers flowing beyond danger level in 13 districts The latest record shows water flowing about 729 cm above danger levels at no less than 20 stations of 11 rivers in 13 districts, according to data compiled by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) released on Monday. According to the centre, when water swells, and flows into the rivers, under or up to one metre beyond the danger level, it is called a flood; when the river water swells over one metre above the danger level, the situation is categorized as severe flood.  The FFWC usually monitors 93 river stations across Bangladesh. Among those, water levels at 34 river stations rose, while 56 fell, and three remained steady as of Monday. Thousands of people have been affected in the districts, as rising water levels of the major rivers left people stranded in waterlogged areas, putting them at risk of contracting water-borne diseases. Many still marooned The situation is improving in several districts, but a significant number of people are still marooned, and in desperate need of help. In Sunamganj, two floods within two weeks have crippled the district, mostly affecting the rural road infrastructure.   According to the district relief and rehabilitation office, there are 88 unions in the district, where 153,785 people remain marooned. During this disaster, seven people were killed by lightning strikes, and boat capsizes. People of Jamalganj upazila were hit the worst, as 7,950 families were affected.  Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) Executive Engineer Md Iqbal Ahmed said: \"The road infrastructure in the district has been most affected by the flood. Massive potholes were created on major roads, bridges, and culverts of the district.\" As soon as the flood water recedes completely, the renovation work will begin in full-scale, he added. In Tangail, the overall flood situation gradually continue to improve as the three major rivers are receding. But the rivers are still flowing above the danger level. Despite the improvement, a huge number of people continue to remain marooned, and cultivable lands, and roads are still flooded. Rezaul Karim, assistant engineer of Tangail Water Development Board's science department, said: \"The Jamuna River, the Dhaleswari River, and the Jhinai River are all still flowing above the danger level. The Pungli, and Bongshai rivers have risen, but are flowing under the danger level.\"  In Faridpur, 30 primary schools were shut down, as the flood water remains stagnant in 223 villages, in the coastal areas of Faridpur sadar, Charbhadrasan, and Sadarpur upazilas. District Primary Education Officer Tauhidul Islam said: \"The schools had to be closed down as they were completely inundated by the flood water.\" Faridpur Deputy Commissioner Atul Sarkar said: \"The flood affected families are being closely monitored, and are being provided with the necessary relief items. Until now, 280 tons of rice, and Tk2.9 lakh in cash were distributed to people of 15 unions in four upazilas.\" In Gaibandha, devastating floods washed away 70,000 homes in seven upazilas, leaving 145,000 families displaced.  Barely able to meet their own needs, caring for their livestock is proving near impossible. These animals do not have a place to stay while food and land have become scarce. Villagers aren't able to sell their animals and they aren't getting fair prices at the local haats. Abdur Rahman, a local, said: \"I have been here since morning and no one is putting a fair price on my cow. The 200kg cow is worth Tk1 lakh, but the highest offer I got was Tk 80,000\" According to the district Department Of Livestock Services, there are over 400,000 cows, close to 300,000 goats and sheep in the district. Among these, 72,777 cows, 48,823 goats and sheep, and 108,244 ducks and chickens were affected by the flood.

In Tangail, although water level of Jamuna River fell from the last few days, Dhaleswari. and Jhinai Rivers continued to flow above the danger level causing the flood situation to remain unchanged.  The water level of Jamuna River was at 98cm above the danger level, while Dhaleswari River at Elasin Bridge point was at 140cm, and Jhinai River at Jokarchar point was flowing at 85cm above the danger level yesterday morning. Assistant Deputy Engineer of the science department of the Water Development Board (WDB), Rezaul Karim, confirmed the information.  In Kurigram, the flood situation also remained unchanged, as Brahmaputra, Dharala, Dudhkumar, and other major rivers in the district continue to flow above the danger level for the last 11 days. Local WDB sources said, the water level in the Brahmaputra River at Chilmari point was at 90cm above the danger level, and 57cm above the danger level at Nunkhaoa point, while Dharala River was at 59cm above the danger level at Setu point, reports UNB. District Administration's control room sources said 864 villages of 57 unions were flooded in the district, leaving 800,000 people marooned. Crops of 20,000 hectares were destroyed while 500km road, 40km embankment, and 41 bridges and culverts were damaged in the district. In Gaibandha, overall flood situation in chars, and Brahmaputra river basin under four upazilas in the district was improving since Thursday night as floodwater started receding from affected areas. Local WDB sources said the Ghagot River of the district recorded a fall of 22cm during the period, and was flowing 72 cm above its danger mark at New Bridge Road point of the district town. Assistant Commissioner and acting district relief and rehabilitation officer M Shahidul Islam said, as many as 485,328 people of the district were marooned.  Some 74,104 flood victims took shelter at 180 flood shelter centres of the district, he said. Deputy Commissioner M Abdul Matin said relief distribution activity was intensified to the flood victims of Sundarganj, Sadar, Fulchhari, and Shaghata upazilas to mitigate their sufferings. In Jamalpur, although water level of the Jamuna River was receding slowing, the Brahmaputra River water level remained the same. As a result, flood persists in 61 out of 68 unions in the district, where close to 500,000 people remain marooned, and 983 schools remain shut. Locals and WDB sources said, the water level of the Jamuna River fell by 12cm, and was at 154cm above the danger level at Bahadurabad point. 25 new villages flooded in Naogaon Gushing upstream water collapsed embankments of the Atrai River in Manda upazila, and the Choto Jamuna in Raninagar upazila of Naogaon. At least 25 new villages were flooded after the two embankments collapsed yesterday, and marooned nearly 200,000 people. Gona Union Council Chairman Abul Hasnat said: \"Local WDB had not renovated the dams in over 40 years, due to which it was at a very risky condition. The flood has inundated nearby villages, and washed away all crops, and domestic animals.\" Our correspondents Abdullah Al Numan, Tangail; Tazul Islam Reza, Gaibandha; Bishwajit Deb, Jamalpur; and Abdur Rouf Pavel, Naogaon contributed to this report"

At least two people were killed on Saturday, while thousands remain marooned by the floods, which have affected crops as well as road communications in different parts, report our correspondents. Moreover, at least 11 people were killed by lightning in three districts on Saturday. Thousands of people in the affected districts have become victims of recurring landslides and rising water levels of the major rivers, making them water-logged and stranded, as well as at risk from water-borne diseases. Water was flowing about 12.84 metres above danger level in at least 23 stations of 15 rivers on Saturday, according to data compiled by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). Three stations each of Surma and Kushiyara rivers, two each of Manu, Sungu, Brahmaputra and Jumuna rivers, and one each of Dhalai, Khowai, Someswari, Kangsha, Halda, Matamuhuri, Dharla, Teesta and Ghagot rivers were flowing above the danger level, the data shows. The FFWC warned that the flood situation in Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Bandarban, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Jamalpur, and Gaibandha may deteriorate further in the next 24 hours. According to the centre, the situation is said to be a flood if the water flows at or up to 1m above the danger level, while it is severe flood if the water flows more than 1m above.  The outlook says that all the major rivers are in rising trend with chances of medium to heavy rainfall in some places and very heavy rainfall in the northern, northeastern and southeastern parts of Bangladesh in the next 24 to 48 hours. It apprehends that all major rivers may continue rising over the next 72 hours.  The Bangladesh Meteorological Department said heavy to very heavy rainfall has been forecast for parts of Rangpur, Mymensingh, Sylhet and Chittagong divisions for the next 24 hours from 10am Saturday to 10am Sunday. In such a situation, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Saturday said the government has taken all necessary preparations to tackle flooding in the country and asked all officials to remain alert so that the floods cannot harm people. State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Enamur Rahman on Friday said 17,500 tons of rice, 50,000 packets of dry food, 500 tents, and Tk2.93 crore in cash have been sent to the flood-affected districts. Two killed, thousands marooned In Rangamati, two people were killed in a landslide triggered by heavy rainfall in Kaptai upazila. The deceased are Atal Barua, 50, and Sujoya Aung Marma, 42, former chairman of Kaptai upazila Dildar Hossain said. According to locals, the landslide killed the pair around 11am on Saturday as they were riding a CNG auto-rickshaw on the Raikhali-Bangalhalia-Bandarban road at Karigarpara under Raikhali union of Kaptai. In Chittagong, a woman and her daughter were pulled out alive from debris following a landslide that occurred around 10:30am at Arefin Nagar in Bayazid area. Shah Noor, 40, and her daughter Marjina, 18, were rushed to Chittagong Medical College Hospital soon after police, army and locals managed to rescue them, said Sub-Inspector Emdadul Haque of Bayazid police station. The civil surgeon office has formed a total of 284 medical teams in the district to tackle any possible disasters that could be triggered by heavy rains. In Bandarban, torrential rain for the last nine days has swelled the rivers Sangu and Matamuhuri, flooding six upazilas and leaving 20,000 families marooned.  Both rivers were flowing above the danger level on Saturday, inundating Armypara, Islampur and Bus station areas under Sadar upazila, and other low-lying areas of Lama, Alikadam, Ruma, Thanchi and Rowangchhari upazilas. Houses have collapsed and croplands destroyed due to the severe flooding, causing immense suffering to the residents of the hilly region. Their daily activities have virtually come to a standstill. Floods have also snapped road links between Bandarban and other parts of the country for the last five days. Due to the disruption in communication, prices of commodities have increased. The district administration has opened 131 shelters and formed special teams to provide health services to the affected people. Different organizations - including the municipality authorities and the upazila administration - are providing food at the shelters. The photo taken on Saturday, July 13, 2019 shows a house is surrounded by flood water in Jamalpur Focus Bangla In Lalmonirhat, water level of the Teesta River has continued to rise due to heavy rain for the last five days and rush of water from upstream, causing severe flooding on both banks of the river. Fourty-four sluice gates of the Teesta Barrage were opened to control the onrush of floodwater, but the water level has continued to rise. BWDB Deputy Assistant Engineer Aminur Rashid said there is a possibility that the water level might continue to rise over the next four to five days. In Sylhet, two people remain missing in Goainghat and Companiganj due to floods. Companiganj police station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Tajul Islam said Helal Uddin, a worker, went missing on Friday when the boat carrying him sank at Bholaganj in the upazila. A drive is underway to trace him. A youth named Hossain Mia has been missing since Wednesday after he drowned in flood water at Nayabasti village in Jaflong, said Goainghat OC (investigation) Hillol Roy. BWDB Executive Engineer in Sylhet Muhammad Shahiduzzaman Sarker said all the rivers in the district were flowing dangerously, compared to Friday. In Sunamganj, the flood situation remains unchanged at Sadar, Bishambharpur, Tahirpur, Jamalganj, and Doarabajar upazilas due to heavy downpour and onrush of upstream water from India. Data compiled by the district administration show that water has entered 14,500 houses, stranding at least 75,000 people. District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer M Fazlul Haque said 1.04 lakh people of 21,000 families have become stranded because of the floods. Some 300 metric tons of rice, 3,765 packets of dry food, and Tk2.5 lakh has been distributed as relief, he added. Tahirpur Upazila Parishad Chairman Koruna Sindhu Chowdhury Babul said at least 5,000 mud houses have been destroyed in his area. In Jamalpur, at least 6,000 people of different areas under Islampur upazila have become stranded because of floods. In Netrokona, hundreds of people under 12 unions of Durgapur and Kolmakanda have been passing a hard time due to the floods. The district and local administrations distributed 20 metric tonnes of rice and 600 packets of dry food among the affected people. In Rangpur, about 50,000 residents of 40 villages under nine unions of three upazilas have largely been affected due to continuous downpour, rise of water level of the Teesta River, coupled with onrush of hilly water from India. In Moulvibazar, 133 hectares of aush paddy have been damaged by the rising waters of Monu and Dholai rivers, as reported by the district agriculture extension department. In Bogra, the Jamuna River was flowing 8cm above the danger level as of 3pm on Saturday, inundating low-lying areas at Kamalpur, Rohodoho, Ghoghudoho, Chandanbaisha, Dholirkandi and Kutubpur in Sariakandi.

Heavy rainfall and water from upstream have also seen all major rivers in Sylhet to surge. The Surma and Kushiara are flowing greatly in excess of 100cm above the danger level in Companyganj, Gowainghat, Jaintapur, Kanaighat, Fenchuganj, and Balaganj upazilas. The Dhalai and Sari rivers also swelled, flooding towns and villages and cutting off communications. Authorities expect the condition to further deteriorate. In Kurigram, the Dharala and Brahmaputra are flowing 12cm and 11cm respectively above the danger point. Other lesser rivers in the district are also swelling as the flow from upstream has not shown any sign of relenting. Intermittent landslides have damaged several dams, endangering at least 20,000 local residents, and putting the Dhaka-Rowmari Highway in risk as well. Bandarban remained cut off from the country after seven days of relentless torrent. Landslides have severed the road connecting Bandarban and Rangamati. The roads are expected to recover once the waters recede. The continuous downpour has further inundated the Sangu and Matamuhuri rivers, flooding parts of the town, prompting 1,200 families to take refuge in 131 shelters. Bandarban Mayor Islam Baby said 2,400 municipality residents are being provided with food daily. The Meghna raged in Chandpur, threatening a Tk300 crore river protection dam project. The local upazila authorities are dumping geo-bags in the river to mitigate soil erosion in lieu of the local Water Development Board authorities. The river has already eroded a 158meter stretch of land along the dam, making locals whose houses, businesses, and land are at risk panic. In Nilphamari, the Teesta had been flowing 28cm above the danger level on Thursday. While it decreased to 24cm above the danger level on Friday, severe damage to a dam in the Dimla upazila has been reported. Local authorities have asked residents of 10 unions to evacuate to high land, cautioning that at least 20,000 people are at risk. In Gaibandha, rainwater and water from upstream in the hills have sharply increased water levels in all major rivers. Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) office sources said the Brahmaputra rose by 36cm, the Teesta by 3cm, the Karotoa by 34cm, and the Ghagot by 53cm. The rise of water level has affected the low-lying areas of the chars and the Brahmaputra river basin, with thousands of people growing concerned, reports BSS.  Deputy Commissioner Abdul Matin said an emergency disaster management meeting was convened on Thursday to help mitigate damages. The government offices are being aided by NGOs who are also operating in the district. Jamuna endangers thousands The Jamuna River has raged through Manikganj over two weeks, taking at least 200 houses, a mosque, a madrasa, and a school into its gullet. Hundreds of families suddenly rendered landless are seeking shelter at government offices. Authorities are distributing relief, but the consensus is that only a long-term solution can prevent Shibalaya and Daulatpur upazilas from suffering catastrophic damages, according to UNB. Three villages in Tangail were ravaged by the Jamuna in the Bhuiyapur upazila. As of Friday, at least 200 houses were reported to have been swallowed by the river's widening maw. Another several hundred houses, in addition to schools, mosques, and temples are also at risk. Locals alleged the Water Development Board has done next to nothing in terms of preventive measures, in spite of repeated pleas for assistance. Authorities admitted the erosion is severe, and requires geo-bags to be dumped along at least a 500meter stretch, but only 75meters have been approved. Government measures State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Enamur Rahman said 17,500 tons of rice, 50,000 packets of dry food, 500 tents and Tk2.93 crore in cash have been sent to the flood-affected districts. Medical teams will also reach the affected areas in a couple of days, said State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Enamur Rahman on Friday. Quoting the Met office, he said the situation may worsen. The Ministry of Water Resources has set up a control room in its Secretariat office to monitor and assess the flood situation. The control room can be contacted at 02-9570028. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, which is also working round the clock, can be reached through their toll-free number of 1090, and the extension 5.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-09 00:00:00      \nUN FAO hints of price hikes, fall in production; Bangladesh imported $1.1 billion worth of agricultural products from the US in 2018 One of the worst floods in recent history has resulted in record low planting of corn and soybean in the United States in five years, driving the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to recalculate global food production estimates for 2019. The UN agency says its cereal price index rose 1.4% because of a sudden surge in corn price quotations after planting of the crop got off to the slowest pace ever recorded in the United States, due to widespread flooding and rains. The US being one of Bangladesh's key source countries for agricultural imports, market sources cautioned the authorities to keep track of the global food and feed output scenario to avoid future price shocks or scarcity.     By June 2, producers had planted 67% of the US's corn acreage, 29 percentage points behind both last year and the 5-year average, according to the Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin published on June 4 by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA also reports that only 39% of the US's soybean acreage was planted by June 2, 47 percentage points behind last year, and 40 points behind in the 5-year average.   Bangladesh's import of agricultural products from the US was worth $1.1 billion last year. The imports include, among other things, soybeans ($434 million), soybean meal ($34 million) and distiller grains that include feed-grade maize ($35 million), according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR).  Though Bangladesh mostly imports soybean oil from Brazil and Argentina, some refineries also import US soybeans for crushing here in Bangladesh. The United States is the world's number one soybean producing country.  Bangladesh's domestic soybean production is only 0.15 million tons. The country needs to import over 1.1 million tons of soybeans and half a million tons of soymeal to keep pace with the growing needs of the cooking oil and feed industry respectively.  As far as maize or corn is concerned, despite its tremendous success in raising domestic output from next to zero in the 80's to over 3.5 million tons now, Bangladesh still has to import over a million tons of maize/corn, mainly for feed purposes, thanks to a burgeoning poultry industry in the country. Officials told the Dhaka Tribune yesterday that while maize is traditionally imported by Bangladesh from India and Thailand, it is being imported from the US as well since 2016. Market sources said, even if Bangladesh gets alternate import sources for its soybean and maize, less planting and lower production of the two agricultural products in the United States, would have a bearing on overall availability and prices in the global market. The US is the world's number one producer of both maize and soybean.  UN FAO predicts a fall in global maize output due to a minimum 10% shrinkage in US maize production due to a slower pace of planting owing to unfavourable weather conditions.   The UN agency said new estimates for production and utilization suggested world cereal stocks could decline by as much as 3% in the new season, hitting a four-year low of 830 million tons. Any rise in maize and soymeal prices would have a bearing on Bangladesh's fast growing poultry and fish industry.  Increased production of soybean and other cereal grains in Brazil and Argentina, sources said, can still potentially offset any global shortages of key agricultural products.  "

India opened the sluice gates of the Farakka Barrage, which aided to the rise of water level in Padma in the last three to four days. Farmers have cultivated 2500 hectares of black gram in the upazila this year, with 1300 hectares alone cultivated in char areas beside the Padma river. At least, 725 hectares of land in char areas have gone under water as the level in the river has been rising for the last three to four days, according to the Upazila Agriculture Extension office. During a visit to the flood affected areas on Monday, our reporter found croplands of Upazila's Ramkrishnapur, Chilmari, Philipnagar and Moricha unions submerged due to the sudden swell of the Padma waters.  This year, I cultivated black gram in 20 bighas of land , but within four to five days, the water level of the Padma rose, inundating my croplands and inflicting me with heavy losses, said  Abdul Jabbar, farmer of the Ramkrishnapur union. Most black gram is cultivated in our char areas. But, the water flow upstream helped in the rise of the water level of the Padma, flooding the croplands of char areas and incurring a heavy losses to farmers, said Saiful Islam, another farmer of this village. Siraj Mondal, chairman of the Ramkrishnapur Union Parishad (UP) said: ''With the swelling of the Padma river, at least 500 hectares of black gram belonging to around 3000 farmers have been inundated. Stating that the farmers suffered heavy losses, he urged the government to provide financial assistance to the affected farmers.'' Sajib Al Maruf, Upazila Agriculture Extension Officer of the Daulatpur Upazila said: ''Water level of the Padma rose as India opened the sluice gate of the Farakka barrage, flooding 500 hectares of black gram of 3000 farmers. We will help them out by providing necessary support after the water recedes.''"

Flood water continued to rise mainly due to the opening of Farakka Barrage gates and torrential rain, according to sources. The waters kept rising in Chapainawabganj touching the danger level. In the last 24 hours (which ended on Wednesday), the level of water in the Padma River had risen by 11cm which is just 0.30cm below the danger level. Water level in the Mohananda River had also risen by 11cm just 0.22cm below the danger level. In Kushtia, water has crossed the danger level and breached the Kuthibari protective dam in Shilaidaha. 30m   of land was under the Padma waters after the breach of the dam. The water level at Bheramara Hardinge Bridge point was flowing 5cm over the danger level and in the last 12 hours the level of water increased by 2cm breaking all the previous records. The floods had caused at least 50,000 people to be stranded. In Tangail, though water in the Jamuna River receded, levels of water in the other rivers increased. Water level in the Dhaleshwari River increased by 5cm causing the water to flow 22cm above the danger level, while the water level of the Jhinai River increased by 1cm resulting the water to flow 62cm over the danger level. The increase in water level had submerged the low lying lands, rendering countless numbers of families homeless.       In Pabna, water level of the Padma at the Paksi Hardinge Bridge point increased by 7cm which caused the water to flow 14.25 cm above the danger level breaking the record of the last 16 years. Considering the flood emergency, leave of public servants of three upazilas including Upazila Nirbahi Officers (UNO) were cancelled, said Deputy Commissioner Kabir Mahmud at a press briefing on Wednesday evening. \"All concerning district officials are on duty due to the sudden upheaval of the water-level in the recent floods, which exceeded the danger mark,\" the commissioner added.

Bihar minister: Farakka Barrage must be dismantled Sanjay Kumar Jha, eastern India's state of Bihar's water resources minister on Tuesday said that Farakka Barrage, which was been built compromising the state's interest, should be dismantled. According to the Times of India, the minister said the state government has been writing to the federal government for the resolution of the problems caused by the dam and will do so again encompassing all issues. The Farakka Barrage was constructed in the early 60s with the main purpose of helping flush out sediment deposition from the Kolkata Port, besides addressing drinking water requirement in West Bengal. The dam became operational in 1975. \"It (Farakka Barrage) must be dismantled in the interest of Bihar...People of Bihar have been suffering every year due to it. It has become 'misery' for all of us,\" Jha told reporters.

With the rising waters, the low-lying and char areas of Kurigram, Sunamganj, and Nilphamari, are beset by landslides and floods. People in the affected areas, especially near river banks and in char areas are in severe danger if the waters continue to rise, say officials at local water development boards (WDB).  Road communications have been severed as major roads in these districts are flooded.  This is hampering regular day-to-day activities, affecting working people who have to set out to earn their daily bread and, in medical emergencies, patients who are left helpless. Businesses relying on these roads daily are also facing monetary losses. In Kurigram, the Brahmaputra River and the Dharala River are reaching dangerous levels and will continue to do so, says the local WDB. Char areas and low-lying regions close to embankments are inundated. According to WDB sources, in the last 24 hours, the Dharala River at jetty point has risen by 32cm, and the Brahmanbaria River at Nunkhaoa point has risen by 12cm. By comparison, the Teesta River is holding steady. In the last 24 hours, the district recorded  rainfall of 31mm, expected to remain the same for the next few days, said Rajarhat Meteorological Station. People living in char areas and near embankments said the rising waters have flooded jute, maize, and other grain crop fields. The rising water levels quickly flooded char areas, threatening people in riverside areas.  Water development board Executive Engineer Md Ariful Islam said: \"Incessant rainfall and upstream water from India have swollen the Brahmaputra and Dharala Rivers. The water level is likely to keep rising as the weather forecast suggests continuous rainfall for a few more days.  \"We have repaired dams damaged in the 2017 floods. There are some dams which need attention on the banks of the Dharala River.\" In Sunamganj, a portion of the Sunamganj-Tahirpur Highway is once again flooded due to landslides in Anwarpur, disconnecting the Sadar and Tahirpur upazilas since Monday. Commuters are suffering with at least 50 vehicles stuck at both ends of the highway. WDB said the Surma River at Shologhar point has risen by 7.11cm. The district recorded rainfall of 175mm in the last 24 hours. WDB Executive Engineer Abu Bakkar Siddique said: \"Incessant rainfall is slowly giving rise to the Surma River. However, it hasn't crossed the danger level yet, though the rain is expected to continue and the water level will also continue to rise.\" In Nilphamari, the Teesta is steadily rising and is just 10cm below the danger point (52.6cm).  To avert flood-related casualties, the WBD has opened all 44 sluice gates of the Teesta barrage. Local representatives say that due to rising water levels, 8,000 families in the low-lying and char areas of Dimla upazila are flood affected.   Hatibandha and Kaliganj upazila of Lalmonirhat are also at risk of flooding as the rising waters may soon overwhelm low-lying and char areas there."

Sources said, around eight thousand residents are living in a water-logged state. Also roads, markets, schools, and madrasas have partially submerged in flood water, and communication is disrupted. The flooded villages are: Dalapur, Hazipur, Adarshapara, Shanti-nagar, Keramatganj, Mohammadpur, Bhodropara Sharifpara, and Sheikhpara. Locals informed that they have lost their crops along with their livestock, and their fish were taken by the sea, due to the high rise of tidal water.

The disaster simulation workshop was jointly organized by the Bangladesh Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), and the United Nations Global Logistics Cluster, according to a press release issued by WFP on Thursday. The purpose of the workshop was to place humanitarian workers in a real-life scenario.  By examining supply chain operations in emergencies, including bottlenecks and gaps, participants gained a better understanding of how disasters like earthquakes could impact relief operations. Participants also acquired knowledge onhow best to mitigate this impact, the statement said. State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Md Enamur Rahman said: \"While cyclones, floods and landslides may pose a greater risk to Bangladesh, we must learn from the 2015 earthquake in Nepal and the level of loss felt by Kathmandu, and be prepared for the unexpected.\" Also Reda- State minister: Bangladesh will be an earthquake resilient country  During the workshop, participants were asked to design, fine-tune and present responses for reducing the impact of a future urban earthquake.  According to the press release, each team's operational plan was evaluated by a panel of government officials who oversee and coordinate the country's emergency response. \"Today, the frequency of disasters has increased globally, making emergency preparedness and disaster management one of the most pressing issues worldwide,\" Country Director of WFP Bangladesh Richard Ragan said.  \"I am pleased to see emergency logistics stakeholders from various humanitarian, government, academic and private sector groups come together to participate in this much-needed logistics and supply-chain simulation exercise,\" he added. Bangladesh sits on a three-way junction of major tectonic plates, atop the world's largest river delta and close to sea level.  This makes it vulnerable to natural hazards such as earthquake, flooding and tsunamis. The capital city of Dhaka, one of the most densely populated cities in the world, is particularly vulnerable. An earthquake here could lead to significant damage to infrastructure and a high number of casualties. The complexity of search-and-rescue efforts in a city like this poses further challenges. Therefore, preparednessis key, the statement added."

Both of the rivers were flowing above the danger level on Saturday, inundating Armypara, Islampur and Bus station areas under Sadar upazila, and other low-lying areas of Lama, Alikadam, Ruma, Thanchi and Rowangchhari upazilas. Houses have collapsed and croplands destroyed due to the severe flood, causing immense suffering to the residents of the hilly region. Their daily activities have virtually come to a standstill.  The flood has also snapped road communications of Bandarban with other parts of the country for the last five days. Due to the lack of connection with the rest of the country, prices of commodities have risen.  Bandarban Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Daudul Islam said 450 tonnes of food grains have been allocated for the flood-affected people. Meanwhile, the district authorities have opened 131 shelters and formed special teams to provide health services to the people. Different organizations - including the municipality authorities and the upazila administration - are providing food at the shelters. Bandarban municipality Mayor, Islam Baby, said they are providing meals to 3,000 people twice a day. "

The Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) officials said farmers have already completed harvesting Aush rice crop on 43,645 hectares of land producing over 1.37-lakh tonnes of clean rice (2.06-lakh tonnes of paddy) in the region. Before floods in July last, farmers cultivated Aush rice on 55,530 hectares of land, higher by 755 hectares than the fixed farming target on 54,775 heaters of land to produce 1.54-lakh tonnes of clean rice (2.34-lakh tonnes of paddy) in the region. \"Last year, farmers produced 1.23-lakh tonnes of Aush rice from 40,618 hectares of land against the fixed production target of 68,969 tonnes from 26,159 heaters,\" Horticulture Specialist of the DAE at its regional office Khondker Md. Mesbahul Islam said. Despite causing production loss of 28,665 tonnes of Aush rice worth Taka 59.30 crore on 7,754 hectares of land by recent floods, farmers are harvesting the remaining Aush rice crop on 47,776 hectares of land this season in the region. \"After harvesting on 43,645 hectares of land so far, farmers are continuing harvesting Aush rice on reaming more 4,131 hectares of land now,\" Islam said. After completion of Aush rice harvest soon in the region, the total Aush rice output might be around 1.49-lakh tonnes of clean rice this season, higher by 26,000 tonnes of Aush rice than last year. Talking to BSS, Deputy Director of DAE for Rangpur region M Moniruzzaman said farmers exceeded the fixed Aush rice cultivation target this time following various realistic programs taken by the government.  The programs include distribution of special intensives, providing technical support to farmers and conducting motivational campaigns. Under the programs, the government distributed special incentives in terms of Aus rice seed and fertilisers worth Taka 5.75 crore among 34,029 small and marginal farmers of all five districts in Rangpur agriculture region this season. \"Each of the beneficiary farmers got 5 kg high yielding variety Aush rice seed, 15 kg Di-ammonium phosphate and 10 kg Murrieta of Potash fertilisers free of costs to cultivate Aush rice on one bigha of land,\" he said. Additional Director of DAE for Rangpur region Muhammad Ali said the profitable Aush rice cultivation regained popularity among farmers in last ten years as a result of special steps taken by the present government. \"The farmer are reaping more profits through cultivation of Aush rice at lower costs using unused seasonal rain water during May, June and July as an additional crop on the lands those remain fallow during the off season,\" Ali said. \"After harvesting Aush rice by August, farmers can easily cultivate T-Aman rice on the same land to further increase rice production for attaining sustainable national food security,\" Ali added. Talking to BSS, local farmers Hossain Ali and Mofizar Rahman said they had already harvested their Aush rice crop and got excellent yield rate of 3.15 tonnes of clean rice per hectare of land on an average this season. They also expressed satisfaction over the current excellent market price between Taka 650 and 750 per mound (every 40 kilogram) of the newly harvested Aus paddy in local markets."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-06 00:00:00      \nLocals blamed the floods, which had swept away a 60-metre embankment near the Jamuna River A large number of cattle, of different breeds, was found to be up for sale at a makeshift cattle market at Alampur Chowrasta Bazar area of Kazipur upazila in Sirajganj, ahead of Eid-ul-Azha coming up next week. However, the absence of buyers in comparison to the scores of sellers indicated that the flood situation had adversely affected sales so far. Locals blamed the floods, which had swept away a 60-metre embankment near the Jamuna River. This led to the flooding of the adjacent village of Meghai, and had also flooded the roads between Sirajganj and villages such as Meghai, Paikartali and Kunkunia. The floods had also affected the livestock and cattle in these villages, while their stock of food, such as hay, was also disrupted. In spite of all these problems, the owners have taken good care of their livestock and cattle, in hopes of selling them just before Eid. Locals also said that, many of those who were able to buy cattle last year may not be able to afford doing so this year, thus different people may buy one animal between them and share the same. This is due to the fact that floods have severely affected their livelihoods, and many people are finding it difficult to make ends meet. Rehana Khatun, a victim of the floods at Meghai village, said her husband was not able to find work ahead of Eid, while the floods have also swept away whatever resources they had. \"It will be difficult even to purchase one sacrificial animal in partnership with others,\" she lamented.  Masud Rana, a seller at the makeshift cattle market at Alampur Chowrasta Bazar, had brought his only medium-sized cow in hopes of fetching a good price. \"The lack of buyers is really disheartening,\" he said, \"I am not sure if I will be able to sell the cow at a good price.\" Shahidul Islam, a resident at Alampur Chowrasta Bazar area, said buyers usually start flocking after 3pm, but the prices do not match their expectations, so most of them leave without purchasing any animal. Bangladesh has a total stock of 11.18 million cows, buffaloes, goats, and sheep \"ready for Eid slaughtering\" this year; slightly up from the previous year. In addition to maintaining the stock of animals ready for sacrifice during Eid, preparations have also been taken to supply healthy goats, sheep, buffaloes, and cattle in markets for Eid-ul-Azha. 4.58 million cows and buffaloes, 7.20 million goats and sheep, and a large number of other sacrificial animals will be available this year to be slaughtered, the Department of Livestock . This figure was confirmed by the Department of Livestock Services (DLS)   at a recent meeting.. Earlier,an annual number of 2.4 to 2.5 million Indian cows were known to enter Bangladesh illegally; however, only 92,000 cows  entered Bangladesh in 2018."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-05 00:00:00      \nHow Dhaka's drainage and natural hydrology can be improved Dhaka is known for water-logging and drainage congestion, losing its past glory of natural khals and wetlands full of fresh water. Wetlands in Dhaka are divided into two categories: Water bodies and lowlands -- which comprises of surrounding rivers, lakes, ponds, khals, and low-lying areas. The surface water area of Dhaka Central Region is about 13% of the total land area. Our drainage has two aspects: Flood protection and storm-water discharge, which are interrelated. The capital's water resources are threatened by both human activity as well as natural causes. Climate change is affecting our city, in particular, in three ways: Increased frequency of floods, drainage congestion, and heat stress. Because of its geographic location, Dhaka suffers from river floods annually. The city also suffers from frequent storm water flooding. The illegal encroachment of rivers, water bodies, lands filling, and indiscriminate dumping of domestic and industrial waste into rivers and canals are accelerating the drainage congestion. As a result, Dhaka faces severe storm water flooding during heavy rainfall. The city corporations and the institutions empowered with various planning and management responsibilities have been nothing but feeble in taking appropriate approaches to tackle these issues. The local surface water hydrology around Dhaka is complex -- the Dhaleswari River, a tributary of the Jamuna River, flows by the south-eastern part of the North Central Region of Bangladesh, close to the confluence of the Padma River and Upper Meghna River. The Lakhya River joins Dhaleswari at 11km downstream of the Buriganga confluence. About 5km below the Dhaleswari-Lakhya confluence, the Dhaleswari meets the Meghna River, which in turn flows into the Padma River, a further 20km downstream. All of this results with the city's drainage system being under the influence of backwater effects from surrounding rivers. The city has been experiencing a gradual increase in water-logging over the last decade, of course. Moderate-to-heavy rain causes serious drainage problems in many parts of the. The process of rapid urbanization is not focusing enough on adequate drainage facilities, which causes water-logging and temporary inundation in parts of Dhaka for several days during monsoon. This has brought the reality that, during the monsoon, the city's drainage depends very much on the water levels of the peripheral river system. The situation worsens when monsoon runoff, generated due to continuous rainfall, coincides with high water level in the river systems. Encroachment of surface water bodies can aggravate the risk of water-logging; micro-drainage system cannot carry out the load and they are not being upgraded, maintained, and managed on a regular basis; and poor, partial, and overloaded sanitation can pose serious health hazard to the dwellers during water-logging particularly in the low lying areas. Needless to say, flood prevention is necessary to avoid damage to property and life.  Over last few decades, development in the flood flow areas within Rajuk jurisdiction has been going on despite planning and legal restrictions. But poor monitoring and lack of enforcement of plans and legal powers have so far failed to put a dent on most of these activities. Once a restricted low land is filled up and inhabited it is almost impossible to reverse the situation from practical point of view. Such activities promote development in these areas but they have adverse impacts in the long run. The authority should build a conservation zone which especially includes flood flow and water retention area that must be preserved for maintaining a sustainable environment of the Dhaka Metropolitan Region. The city authority should adopt legal measures and innovation of economic use to preserve retention ponds. All development in the eastern fringe areas should safeguard the retention pond areas and khals; all private housings within the eastern fringe areas should incorporate flood water management and higher level (Structure Plan and Detailed Area Plan) road proposals.  Policies on drainage and hydrology were provided in the Dhaka Structure Plan in 1995, where policies were set on flood control, flood flow zone, and drainage. A structure plan was followed by Detailed Area Plans (2010) where more detailed proposals were made based on the policy framework of the structure plan. DWASA has been preparing detailed and comprehensive Storm Water Drainage Master Plan for an efficient drainage network for greater Dhaka City, which will be treated as a basic document for storm-water/manmade drainage network plan for DAP, 2016-2035. The important point to note here is to ensure the proper and timely implementation of these policies and plans. Moreover, it is imperative that we develop a comprehensive Watershed/Water Resources Management Action Plan that would account for the impacts of climate change and adaptation measures conforming to future urban development plans.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-18 00:00:00      \nAre we ready for summertime cyclones, storms, and tornadoes? Bangladesh has a long history of natural hazards in summer. The main hazards include tornadoes, Nor'wester, flash floods, and cyclones. These disasters lead to the loss of lives, livelihoods, assets, and properties.     Tornadoes mainly occur in the pre-monsoon (March-May), and post-monsoon (October-November) periods. They form suddenly, are of brief duration, and are extremely localized in nature. It is the pre-monsoon period when most of the abnormal rainfall or droughts occur in different parts of Bangladesh. A tornado occurred in Manikganj on April 26, 1989. It was the deadliest tornado in Bangladesh's history. It killed around 1,300 people. In addition there are severe local seasonal storms, popularly known as Nor'westers (Kalboishakhi). These storms are generally associated with tornadoes. Wind-speeds in Nor'westers usually range from 113km/h to 130km/h, though often their speeds exceed 162km/h.  Since 1971, Bangladesh has experienced several major tornadoes, which have killed an average of more than 100 people in each event, and caused severe damage in their narrow paths.  Cyclones and storm surges  Tropical cyclones from the Bay of Bengal accompanied by storm surges are one of the major disasters in Bangladesh. They occur mainly in April/May and October/November. The country is one of the worst sufferers of all cyclonic casualties in the world.  Cyclones and storm surges are a continuous threat for the coastal population. The average annual frequency of tropical disturbances in the Bay of Bengal is between 12 and 13, of which five attain the cyclonic strength. Most of these cyclones strike land on the Bangladesh coast or the coast of Myanmar and India. On April 29, 1991, a powerful cyclone struck the coastal area of Bangladesh with winds of around 250 km/h. The storm killed at least 138,000 people, and left as many as 10 million homeless.  The cyclonic storm \"Aila\" hit Khulna division on May 25, 2009, killing approximately 190 in Bangladesh. Hundreds of thousands of homes were washed away when wind-driven tidal surges of up to three metres destroyed the coastal belt of Khulna region. The country has experienced an increased frequency of flash floods in the recent years. Flash floods mainly occur in haor areas of the north-eastern part of the country during the period of late March to May. These floods cause quick damage to crops and property, and are followed by relatively rapid recession. Untimely flash floods can cause people to lose their harvest. The following points have been placed by relevant authorities for further improving the emergency and disaster risk reduction performances.  Emergency management  The key tasks for effective emergency management are mentioned below. Readiness for a rapid response includes measures that need to be taken before a disaster event in order to minimize the loss of life and interference to critical services. It also includes the formulation of workable hazard-specific emergency plans, the development of warning systems, the maintenance of inventories, and the training of workforce. It may also include search-and-rescue measures and evacuation plans for communities at risk. Prior to any emergency situation, the contingency plan provides the basis for identifying and further developing response capacity. The contingency plan is the basis of readiness and cover. It includes:  1. Analysis of the context, risk mapping, and identification of likely emergency scenarios.  2. Mapping of capacity, vulnerabilities, constraints, resources, and tangible/intangible assets. 3. Identification of other external organizations' capacity, constraints, and resources in the department, ministry, area, country, or region.    Reduction of risks It is expected that responsible authorities will act appropriately for reducing the disaster risks in line with the disaster management vision of the government of Bangladesh.  The vision is to reduce the risks faced by people, especially the poor and the disadvantaged, from the effects of natural, environmental, and human-induced hazards and to have in place an efficient emergency response system capable of handling large-scale disasters. The major areas of interventions for reducing summer disaster could include the following. Mainstreaming disaster risk reduction in existing development works and future initiatives of different government departments and non-government organizations (NGOs) of the country is very important. Authorities concerned should develop a disaster database to carry out detailed studies and planning.  The government and NGOs need to redesign their development programs to ensure the active participation of the most vulnerable communities. Disaster mitigation potential needs to be maximized, and traditional community coping practices need to be incorporated. Some targeted but tested disaster risk reduction activities could be carried out in consultation with communities at risk, and with relevant organizations. Appropriate feasibility and cost benefit analysis of independent authorities are needed for taking any structural protection initiatives. A public hearing and consultation is important in this regard.  The respective authorities at different levels should strengthen capacity-building initiatives of the local government and communities at risk. A well-organized and coordinated effort is needed to further strengthen local level planning. Proper resources from central government and others should be ensured by authorities and policy-makers. Bangladesh is good at forecasting cyclones and river floods. However, there are a lot of gaps and limitations in forecasting flash floods and tornadoes.  Our flood and flash flood warning information will not be at the desired level without the establishment of a strong regional data-sharing and cooperation framework.  A tornado forecasting system is needed, because tornadoes generate on the land and provide little time for early warning and forecasting. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department needs to play a significant role in this initiative. Reducing the disaster risks of the summer season is imperative to protecting lives, livelihoods, and properties in Bangladesh.

Authorities said the deaths occurred largely due to electrocutions caused by ill-maintained power lines even as large segments of the city suffered hours-long outages that lasted up to a day in some areas. According to the Edhi Foundation -- which oversees a vast rescue services operation in Karachi -- up to 15 people were killed during the recent bout of flooding.  12 killed as flooding paralyses Pakistani city of Karachi https://t.co/BmufW6HdIM However government hospitals in the city said only 12 people had died in recent days in flood-related incidents. Outrage simmered in the city after a video went viral on social media showing two children who had been allegedly electrocuted by a power line that had fallen into a puddle. \"The electricity company must be held responsible for the children's death as safety and security is its responsibility,\" said Faisal Edhi, who heads the Edhi Foundation.  Dr Seemi Jamali -- director of the state-run Jinnah Postgraduate Medical University -- confirmed that nine people were \"brought dead\" to the hospital because of electrocutions. At least 12 people were killed as monsoon rains lashed #Pakistan's port city of #Karachi. https://t.co/wCf0nvnxCv Another three bodies, including the children from the video shared online, were taken to the city's Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, a doctor on duty at the facility confirmed to AFP. The megacity of some 20 million has been inundated with heavy rains since Monday, flooding residential areas and bringing large swathes of Karachi's perennially traffic-congested streets to a halt. \"We are living without electricity and water for the past three days and no official rescue came,\" said 24-year-old resident Qaiser Khan. Hundreds have been killed across South Asia this monsoon season and tens of thousands displaced by the heavy rains.  While the annual rains are crucial to replenishing water supplies in the impoverished region, they often turn deadly."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-24 00:00:00      \nThe fund will help 300 million smallholder farmers adapt to the impacts of climate change A coalition of donors, aid institutions and philanthropy promised yesterday to invest more than US $650 million to help 300 million smallholder farmers in developing countries including those in Bangladesh adapt to the impacts of climate change. This big investment pledge came at a time when climate change is already eroding crop and livestock production in places like South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The investments from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the European Commission, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany are part of a broader commitment of more than US $790 million to address the impact of climate change on food and agriculture.  The announcement came yesterday at the United Nations Climate Action Summit as a response to a call to action from the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) urging world leaders to mount a massive effort to adapt to conditions that are now inevitable. The GCA is co-chaired by Bill Gates, former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva. The funding will be funneled through CGIAR (formerly known as consultative group for international agricultural research), which has long been working for the benefits of smallholders across regions including South Asia and Bangladesh.     CGIAR is a global research partnership dedicated to reducing poverty, enhancing food and nutrition security, and improving natural resources for smallholder farmers in the developing world. Investments in CGIAR have proven to be highly cost-effective, generating returns upto $17 for every $1 invested, with significant economic benefits for producers and consumers.  CGIAR's 15 research centers are working as a single unit under its flagship 'Two Degree Initiative for Food and Agriculture'. This 'Two Degree' effort is helping small-scale food producers across the globe adapt their farming systems, livelihoods, and landscapes to weather extremes and embrace production practices that lower emissions. CGIAR's research mandates include readying climate change ready-rice - for instance - new \"scuba rice\" varieties that survive under water for up to 17 days and potentially benefit 18 million farming households and save millions more from hunger.    During floods, farmers in Bangladesh and India lose up to 4 million tons of rice per year--enough to feed 30 million people. Submergence can affect rice crops at any stage of growth, either short-term (flash floods) or long-term (stagnant flooding). The chances of survival are extremely low when completely submerged during the crop's vegetative stage.  Improved varieties incorporated with the SUB1 gene (that withstand flood situation) have shown a yield advantage of 1-3 tons following flooding for 10-15 days. Flood-tolerant varieties that have been released and are now being planted include Swarna Sub1 in India, Samba Mahsuri in Bangladesh, and IR64-Sub1 in the Philippines. CGIAR experts are also developing solar-powered irrigation pumps for large-scale distribution in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The pumps are to be deployed alongside advanced information systems to ensure they can help farmers sustainably adapt to increasingly unreliable rains, but without stressing available water resources. The move comes at a time when government in Bangladesh just charted out a roadmap envisaging plan to replace a third of the countries over 1.3 million diesel-run irrigation pumps by solar pumps.  Elwyn Grainger-Jones, Executive Director of the CGIAR System Organization said: \"The new investments announced today (yesterday) are a recognition that we have just 11 growing seasons between now and 2030 and farmers need a host of new innovations to overcome a growing array of climate threats. This new funding is an important start towards a global effort to substantially increase support for CGIAR activities.\" The investment pledged include, among others: $310 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, $150 million from the World Bank, $110 million from the Netherlands, $100 million from the United Kingdom, $33 million from Switzerland, $35 million from the European Commission, and $16 million from Sweden.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-22 00:00:00      \n'Extreme climatic events such as drought and flashfloods cause severe agricultural losses' A United Nations (UN)report mentioning that climate change threatens child nutrition said that over 19 million children -- a quarter of them under 5 -- spread across Bangladesh are at the front line of climate change disasters. The report says 58.7 million children under 5 were stunted and almost 25.9 million were wasted in South Asia in 2018, adding that more children and young people are surviving, but far too few are thriving, reports UNB. The government of Bangladesh will begin the second phase of its 'Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan' this year, placing greater emphasis on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable, according to the UN report. The plan will be demanding more attention and resources to ensure that child nutrition, health, education, social protection, and other services are shielded from the effects of climate change. Floods and riverbank erosion are driving families to city slums, where they face overcrowding and a lack of access to adequate health and nutrition services, adequate nutritious food, especially during the first 1,000 days, education, sanitation, hygiene and safe water, according to the Unicef report titled: \"The State of the World's Children (SOWC) 2019: Children, food and nutrition - Growing well in a changing world.\"Villagers look on as a part of an embankment is being washed away by the flood water in Gaibandha |Dhaka Tribune In slums, children must often fend for themselves and are at greater risk of malnutrition, child labour, child marriage, and exposure to pollution, violence and abuse, according to the South Asia section of the global report. Extreme climatic events, such as drought and flash floods, cause severe agricultural losses, it says. In a country where 60 percent of the population counts on agriculture for their livelihood, this means children from the poorest families are most likely to go hungry, according to the report. The reduced production also leads to an increase in food prices, hitting the poorest families the hardest. A rise in communicable and non-communicable diseases, linked to changing climate conditions and unplanned urbanization, also threatens children and their families, Unicef said. These diseases include diarrhea, hepatitis A, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, dengue and chikungunya fever. Ruma, her husband Ali Akbar, and their two children Sunjida, 3, and Shahaun, 9, moved to the Chalantika Slum of Dhaka after their home was repeated flooded by the Meghna River, the report mentioned.  \"At least we can stand on dry ground here even if we struggle with the cost of living,\" she said. \"My husband earns about Tk 7,000 [US$83] a month. By the time we've paid our rent and bought our groceries, there is very little left over. But at least we're able to earn here, which we often weren't able to do when we lived in the village.\" Ruma shares a small kitchen - a few planks of wood atop bamboo poles set in a swamp - with at least 10 other families. While they initially used butane gas, this proved impossible to share equitably. Wood is now preferred, further worsening the slum's air quality. People walking in knee-deep water as flash floods and rainfall inundated low-lying areas in Sunamganj |Dhaka Tribune Her family eats rice and lentils most days, she says, and can occasionally afford meat or fish. Her son, Shahaun, is showing signs of malnourishment. In addition to the arduous challenge of trying to provide her family with healthy food, Ruma describes an unhealthy environment with no access to safe water, basic toilets or adequate hygiene. Electricity in the slum is irregular, and rodents and insects in their single room \"make our lives an absolute misery,\" she says. It is 20 years since the State of the World's Children last examined children's nutrition, and, in that time, much has changed. Unicef's flagship report examines the issue of children, food and nutrition, providing a fresh perspective on a rapidly evolving challenge. Despite progress in the past two decades, one-third of children under age 5 are malnourished - stunted, wasted, or overweight - while two-thirds are at risk of malnutrition and hidden hunger, because of the poor quality of their diets. At the centre of this challenge is a broken food system that fails to provide children with the diet they need to grow healthy. This report also provided new data and analyses of malnutrition in the 21st century and outlines recommendations to put children's rights at the heart of food systems."

In a report on Friday, The News International said an an official of Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) confirmed that Bangladesh's Tasho Enterprise finalized deals with a Karachi-based Roshan Enterprise in this regard. \"At least 12 containers of onions are being exported to Bangladesh,\" the official told the daily.  Earlier, India slapped a ban on exports of onion to Bangladesh due to its local shortage amid floods, causing a surge in prices to new heights in Bangladesh, as the market was heavily dependent on Indian supply. According to the Pakistani newspaper, the official said Bangladesh is also looking for import options from countries like Turkey, Myanmar, and Egypt to meet the demand in the local market.  The official also said the onion trade was also agreed in government-to-government level talks.  \"This (ban) has created market potential for Pakistan.\"  An exporter believes the export price would be much more viable for Bangladesh considering the current onion price in the market. \"The shipment value from Pakistan would be around $600 a ton,\" Waheed Ahmed, patron-in-chief of All Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exporters, Importers and Merchant Association, said. He said one container carries approximately 28 tons. A TDAP official said Bangladesh is also considering import of dates, grey fabric, and yarn from Pakistani companies. The News International also reports, a government department said trade diplomacy between the two countries generally remained stalled between 2001 and 2006. \"For instance, holding of the Joint Economic Commission (JEC) between Pakistan and Bangladesh is long overdue,\" the commercial wing of Pakistan's High Commission in Dhaka said in a report. The last JEC meeting was held in 2005 in Bangladesh. Moreover, most of the trade diplomacy and major bilateral agreements were made during the previous governments."

Humayun answered the question in the absence of Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi.  He said the onion market got overheated due to a supply shortfall caused by India's export ban following flashfloods in the neighbouring country. \"But we have brought the situation under control quickly. We are importing onions from Myanmar and Turkey,\" the minister added. The industries minister said it is a lean season for onions and a crisis usually prevails at this time of the year. \"Our local onions are yet to hit the market. However, they will be available within a few days.\" He also mentioned that the import of onions from India has started again.  The Industries minister added that the government is conducting mobile courts at district and upazila levels to prevent the sale of onions at exorbitant prices.  The Directorate of Consumer Rights Protection and other government agencies are monitoring markets across the country. Replying to a written question from Awami League MP Anwar Khan (Laxmipur 1), he said the annual demand for onions in the country is 2.4m metric tons (MT) against a local production of 23.3m MT. \"Of the produced amount, 30% is damaged during harvesting and improper preservation. That means the total amount stands at 16.31m MT. This deficit is met with imports from India,\" Humayun continued. He said, the onion market suffered seriously due to floods in Maharashtra, India. For that, Indian export prices were raised to US $850 from $250-300. \"Later, they stopped onion exports as prices shot up abnormally. As a result, prices in Bangladesh also saw an upward trend.\" To cool down the market, the minister said, the government has started selling onions in the open market through the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB)."

They are rushing to nearby cattle markets ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, but are having to sell their dairy assets off at outrageously low prices to cattle traders. This has been due to the devastation left by the floods, as it has also damaged stacks of hays across the district. It led to a shortage of food for the livestock, which is being sold at higher than given price. According to the district's livestock office sources, 4,417 tons of grass has been damaged by the floods over the last two weeks, which is considered to be worth Tk1.42 crore, while 1,320 metric tons of hay has also been damaged. This has put the farmers of Sundarganj, Saghata, Fulchhari, Gobindganj, and Sadar Upazila in jeopardy, as their 72,777 cows, 102 buffaloes, 32,583 goats, and 16,240 lambs now face an acute crisis of food supply. Upon inspecting the Char areas, it was found that several flood victims are living on whatever piece of dry land they have, along with their livestock, all are waiting for buyers to sell them off. In Fulchhari's Balasighat, it was found that several cattle, which were being fattened ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, are deteriorating in health due to lack of food. This has forced their owners to find buyers, and sell them off cheap.  Goats are comparatively more at risk, as the floods are carrying waterborne diseases, which are affecting them quicker than humans, often resulting in deaths. Abdur Rafiq, a resident of Fulchhari's Bhasharpara village, said the hay which he had stored in his courtyard was submerged in water, rendering it unusable as food for his cows. He is now rushing to sell his two cows, and two goats as soon as possible, before they perish. Aminul Miah, a resident of neighbouring Sidhai village, had purchased a calf a year ago for Tk30,000, in hopes of selling it this Eid for a hefty price. But the floods have dashed those hopes, as he is forced to sell it off at whatever price it fetches. Md Faruk Hossain, a lessor of a cattle market in Ratanpur village, said the market has not become as vibrant as expected, due to the floods. But a lot of villagers are swarming in to sell off their livestock, he added. Dr Abdus Samad, Gaibandha livestock officer, said 175 livestock in 17 dairy farms were affected because of the recent floods, with two cows, worth Tk12.60 lakh, reported dead. He said Tk4 lakh has been sent as relief fund from the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, but it is very little compared to the incurred damage."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-30 00:00:00      \nFarmers fear that they will face great losses if the situation persists A Meghna-Dhonagoda irrigation project dyke--a reservoir of water to irrigate rice fields, in Matlab South upazila of Chandpur--has collapsed, flooding nearby rice fields.  Since the collapse of the embankment near Paschim Baishpur union mosque, on Monday afternoon, water has been rapidly pouring into rice fields.  Due to this, many farmers fear that they will incur immense losses, and they are dreading that if the situation persists, around three acres of farmland might become submerged in water. Locals said a large portion of the U1 irrigation dyke--on the east side of the dyke's 6th turnout--collapsed. There embankment began leaking a few days ago, when the canal was full of water. The locals also alleged that they had not seen any officials from the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) take action to repair the leak, which is why the dyke collapsed. They claimed they are in danger of losing their properties and houses-- including their farmland--due to the collapse. As this is the season where the fields will be filled with ripe rice paddies, they will be harmed by this rush of water inflow. However, the upper paddy fields will need water in 10-15days, so if the water reserve dam is not repaired the farmers will face immense losses. An affected farmer, Khokon Mal, 30, from Paschim Baishpur, said: \"About 60% of ripe rice paddies were damaged. When I called the lineman Zahirul Islam of the dyke for that area, he did not appear.\" Another farmer of the area, Nazrul Islam alias Babu, said there was good yield this season, from two of his paddy fields. However, most of the paddies were destroyed when the dyke burst.  Farmer Tofazzel Hossain, 55, said: \"There is excessive water in the dyke, which the rice fields do not need; therefore the dyke broke due to the pressure.\" The Ichhamati Water Management Association--a committee formed by six water management groups--General Secretary and Senior Awami League Vice-President of West Fatehpur Union unit, Khwaja Ahmed, said: \"I arranged the shutdown of the irrigation pump machine after the dam broke. When BWDB Executive Engineer Zakir Hossain and Deputy Assistant Engineer (SO) Salauddin Ahmed were called several times, they did not answer.\" Deputy Assistant Engineer of the Management and Maintenance department in the Meghna-Dhonagoda project, Jamal Hossain, told Dhaka Tribune that this matter was not under his authority. This area is under the authority of our Deputy Assistant Engineer Salauddin.  He said: \"All of us arrived at the spot after getting the news. Water is still entering along the broken portion of the dyke -- a crack around seven-to-eight kilometres-long. We are working on it, and hope that the process of repairing the dyke will be completed in a week. He further said: \"There is no farmland in this area, mostly houses. There is no more crop land, so there was not much harm done. \"Within two days, we hope to remove the excess water from farmland. If that does not work, then we will take other measures. However, this will bring no harm to rice paddies,\" he claimed. Matlab North Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Sharmin Akhter told Dhaka Tribune: \"I arrived at the spot immediately after hearing the news. The repair work will commence at night, therefore, I will be here until the work begins.\" She said: \"Keeping in mind about the possible damage to crops, we are making all out efforts for the repairs.\""

      "authors": "Saqib Sarker",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-19 00:00:00      \nEnvironmental scientist Jonathan Gilligan talks to Climate Tribune Sea level rise is a concern in all coastal regions in the world. Bangladesh happens to be among the most vulnerable areas. But for all the talk about how vulnerable the country is, the river laden land has evolved to create mechanisms that naturally counter sea level rise. Environmental scientist Jonathan Gilligan says this aspect is often not understood.  This is not to say there is no risk from human induced sea level rise and all the commotion about part of the country submerging underwater deserves less attention. But the geographical area known as Bangladesh has for centuries acted as the big basin that paves the way for the mighty Brahmaputra and Ganges to unite with the sea at the Bay of Bengal. The land has learned how to survive rise of water.  It does so through the fascinating natural mechanism of depositing sediment. That is how it has managed to stay above water for thousands and thousands of years, said Prof Gilligan. But this might change quite soon. An associate professor at Vanderbilt University in the United States, Gilligan studies the interactions between human society and the environment.  His work requires an interdisciplinary approach, and as a result he often works with teams that have social scientists, natural scientists and engineers. The interdisciplinary approach is necessary to understand how the actions of communities affect environment around them and how the changing environment - that is changed both by the actions of the community and also actions from the outside like climate change then affect the livelihood of the community.  \"And by trying to understand the two together, we can then understand better how the environmental change will affect the community and how the community might adapt,\" he said.  Gilligan, who worked in Sri Lanka on how paddy farmers are affected by water scarcity, has carried out a lot of research work in the southwest coastal areas of Bangladesh. \"Climate change has a lot of effects on the ground. My focus primarily is on how the coastal communities are affected by increased flood hazards due to subsidence of the land combined with sea level rise and also how increasing salinity is affecting community,\" he said.  To understand the effects of sea level rise Gilligan looks at how the communities are using their land, how the polders are affecting the changing rivers and how they are affecting the land inside the polder. \"My group is currently studying how the erosion of the river banks and the formation of 'ghashland' is going to affect communities. And how climate change interacts with all the activities along the river; and the combination of the land use and the communities with the sea level rise. You need to understand the combination to understand the effect on the communities.\" Gilligan says the impacts of climate change and sea level rise is going to be very visible in the next 20 to 30 years and they will become increasingly severe through the rest of this century, because the sea level rise is speeding up.  \"But what often doesn't get understood is there's also a tremendous natural resource that Bangladesh has and this is the sediment that is carried in the rivers. Over the last several thousand years there has been natural sea level rise, which is not as severe as the human sea level rise.\" \"But with the natural sea level rise the land has risen at the same rate as the sea level rise, because there is a natural balance between the sea level rise and the sediment that comes  with the rivers and deposit on the land,\" he said.  This will allow Bangladesh to survive natural sea level rise as it has for millenia.  And if the sea level rise does not exceed a certain level the land will simply rise at the same rate as the sea.   \"But if the sea level rise become too rapid or something stops the sediments coming in the river, either of those would mean sea level rise would become much more severe,\" said Gilligan. With the Polar ice melting at unprecedented rates, the worse case scenario is not out of the picture. In fact, as scientists estimate, it is imminent.  \"Some lands can be rescued from the sea level rise, because there's enough sediment to build up the land by several milimetres  per year. The question is how the rivers and the land and the polders are managed to try to get the maximum benefit from that sediment, to raise the land up as much as possible, so that the sea level rise does not drown too much.\" Gilligan is currently studying how the changes from human contribution are affecting migration.  \"There will be migration from places where the rise is too rapid. But migration does not happen just because of environmental stresses. It happens for economic reasons. What becomes very important to understand is that migration can be a valuable response to climate change. But it can also bring economic opportunities to pull people out of poverty,\" he said.  Bangladeshi people have traditionally employed many mechanisms to cope with the natural floods that occur regularly in the delta. Embankments are one of the methods that have been used for many years. A previous study by Gilligan found that embankments across the coastal plain of Bangladesh for preventing tidal inundation of the landscape also caused disruption in sediment flow.  While these embankments were necessary for rice cultivation and to prevent food shortages in Bangladesh, these also cut off Bangladeshi lands from their riverine sediment supply. Consequently, most lands today have subsided far below mean high water levels, making them increasingly susceptible to severe flooding from waterlogging and the impacts of storm surges. The study, where Gilligan was one of the researching scientists, found that embankments constructed since the 1960s are the main reason for lower land elevations along coastal areas in Bangladesh. Within this area, some are experiencing more than twice the rate of the most worrisome sea-level rise projections from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Disruption to sediment transfer is also likely to happen from river diversion projects by India. The Farakka Barrage has caused significant political tension since the 90s between Bangladesh and its big neighbour. But Farakka actually does not stop sediment flow to any significant level, Gilligan said.  \"The Farakka Barrage has been very controversial. The research by some of my colleagues who I work closely with, they are geologists - that research is suggesting that Farakka Barrage has not been significantly affecting the sediment transport,\" said Gilligan.  However, this will not be the case if India implements its other river diversion projects. \"If India implements the big river diversion project that is being considered, that could have very serious impact. That could divert a lot of sediment out of the river. An it could cause harm to Bangladesh,\" he said.  Jonathan Gilligan is currently developing models to study how the diversion of sediment could affect the adaptive capacity of sea level rise within Bangladesh. "

Some residents have already been evacuated after days of monsoon rains lashed the region around the coastal city of Townsville in north Queensland, a spokesman for the Bureau of Meteorology said. Adam Blazak, a forecaster with the bureau, did not say how many people had been evacuated, but added that some areas had reached \"major\" flood levels. \"Normally a monsoonal burst might last a few days, but this one's been going on over a week now and is set to continue for a few more days as well,\" he said. Between 150mm and200 mm of rain is expected across Townsville on Saturday - equal to about a month's average rainfall. Local authorities issued a number of flood warnings on Saturday morning and told residents to avoid using roads and consider moving to higher ground if conditions worsen.  North Queensland has significant zinc reserves as well as major deposits of silver, lead, copper and iron ore, with Townsville a major processing centre for the region's base metals. In stark contrast, wildfires in the southern island state of Tasmania have burnt through close to 190,000 hectares of land, fire officials said. Chris Arnold, the chief officer of the Tasmania Fire Service, said on Saturday that nearly 600 personnel were working to contain the fires, some of which have been burning for weeks and have destroyed homes. Arnold told reporters that while the last few days have seen favourable conditions for battling the blazes, communities in part of the state were still under threat as expected hot and dry weather on Sunday could see bushfires escalate again. Australia endured its hottest month on record in January, with sweltering conditions expected to persist through April. That scorching weather triggered power outages in some areas and sent electricity prices soaring."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-27 00:00:00      \nIt receives Cabinet Division letter amidst farmers' woes over low paddy prices There seems to be no end in sight to the woes of farmers over low paddy prices. Neither the government nor traders and millers have gone for any big purchase drives.  Though the government has fixed a Tk1,040 support price for each maund (40 kgs) of paddy, farmers across the rice-growing zones in the country are still reporting market prices as low as Tk600.  According to Food Ministry statistics in the first one month of public food grain procurement drives, the government bought less than 2,000 tons of paddy and a little over 100,000 tons of rice up until May 21 this Boro season, where farmers are anticipated to have grown nearly 20 million tons of rice.  Food ministry officials confirmed to the Dhaka Tribune yesterday, that upon receipt of a Cabinet Division letter, the ministry is revisiting the current food procurement system that mostly benefits rice traders and millers, hardly benefiting rice farmers, the primary producers. Amidst a nationwide outcry over farmers getting poor prices for their produce in the current Boro season, the Cabinet Division has sent a letter to the Food Ministry asking them to include a farmer-friendly paddy procurement scheme in the ministry's Annual Performance Agreement (APA) for 2019-20. The 2019-20 APA is scheduled for signing in the presence of the prime minister on July 4, officials confirmed. In the current procurement system, the grassroots level food directorate apparatus is largely buying rice from millers under seasonal agreements, thereby benefiting millers, middlemen, and seasonal rice traders only. Farmers just get a tiny slice of that big support price cake in the form of sales of a few thousand tons of paddy to a few food procurement centres.  Officials said they do not buy paddy from farmers directly mostly because of the high moisture content of paddy, freshly cut from the fields, and they prefer buying the grain from millers after the paddy is dried, husked, and converted to rice. Food Ministry officials told this correspondent that the ministry is now mulling to develop drier facilities and paddy silos across the country so that the food directorate can procure more staple in the form of paddy, directly from farmers, rather than rice from the millers.  \"It's understandable that it will take a year or two to roll out the new plan for direct paddy purchases from farmers, but decisions are being taken in that direction, taking lessons from this year's Boro paddy price fiasco ,\" said a food official on anonymity. Brake on imports With 55% of the country's annual rice output of more than 35 million tons coming from the irrigated Boro rice, farmers are now at the mercy of traders and millers who are not procuring much from them due to a supply glut and carryover stocks, thanks to a liberal import policy long pursued by the government. Only last week, the government finally put a brake on private traders flooding the market with cheaper rice from across the border by imposing a whopping 55% tax on rice imports. Many consider it a late response from the government. Against the officially declared one million ton of crop loss in the 2017 haor floods, the government allowed the import of over four million tons of rice in FY2017-18 and the imported rice was still in the pipeline, until the government finally increased import duties on rice last week. Until there is a paradigm shift in the government's long pursued food procurement policy, there appears to be no respite in sight for farmers in terms of getting a fair price for their produce. This is evident from food statistics procured by the government so far in the current Boro season. Long before farmers started harvesting Boro in late April this year, the government had decided last March that it would buy 1.1 million tons of rice and 150,000 tons of paddy between April 25 and August 31. Interestingly, a month after the official launch date of the food procurement drive, the food directorate purchased less than 2,000 tons of paddy from farmers and a little over 100,000 tons of rice from millers. Farmers across the country, who are projected to have grown 20 million tons of Boro this season, are now going through hard times and suffering a cash crunch amidst very meager government purchases at poor, rock bottom prices from reluctant traders and millers, who already have huge import-fed rice stocks in hand.  In the last financial year (2017-18), the government had announced the purchase of 0.15 million tons of paddy directly from farmers, but ended up buying only 24,000 tons."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-06 00:00:00      \nThe Rohingya refugee crisis is putting a great amount of pressure on a country that is already in peril The geographic and socioeconomic characteristics of Bangladesh makes the country particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Around 77% of people in Bangladesh depend on natural resources and the degradation of the natural resources and biodiversity has a direct impact on the livelihood of the people. Further, sea level rise and extreme weather conditions as a result of climate change impacts will be more perilous. Threatening food security, agriculture and affecting the livelihood of the communities, as well as economic impacts would be stronger; Dhaka, the capital, attracting people around the country in search of better work opportunities, would be one of the most climate vulnerable cities in the world.  A combination of factors -- poverty, oppression, safety and better opportunities -- lead to displacement of people and crossing of the national border. Migration of people to a country, which is already climate vulnerable, expands a number of problems, including the environmental concerns that eventually affect the livelihood of people. Rohingya refugees are stateless and one of the most widely persecuted minorities in the world. The violence in Myanmar led one million Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh in 2017. Though, the displacement of people from Myanmar has started since the 1990's. From time to time environmental consequences make the safety and protection of people as well as sustainable use of the resources a massive task. The large influx of Rohingya refugees in the Cox's Bazar District has been putting enormous stress on the local resources and the livelihood, challenging the development, infrastructure, and health care. Crunch and consequences  Rohingya influx in the world's largest and growing refugee camp in the climate vulnerable country has accelerated the pressure on social protection and environmental concerns. Rohingya influx into the Cox's Bazar area has occupied most of the forestland, clearing mostly the hill areas, which is around 6000 acres of forestland in Ukhiya and Teknaf. The camps are accommodating the majority of the population in this particular area. The rapid destruction of forestland for the settlement of people disturbs the overall environment specially the ecological balance. The forest area of Cox's Bazar is also home to protected forest and wildlife habitat. Cutting down of trees for fuel wood and making shelters has been critical. The fuel wood collection was a part of the local community's livelihood survival, but ever since the Rohingya influx, deforestation became rampant. Also, the locals have been affected by the loss of the land and cutting of forest has transformed the hill land. The loss of forest increases the threat of flood, soil erosion, fewer crops, and more importantly, loss of habitat for the variety of species. Aid agencies are struggling to provide assistance to around 1 million Rohingya population and also the needs of host communities to improve poor conditions, provide safety of women and children, and fulfil the basic needs of all. The major issues are regarding social protection, economic assistance for sustenance and health care services. The weather changing conditions, floods, landslides, contamination of water and damages to the shelter do not put the communities in a safe spot. The World Bank announced grant figure of half a million to provide support to Bangladesh for addressing the needs of Rohingya refugees with health, sanitation, disaster risk management, sustainable use of forest, coastal area safety and rural development. Health care of the people due to the conditions of floods, landslides and the following outbreak of waterborne diseases are at a higher risk. Subsequently, the need to educate the vulnerable refugee youth and children is another important factor.   Finding balance amidst the challenges In the climate vulnerable countries with the influx of people it becomes quite challenging to provide social, economic protection and fulfil basic needs at times. In the disaster prone areas where multiple risks are attached, it requires several agencies, both the public and private sector to work together in making the communities climate resilient. Also, monitor changes closely for effective strategies and execution for minimum effect on the livelihood. Making people climate resilient through policy interventions and mainstreaming the major risks is helpful in preparing for the conditions that may arise from time to time. Bangladesh is the first country to have developed a climate resilience program with national level planning and guidelines. The need is to strengthen the institutions with adequate funding arrangements, appropriate execution and fulfilling the human resource requirements for effectiveness.  Policy changes and adjustment in the national level planning, that support the well-being opportunities to support both communities in tourism, salt production and fisheries and promote the sustainable development goals are necessary. Public and private sector's inclusive strategies for development of both communities; from financing for livelihood improvement, education, investment in the various sectors, planning and enhancing the mobility of labour are crucial. Also, conservation management plans for the protection of the environment and continuous improvement of institutional mechanism should be implemented. Improving the economic benefit, as the people are consumers, climate financing for development, provide labour and also skill training etc. The new projects with the climate finance to aim at increasing resilience and also, explore financing opportunities for Green climate fund. International organizations including UNHCR, IMO and UNDP are helping countries to focus on the issue of migration in the national development to enhance community based integration, environmental monitoring, and building capacity at local level. The focus should be equal on the host communities with the refugees for overall mobilizing effort -- handling the tension between the host community and the refugees for the resources, land and opportunities. The need is for multiple stakeholders to collaborate and coordinate for improvement of the social security, in a way the needs of both; the host communities and the Rohingya refugees are considered as well as providing alternative options to put less pressure on the natural resources, which considers both the environment and the people.

The Commerce Ministry on Monday said some big importers are importing onions in huge consignments from Egypt and Turkey at the ministry's request, reports UNB. Bangladesh has also started importing onions from neighboring Myanmar as an alternative source to keep its price stable in the domestic market with adequate supply, amid India's export ban on the essential kitchen item. Bangladesh is importing onions from Myanmar in two ways - by opening LC and border trade- said the Commerce Ministry, urging businesspeople to increase their import volumes and conduct business while maintaining business ethics. Meanwhile, new onions are expected to hit the domestic market from the third week of November. People buying onion from a truck which is authorized by TCB | Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune Analyzing all the aspects, the Commerce Ministry said, it appears that there is adequate supply of onions in the market. Imported onions are arriving every day. \"Consumers do not need to panic. Onion prices will soon become normal as large consignments will arrive within a couple of days,\" it said.  The Commerce Ministry said it has taken a number of steps to keep the price of onions and its supply normal, as large consignments are coming from alternative sources. Apart from Myanmar, Bangladesh has started importing onions from Egypt and Turkey through opening LCs.  Also Read - OMS onion in Dhaka: Joy for some, disappointment for many The Commerce Ministry said the prices of onions increased recently in Myanmar's market as well, which also had an impact on the Bangladeshi market. On September 29, the Indian government banned the export of onions with immediate effect, till further orders, for what it says is the improvement of domestic availability. On September 13, the minimum export price of $850 per metric tonne was imposed on onion export. The ban on onion export is expected to improve domestic availability and cool prices, said the Indian government.  Bangladesh used to import onions from India mainly due to low price and smooth transportation system. But onion production in India was hampered due to floods in the Indian State Maharashtra and other places, prompting India to impose ban on onion export.   The Commerce Ministry had meetings with onion importers and business people several times, and is in constant touch with importers. Earlier, it was announced that stern action will be taken if any businessperson tries to build stocks of onion illegally, increase price artificially, and hamper the normal supply flow."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-17 00:00:00      \nAlong the rutted village roads of this sub-district in central Bangladesh, one plant stands out: young palm trees.  Hundreds have been planted since 2017 in an effort to combat one of Bangladesh's fastest-growing disaster threats - a surge in deadly lightning strikes.  In Bangladesh, moist and hot air flowing from the Bay of Bengal and colder, heavier air descending from the Himalayas have long collided in lightning-sparking thunderstorms, said Murad Ahmed Farukh, an environmental scientist at Bangladesh Agricultural University.  But as the atmosphere warms as a result of climate change, and holds more moisture, deadly lightning strikes are happening more frequently than before, turning lightning into one of the South Asian nation's deadliest disasters.  Last year, around 360 people in Bangladesh were killed by lightning strikes - more than by floods or cyclones, according to the nation's disaster ministry. In 2016, 80 people died in a single stormy day.  Ghior is now one of the communities trying to find ways to cut the risks, in part by planting fast-growing palm trees that can divert strikes away from people.  Local authorities began sowing palm seeds in 2017 in response to a call from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who also urged that buildings be constructed with earthing systems, to discharge electricity from lightning strikes to the ground.  Lightning protection measures are now part of the country's national disaster management plan and its National Building Code.  Abdul Baten, an elected official in Ghior, has used $500 from the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief's food-for-work program to grow more than 500 palms, he said.  \"This is a preemptive measure by the government to cut loss of lives to lightning,\" Baten said, standing along a road lined with young palms.  So far, Bangladesh's disaster management department has supported sowing of 4.8 million palms nationwide, exceeding an initial target of 1 million, an agency official said.  RISING FEARS  Still, lightning continues to cause deaths in Ghior sub-district, most recently claiming 55-year-old Mongol Chandra Sarker in August as he walked to a pond to bathe.  Abdul Baten, a 57-year-old farmer, said he now leaves his fields if it begins to rain.  Unlike in the past, \"now we go back home as soon as we see dark clouds in the sky,\" he said.  So does brick kiln worker Abdul Latif, 55, who said he had not heard about climate change but could see the weather getting warmer.  Azad Mia, of nearby Kalia village, blamed the growing lightning menace on the felling of large trees in the area as people created space for new homes or rice fields.  \"Now taller trees such as date palm, betel nut, coconut and fan palm have almost vanished,\" he said, noting that such trees once attracted lightning away from people.  PREVENTING DEATHS  But rising awareness of the risks may have begun to cut the numbers of deaths. As of mid-September, about 180 people had died in lightning strikes this year, down from about 360 last year, according to disaster ministry figures.  Dhaka campaign group Save the Society and Thunderstorm Awareness Forum said by its tally 246 people had died between February and August this year, based on media reports.  In 2017, the death toll was 307, almost double the number in 2015, government data showed.  Mohammad Mohsin, a disaster ministry additional secretary, said as people learned more about the threat they were taking steps to lower their risk.  \"The number one factor is awareness,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in an interview at his office in downtown Dhaka.  That is playing out in the country's economy, he said. Last year, farmers in Sunamganj, a wetland-dotted northeastern district considered the country's lightning capital, had difficulty finding enough workers at harvest season, he said.  Farukh, the environmental scientist, however, said the introduction of a fast-growing rice in wetland districts - one that can be harvested in April, before the May and June peak lightning season - was likely to save lives.  Besides causing deaths, lightning strikes leave many of their victims permanently impaired with burn scars, hearing loss and neurological difficulties, medical experts say.  Mojibur Rahman, a next-door neighbor of Sarker, the man who died in a lightning strike in August, still suffers hearing loss in his right ear and a burn on his left side after lighting hit him five years ago as he was fishing.  \"I became senseless at the lightning flash,\" said the 35-year old, who now peddles fruit for a living.  \"It was so powerful that the railings of a nearby bridge collapsed,\" the bare-chest man recalled, standing in front of the iron shed where he lives with his wife and three children.  CUTTING RISK  Farukh, who has done lightning mapping in Bangladesh, blames deforestation, worsening air pollution and global warming for the spike in lightning deaths in recent years.  \"Something exceptional is happening in our atmosphere,\" he said.

Abdul Mannan, a meteorologist at the state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department, said the lightning danger period now extended further through the year, starting as early as February.  He said Bangladesh over decades had managed to bring down once sky-high death tolls from cyclones and flooding, through measures such as better early warning systems and protective structures.  Now the rising death toll from lightning similarly \"has to be prevented\", he said.  Mohsin, of the disaster ministry, noted that Bangladesh's lighting death toll was lower when the country had more large trees, so planting trees could be one step.  Scientists warned, however, that as trees take time to grow, the planting push may not provide protection for many years, and other changes may be needed in the meantime.  Trees are \"a long-term resilience measure. Will you wait for another 25 years?\" asked Farukh. \"Many farmers and fishermen will die by then.\"  He estimated that 80% of lightning victims are farmers and fishermen who need to work outside.  Aware of the planting project's limitations, the government also is pushing other measures, including putting in place lightning diverters - tall poles that can attract strikes and protect people within 90 meters (300 feet) of them.  It also hopes to build concrete lightning shelters in areas prone to strikes, Mohsin said.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-01 00:00:00      \nDUMC begins free dengue identification service for students A total of 13 students among 168 of the university have been marked as dengue positive on the first day of the installation of a dengue detection machine in Dhaka University's Medical Centre (DUMC). The students were provided with a free test to know their platelet count from their blood samples on Wednesday.  \"Both the blood platelet count and dengue identification can be done here for students free of cost. The daily capacity of the device is 150. It is operated by the Bangladesh Association of Clinical Biochemists,\" said DUMC Chief Medical Officer Dr Sarwar Jahan Muttafi.  Acknowledging the lack of sufficient numbers of dengue testing devices at the centre, Dr Sarwar said: \"We will start our service for the students from 8am every day. Students are perhaps unhappy with our services due to excessive pressure in the medical centre.\"  The dengue detection device was brought to the DUMC on Sunday amid growing dengue-panic in the university campus. A draft count by the university students claimed that around 150 students are suffering from dengue staying on campus.  Most of them are first year students and staying in rooms of the dormitories. General students along with leftist student wing Bangladesh Chhatra Union DU chapter demanded that the campus be shut down to prevent the spread of the mosquito-borne disease. Dhaka University Vice Chancellor Prof M Akhtaruzzaman said: \"Dengue and floods has spread across the country. How can we leave our students in such a situation as we are their present guardians?\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-29 00:00:00      \nOn Monday, Indonesia's disaster agency confirmed 29 deaths and said at least 13 more people were missing in Sumatra island's Bengkulu province Floods sparked by torrential rains have killed nearly 40 in Indonesia with a dozen more still missing, officials said Monday, marking the latest calamity for a disaster-prone nation. Landslides and floods are common during the monsoon season between October and April, when rains lash the vast Southeast Asian archipelago. On Monday, Indonesia's disaster agency confirmed 29 deaths and said at least 13 more people were missing in Sumatra island's Bengkulu province. A landslide triggered by heavy rain in neighbouring Lampung province on Saturday also killed a family of six. Meanwhile, flooding in and around parts of the capital Jakarta last week killed at least two people, forced more than 2,000 to evacuate their homes and set 14 pet pythons on the loose. In Bogor, a satellite city of Jakarta, residents had to contend with the prospect of coming face to face with the giant serpents, after they were set loose from a private property due to the high waters. Six of the snakes - which were as long as four metres 13ft - have been found, but eight were still missing, officials said at the weekend. \"If you find them please report it to authorities or volunteers,\" said Indonesian disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. That was not much comfort for some Bogor residents. \"We're terrified to hear this,\" said Samsudin, who goes by one name. \"Apparently they're very big so we want authorities to help us find them or take action.\" Illegal mining In Sumatra, some 12,000 residents have been evacuated from water-logged Bengkulu with hundreds of buildings, bridges and roads damaged.  Authorities have set up temporary shelters and public kitchens for those displaced by the rains. Hardest hit was Bengkulu Tengah district, just outside of the provincial capital, where 22 people were killed along with hundreds of livestock.  Illegal coal mining was partly to blame for deadly landslides, authorities said. \"Apart from natural factors like the heavy rain, (the flooding) was also caused by human activity that destroys the environment,\" disaster agency head Doni Monardo told reporters in Bengkulu on Monday.  Activists have long warned deforestation from rampant mining in the province could trigger a catastrophe.  At least four major rivers in Bengkulu overflow every time it rains due to environmental damage near their banks, activists said. \"The flooding in Bengkulu was made worse by the severe damage caused by coal mining,\" Ali Akbar from local environmental group Kanopi Bengkulu said in a statement. Illegal mining was blamed for killing dozens on the island of Sulawesi in March when a makeshift mine collapsed. Mineral-rich Indonesia has scores of unlicensed mines - many with complete disregard for even the most basic safety procedures.  Also in Sulawesi this year, some 70 people were killed by floods and landslides that wiped entire villages off the map. Nearly 10,000 people were displaced. Last month, some 112 people died and more than 90 remain missing after torrential rains pounded Indonesia's Papua region, triggering landslides and flash floods. Indonesia, a nation of some 17,000 islands, is one of the most disaster-prone nations on Earth. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are a common occurrence."

And since then, Bangladesh -- born of much struggle and a bloody war of independence, but with the flickering hope of the values on which it was founded -- has risen throughout the next five decades, on the precipice of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the most prosperous nations in the world. Having said that, our country's journey throughout these 48 years has been far from easy. It has gone through immense struggle -- be it famines, floods, autocracy, and our ever-present problem of corruption. But no one can deny Bangladesh's place as a nation today, in the world and in the hearts of its people, a country brimming with potential, a nation full of opportunities. Bangladesh stands as one of the greatest success stories in humanity's history, and its success -- be it in providing food and shelter to the people, in reducing the child mortality rate, in providing education to its children, or its immensely successful economy which continues to boom at an unprecedented rate -- is no doubt an indication of the resilience of the Bangladeshi people.  This success would not have been possible if we had not learned our lesson from the oppressive Pakistan Army forces who wished to extinguish our spirit -- and one of the most heinous methods they tried to achieve that goal was perhaps their systematic killings of our intellectuals, the very best of our nation. But through understanding the values upon which Bangladesh was founded -- that of democracy, secularism, equality -- did we manage to rise from the ashes of our martyred brothers and sisters as a nation that is stronger and is now well on its way towards true prosperity. Of course, that is not to say Bangladesh will not face obstacles in the coming years. Corruption continues to be an ugly ever-present force in our governance, and poverty remains all too real for too many in the country. But if we chose to honour the values on which the Father of the Nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman envisioned this nation, our success is nothing if not inevitable. It is through our remembrance that we honour the countless people who gave their lives for this country, and it is through our success that we continue to ensure that they live on in our actions."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-01-29 00:00:00      \nThe project, which is scheduled to be completed this year, is being implemented by the Bangladesh Navy Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh are seemingly in the dark on the benefits, risks, and probable side-effects of relocation to the remote island of Bhashan Char, located in an estuary of the Meghna river. The Bangladesh government assures a comfortable living for the relocated Rohingyas on the island, though the community appears to be unconvinced. By the government's plan, 103,200 Rohingyas out of more than a million currently sheltered in the cramped camps of Cox's Bazar will be moved to Bhashan Char under a project with an estimated cost of over Tk2,312 crore. The project, which is scheduled to be completed this year, is being implemented by the Bangladesh Navy. Bhashan Char, also known as Thengar Char, is located 21 nautical miles from Noakhali, 11 nautical miles from Jahajir Char, 4.2 nautical miles from Sandwip, 28 nautical miles from Patenga, and 13.2 nautical miles from Hatia. The only mode of commute for residents of Bhasan Char, located 30km away from the mainland, will be vessels that take three to three-and-a-half hours to travel from Hatia. Despite the reservations of both the Rohingyas and the international community, the government is still hopeful that the plan will help manage the massive refugee population in a disciplined manner. One of the main concerns raised by Rohingyas against Bhasan Char is that they fear the island can be washed away by tidal surges. The area, declared a forest reserve in 2013, is 10,000 acres at high tide and 15,000 acres at low tide. No one has ever lived on the island before. It was mostly used for cattle grazing until the construction of shelters for the Rohingyas began.   The Rohingya community is also concerned that the relocated members will be cut off from NGOs and the international community currently working in Cox's Bazar camps, providing food, shelter, education, and medical health care. However, authorities say a very healthy and comfortable life, facilitated by the government itself, is waiting for the Rohingyas in Bhashan Char if they relocate.  Noakhali Deputy Commissioner Tanmoy Das said the Rohingyas may harbour these fears because of the separation from Cox's Bazar. As a solution, a small number of refugees will be taken to the island beforehand to see the real scenario, so they can convince others to relocate. Concrete homes and flood defence Government officials are very optimistic about the relocation plan. They believe the Rohingya people would find the place suitable once they start living there. According to the plan approved in November 2017, there will be 120 cluster villages with 1,440 houses to house the displaced Rohingyas. The houses will be built four feet above the ground, in order to protect the refugees from high tidal waves. Each of the houses will have concrete breeze-block rooms measuring 2m x 2.5m with small barred windows, which are more habitable than the camps in Cox's Bazar. In order to protect the site from tidal floods and natural disasters, the island will have a 13km flood defence embankment, with a height of three metres and a width of 37 metres on a layer by layer basis. \"The 14 feet double embankment has been built to deal with tidal surges,\" said Noakhali DC.  There will also be 120 cyclone centres to protect the Rohinygas from cyclones, according to the plan. The ground floor of the cyclone shelters is four feet above the ground and the first floor is 10 feet above the ground floor. Refugees on the first floor of the shelters should be safe from tidal surges up to a height of 14 feet. The shelter houses, whenever required, will also be used as clinics and community centres, said DC Tanmoy Das. There will be modern hospital facilities, educational institutions, playgrounds for Rohingya children, and prayer houses for the community.  Currently, 22 people use one toilet in crowded camps in Cox's Bazar which will stand at one toilet for 11 people in Bhashan Char. To ensure pure drinking water, there will be deep tube wells for the residents. There will be a jetty, a dam, a fire service unit, and a meteorological office on the island. Solar power systems will be installed to ensure 24-hour electricity for residents. There will be perimeter fencing and watch towers will also be built to ensure security for the rehabilitation project. A police camp has already been built there. \"There is also a silo there which will preserve food for the community,\" said Das. 'Bhashan Char will give them economic freedom' Assuring the Rohingya people of a better living compared to the current life they are leading, Noakhali Deputy Commissioner Tanmoy Das said the island has been developed in a way that can not only ensure a comfortable living, but also help Rohingya people develop their lives socially and financially. \"They can choose to work here. We have developed the island in a way that they can work in cottage industries, agricultural work, fish farming, and animal husbandry. They can even set up shops here. It will make them economically independent,\" said Das. Some non-government organisations have already been contacted to purchase products produced by the community on the island, and to sell then outside with proper branding, he added. \"The Rohingyas can generate savings by doing this sort of work, and it will help them when they go back to Myanmar,\" said the Noakhali DC. Mohammad Abul Kalam, refugee relief and repatriation commissioner, said they will first take a delegation of Rohingyas to the island so they can see the development with their own eyes and convince others. Secretary to the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry, Md Shah Kamal, told the Dhaka Tribune that the island will ensure a much better livelihood for the Rohingyas. \"Primarily we aim to take 100,000 people there. They will be able to lead humane lives with all necessary facilities there,\" he said. The secretary said the island is ready to receive new inhabitants, but could not say when the relocation process would begin."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-12 00:00:00      \nThe crisis is exacerbated by a lack of major dredging operations  The navigability of rivers in Sylhet district is at an all-time low, due to the inflow of silt carried by Indian floodwaters. A lack of regular dredging efforts has also contributed significantly to this particular problem. Numerous river islands have appeared in almost all rivers across the district; especially in the Surma, one of the largest rivers in Sylhet division.  This phenomenon has caused the river flow to further decrease in the dry season.  According to information from the Sylhet divisional commissioner's office, Maharam Patla river of Sunamganj's Tahirpur upazila is nearly dead because of the sediment. The biodiversity of Sunamganj's Jadukata, Rakti, Patlai, Boulai, and Maharam rivers is threatened by the illegal and unplanned occupation of river islands and land surrounding the river. Biodiversity of rivers endangered There are 36 rivers in Sylhet division, according to information published on the website of the divisional commissioner. They are the: Surma, Piyain Gange, Sari Gowain, Bagra Gange, Naowa Gange, Shyola, Dhamalia, Monai, Borodal, Juri Monu, Dholai, Longla, Karangi, Khowai, Sutang, Kushiyara, Madhabpur, Mahasing, Khajanchi, Bhottokhal, Kalni, Jamalpur, Boraba river, Lobha, Hari, Bogapani, Dhariyana, Dhoyai, Jadukata, Dhola-Dholai Gange, Gopla-Longol, Mogai-Chalti, Rakti, Poinda, Bhera Mohona, and Dhanu Bolai. Sylhet Additional Divisional Commissioner Mrinal Kanti Deb told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Drives are being conducted in Habiganj, Sunamganj, and Moulvibazar--as well as in Sylhet's Bishwanath upazila--to evict the illegal occupiers from the river islands.\" He said there will be a meeting by the River Protection Commission in Sylhet this month; where they will discuss the steps necessary in order to protect the rivers. National River Protection Commission Chairman Mujibur Rahman Howladar, at one of the commission's meetings a few days ago, said: \"As Bangladesh is geographically lower than its neighbouring country, India, the country faces many natural disasters, including flash floods, due to mudslides from hilly areas.\" Consequently, rivers face navigability issues and their direction flow changes as the depth of the water decreases. This is because river islands emerge as sediment amasses on the river beds, he added. National River Protection Commission General Member Md Alauddin said the rivers' environmental balance is being disrupted by the emergence of these river islands and their illegal acquisition, threatening the biodiversity of those rivers.  Bangladesh Water Development Board's (BWDB) Executive Engineer of Sylhet unit Md Sirajul Islam said: \"I believe that, every year, the navigability of Sylhet's rivers decreases by half a metre due to the inflow of silt from India.\" He furthered that India's Barak river flows into streams through the Surma and Kushiyara at Bangladesh's Amalsid point. As the Surma river's source has filled with silt, most of the water flows through the Kushiyara river, resulting in horrific erosion on the river banks.  River water flow disrupted The BWDB official also said the Piyain river--the trans-boundary river of India and Bangladesh that used to flow down from India's Omghat--has already filled with sediment. Thus, this river is flowing through the Dawki river. At Amalsid point, the Surma river is flowing in the opposite direction and has taken a right turn; and Kushiyara is also flowing in the same alignment. Some 60% of the water inflow from India flows through the Surma river and the remaining 40-35% flows through the Kushiyara river; the inconsistency of water flow is causing the silt deposits and erosion. Huge river islands have started to emerge at the source of the Surma river, almost killing  the upper Surma. Of the 53 kilometres of this river, 26 kilometres flow along the border--which is creating immense pressure on the Kushiyara river--causing river erosion on its banks, the BWDB official added. Sirajul Islam furthered: \"If dredging operations are executed on the upper Surma river-- with the consent of both India and Bangladesh's government--then the navigability crisis, environmental-ecological problems, and other inconveniences might be averted. \"All the silt from landslides, mudslides, or flow from upstream is depositing on Bangladesh's side of the river.\" He said since water flow is higher in the upper Surma channel--than its capacity to uphold the flow--river islands are being created near the piers of all the bridges on the channels, while the velocity of the flow decreases. Due to this, a whole town of Kanaighat was flooded in three hours last year, he added. Describing basin management as the key to the river's condition, the BWDB executive engineer said: \"The river basin is not in my country, so how should I manage that? This problem does not even have a scientific solution.\"  According to information on river research by Sylhet Agricultural University's Soil Science Department Professor, also the Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, Dr Md Abul Kashem, every year 800,000,000 million tonnes of sand and silt are deposited in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is facing frequent floods now, whereas it only used to flood every five to seven years due to the overflowing river bodies. He stated that apart from Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, and Habiganj, silt from India flows through 57 upazilas of seven districts--including Brahmanbaria, Kishoreganj and Netrokona--into the Meghna river, crossing near Brahmanbaria's Titas, old Brahmaputra, and Bhairab. However, the depth of all three points through which silt is carried has decreased, causing frequent flooding every year. He said: \"There have been no major dredging operation on rivers in the eastern region of Bangladesh, because of this, it is difficult to avoid the crisis.\" "

India's monsoon season that begins in June usually starts to retreat by early September, but heavy rains have continued across parts of the country this year, triggering floods. An official said that at least 93 people had died in most populous Uttar Pradesh since Friday after its eastern areas were lashed by intense monsoon showers. Rising water levels forced authorities to shift 900 inmates from a prison in eastern Ballia district, police officer Santosh Verma said. This is the first time since 1960 that the monsoon will remain active till mid-October. https://t.co/EyRY4LBMOk In neighbouring Bihar, an impoverished agrarian region that was hit by floods earlier this year, the death toll from the latest bout of rain had reached 20 on Monday, a state government official said.  Bihar's capital city of Patna, home to around 2 million, has been badly hit, with waist-deep flood waters across many streets, and entering homes, shops, and even the wards of a major hospital. In some parts, authorities deployed boats to rescue residents. At least 100 people have died in northern India over the last three days in unusually heavy late monsoon rains which have submerged streets, hospital wards and houses, officials say.https://t.co/MaCaJU4R4h \"The rains have stopped but there is waterlogging in many areas,\" Bihar's Additional Secretary in the Disaster Relief Department Amod Kumar Sharan said. In its bulletin on Monday, India's Meteorological Department said the intensity of rainfall over Bihar was very likely to reduce. Showers in Uttar Pradesh are also expected to abate this week. Weather department officials said this month that monsoon rains were likely to be above average for the first time in six years."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-20 00:00:00      \nPreventive and curative measures have been recommended to handle the issue Aminul was only nine years old when his family was forced to leave their home on the island of Bhola--at the mouth of the Meghna River--after incessant rains resulted in massive soil erosion and floods. His father left his mother and him with relatives to go in search of a livelihood and Aminul never saw him again. Now 30, Aminul is a drug peddler in the slums of Dhaka. He says he had no choice. He came to the big city when he was 11, in search of his father, and tried to eke out a living at the Sadarghat Launch Terminal, the bustling river port in the city, by being a baggage handler and waste collector. \"It was very harsh. I was beaten and tortured by unknown people...I slept many days without food, and later I became addicted to sniffing glue. The glue helped to control my hunger, as well as numb my body so that I did not feel any pain when I was physically abused,\" he told Dhaka Tribune. Then one day, he found a saviour. A man found him injured and brought him away to the Karwan Bazar slum; a man who introduced him to drugs and gave him a livelihood. \"This man was bad but he took care of me, saved me from those animals who used to beat me brutally or sexually abuse me on the streets,\" he said.  Explaining why he became involved with crime, Aminul said: \"I was physically and sexually abused. I never found my father, and my mother also died. The man who found me was bad. This life is bad, I agree. But, there was no one to protect me except him. I also wanted a decent life.\" A recent Unicef study, published on April 5, found that climate change threatens the lives of 19 million Bangladeshi children. The report said climate change is a key factor in pushing poorer Bangladeshis to abandon their homes and communities to try and rebuild their lives elsewhere. Many head to Dhaka and other major cities, where children risk being pushed into dangerous forms of labour and into early marriages.  Why internal migration happens Bangladesh is located downstream of three large river basins: the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna river basins. Heavy rainfall during the monsoon period is the main cause of flooding which occurs almost every year, with a devastating flood every 5-8 years, according to the country's Flood Forecasting and Warning centre. The river bank erosion and displacement from char land--which is vulnerable--results in the displacement of large amounts of people who migrate to major cities or nearby towns in search of a livelihood.   \"Suddenly they do not know where to go, and many of them move to major cities like Dhaka where they end up in slums,\" said Dr Atiq Rahman, executive director of think-tank Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS). Forced migration is a hugely traumatic event and migrants do not always get to choose how to live. \"Very often, displaced people are extremely responsible; they are making a living. But, because their family structure is under threat, areas are new, there may be some who might be dislodged or might be lured by others into minor criminal activity,\" Dr Atiq said. \"Now, the next issue is climate change-induced displacement. Climate change is a much more recent phenomenon. Some people say climate change has not started in a full-blown way. Some say the beginning of a half-hazard has started,\" he added. A large number of street children come to urban areas from disaster-prone areas, according to Moniruzzaman Mukul, deputy program manager of Manusher Jonno Foundation (MJF), who has worked with them for decades. \"In Sadarghat area, most of the street children come from Barisal division, Chandpur, and other river basin areas. In the Dhaka slum, we have found the same scenario, those who migrate from bitter effects of climate change,\" he said. The slum census of 2014, identified frequent natural calamities and river erosion as the potential reason for rural to urban migration, he added. Children, abuse and crime  According to Bangladesh Shishu Odhikar Foundation, 148 children came under law enforcement supervision in 2018, who were involved in crime like: rape, murder, kidnapping, drug peddling, purse snatching, sexual harassment, and others.   Moniruzzaman said: \"In the slums, children are unaccompanied during the day, as the parents are engaged in work elsewhere. Boys are pushed into work on the streets. The slum census of 2014 reports that around 71% of girls are married-off before the age of 18, and more the 60% of the slum dwellers do not even pass eighth grade.\" According to Department of Narcotics Control (DNC), around 200 drug peddlers were arrested at the Karwan Bazar slum. Khorshid Alam, DNC assistant director, told Dhaka Tribune that the drug business at Karwan Bazar slum usually starts in the evening, till midnight. He added: \"We have also seen abused children become drug carriers. We bring children to our treatment centre or refer them to a social welfare rehabilitation center.\" Assistant Director (Operation) of NDC Md Bazlur Rahman said the number of narcotics cases has increased but there is no data or research done on how many children are involved.  \"Children are never suspected. Hence, slum children or drifting children are an easy choice for drug peddlers to use as carriers,\" said Md Bazlur.  Chief Consultant of Central Drug Addiction Treatment Centre Dr Syed Emamul Hossain emphasized that street and floating children are vulnerable to social protection. \"Street or floating children from slums or city streets, I found here, most do not have a family. Some of their parents left them on the streets. Some parents got divorced. When they do not find any other means to live a decent life, they become easy targets for abuse,\" said Dr Emamul. What can be done? Dr Emamul suggested someone determine from where, and why, these children are coming to city streets or slums, and urged that proper protection measures be taken for them.  MJF Deputy Program Manager Moniruzzaman also suggested that two types of measures--preventive and curative--be used to deal with the future challenge. Preventive measures: *    Strengthen standing committees in the local government system. The members of the Union Parishad know the problems in their communities, so they can help identify vulnerable families to address the problem *    Initiate a mass-awareness raising program *    Improve village economies, for example, by expanding agro loans, developing local entrepreneurship, and improving access for vulnerable groups to public resources, etc. *    Prepare database and rationing services Curative measures: *    Extend services, and create information hub   *    Create rehabilitation centre for street children *    Undertake ward-wise service mapping"

According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the concentration of planet-warming CO2 in the atmosphere has reached levels not seen in three to five million years. The adverse effects of climate change has compelled youth activists like Greta Thunberg and Rebeca Sabnam to voice their concerns about the crisis the world is facing. Greta is known to all because of her speech about climate change, but there are many more activists like her whose stories are yet to be told. Sixteen-year-old Rebeca Sabnam is a Bangladeshi origin US citizen. She is one of the youths trying to raise their voice and contribute to the process of saving the world. The high school student lives in New York with her family, who migrated to America when she was six years old. In September this year, more than 200,000 people marched in Manhattan for an environmental demonstration for climate change action.  Rebecca stood in front of a crowd of thousands during the march and shared her experience of the effects of climate change.   She recalled the times when her uncle had to carry her to school on his back during floods in Dhaka, reports Al Jazeera. Rebecca said: \"I am from Bangladesh, a country that exemplifies how interconnected the climate emergency is to racial justice and poverty.\" Later, while talking to Al Jazeera, Rebecca said she did not expect much response when she mentioned Bangladesh in her speech, but instead she got an overwhelming response from the crowd.  \"The climate crisis is not just an environmental issue, it's an urgent human rights issue,\" she said. The 16-year-old said: \"Bangladeshi women are extremely vulnerable to post displacement trafficking, magnified by the climate crisis. We want Bengali women, as well as the Rohingya people living in Bangladeshi refugee camps, to know that youth around the world are striking for their lives and security.\" Leaders from across the world, including Bangladesh, come together in Madrid, Spain, for the UN Climate Change Conference, COP25.  World leaders will deliberate on the environmental crisis facing humanity in the 12-day conference, which began on Monday. A wide range of issues, including the global tourism industry's work to implement climate-friendly initiatives, tracking progress on the Paris Climate Agreement 2016, will be discussed in COP25. According to a Unicef report published in April, around 19 million Bangladeshi children are at risk due to climate change disasters such as floods and cyclones. Two weeks before the conference began, Rebecca told Al Jazeera: \"We want COP25 to not simply take note of [the] alarming data [on the rise in temperature], but to advocate for the end of the funding, expansion, and use of fossil fuel.\" In the September speech in New York, she stressed on the need to understand how the effects of climate change intersect with some of the most vulnerable communities around the world. Her focus of the journey ahead is to try and figure out a way to use the current momentum and put Bangladeshi women, children, and Rohingya refugees at the forefront of the global climate change debate. Rebecca said she is trying to ensure that Bangladesh is not forgotten along the way after the Climate Strike.

Dr Kaikaus urged journalists to create awareness in people not to believe any rumour about power disruption. However, he added there might be some cases of supply disruption in some areas due to floods as power transformers have gone under water but there is no possibility of a countrywide black out. Unique Group signed a contract with the government on Wednesday to set up a 584MW combined cycle power plant in Meghnaghat in the next three years on a build-own-operate (BOOT) basis.

The premier said this while delivering her speech at a joint meeting of Awami League Advisory Council and the Central Working Committee at her official residence Ganabhaban on Friday, reports UNB.  She said the government's resilience and strength in putting Bangladesh in the current position stems from the people of the country and their support.   \"The way Bangladesh is advancing, I think we need to build up the organizations more strongly,\" she said.   In this connection, she reckons that while Awami League was in the opposition, it developed plans as a political party on how to advance the country.   \"We have to take preparations and move forward gradually. We must put behind memories of difficulties and hardship, in order to consolidate Awami League stronger, we need to build public consensus,\" she said.    The prime minister said development narratives and tested knowledge in promoting better governance in the country need sharing in a coordinated way that will help the country move forward.   Over the past ten years, the prime minister said the government continued its development trends at a considerable pace.   \"We never stumbled on our way to development. This is the most important thing,\" she said.  Criticizing a section of the society, the premier said they always down play the government's achievement in a typical way.   Talking about recent rains and the possibility of floods, Sheikh Hasina said the government is well aware of the situation. \"We are collecting information from different parts of the country,\" she emphasized. Sheikh Hasina also asked party leaders and activists to remain in full preparedness to deal with possible floods in the country."

According to the 2019 Global Peace Index (GPI) released in London yesterday by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), the country has been ranked 101st out of 163 countries with a global score of 2.128. Last year, its position was 93 with a score of 2.084. Earlier in 2017, Bangladesh's position was 84th with a score of 2.035.  Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008. It is joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Austria, Portugal, and Denmark. Afghanistan is now the least peaceful country in the world, replacing Syria, which is now the second least peaceful. South Sudan, Yemen, and Iraq comprise the remaining five least peaceful countries. Peacefulness in the Asia-Pacific region improved by 3 per cent, but the region also experienced a higher number of refugees, terrorism, and higher levels of internal conflict, said the report. Among South Asia countries, Bangladesh remains in fourth place leaving behind India (2.605), Pakistan (3.072) and Afghanistan (3.574), and now sits behind Bhutan (1.506), Sri Lanka (1.986) and Nepal (2.003). It said peacefulness improved in 86 countries while it deteriorated in 76 countries. Billion people facing high exposure to climate change effects Nearly a billion people are facing climate change hazards globally, with the Asia-Pacific region housing twice as many people living in areas with high exposure than all other regions combined.  Discover the state of peace today with our website dedicated to the 2019 Global Peace Index.Read the latest research about climate change, perceptions of leadership, the economic cost of violence and wellbeing here: https://t.co/qEXSicxfLI pic.twitter.com/OPa2mrHhGh As shown in the Global Risk 2019 report, the top nine countries -- Philippines, Japan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, China, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, and Pakistan-- are facing the highest risk of multiple climate hazards. The report said an estimated 971 million people live in areas with high or very high exposure to climate hazards including cyclones, floods, bushfires, desertification and rising sea levels. Overall, the report found global peace improved for the first time in five years and the economic impact of violence also fell, although the world remains less peaceful than a decade ago. Military expenditure, violent protests, and violent crime, all decreased globally this year, particularly in Asia. While the percentage of GDP spending on defence decreased in two out of every three countries over the past decade, the US and China have continued to rapidly increase their military spending. The 13th edition of the Global Peace Index (GPI) measured the peacefulness of 163 independent states and territories. The GPI covers 99.7 per cent of the world's population, using 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators from highly respected sources, and measures the state of peace using three thematic domains: the level of Societal Safety and Security, the extent of Ongoing Domestic and International Conflict, and the degree of Militarisation. According to the latest report, global peacefulness improved very slightly in the 2019 GPI with average country scores improving by 0.09 per cent."

Our correspondents in Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari reported that people are marooned in several places due to heavy flooding, caused by the rain. Meanwhile, nearly 3,400 makeshift houses in the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar were destroyed due to the rain, killing two people and rendering more than 2,700 refugees homeless, according to a press statement issued by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN migration agency, Cox's Bazar office. In Rangamati, chunks of mud collapsed on tin-shed houses in Kalabagan of the Karnaphuli Paper Mill area, in the district's Kaptai upazila, around 12:30pm yesterday. Speaking to Dhaka Tribune, Kaptai police station OC Md Nasir Uddin said when informed, fire fighters from the local Fire Service office rushed to the spot and rescued four people - a woman named Tahmina Akter, 25, her parents Md Gafur, 54, and Bilkis Begum, 43, and a child named Surya Mallik, 6 - from the debris of the crushed houses. They were sent to the Christian Hospital Chandraghona in Kaptai, where the doctors on duty pronounced Tahmina and Surya dead. Tahmina's parents are undergoing treatment at the hospital. The local met office recorded 170mm rainfall in Rangamati from 6am on Sunday to 6am yesterday. Another landslide was reported at Bamechhara in the Langadu upazila yesterday afternoon, with no report of casualties. But the road communication between Langadu and Khagrachhari's Dighinala upazila was suspended. Langadu Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Prabir Kumar Roy, while inspecting the damage at the spot, said: \"A small hill collapsed on the road, which is why vehicular movement is suspended for now. We will start removing the debris once the rain lets up a little.\" In another incident of landslide, at least 14 kilometres of road between Ruma and Thanchi upazilas in Bandarbanwere blocked yesterday, affecting communication in the area. Meanwhile, at least 30 tourists are stranded in different tourist spots in the district as the water in Sangu River has surpassed the safe level after four days of rain. Speaking to Dhaka Tribune, Thanchi police station OC Zubayerul Haque said: \"There were 25 tourists in Thanchi's Jinnah Para area, four of whom travelled to Thanchi sadar today [yesterday]. We suspect there are more tourists stranded in Remakri area.\" Local sources said communication through the Sangu were suspended on Friday, while traffic on land routes is also suspended due to the heightened risks of landslides. Local administration has set up 126 shelters and asked the locals to move in for safety. In Khagrachhari, the district administration has issued emergency warning, urging locals to move away from areas vulnerable to landslides.  Speaking to Dhaka Tribune, Khagrachhari Deputy Commissioner Md Shahidul Islam said shelters in all nine upazilas are open and ready to accommodate people in case of a disaster. He further said more than 800 families were living in vulnerable foothills across the district, and the administration is working to evacuate them to the shelters.     In Chittagong, the district administration opened 10 shelters where people living in risky areas can take refuge to avert landslide-related casualties. Chittagong Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Kamal Hossain said they were asking the people living at locations with risk of landslides to move to safer places as a precaution. On Sunday, the officials moved 34 families, who are at risk of landslide, from the Modhu Shah hills near the Jalalabad Housing Society in Chittagong city. On July 3, 50 families from the hills near Akbar Shah area were evicted. The district administration has so far listed 835 families who are living on the 17 most vulnerable hills. According to the Weekly Regional Humanitarian Snapshot of UN Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), between July 1 and July 7, 136 incidents of natural disasters were reported in Cox's Bazar, affecting 18,000 people in the refugee camps. 2 Rohingyas killed, 2,700 displaced in Cox's Bazar Five days of heavy rains and winds destroyed more than 3,400 houses in the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar, killing at least two people and displacing over 2,700, according to an IOM statement issued yesterday. \"We are only half way into the monsoon season and helped over 2,000 people in the past 72 hours. Our teams have been working round the clock,\" IOM spokesman George McLeod said in the statement. Preliminary damage estimates have already exceeded those recorded in 2018, he added. Records from rain gauges between July 3-5 in the Kutupalong mega camp showed 510 mm, while Camp 16 - another major settlement - recorded 530 mm. IOM preliminary damage data covering the period of July 2-6 includes 1,186 households affected by landslides, 216 households impacted by flooding, 1,840 households affected by wind, 15,534 people affected by flooding or other safety risks, 391 landslides and 51 wind storms. As of Sunday night, IOM damage reports for the previous 24-hour period indicated 13 more landslides, nine windstorms and two floods affecting 2,200 individuals and 432 households."

A search for more possible victims was under way in the town of Sentani, which was hit by flash floods late on Saturday. Fifty-one people were killed and 74 injured there, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the national disaster agency, told a news briefing. Heavy rain caused landslides in the nearby provincial capital of Jayapura, killing seven there, Nugroho said. Soldiers pulled alive a 5-month old baby from under the rubble of his house and took him to hospital, Papua military spokesman Muhammad Aidi said. The number of victims \"will probably increase because the evacuation process is still taking place and not all affected areas have been reached,\" Nugroho said. About 4,150 people are sheltering in six evacuation centres, he said.  Hundreds of houses, three bridges and a Twin Otter airplane parked at the airport were damaged by the floods. The Sentani airport, the province's main transport hub, remained open. TV footage showed mud and large logs on Sentani's main roads after floodwaters receded. Disaster authorities have warned local governments of flash flood risks due to deforestation in the mountains surrounding the town, Nugroho said, adding that in 2018 Jakarta sent seedlings intended for tree-planting. \"Forest destruction in the Cyclops Mountains have increased for use as firewood and to turn the land into plantations,\" Nugroho said. \"Since 2018 we have warned the Jayapura government to be careful of flash flood risks because of this deforestation,\" he added."

He said RAB has strengthened surveillance on launch and bus terminals as well as railway stations, so that holidaymakers can travel home safely.  \"But, this year, roads and rail lines were damaged due to floods in the country's north-eastern region. That is why vehicle movement is slow there. RAB personnel are working sincerely to make Eid journeys of the people smooth,\" The RAB chief said. Noting that there are some 42 accident-prone spots on highways in the country, he said RAB has increased monitoring to avert accidents in these areas. "

      "authors": "Belal Muntasir",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-22 00:00:00      \nA circular was issued in this regard on Wednesday The government has almost doubled import duties on rice to 55%, in a bid to bring slight relief to farmers hit hard by lower prices of paddy. Earlier, import duties totaled 28%. According to a statutory regulatory order (SRO) issued by the National Board of Revenue (NBR) on Wednesday, the new import duties will be effective immediately.  \"We revised the import duties as per the instructions of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, to save farmers from incurring financial losses,\" NBR Chairman Md Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan said. He added that 303,000 tons of rice were imported in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year (FY2018-19), which had a negative effect on the sales of paddy grown by local farmers. \"Farmers even had to sell rice at prices so low that they failed to meet production costs,\" the NBR chairman said. According to the SRO, rice importers now have to pay 25% regulatory duty, as compared to the previous 3%. Furthermore, the NBR imposed 5% advance income tax (AIT) on rice imports for the first time ever. On the other hand, the customs duty has remained unchanged at 25%. NBR member Md Firoz Shah Alam said the government has been gradually increasing import duties on rice over the last few years to discourage imports. The import duty on rice was 25% in FY2017-18, and was raised by 3% to 28% in the budget for FY2018-19. Import duties have now been raised further to 55% to help farmers, Alam added.  Earlier on Monday, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Food Ministry recommended stopping rice imports and taking plans for exports. Experts believe the government initiative to increase import duties will benefit farmers in the long run. Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Research Director Khondaker Golam Moazzem said the decision to control rice imports should have been taken long ago. \"The government has acted too late,\" he said, adding that the late decision had caused suffering for farmers as rice prices were reduced by the supply of rice from imports. He also said the increase in import duties should not increase the price of rice in the market, as there are adequate stocks. Moazzem suggested that the government should procure more rice from farmers immediately, to ensure fair prices, and that exports be allowed in limited numbers. The government earlier promoted rice imports in the last two years ago, lowering import duties to 10% to meet a rice supply shortage caused by floods in 2017. The government had said they required 1,000,000 tons of rice to meet the shortage, but a total 6,000,000 tons were imported in the last two years, said the Food Ministry. There has been substantial growth in rice production over the last few harvest seasons, and rice stocks have risen significantly. The high supply forced farmers to lower prices to the point at which they could not meet production costs. Paddy was found to be selling at Tk450 to Tk500 for every maund (1 maund=40kg) in the last few days, but growers said the cost of harvesting each maund of paddy was between Tk1,000 to Tk1,500. Farmers across the country have launched protests over the issue."

She made the call when IRRI Director General Dr Matthew Morell met her at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Thursday. The prime minister's Speech Writer Md Nazrul Islam briefed reporters after the meeting. The prime minister stressed the need to strengthen research work to invent saline-, cold-, and draught-tolerant varieties of rice--on a large scale--and improve deep water rice varieties. She emphasized the importance of increasing the capacities for producing rice in the country, continuously, as arable land is diminishing. \"Our farmers are very smart and quick learners. They can easily adopt technology,\" Nazrul quoted the prime minister as saying. Talking about crop patterns, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh cultivates wheat, maize, pulse, and other crops that need less water, in the northern region. She asked the authorities concerned to take steps to boost rice production in the southern region. Also Read- Bangladeshi rice research lags behind due to legal framework She stressed the need to increase the use of surface water and reduce dependence on underground water for irrigation; to protect the environment.  \"So, the country's water bodies--including rivers, canals, and beels--are being re-excavated for irrigation,\" she said.  The prime minister praised the existing collaboration between IRRI and BRRI. IRRI's director general said IRRI is keen to undertake a collaborative program with BRRI to increase rice production in Bangladesh. Raising a 14-point action plan, designed by IRRI--under the collaborative program--he said if the action plan can be implemented, Bangladesh will be able to have high growth in rice production and sustain the country's food security. The action plans include: increasing production in Aush areas, inventing varieties of Aman crops, increasing Boro production overcoming stagnancy, making hybrid rice suitable for local environments through research, and introducing nutritious and healthy rice in Bangladesh. The other action plans include: inventing cold-tolerant Boro variety for the Haor areas,  protecting crops from flash floods, working on saline-tolerant varieties for coastal areas, overcoming harvesting and seed problems, enhancing mechanization to reduce production costs, inventing climate change-resistant varieties, shifting cropping patterns of the northern region to the southern regions, and disseminating of technology to farmers. Dr Matthew said IRRI is interested in working on this action plan in partnership with BRRI. The prime minister praised the action plan. Agriculture Minister Dr Md Abdur Razzaque, Agriculture Secretary Md Nasiurzzaman, the Prime Minister's International Affairs Advisor Dr Gowhar Rizvi, and PMO Secretary Sajjadul Hassan were present at the meeting.  BRRI Director General Dr Md Shahjahan Kabir, IRRI representative for South Asia Dr Nafees Meah, and IRRI representative for Bangladesh Dr Humnath Bhandari also attended the meeting. The IRRI is an independent, non-profit, research institute founded in 1960. The Philippines-based institute has offices in 17 rice-growing countries--including Bangladesh--across Asia and Africa."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-01-29 00:00:00      \nThey fear the island will flood, cut them off from humanitarian aid and services The displaced Rohingya population prefers living in the cramped and squalid refugee camps of Cox's Bazar, rather than living in a potentially better-sheltered and relatively more comfortable facility on Bhasan Char. The Bangladesh government is almost at the final stage of relocating 100,000 Rohingyas who were forcefully driven away from their land in a Myanmar army crackdown.  However, the unwillingness of the Rohingyas to relocate to the remote island is delaying the relocation plan. Construction has already been carried out at Bhasan Char, previously known as Thengar Char, a river island which emerged twenty years ago at the mouth of the Meghna River. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is set to formally inaugurate the housing complex on the flood- prone isolated island soon. However, many Rohingyas disagree with the relocation plan. Speaking with the Dhaka Tribune, they said they want to continue living in the refugee camps of Cox's Bazar, instead of on Bhasan Char in Noakhali. The assurance of a relatively-comfortable life on the remote island, made by the Bangladesh government, is not enough to convince them. Most Rohingya refugees are unwilling to relocate there as they fear death by starvation, floods, and a lack of humanitarian aid. An exclusive video, released in November by the Guardian, also showed a number of \"prison-like units\" built for Rohingyas on the remote silt island.   Bhasan Char project at a glance The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), in November 2017, approved a Tk2312.15 crore project to provide temporary shelter for Rohingya refugees on Bhasan Char. The island is located 21 nautical miles from Noakhali, 11 nautical miles from Jahajir Char, 4.2 nautical miles from Sandwip, 28 nautical miles from Patenga, and 13.2 nautical miles from Hatiya. Motor-run boats are the only mode of travel to this area.  Under project \"Ashrayan-3,\" the necessary infrastructure to house 100,000 displaced Myanmar citizens, and other island facilities, are being constructed on Bhasan Char. Almost 80% of the construction of houses and cyclone shelters has already been completed, and the island will have flood protection embankments, secure homes, and administrative buildings. 'A death trap' Speaking to our correspondent at Lambasia Rohingya refugee camp in Ukhiya upazila of Cox's Bazar, a number of Rohingyas rejected the idea of moving to Bhasan Char. Hamid Hussain, a Rohingya man in his sixties, living in the camp for almost five years, said: \"If the Bangladesh government wants to improve our quality of life, then they should do it here in Cox's Bazar where all the Rohingya population is already living.  \"The new place is a death trap. Someone told me that island might go underwater anytime. There is also slim chance of humanitarian services of non-government organizations (NGOs) on that remote island.\" Expressing his concerns, Hamid added: \"There will be no NGOs on Bhasan Char, which means there will be no humanitarian support or activities, and no monitoring.\" At present, many international and local NGOs are working at the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar, providing much-needed food, shelter, healthcare, and other aid to the refugees. Hamid's son Jamil Hussain said his father was a farmer in Myanmar, but they are now unemployed. Discussing his life in the camp, Jamil said: \"It has been over a year since we have taken shelter in Bangladesh. During this period, my father has set up a shop where he can earn Tk200 to Tk300 per day.  \"Life is difficult, but we are well aware this is the best we can do right now. So, we do not want to leave this camp. In fact, we will not go anywhere except our own country.\" 'We will drown' Abdus Salam, a majhi -a title given to a Rohingya leader - of the Lambasia camp said they had already discussed relocation among themselves,and almost everyone is scared about the idea. He told the Dhaka Tribune: \"These Rohingyas have been here for a long time, and they do not want to change their place of residence again. It takes 3 hours to reach Bhasan Char by boat. We do not want to live in such an isolated place. \"Will an adequate amount of food, necessary facilities, and security be available there? There is so much water, we will drown eventually. It is better to die here, than to move to Bhasan Char.\" When asked why the Rohingyas are rejecting the possibly of a better life on Bhasan Char, a Rohingya woman named Shekufa Begum said: \"The camp in Cox's Bazar is very close to my homeland Myanmar, and I can return there if the situation improves.  \"But in Bhasan Char, we face the risk of this island sinking to the depths. Locals and other Rohingyas have warned me about it.\"  Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Mohammad Abul Kalam, who is supervising the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, said the Prime Minister's Office has been instructed to select some majhis and to bring them to Bhasan Char for an orientation. The majhis will be given a tour of the island and its facilities so they can inspire Rohingyas living in the Cox's Bazar camps to relocate.  \"We will take a Rohingya delegation to Bhasan Char as soon as possible and will show them the facilities,\" said Kalam, hoping they will be more willing to relocate after a tour. On August 25 last year, the Myanmar army launched a crackdown on the Rohingya minority, forcing over 700,000 of the ethnic community to cross the border and take shelter in overcrowded refugee camps at Cox's Bazar."

The World Food Program (WFP) is working with the government of Bangladesh to lift rural women out of extreme poverty through a ground breaking program, said the WFP on Monday. The participants of the Investment Component for Vulnerable Group Development (ICVGD) program come from all 64 districts of the country, residing in remote areas that are prone to natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes and cyclones. They face high poverty with low employment opportunities, reports UNB. \"WFP applauds the government for its commitment towards empowering women and achieving food security in Bangladesh,\" said Richard Ragan, WFP representative and country director in Bangladesh. \"Thanks to commitments like this, rural women will now have a chance to transform their lives and that of their children through skills and knowledge,\" he added.  Currently in its second phase, the program consists of training in entrepreneurship, financial management and life skills, as well as behavioural change education in the areas of nutrition, health, and water, sanitation and hygiene. Each participant will receive a start-up grant of Tk15,000 ($180) and a monthly ration of 30kg of fortified rice during their training period. During the first phase of this program, which started in 2015, 8,000 rural women were provided with similar support. An evaluation of the first phase showed improvements in income, food security and dietary diversity of these women and their families. A positive change in their decision making ability was also observed. Run by the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, ICVGD is part of the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) program, which is the largest safety net program targeting extremely poor and vulnerable women and their households in Bangladesh."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-11 00:00:00      \nSave the Children chief has expressed her concern in a press release Former prime minister of Denmark and Chief Executive of Save the Children, Helle Thorning Schmidt has expressed fear that a whole generation of Rohingyas could be lost, due to lack of general education. She said 18 months ago she went to Cox's Bazar when thousands of Rohingyas were entering Bangladesh every day. She spoke to Rohingya refugee children who were forced to run for their lives in Myanmar and sought sanctuary in Bangladesh, a press release issued on Wednesday read. \"All efforts have been made to meet their basic needs, yet many children are to receive general education after one and a half year of exodus. I am worried that a whole generation of Rohingyas will be lost if the absence of children in the education system is continued.\" Schmidt said. Schmidt further praised the Bangladesh government and its people for showing generosity to nearly one million Rohingya refugees living in Cox's Bazar, more than half of whom are women and children.  She said: \"Bangladeshi people have shown immense compassion and risen to the challenge of hosting the world's largest refugee camp.  \"International-national, all the non-government organizations are doing their utmost for the refugees, but as the number of Rohingyas are growing, we believe the cooperation of the Bangladeshi people is also needed,\" The former Danish prime minister went onto say: \"Today, Save the Children is providing life-saving healthcare, food supplies and access to clean water and sanitation.   We are also providing education and child protection services for the most vulnerable children in the camps.  But we rely on the support of the Bangladeshi people, particularly the local host community of Cox's Bazar, whose lives have changed dramatically since the Rohingya crisis escalated nearly two years ago.\" \"Save the children eagerly wishes to work for Rohingyas along with Bangladeshis at any time.\" \"Save the Children stands shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh in responding to the needs of the Rohingya while they are in Bangladesh.  \"Together, we can uphold the dignity and rights of Rohingya refugees and the host community in Bangladesh while pursuing international justice for the crimes committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar,\" she added. On a two day visit with Save the Children Bangladesh Country Director Mark Pierce, Schmidt visited various activities in the refugee camps such as, \"Temporary Learning Centre,\" \"General Food Distribution Centre,\" \"Health and Nutrition Post,\" \"Child Friendly Space,\" \"Child Protection Case\" \"Management Office,\" and \"Health and Nutrition Office.\""

Originating from Dumur in the north eastern hilly region of India's Tripura state, the Gumti was once a hilly river of strong current. But the river has now lost its navigability, current and even its natural course. Locals say, since the river course was altered to save the town from concurrent floods, encroachers began constructing buildings, sewerage lines on its banks; gradually they closed in by piling up waste, to later claim the banks as their land. According to Comilla City Corporation sources, almost 258.74 acres of the river stretching from the Sadar upazila to Comilla municipality are now under the grasp of 522 listed land grabbers. Government land rented, sold  Land grabbers are relentless at renting, leasing, and selling these government owned riverine lands to locals providing them fake documents, locals said. Mizanur Rahman, a riverside house owner, said: \"I had to borrow money to buy this land. The previous owners did not provide any legal papers and now the district administration is trying to evict me from my home.  With Mizanur, Mobarak Hossain and multiple other house owners echoed the same concerns. Initiatives to revive it In a 2016 letter to the Additional Deputy Commissioner Abul Fazal Mir, Assistant Commissioner (Land) Md Shamim Hossain of Adarsha Sadar upazila, asked the authority to evict the illegal land grabbers and save the river. However, locals say, despite repetitive attempts by the authority, the situation remained the same, as they always failed to evict the illegal structures. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said: \"The district administration office is responsible to oversee the conservation of the river. However, the city corporation is looking to provide assistance in this regard. \"We hope the plan to restore the beauty of the Gumti River and make it a public recreational spot like Hatirjheel is soon approved,\" the mayor added."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-03 00:00:00      \nExport subsidy will only benefit the traders, not farmers, experts fear The price subsidy that the traders will get for exporting rice will cost government something in the range of Tk600 crore to Tk1,200 crore. Experts fear, it will not serve the purpose as it would only benefit the traders, not the paddy growers who have been suffering due to low paddy prices in the current Boro season. They rather ask government to utilize more funds on paddy purchase directly from the farmers.  The government announced last week to provide up to 30% export subsidy for private traders who will be exporting rice abroad. Government is hoping that once the export line opens it will help buoy up the market, dampened mostly because of rice glut due to carryover stocks from previous cheaper imports and high domestic output in two successive rice seasons -- Aman and Boro.       Agriculture Minister Dr Abdur Razzaque last Thursday declared the government's readiness to allow up to 1.5 million tons of rice export. Given the current poor demand of rice in international market, a rough estimate says the government would have to bear something between Tk600 crore to Tk1,200 crore as export subsidy, even if the millers and traders having big rice stocks manage to find export markets for 1.5 million tons of rice. To Dr Akhter Ahmed, who heads the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute's (IFPRI) Bangladesh operation, rice export is a poor proposition as it will only benefit the traders, not the farmers. \"Rather, I'll propose the government invest this money on buying paddy directly from farmers, convert the paddy to rice through millers and then preserve in public granaries,\" says Akhter, also the chief of party of the USAID-supported Policy Research and Strategy Support Program. Anwar Faruque, a former secretary of the Agriculture Ministry, also considers that government needed to inject more money on paddy procurement if it likes to mitigate the woes of Boro farmers during this season of Eid festival. He said, instead of procuring paddy following faulty farmers' list, the government should buy from farmers' cooperatives as is the case in India's West Bengal. 'Subsidy to hike rice price'  Market sources told Dhaka Tribune the traders, who got benefitted by importing cheaper rice from across the border taking the government's zero tariff advantage in 2017 and 2018, would benefit again by getting the export subsidy. After a government-declared one million tons of crop loss in 2017 haor floods, it allowed both public and private sector rice imports at zero tariff, thereby, flooding the domestic market with a record four million tons of import. Akhter Ahmed fears export of rice with price subsidy facility would rather result in high domestic rice prices; and will not help farmers getting fair price for their paddy. \"Now farmers are suffering from low paddy price and then (in case of rice export) the consumers will also suffer due to price hike of the staple in the domestic market,\" he said. As against the government's paddy procurement price of Tk1,040 a maund, farmers across the country are faring poorly by getting only Tk500 to Tk600 price offer from the traders and millers. As government plans to buy only 0.15 million tons of paddy from farmers and 1.1 million tons rice only from the millers, the fair price set by the government is having no impact in the market in this Boro season when farmers are expected to have grown nearly 20 million tons of rice. Moreover, the government took the rice export decision at a time when global demand for rice is fast shrinking with main players in the rice export markets India, Thailand and Vietnam getting nearly no fresh orders. In a presentation held at the Agriculture Ministry on May 20, Akhter Ahmed informed the government that paddy price declined to as low as Tk499 on May 19. \"Paddy price might further collapse once Boro harvest is completed,\" he feared. Also Read- Rice prices: A curious comparison - The answer is right next door \"The main objective of procurement should be to support prices for farm-level incentives. It is counterproductive to include other objectives, such as public stocks and distributional considerations such as safety net or disaster relief... \"However, at the operational level of the Food Department, building up foodgrain stocks is perceived to be the dominant purpose,\" the presentation stated. It also suggested: \"Rice procurement prices should be set and notified to farmers before rice planting season to enable farmers to make better land allocation decisions.\""

Lalmonirhat Sadar Upazila Nirbahi Officer Jayasree Rani Roy said: \"Flood affected people are being registered. Some relief supplies have been distributed among the affected people.\"  Lalmonirhat Deputy Commissioner Md Abu Zafar echoed the UNO's comments on relief distribution. Dalia, Lalmonirhat and Rangpur Water Development Board said it has been raining heavily since Monday, which is why the water level has risen. Due to the heavy rain fall, flooding has occurred in: Dohogram union, Goddimari in Hatibandha upazila, Saniazan, Shingimari, Dauwabari, Sindurna, Patikapara union, Bhotmari in Kaliganj upazila, Kakina union, Bhushbandar, Mohishkhucha union in Aditmari upazila, Khuniagach in Lalmonirhat sadar upazila, Panchagram, and Gokunda union.  Due to the flooding, people living in these areas are facing food and drinking water crises."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-05 00:00:00      \nWhat is the true cost of industrialization?  Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe are experiencing the hottest summer. The world has experienced about 0.8C rise since 1880.  Roughly, about 0.15-0.20C warming has occurred per decade since 1975, according to an ongoing temperature analysis conducted by scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). Temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5C between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace, and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures to curtail the increase. Rapid industrialization has led to the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which is warming the air and depleting the ozone layer.  We are falling victim to climate change, as deforestation intensifies to set up households and industries. Environmentalists suggest that a country should have at least 25% forest coverage to meet the ecological balance, but most countries around the world have less than 17%. It's spring in the Arctic, but ice is melting and the sea level is rising due to an early summer heat wave. Germany has also recorded the hottest day in their history with the temperature rising to 40C last month.  In Asia, extreme heat is also melting the Himalayan snow and causing natural disasters like cyclones and floods, causing climate-sensitive health hazards such as malnutrition, diarrheoa, cholera, and puts women at miscarriage risk with the rise of salinity in the water. World Bank in their report in 2013 cited Bangladesh as one of more \"potential impact hotspots\" threatened by extreme flood, more intense tropical cyclone, sea level rising etc.  World Health Organization (WHO) in their study cited the health consequences of climate change in Bangladesh. The extreme heat wave increases the chances of asthma, heatstroke, and skin cancer.  River water level rise causes unexpected nutrient deficiencies more in women and children as they have limited access during natural disasters. They can't access nutritious foods.  Hence, children suffer from stunted growth and weakness. They grow malnourished and live an unhealthy lifestyle.  They are affected with worms and other diseases. Besides children, women also suffer from malnutrition related diseases. As the custom of the country encourages women to give the nutritious food to the male members and take only the leftovers for themselves, they lack valuable nutrients.  During floods and other natural calamities, streams and rivers tend to get contaminated.  Water from unsafe sources cause the mortality rates of children under five and elderly people to rise, according to a study by WHO and Unicef. Water-logging is a common problem in coastal areas during heavy rain. Water-logging and rising temperatures may increase the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases.  Malaria, dengue, and other such diseases break into an epidemic. WHO in their study cited that pregnant women are twice as likely to be bit by mosquitoes than their non-pregnant counterparts.  There could be two possible physiological factors: First, women tend to produce more exhaled breath, and there are several hundred different components in human breath, which help mosquitoes detect a host. Second, during pregnancy, blood flow to the skin increases, which releases heat. The substances in the skin may also be the reason to attract mosquitoes.  Studies found that pregnancy-induced hypertension and eclampsia risks are very high when the temperature is high and the humidity is low.  Rural women are more prone to develop lung cancer, as they are exposed to burning coals and fossils for cooking.    Climate change has caused global sea levels to rise, a phenomenon that brings sea-water closer to freshwater sources, contaminating freshwater and soil with higher levels of salt. Elevated blood pressure was found more prevalent in some Bangladeshi coastal communities and an icddr,b study argues that higher water salinity levels, possibly triggered by climate change, may have a role in this. The government and private sectors collectively must implement afforestation programs to curb climate change related hazards.  The growth of industrialization has to be limited, especially in coastal areas, as the industrial wastes pollute the water and the emission of gases warm the air.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-20 00:00:00      \nFor over three decades a 500 ton stock of DDT has caused serious health hazards; UN FAO comes to the rescue   Thanks to a United Nations-led initiative, Bangladesh is finally getting rid of a huge cache of notoriously toxic and currently illegal pesticide, Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane or DDT, as it is commonly known. Thirty four years after the import of a sub-standard DDT consignment which has since been stored at Chattogram Government Medical Sub-depot (MSD), will soon be shipped out of the country and destroyed in an underground incinerator in Germany. Government will launch a USD 42 million project - 'Pesticide Risk Reduction in Bangladesh' - with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations on Thursday, under which USD 8.29 million will be spent to dispose of the DDT, officials of FAO and the Economic Relations Division (ERD) of the Finance Ministry told the Dhaka Tribune on Wednesday.  Global Environment Facility (GEF) is providing the DDT destroying fund. Established on the eve of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, GEF helps tackle the planet's most pressing environmental problems.   Once destroyed, Bangladesh will at last be freed from the trouble of stocking  such a big consignment of DDT, which for years has been polluting the environment causing serious health hazards. The development comes 21 years after Bangladesh officially banned DDT registration in the country, stopping local production and imports. The United States banned toxic DDT back in 1972 while a worldwide ban on its agricultural use as pesticide was banned under the Stock Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) since 2004.  In 1985, the Bangladesh government, with an Asian Development Bank (ADB) financed project, implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO), imported the DDT to fight a malaria epidemic. However, it was later found out to be not in compliance with the technical requirements and therefore, was stored in Chattogram MSD.  The stockpile has remained there since, where due to the adverse effects of a humid tropical climate on DDT molecular stability, the stock became severely degraded and largely obsolete. In addition, in 1991 the area was exposed to severe floods, greatly exacerbating the problem by flushing DDT into the surrounding environment.  Speaking on the DDT crisis at a city workshop last year, a then additional secretary of the ministry of environment forest and climate change said exposure to the stockpiled DDT might have caused cancer to at least two of his colleagues who later died. They were posted at the DDT stockyard at different points in time.  DDT persists in soil, water, and bio-accumulates in organisms through the food chain. Eventual consumption by humans has toxic and likely carcinogenic effects.  Bangladesh has one of the highest population densities of any country in the world and the port city of Chattogram is the second largest city of Bangladesh. The DDT stockpile is in the centre of the city.  According to the FAO, people living in slums surrounding the depot until recently, very likely have been exposed to DDT and the stockpile poses a very high risk to human health and the ecosystem.   FAO says: \"While DDT is banned for use as an agricultural pesticide, testing has shown high concentrations of DDT in dry fish, a common source of protein and the basis of many livelihoods in Bangladesh. DDT is being used in some areas of Bangladesh to prevent spoilage of fish in the drying process, demonstrating a severe lack of awareness of the negative impacts of DDT.\"  Why it took so long In Bangladesh there is neither strategy nor capacity for collecting and disposing of hazardous waste such as obsolete pesticides. National regulations and border customs practices have loopholes that allow hazardous substances to escape attention.    Following increased public awareness about the negative impacts of DDT like its spillage owing to floods, and the DDT contamination of dried fish, the government in recent years has tried to manage funds and capacity to dispose of the DDT.  The FAO project now intends, not only to rid Bangladesh of the toxic substance but also to support the country in updating its national regulations in keeping with the Stockholm Convention, and developing national capacity for the management and safe disposal of hazardous waste in order to safeguard people and the environment. The project objective is to reduce the risk to human and animal health and the environment from stockpiles of POPs and other obsolete pesticides, and from the ongoing excessive use of new POPs and other highly hazardous pesticides. The project has several components, which include: disposal of legacy stockpiles of POPs, governance and enforcement, and awareness and communication regarding pesticide use. It's not only DDT In addition to the 500 tons of DDT, there are another estimated 500 tons of other POPs in Bangladesh and the government-FAO partnership also aims to reduce the risk to human and animal health and the environment with an environmentally sound elimination of 1000 tons of POPs. The project will also work to ensure better management of empty pesticide containers, better food preservation and agricultural practices, and improved legislation for chemical management.  The project proposes collecting, cleaning up, and safely disposing of the large stockpile of obsolete DDT in Chattogram, and developing national capacity for emergency preparedness.  Furthermore, the project will work towards ensuring safe practices in the management of hazardous waste, risk assessment,  sampling and analysis in the field and laboratory, for environmental monitoring. The project also proposes piloting a collection and disposal/recycling strategy for empty pesticide containers with an initial 100 tons of containers to be collected and safely disposed of.  What is DDT? Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, commonly known as DDT, is a colorless, tasteless, and almost odorless crystalline chemical compound, originally developed as an insecticide, and ultimately becoming infamous for its environmental impacts.  It was first synthesized in 1874 by Austrian chemist Othmar Zeidler. DDT's insecticidal action was discovered by Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Muller in 1939. DDT was used in the second half of the Second World War to control malaria among civilians and troops. Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods in 1948.   In 1962 publication of Rachel Carson's book, \"Silent Spring,\" cataloged environmental impacts that coincided with the widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment with little prior investigation of their environmental and health effects. The book said that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the environmental movement and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States in 1972. "

Over the years, the magnitude and frequency of these natural disasters have intensified as a result of climate change hence contribute to huge economic losses. Since 1980, the country witnessed over 200 natural disasters, contributing to a total death toll of around 200,000 people and economic loss worth $17 billion. Given the poor economic development and financial support of the developed country, the country experiences difficulty in minimizing loss and damages. For example, the natural hazard events in Bangladesh resulted in economic losses of more than $10 billion from 2000 to 2013, but the total funding available for relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction for the said period was $2 billion only. Every year, the Conference of Parties (COP), which is a decision-making body, takes place to review and monitor the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). At COP 21, held in 2015, Paris, the developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion of new and additional finance each year to developing countries by 2020. In the latest report by the Standing Committee of Finance, which was submitted to the negotiators at COP 24, estimated that $55 billion climate fund was raised by developed countries in 2016. However, the report stated that only around a quarter of this amount was channeled towards adaptation efforts. This year, the 24th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 24) was held on December 15, 2018, in Katowice, Poland. Bangladesh, being a member country of the convention, has expressed concerns about the climate-induced loss and damage. The said topic has always been a debatable topic at the international climate change treaties. The reason could be attributed to the fact that there is no clear financial mechanism of addressing loss and damage. Also, the developed countries fear that the losses and damages incurred from the adverse impacts of climate change will be entirely borne by them. Climate-induced loss and damage are the manifestations of extreme climatic events as a result of persistent emissions of greenhouse gas contributed by the developed countries over the years. Hence, the developed countries fear that they will have to bear expenses of both current, past and future climate-induced loss and damages.  The provisions on loss and damage in the agreement of COP 24 have not been given due consideration and are not in favour of the vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh. The provision states that \"Each interested party may provide, as appropriate, information related to enhancing understanding, action and support, on a cooperative and facilitative basis, to avert, minimize and address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts\". The provision clearly indicate leniency in providing any kinds of supports to address loss and damage. The rules clearly stated \"Each interested party may provide...\"which indicates that the member countries or the developed countries have given some privilege to decide on the amount of financial and technological resources. In other words, the developed countries may or may not provide the amount of financial supports required by the developing countries.   At COP 25, which will be held in December 2019 in Santiago, Chile, the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM), which has been established to address climate-induced loss and damage, will be reviewed hence discussions will largely be centered on loss and damage. Now, it is imperative for Bangladesh to strategically explore possibilities and avenues to address loss and damage. Also create an enabling environment to attract climate funds and enhance budgetary allocations to adaptation efforts. Concerns over inadequate climate funds to address climate change adaptation and loss and damage are required to be re-emphasized. Also showcase our mitigation efforts such as adoption of battery-run three wheelers, solar energy, etc across country. Such efforts would facilitate to uphold our image at the international climate change arena. COP 24 was merely a war of words. It is imperative for Bangladesh to do some preparatory work for the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and put forward all its claims in an articulated and diplomatic manner at COP 25.

The Habiganj Rice Research Institute took the initiative to plant these crops on an experimental basis and the success rate has now inspired several other farmers to cultivate it as well.  Farmland at Gungiajuri haor of Habiganj is always vulnerable to flooding, which is why hundreds of farmers from Abdullahpur area of Sadar upazila went for this different approach.  The production rate was higher and farmers were able to harvest beforehand in comparison to regular crops. Local union parishad member Shrikanto Das said: \"There is massive production compared to previous years and crops, too are safe from floods now. This success has inspired many other farmers to cultivate these crops.\" Farmer Salim Ullah said: \"Last year I cultivated 80 maunds of paddy on 42,768 square feet of land, this year almost 100 maunds of paddy were produced on the same land. Also Read- USDA: Rice output continues to see growth  \"Regular crops have not yet fully grown whereas the hybrid 58 rice is already harvested,\" he added.   Another farmer Rahim Mia added: \"The first cultivation of hybrid rice 5 and 58 has shown a huge success rate and from the next time, more of these crops will be produced.\" Dr. Rafiqul Islam, senior scientist of Habiganj Rice Research Institute said: \"When hybrid rice 5 is cultivated in flood risk areas, production rates are expected to double.\" Planning Officer of this project and also the Chief Executive of local NGO ASED Jafar Iqbal Chowdhury said: \"The high production rate of the hybrid crops has inspired farmers to produce more and the beneficial part is these crops are ready for harvest a week before other crops.\" Chief Scientist of Gazipur Rice Research Institute Dr Rumana Yeasmin came to visit the fields and said: \"These hybrid crops were invented for flood risk areas and they have show great results.  \"Farmers are really satisfied with this high production rate,\" she added."

Cox's Bazar is one of the most disaster-prone districts of Bangladesh. UN agencies - International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), and the World Food Programme (WFP) - have been working with the government to further develop local capacity to respond to recurring disasters. The second phase, which was launched on Tuesday, will further reinforce and rehabilitate cyclone shelters, strengthen local capacity, preparedness, and resilience, and strengthen social cohesion, the agencies said in a joint statement.  File photo of Rohingya women and children in a camp in Cox Bazar Mahmud Hossain Opu/ Dhaka Tribune UN agencies said they are working closely with the government as well as the Cox's Bazar district Disaster Management Committee to strengthen the local community's resilience and capacity to face recurrent disasters. \"IOM is very pleased with yet another partnering initiative with the Government of Bangladesh, our sister UN agencies and other partners, this time to contribute to tackling Disaster Risk Reduction in the host communities,\" Manuel Pereira, IOM deputy chief of Mission in Bangladesh, said.  He said infrastructure improvements and capacity strengthening of communities to take the lead in disaster preparedness and lifesaving response is a priority for IOM. \"Our commitment to Bangladesh capacity to mitigate and, when needed, self-response to disasters is unequivocal,\" he said. Distressed rohngya women and children at a camp in Cox Bazar Dhaka Tribune/Mahmud Hossain Opu  Peter Guest, emergency coordinator for WFP in Cox's Bazar, said rehabilitating the cyclone shelters is just part of their disaster risk reduction activities in the coastal district. \"Mitigating the impact of disasters and ensuring vital access points remain open is critical to maintaining food security in the region,\" he said. Guest noted that Bangladesh is facing an increasing number of weather-related disasters as the effects of climate change worsen \"which makes it even more important to ensure that local communities are empowered and resilient when facing disasters.\" The launch was followed by a two-day Disaster Risk Reduction workshop that sought to create linkages between local, national, and international disaster reduction actors. Head of Operations for UNHCR in Cox's Bazar Marin Din Kajdomcaj said UNHCR and partners continue to improve their preparedness capacity for extreme weather events. File photo of Rohingya people Migrating to different camps in Cox Bazaar Dhaka Tribune/MAHMUD HOSSAIN OPU \"UNHCR has put refugees at the centre of the response through skill trainings and the provision of basic tools [and the] results are already showing,\" he said. \"While joint projects underway have massively reduced the risk of floods, landslides and the loss of life, much more remains to be achieved, through the exchange of knowledge and best practices, improvement of coordination and simulation exercises,\" Kajdomcaj said."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-06 00:00:00      \nBD Clean has an inspiring vision of cleaning up the streets of Bangladesh BD Clean - which inspires to turn Bangladesh into a cleaner and healthier nation - is Bangladesh's biggest mass-action environmental campaign and was first launched in 2016.  In July in 2016, a group of passionate youth roaming through Gulshan, collected waste and garbage by themselves with a higher purpose amid the heightened security.  Police and members of law enforcement agencies offered cooperation and did not bar the youths from cleaning the city's posh neighbourhood, considering their noble intention. In the early hours of June 3 in 2016, a group of 24 youths started their mission from Dhaka's Shahbagh intersection - whose selfless acts of determination has now fanned across the country, reaching 54 districts.  BD Clean draws its strength from the support of selfless volunteers |Courtesy The campaign started off by clearing litter from footpaths, fields, river banks and roadsides throughout Dhaka. The campaign also garnered publicity through the use of posters and other activities, highlighting the importance of cleaning up the city.  Their core message is that Bangladesh will become clean through the actions of its own people.  As more and members have been inspired to engage community volunteering in order to bring about a significant positive change in the society, the member count of BD Clean has risen to a whopping 17,246 as of July 2019. BD clean, a youth voluntary organization, tends to create mass awareness on the importance of having a clean environment and its benefits. To achieve that goal, it draws its strength from the support of selfless volunteers. These members consist of youth from different communities, who partake in social, charitable and environmental activities on a voluntary basis. The group encourages people to put waste material into litter bins. The central message is one of individual responsibility.  The founder's vision Farid Uddin, the founder of BD Clean, believes that education and awareness are of utmost importance, if we are to successfully keep our environment green and clean. A graduate from Dhaka University, he drew immense attention to his work through the use of social media.  Talking to Dhaka Tribune, the highly ambitious student of Fine Arts expressed his profound determination towards his goal and of optimism about the future of the country.  He said: \"It is the duty of all to keep his or her own neighbourhood clean. The citizens themselves can keep the capital and other cities clean. No directives or government actions would do any good unless people realize, by being conscientious members of the society, the urgency of a cleaner and safer Bangladesh.\" Funding, operations, campaigns The organization has identified two sources of funding. Primarily, the organization started functioning through own funding, and later also received charitable donations from various organizations, which arrange cleaning programs and competitions in the educational institutions.  Meanwhile, given the  ongoing floods and erosion along the main river banks of the country, BD Clean has already launched campaigns in flood affected areas and hosted awareness events. Recently, an eight-week campaign titled \"Clean Campus, Green Campus\" is being held at 1,453 educational institutions across Bangladesh.  Each team, consisting of 101 members, represented different schools and colleges. These teams ran awareness campaigns about waste management, and highlighted the fact that keeping our neighbourhoods clean is beneficial for everyone.  They also encouraged the education institutions to cover at least 20% of their premises with green trees. Following successful campaigns, a vast majority of the institutions have taken steps to use dust bins.  Moreover, the students, inspired by BD Clean, took photographs of how much they have cleaned and shared the photographs on social media, said Farid. For Dhaka city, BD Clean delegated two coordinators, one each for Dhaka North and Dhaka South. Farid draws inspiration from the language movement in 1952 and the Liberation War in 1971.   He said: \"Our youths took charge of their destiny, and transformed challenges into motivation and courage in 1952 and 1971. I think change may not be possible immediately but transformation of our society is very much possible if the youth come forward. \"I have a dream of developing a 'Clean Bangladesh' for the next generation of youths by 2021 - the golden jubilee of Bangladesh's independence.\" "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-17 00:00:00      \nClimate change is real, and it's here The Kalboishakhi storm is one of the main indicators of the arrival of the Bengali New Year, or \"Pohela Boishakh\" in Bangladesh.  Pohela Boishakh marks the beginning of the New Year, and the beginning of summer. The Kalboishakhi storm happening earlier may very well indicate that summer is arriving earlier in Bangladesh. The scientific research on Bangladesh is sparse, but climate change being a global phenomenon, a lot can be inferred from the research that is based on other areas of the world. According to scientific records and media reports, summer is arriving earlier every year in Europe as well. The early occurrence of the Kalboishakhi this year in Bangladesh may indicate the same thing happening here. The implications of this are major -- it means that climate change is no longer the big bad thing in the future, but something that is happening right now. It is here, and knocking at our doorstep. Most articles on climate change published in the Western media include suggestions on what the reader can do to combat climate change. This makes sense, because even though climate change can be natural, what we are facing now is human-induced climate change.  But does this same idea apply to the average Bangladeshi reader? If the main reason behind climate change is the greenhouse gas emissions caused by industrialization, surely Bangladesh, being such a young and small country, has had little to do with that. Bangladesh has contributed a minuscule percentage of the greenhouse gases that are present in the atmosphere today, but it is one of the countries that are at greatest risk from climate change. The developed countries of the world that are responsible for the industrial age and subsequent global warming have had their chance to develop and prosper, and will no doubt feel the brunt of climate change, but so will we.  A small nation that has faced so many atrocities will face more. Climate change is going to bring many disasters to Bangladesh. Farmers will suffer as crop production is affected by untimely storms and frequent floods. River erosion, which is already common in Bangladesh, will become more frequent.   Many people will become displaced, and this will lead to a growing number of \"climate change refugees.\" As evidenced by the Rohingya crisis, no country (except maybe Bangladesh) wants a large number of refugees. It can be said that moving Bangladeshi climate change refugees overseas will not be an option. Therefore, we can look forward to more overcrowding of already overcrowded areas. The current Bangladeshi government has done a lot to secure funds to help us combat climate change. There is nothing we can do to stop climate change at this point, but we can make the best of the funds and resources available to us in order to help mitigate the effects of climate change.  Many disaster-prone areas of Bangladesh have evacuation plans in place for residents, which help to reduce casualties. Such work needs to continue, as disaster-preparedness is the only thing that can make the future better for all Bangladeshis.  With many countries opting for green energy and international funds being channeled to countries like Bangladesh, it is not all doom and gloom. There are steps that can be taken to minimize the effects of climate change. It is now a matter of taking them with efficiency and speed.  Something as small as the early arrival of Kalboishakhi can indicate that urgent action is necessary. More scientific research on this matter is also required, as in the swift communication of such information on mass media.  Proma Gulshan is Editorial Assistant at the Dhaka Tribune."

Crops on 5,880 hectares of land in various upazilas are about to be ruined by three days of untimely rains, lasting from Wednesday to Saturday. If favourable weather conditions continue,an estimated 26,460 metric tons of farming output is expected. But due to the recent and unfavourable turn in the weather, officers of the agriculture division and local farmers fear that the above goal may not be reached. Farmers recently planted their winter crops to recoup the losses caused by two recent floods.  Unfortunately the recent rains, locusts, and rot have all negatively affected their crops. In many areas, the paddy has also gone underwater. Masud Karim, assistant agriculture officer of Puthia upazila, said: \"At this moment, most of the paddy on the lands have ripened. And when the paddy ripens, the roots of the paddy  naturally soften, and the head becomes heavy from the fresh blooming sheaf of paddy. Added to that, with the rain and the accompanying winds, the paddy has fallen into the water some areas. But at this time,we are advising farmers to drain water from the lands. Those lands that are underwater have a greater probability of producing less.\"  Crops on 300 hectares of land in different upazilas are about to be ruined by three days of untimely rains. Farmers recently planted their winter crops to recoup the losses caused by two consecutive floods in two phases. Now they are facing a tough situation with the winter crops which have gone under rainwater. According to the Faridpur Met Office, 32 mm of rain was recorded in the district on Friday and Saturday. Vvisiting Charmadhobdia, Aliabad, Ombikapur unions of Sadar upazila, this correspondent found waterlogged fields of crops and vegetables, including 'Muri-kata' onions. Farmers fear the biggest losses with a damaged onion crop.  If the rainwater doesn't drain from the land quickly it will cause huge losses to farmers, said some local farmers. Kartik Chandra Chakraborty, agriculturalist at the Department of Agricultural Extension, Faridpur said: \"Various types of crops have been damaged. Farmers of 'Muri-kata' onion and winter crops will be the worst affected by the rains,\" he said."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-28 00:00:00      \n'If there is a flash flood in the haor areas, storm water flows down to the Meghna River through the Kushiyara River, and ilish enters Hakaluki from the Meghna' Fishermen of Moulvibazar are pocketing good profits, as ilish are being netted in an abundant number in the Hakaluki Haor. A beam of satisfaction is seen in the faces of thousands of fishermen, and they are passing busy time with cheerful mood. Traders as well as fishermen remain busy round the clock in unloading the delicious fish from boats, and supplying those to wholesale markets across Bangladesh. According to Kulaura Upazila Fisheries Department, fishermen have been netting ilish in the haor areas since 2016. Ilish was a hard catch in the last three years, but due to this year's abundant flash floods, and persistent rain, the Kushiyara River over-flowed, and ilish, along with other freshwater fish, entered Hakaluki Haor. Local fishermen Moyna Mia, Masuk, and Keramot Ali told Dhaka Tribune that on a few occasions they caught ilish weighing up to 900 grams. But usually most of the catch was smaller in size, and weighed between 300 and 600 grams. Mohammad Sultan Mahmud, fisheries officer in Kulaura upazila of Moulvibazar, said: \"If there is a flash flood in the haor areas, storm water flows down to the Meghna River through the Kushiyara River, and ilish enters Hakaluki from the Meghna.\" He further said the 65-day ban on fishing in the Bay of Bengal also contributed to the abundant quantity of ilish this year.  Fish traders of Achurighat, Chidrat Ali, Moshabbir Ali, and Kirendranath said, Hakaluki Haor is booming with all kinds of fishes because the Ministry of Fisheries And Livestock (MOFL) released a large amount of fish larvae in the haor. Price of ilish is also decreasing in the local markets as plenty of ilish is being netted. Its price in wholesale markets now range between Tk 500-600 per kg depending on size. Sirajuddin Ahmed Badshah, chief of a Moulvibazar-based local organization that works to protect the haor and the farmers, and preserve natural resources, said: \"Large ilish were a common catch in the haor and Kushiyara River in the past. But since the Buri Keari embankment was installed, ilish are left on the other side, and fishermen were unable to catch enough fish.\" \"If the embankment is demolished, and other water bodies dredged, larger quantity of ilish would have been available, and we could have enriched our bio-diversity as well,\" he added. Dr Mrittunjay Kundu, professor of Sylhet Agricultural University's Aquatic Resource Management Department, said: \"It is unusual for ilish to change their direction, and lay eggs in the haor. It will be a milestone if ilish can be aqua-cultured in the haor. \"Though in haor, ilish cannot grow to their fuller size as much as the flowing-water ilish, we should do more research for aquafarming ilish in large water bodies like a haor.\" Dr Mrittunjay further added: \"Haors are getting polluted because of the insecticides used by paddy farmers. Biodiversity of these areas are at a huge risk due to unscrupulous use of harmful chemicals.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-27 00:00:00      \nThe meeting was facilitated by Imrul Hasan Khan, Director, Programmes and Operations, RedOrange Media and Communications RedOrange Media and Communications and Dhaka Tribune jointly organized a consultative meeting, titled \"Reflection on MHM Learning: National MHM Strategy.\" Md Zahirul Islam, Additional Secretary of the Local Government Division under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operatives, was present as the chief guest at the event, which was chaired by Rokeya Kabir, Chair of Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) Platform and Executive Director of BNPS. The meeting was facilitated by Imrul Hasan Khan, Director, Programmes and Operations, RedOrange Media and Communications. The meeting's objective was to share information, opportunities and challenges of MHM among stakeholders in order to help formulate The National MHM Strategy. Mahbuba Haque Kumkum, Programme Manager, Simavi Based on Ritu Program's findings, two topics stood out -- education and wash. When dealing with menstruation, we needed an improved educational channel to disseminate correct scientific data. An obstacle to this is a mother taboo that claims that menstrual blood is polluted. Breaking this one will remove 80% of all taboos. To that end, we needed to create a sustainable source for correct information in order to educate our youth. So we focused on educating schoolteachers and families as the primary source of information, producing effective results.  Furthermore, education officers should monitor how effectively teachers are educating students on sensitive issues, including but not limited to menstrual hygiene. We also need to improve the school wash systems. We have tried to build awareness in this regard, and we felt that an information dissemination system to let the schools and community know about the budget for realizing MHM toilets should be developed between the local government and the school and community to produce the best results. Nakib Rajib Ahmed, Head of Programmes, RedOrange Media and Communications Lack of awareness is the root cause behind every taboo, misconception and social stigma around menstruation, and a significant aspect of the Ritu Program is building that awareness and advocacy around menstrual hygiene management on a national level. Working on this, we have learned two major things. First, on a national level, using edutainment and infotainment involving mass and social media campaigns have a big impact in raising awareness. We produced a 13-episode reality TV show, where we learned that if we can get the target audience directly involved, it gathers massive acceptance and credibility. If these people are talking about it publicly, then the taboo is broken to a large extent and people can start having a more positive outlook on menstruation. The second most noteworthy learning comes from our journalist fellowship program, where we provided orientation to 90 journalists. It had a transformative effect on these journalists, and now they identify MHM as a significant aspect of women's health, which has, in turn, inspired them to write extensive news reports on the topic.

Mahjabeen Ahmed, WASH Specialist, UNICEF National hygiene promotion strategy of Bangladesh has emphasized on menstrual hygiene. When national hygiene surveys are conducted, a number of indicators are included which paints a clear picture of the situation. Within its support to ensure the sustainability, UNICEF has suggested to include very important elements in the strategy: informing  girls on menstrual hygiene issues at early age before  menstruation starts, operation and maintenance of WASH facilities at schools and other institutions, emergency preparedness plan eg during natural disasters, reinforcement of public-private partnership, disposal methods at homes, schools and workplaces, community engagement for breaking taboos, making appropriate use of  technological advancements, development of appropriate and gender sensitive IEC/BCC materials, involvement of men as they have many important roles in the society such as father, husband, colleague, classmate and professionals and better knowledge management through dissemination of best practices of different stakeholders. Dr Ikhtiar Uddin Khandaker, Head of Health Programme, Plan International Bangladesh We have focused our SRHR efforts in hard to reach locations like coastal and hilly areas. We should continue to create partnerships with the union council. In our experience, it has produced better results since these councils have a budget allocated exclusively for SRHR; they even helped install toilets. With regard to informing students about MHM, we suggest creating interactive and engaging channels apart from the standard curriculum. This allows students to feel more interested and helps them absorb the information better. Md. Zahirul Islam, Additional Secretary, Local Government Division The government is in the process of creating an MHM strategy through a working committee with me as its chairperson. In this meeting, we have already discussed the need for awareness, infrastructure, regulatory reform, availability of products and pads, and budget allocations, and I am certain these discussions will bear fruit. Menstruation is a natural phenomenon and our people's representatives, guardians, parents, teachers and religious authorities need to exercise an ideal social perspective toward it. To bring this about, we need an all-encompassing social movement with the Ritu Program as the pioneer behind it whose experience can prove invaluable to us. I would request every institution to include madrasas whenever they are working to create MHM awareness in schools. Since madrasas are managed by the government, it is often easier to work with them than with schools. With Islam having specific guidelines related to menstruation, we need to work on sensitizing our religious leaders as well, thus removing religious obstacles currently predominant in society. Private contributions outweigh government contribution in case of MHM because the government does not have sufficient resources to take a financial lead on this. The government will focus on vulnerable groups and be responsible for their development. Lastly, I would like to point out that our communication regarding MHM has become primarily English-centric and I suggest that we make a comprehensive Bangla version available as well. This will help increase reach and is likely to produce far more effective results. Mahfuj-ur Rahman, Equity and Rights Specialist at WaterAid Bangladesh We have been working on a project called WASH in School since November 2016 with the aim to address WASH inequalities at secondary school and madrasas across the country. At the initial phase, the project encompasses approximately 350 secondary schools and madrasas from 76 upazilas in greater Rangpur, Sylhet and Dhaka division. In our experience, infrastructure is crucial for MHM, that is why we tried to follow a gender-friendly inclusive model and it has seen significant development over the years. An integral part of it is an exclusive restroom reserved for MHM, primarily because although there are latrines in most schools, such restroom that allows changing sanitary pad is not available almost anywhere. On disposal, the ministry circular states that every school needs to have a lidded bin exclusively for pad disposal. But carrying that bin away for further disposal becomes an issue. That is why we came up with a sustainable plan -- the bin would house a pit behind it to collect pads. In about three years when the pit is filled to capacity, these pads will get incinerated. These restrooms are also equipped with washing and drying facilities of sanitary materials. Md. Enamul Haque, Joint Secretary, Education Ministry Under the Ministry of Education, we have 10,000 madrasas covering 100,000 students. There are plans for 1,800 more madrasa buildings, and according to our SDGs, each building should have at least two wash blocks. MHM is often not in focus as a part of the fourth SDG and to address that, we should include the madrasa training centre in our strategy. Md. Iqbal Hussain, Joint Secretary, Women and Children Affairs Ministry It is an undeniable fact that MHM is still a taboo in our country. Last year, our ministry carried out a project to ensure adolescent girls' menstrual health by producing and distributing sanitary napkins. I was appointed as the project director, but after doing a little research, I notified the ministry that it would be difficult for me to carry out my responsibilities the project's sensitive nature. Later, a woman was appointed in my place. We have to acknowledge these realities when dealing with MHM. Dr Bilkish Begum, Deputy Secretary, Health Services Division  Speaking of hygiene management, in the Health Ministry, women starting from the rank of deputy secretary all the way to peons do not have access to a toilet exclusively reserved for ladies. As a workaround, we use the library toilet and that too takes some effort. I hope this will be addressed in the near future. Dr Mahbubur Rahman, Project Coordinator, EIU, icddr,b In the national hygiene surveys of 2015 and 2018, hygiene product usage rates showed 85% of all women used cloth pads. In 2018, sanitary pad usage increased, bringing cloth pad usage to 73%. The usage of sanitary pads was most prevalent among adolescents. In one research, we gave both cloth and sanitary pads to schools to determine preference patterns. Results showed a preference for both. The challenge with cloth pads was drying and washing while that of sanitary pads was the availability of proper disposal methods. Increased MHM awareness in schools also decreased absenteeism to an extent. We need to orient girls and women on how to use these pads hygienically. We also need to focus on making these products as biodegradable as possible and help facilitate the pad disposal process. Zobair Hasan, Director, DORP We started bringing MHM to the forefront of discussion since 2014. Of the 11 directives issued in a 2015 circular, the first stated that there will be sufficient fund allocation for MHM. As in a few other cases, there is no exclusive budget allocation for MHM; it is fragmented over multiple allocations. The 2019 Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation report states that 80% of the country's health and sanitation costs are borne by families. The case is quite similar for schools as well. We look forward to seeing our government create a policy that will acknowledge our recommendations. In our 17 SDGs, the fourth SDG states that women should have separate toilet facilities and we should work to achieve this goal by providing this facility all over the country. The SDG Planning Commission has allocated a budget which amounts to Tk1,186 per individual. Our local representatives need to be aware of this since the budget needs to be implemented in the grassroots. Reaz Ahmad, Executive Editor, Dhaka Tribune Objectively speaking, we need to acknowledge that we are not doing too badly as far as providing basic hygiene necessities are concerned. Comparatively, in many rural areas of India, women do not have access to proper toilets, let alone MHM facilities. Almost 100% of our country has access to some form of hygiene facility. Putting the three stakeholders -- our government, NGOs and charities account for 33% of the total health budget. That means 67% of our health expenditure is out of pocket, which is one of the highest in the world. Since the '70s, we have been getting exceedingly better at health management even through natural disasters such as cyclones and floods. But, we need to prioritize on addressing how people slip back into poverty because they cannot cope with the high health budget. The irrational levels of VAT applied to MHM products and ingredients only contribute to the problem. Removing these taxes will benefit not just women but future generations. Issues such as MHM and early marriage need to be addressed immediately, otherwise, we will not be able to begin reducing malnutrition and stunted growth for our future generations. Nasrin Begum, Unite for Body Rights We are working to incorporate MHM strategies in the NCTB curriculum. NCTB has announced that after 2020, the books up to 10th grade will include MHM and SRHR as a part of life-skill education. We need to try to incorporate SRHR and MHM in the public and private teachers' training institutions; only then can we have a major impact on a large group of adolescents. Lastly, we should develop a few web-based tools as part of the strategy in order to virtually connect to every adolescent in the country. Alok Majumder, Country Coordinator, WAI, Simavi MHM should not be simply about women since it affects reproductive health and thus our entire future generation. According to a 2019 government report with survey data from 2013 and 2018, although 84% schools have latrines, only 22% have access to soap and water and only 13% has MHM systems in place. Among these latrines in schools, 55% remain locked which needs to change. The previous survey showed 40% absenteeism and the current survey shows a 10% decrease, which is a sign of good progress. Currently, the ratio for the number of students to toilets is 187 to 1, while our government's target is to take this ratio to 50 to 1. Md. Abdur Rauf, Joint Secretary, Policy Support Branch, Local Government Division The National Hygiene Promotion Strategy 2012, the first legal document on MHM, first saw the inclusion of MHM in Bangladesh. One of the 10 strategies mentioned in it was the Behaviour and Social Change Communication (BSCC) strategy and its primary focus was personal hygiene including menstrual hygiene. Previously we did not have any data on the state of menstrual hygiene. So in 2014, we conducted a survey under the local government in collaboration with icddr,b and Water Aid.  The results showed that 86% of all women use cloth pads and over 30% are not aware of MHM until it happens to them. However, our most recent survey data, which is yet to be published, shows that the percentage of women using cloth pads has dropped by 13%. In 2018, we had met at Sonargaon hotel to observe the Menstrual Hygiene Management Day where we witnessed a rather strong demand for the creation of a legal instrument for MHM. After prolonged deliberations, we now have created a guideline that will help develop the National MHM Strategy. Fazal Mahmud, Manager, Marketing, Square Toiletries Ltd Before going to our recommendations, I would like to thank Bangladesh government and NBR for their care for female hygiene and declaring SRO to withdraw supplementary duty. However, we believe that this caring attitude will be reflected further to remove Custom Duty on Raw Materials; some of the major raw materials, such as Airlaid, PE Film, SAP etc. still have a CD of 25%, 10% and 10% respectively. Also, if the prevailing 15% VAT is removed from production stage, it would help companies to offer lower priced sanitary napkin. From Square Toiletries Limited, we are trying to make our napkins more environment-friendly. To do that, we need significant assistance from our government, particularly because the necessary raw materials will have to be imported. India launched a biodegradable sanitary pad in March 2018 which costs only Rs 2.5 since it is heavily subsidized by the Indian government. It would be good if our government adopts similar practices and extend its assistance to produce and promote such environment friendly solution across the country.  On the topic of ensuring availability and disposing sanitary napkin, we have a few initiatives in place. One such initiative is educating around 100,000 students annually and making sure their parents are notified of this MHM awareness program. Availability of pads in educational institutes or working places is an infrastructural issue and lack of eagerness is also there; even though we are pursuing to build a channel to keep products available at these places, a government order would bring more pace to ensure access of sanitary napkin for every girl. Mahiul Kadir, Executive Director, Hope for the Poorest If we divide the girls and women relevant for MHM into three broad categories -- we have those who have no knowledge regarding menstruation, the ones who are aware but do not have the resources to acquire necessary pads, and ones who are exercise MHM in an ideal manner.  A secondary target group would then be parents and siblings with teachers and leader groups as part of the community. The tertiary group would consist of the media which can focus on creating a link between policymakers and beneficiaries. Then there are organizations like the MHM Platform that addresses such issues, and lastly, there are cultural and social activists that can help create an enabling environment. Furthermore, we need an intervention from the government so that we can have a separate and exclusive entity to address MHM issues. Prof Dr Md Abdul Mannan, Director (Secondary), Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education The curriculum that was developed in 2011 for pre-primary to Class XII included assessment strategies and teaching-learning approaches. But we have not been able to transition from a result-based education to a learning-based one  because we could not implement the continuous assessment mentioned in the curriculum. Over the years, we have witnessed much development from a makeshift latrine to a toilet and now we have requirements for a wash block. But in order to achieve the fourth SDG, we are in dire need of continuous assessment. Mushfiqua Zaman Satiar, Senior Policy Adviser, SRHR and Gender, The Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands The Ritu Program had a target of creating an MHM policy and it is evident through this dialogue that the initiative is already underway. Through our research projects, we have noticed how girls drop out due to MHM issues. This drop out leads to early marriage and that, in turn, leads to early pregnancy which proves detrimental for them in the long run. These limitations are restraining the women in our society from keeping up with men in terms of progress and development. Unfortunately, the project outline stated that we are to start with HSC students, whereas girls in Class IV often experience menstruation. So we believe girls should be made aware at a much earlier age. We should also focus on alleviating the shock that accompanies experiencing menstruation for the first time."

A bamboo bridge was built in its place now being used regularly by auto rickshaws, motorcycles and rickshaw-vans. Locals fear the bamboo bridge might collapse anytime as it is unsteady and shakes when a vehicle crosses it. According to District Relief and Rehabilitation Office sources, the contractor company Molla Enterprise had built the Rangachira Bridge in FY2016-17, at a cost of Tk22 lakh. \"The tender issued for the Rangachira Bridge did not include any instructions for piling. So, the bridge had collapsed due to its weak foundation during the recent floods in the area,\" said former union parishad chairman Badiuzzaman Faruk.   \"The bridge collapsed in July this year because it did not have any reinforced cement concrete (RCC) pillars,\" said Abdus Sattar Azad, Awami League's Kakua Union unit president. Auto-rickshaw driver Minhaz Uddin, who has to drive his vehicle regularly on the bamboo bridge, said: \"The collapse of the concrete bridge have caused much inconvenience to the people here in the char areas. It needs swift reconstruction.\" Kakua UP Chairman Md Ali Jinnah said: \"The temporary bamboo bridge was financed from my private funds to curb the commute trouble.\" He added that a letter was sent to the Upazila Engineer and MP for the construction of a brand new bridge in the area. Tangail District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Abdul Gani said: \"Tenders has been issued for reconstructing broken bridges across the district. We will construct the bridges upon considering their priority.\""

Generations of building skills have made these homes aesthetically pleasing, temperate and comfortable The Machang house is a shared tradition among the various ethnic communities of Chittagong Hill Tracts, despite the diverse customs and unique crafts. The houses are built with chhan and bamboos on elevated platforms. Generations of building skills have made these homes aesthetically pleasing, temperate and comfortable. With the proliferation of modern building materials, however, Machang houses are in decline. Even though these traditional houses can still be seen in many villages in the hills, builders and locals say people are no longer choosing to make them, opting instead for modern dwellings. According to people from these communities, the original purpose of the elevated houses, which often stand on 5-6 feet of braced bamboo stilts, was to protect the homes from wildlife and flash floods. The space under the platform is also used to shelter livestock. The chhan, which along with bamboo was the main material for building these houses, was once in high demand in the three hill districts. With changing agricultural practices, the volume of chhan cultivation is decreasing and prices of the material have gone up. Mong Sha Prue Marma, a resident of Trakkhiyang Para, said bamboos and trees are not readily available from the forests, and bamboo in the markets is very expensive. \"This is the reason Machang houses are in decline,\" he said. The platforms of Machang houses are supported on bamboo frames, with the main pillars often made from trees. Sometimes large bamboo stilts are also used. The diagonal supports are tied to the pillars with 'bet,' or strips made from young bamboo.  Despite the rich customs and distinct architecture of the Machang houses, ethnic communities have lost their interest in building Machangs because of the dearth and high price of materials. With this crisis, these architectural heritages are at risk of being lost from the local culture. Kasyimong Marma, a student of Bandarban Government College, said even people who can afford these houses will not build them these days as they do not last more than three to four years. \"So even if it is a little more expensive, those who are well-off prefer to build brick-and-concrete houses.\" One has to go to Trakkhiyang Para, ieght kilometres out of Bandarban town, before they can spot the first Machang house. But then. even in this out-of-the-way village, modern dwellings are taking over. In a cluster at the village's centre, brick houses have mushroomed in the last few years. Bandarban Tribal Cultural Institute Research Officer Uchnu said Machangs were going extinct mostly owing to relocation of the communities, and unavailability of the traditional building materials. \"We need coordinated public and private effort if we are to sustain this heritage,\" he said."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-26 00:00:00      \nArif and Sumit are the first Bangladeshis to get selected for the prestigious mentoring program which connects filmmakers with leading US entertainment professionals  Bangladeshi filmmakers Arifur Rahman and Rezwan Shahriar Sumit have been invited to Film Independent's Global Media Makers (GMM) program in Hollywood, Los Angeles, according to a recent exclusive report by Hollywood Reporter. They are the first Bangladeshis to be selected for the prestigious program which connects film talent such as writers, directors, and producers, with leading US entertainment professionals through workshops and master classes. The program which initially focused on mentoring talent from the Middle East and North Africa, will bring 18 participants from selected regions of the world to LA for a six week residency program starting October. This is the first time Film Independent, creator of the prestigious Spirit Award, has included filmmakers from South Asia for its annual Global Media Makers program. GMM was launched in 2016 as a partnership between Film Independent and the US Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs which focused on mentoring film talent from countries in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa).  This year GMM expanded into South Asia with a total of 18 candidates: nine men and nine women selected from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Lebanon.  Selected participants are awarded a yearlong fellowship starting with a six-week residency in Hollywood, LA, starting October 1.  This year's mentors include Andrew Ahn (Spa Night), Jay Duplass (Room 104), Nicole Perlman (Guardians of the Galaxy), Justin Simien (Dear White People), Mary Sweeney (Mulholland Drive), Lulu Wang (The Farewell) and Bradford Young (Selma). 49 GMM fellows have participated in the past four years, leading to eight produced projects. Among those projects, Egyptian producer Hossam Elouan's 'You Will Die at Twenty' was praised in Venice and Toronto. Tunisian filmmaker Nejib Belkhadi's Look at Me and Turkish filmmaker Ali Vatansever's Saf, also premiered in Toronto, and Egyptian filmmaker Amr Salama's Sheikh Jackson was Egypt's official 2017 submission to the Academy Awards. The master classes and sessions focus on screenwriting, creative producing, and documentary filmmaking, where participants develop their ongoing projects with US mentors, with industry sessions, and field trips to major entertainment companies. These include Netflix, Stage13/Warner Bros., ARRAY and HBO, including an exclusive interaction with HBO Films, Miniseries and Cinemax programming president, Len Amato. Sumit, director of Nonajoler Kabbo-The Salt in Our Waters, told Dhaka Tribune's Showtime: \"GMM has invited me for my second feature project titled 'A New Prophet' starting next week in LA. This is a writing and development residency organized by Film Independent and the US Department of State. I have recently returned from France after completing the post production of my first film Nonajoler Kabbo and will fly off to LA on September 29 for this program.\" Asked about the local release date of Nonajoler Kabbo, Sumit who was a semifinalist at Sundance Screenwriters Lab in 2017,  replied: \"I will start submitting the film in the international film festival circuit from October and the local release date will be set according to the buzz it receives globally.\" Arif, producer of Afghanistan-Bangladesh co-production Roqaia, which opened at the 76th Venice International Film Festival, told Dhaka Tribune's Showtime: \"The GMM program seemed very interesting to me because filmmakers cannot directly apply to this program. They have to be nominated by global filmmakers. As Sumit and I got selected at this program this must mean we (Bangladeshi filmmakers) are on the right track. It is also a huge honour for us to represent Bangladesh in LA and major Hollywood professionals and studios.\" \"When GMM officials contacted me saying I had been nominated by other global filmmakers, I completed their official application and other procedures. I also told them then if we collaborate and organize some workshops with these industry professionals back in Bangladesh it would be great, because we need to nurture promising filmmakers back here. They replied positively and hopefully we can do that soon,\" added Arif. Arifur Rahman, producer of Matir Projar Deshe - Kingdom of Clay Subjects, has been invited to the GMM program for his upcoming Bangladesh-Germany co-production, 'Paradise.' The film has also been selected for the 16th Berlinale Co-Production Market.  Arif is currently attending a producers' program in Busan, Korea, and will start for LA when it ends this week.

For Eid-ul-Azha, Gazir Bazar haat houses a lot of cattle coming in from around 150 villages of 18 upazilas in Jessore, Magura, and Jhenaidah. Traders highlighted three main reasons for low sales, that include: floods having affected customers financially, insufficient customers from affluent parts of the country, and too much cattle from traders. On a visit to the cattle market on Monday, this correspondent saw almost 4,000 heads of cattle on display, but not many customers, driving them to bargain with traders. Cattle traders said approximately Tk3 crore worth of sacrificial animals were there that day. The price of a cow for sacrifice has on average fallen at least Tk10,000-Tk20,000 compared to prices last year. Sellers and businessmen in the market were disappointed by their losses this year. Lutfur Rahman from Fazilpur village of Kotchandpur upazila in Jhenaidah, said he brought four cows to sell in the market but was able to sell only one for Tk60,000. He added that the price should have been at least Tk70,000. Shaheb Ali from Magura, said: \"I have been in the cattle business for 48 years. I think because of the flood situation across the country, the demand is low for cattle.\"  He too was able to sell only one cow at a price of Tk53,000. Abdur Rahim another seller of the same upazila, said he had bought a cow for Tk87,000, but was able to sell that for only Tk85,000. Because of the additional expenses and the loss in sale price, he suffered a loss of at least Tk5000. Abdur Razzak, from Bagherpara upazila, Jessore, said: He brought a cow weighing 4 maunds, which should have sold for Tk90,000, but it went for Tk80,000 only. Shafirul Islam, from Salua village of Magura district, said: \"This year the number of buyers from outside Jhenaidah, and especially Dhaka, are low.  This is one of the reasons for the low price of cattle.\" He added that he sold a cow for the same price he bought it at. Sagar Biswas, the leaseholder of the cattle market, said: \"Our cattle market supplies the best quality cattle in the district. Every year thousands of heads of cattle are traded, but this year the sales are low relative to supply.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-30 00:00:00      \nThe state has a strong ethnic mix, deeply committed to preserving their cultural autonomy Dissident political leaders from the Indian state of Manipur on Tuesday said they were unilaterally declaring independence from India and forming a government-in-exile in Britain. The former princely state became part of India in 1949, two years after the country won independence from Britain, but has since seen decades-long violent separatist campaigns.  Narengbam Samarjit, external affairs minister in the self-declared Manipur State Council, said the exiled government would push for recognition at the United Nations. \"We will run the de jure exiled government here from today onwards,\" he told reporters in London, after a declaration of independence first announced in Manipur in 2012 was read aloud. \"We will seek recognition from different nations to become a UN member. We hope many of the countries will recognise our independence.\" Manipur, one of India's smallest states with a population of around just 2.8 million people, is one of the so-called \"Seven Sisters\" - a group of restive north-eastern states. The region, encircled by five other countries and connected to the rest of India by a sliver of land arching over Bangladesh, has been wracked by armed conflict and instability.  It has spawned more than 100 militant groups over the decades whose demands range from autonomy to secession.  Violence has been part of daily life for decades in Manipur, which borders Myanmar, with a strong presence of the Indian military. The state has a strong ethnic mix, and its Meitei, Naga, Kuki and Pangal communities are all deeply committed to preserving their own cultural autonomy. Its people have also always tended to look eastwards in their search for cultural links. Samarjit said he hoped the world would support its independence cause. \"We are not free there and our history is going to be destroyed, our culture is going to be extinct,\" he warned. \"So the UN should listen we raise our voice to the whole world that the people living in Manipur are human beings.\" The High Commission of India did not respond to a request for comment."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-09 00:00:00      \nFrench cartoonist Philippe Squarzoni has taken up the huge task of trying to convey the complex science of climate science and the global emergency that it implies in the form of his autobiographical/documentary graphic novel titled 'Climate Changed'. Hopefully, this will enable the general public, which does not always seem inclined to wade through dense texts on scientific topics, to get a better appreciation of the challenges of global warming The book starts with the author contemplating the difficulties of tackling the subject of global warming in comic book form. Unlike most comic book stories, it's a scientific phenomenon without the conventional beginning and end.  His solution is to place a fairly detailed exposition of climate science in the context of an autobiography. The end result is illuminating. It serves to remind the reader that climate change is not just happening to the globe. It's happening to all of us, since we all live on this planet that is rapidly heating up, and is already presenting us with real consequences in the form of record high temperatures, droughts and deadlier storms. His visit to his childhood home and his observation of how much smaller and how different it seems as an adult illustrates that the comfortable planet we knew even a few decades ago is gone forever; the climate has changed, and it's a now a new, more dangerous world that we live in. As a low-lying country which is both densely populated and incredibly vulnerable to sea level rise, Bangladesh gets two mentions in the book. Squarzoni quotes climatologist and World Bank economist Stephane Hallegatte: with \"...a rise in sea level of a little over 3 feet (1 metre)... numerous densely populated coastal regions such as the Ganges and Nile deltas could be flooded. Millions of people will be driven out, and agricultural production will be severely affected. 20% of Bangladesh could be flooded.\" Bangladesh comes up again when Hallegatte discusses the potential effect of millions of climate refugees on the international arena: \"If 20 million people leave Bangladesh and head for India, what do we do?... What will the India and Bangladesh of 2060 be like? Will tensions between them have eased? Or will they be at war?\" Even in Bangladesh, such long-terms concerns are rarely addressed in the short-term new cycle. Unfortunately, the effects of climate change will be felt disproportionately by the poor; this is made clear by Squarzoni's account of the severe flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans in 2005. The wealthier sections of the populace all evacuated upon hearing storm warnings a day in advance. The poor had no means to escape, and had to survive for days on the roofs of their submerged houses with most of the city being flooded with up to 23 feet of water.  30,000 people took shelter above the flood waters in the city stadium, until being finally evacuated by the government to the surrounding states. Desperate people started looting shops for supplies, with the result that a curfew was imposed; US soldiers freshly returned from Iraq were called in with orders from the state governor to shoot to kill. Total deaths numbered 1293, and 2 million were displaced; hundreds of thousands for over a year. A vast number of people were left in financial ruin with no means of rebuilding their ruined homes. All this in the richest country in the world. The question arises as to how poorer countries would deal with similar storms and floods, which will grow more common everywhere as global warming adds heat and power to storm systems. Will wealthy countries treat poor countries any better than they treat the poorest of their own citizens? \"So, how to end this book?\" Squarzoni asks as he draws to a close. He observes that so far humanity has failed to deal with the existential threat of climate change by curbing fossil fuel use, and thus closes almost on a pessimistic note. However, he goes on to say, \"The story isn't over.\" Everything depends on how successfully we the public are able to lobby governments of the world to act over the next decade, which according to the 2018 International Panel on Climate Change report is all the time we have left to make severe cuts to fossil fuel use and thus prevent catastrophic climate change of over 1.5C.

According to government data, production of the silver fish stood at 517,000 tons in 2017-18, up from 279,189 tons in 2006-07. In 2014-2015 the production was 387,211 tons. The ban was first imposed in 2011, the officials of the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock said at a national seminar on \"65 days fishing ban in the sea, and 22 days ban on hilsha fishing to protect reproductive Hilsa programme - 2019\"  at capital's CIRDAP auditorium on Wednesday.  The seminar was organised by Sustainable Coastal and Main Fisheries Project of the Department of Fisheries.  Masud Ara Momi, assistant director of the fisheries department, said: \"In 2011-2014, the government imposed a ban on catching Ilish during the breeding season for 11 days. In 2015, the period was increased to 16 days and in 2017 to 22 days. We have found significant increase in the production as well as in size and weight. \"The average size of the netted fish also increased from 510 grams (2014) to 880 grams (2016).\" This year, the ban on fishing will start from October 9 and will continue till October 30, she said.  While sharing the impact of the ban, Director (Marine) Dr Md Abul Hasanat of the fisheries department gave examples of neighboring countries - India (45-61 days), Myanmar (92 days), Thailand (91 days), Srilanka (February, September, October), and China (78-124 days). \"We have done a research on the impact of the 65-day ban where we found that 49% of the people related with the industry said it's helpful, 14% said time period for ban needs to be increased while 3% said the time span needs to decrease, with 6% for delaying the ban period,\" said Dr Md Abul Hasanat.  He also emphasized on the challenges of implementing the ban on fishing and recommendations, saying: \"We lack manpower and logistics, budget; there is a tendency of illegal entry of foreign vessels, lack of patrol vessels as well as controlling the motorized and non-motorized fishing boats in the 710 kilometers of the country's coastal area.\" Recommendations Citing the study, a number of recommendations was advised. They are:  *    increase of manpower,  *    opening up a new economic code to implement banned seasons, and allocating a sufficient budget,  *    adopting new programs to implement banned seasons as well as materializing them, increasing food assistance and adopting alternative economic activities for fishermen            during the period,   *    providing ID cards to all the fishermen working in the vessels at sea,  *    Ensuring \"Safety of Life at Sea\" training for all officials, sailors and fishermen of sea vessels,  *    passing the proposed Marine Fisheries Bill and the National Marine Fisheries Guideline,  *    updating the data of motorised and non-motorised fishing vessels,  *    registration of all fishing vessels, bringing all fishing vessels under the (Vessel Monitoring System) VMS and the (Automatic Identification System) AIS systems, *    formulating the Bay of Bengal Hilsa Commission comprising of the members from the countries concerned,  *    capacity building of the Marine Fisheries and Coastal  Fisheries departments to implement the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS),  *    taking effective measures to control sea pollution, and demarcating a 40-meter geofence or control line in the Bay. The speakers at the seminar, suggested that the government coordinates with neighboring countries India and Myanmar in regard to the ban on fishing at the Bay of Bengal. \"Fishermen are at risk, as well as the fishing industry, because of the ban. However, this ban needs to be imposed on the fishing boats of Myanmar and India in our territory,\" said Md Tajuddin Taju, general secretary of the Marine White Fish Trawler Owners Association.  Representative of Bangladesh Coast Guard Commander Masud said that they have recently sat with the high officials of India including the director general of the Coast Guard, where they have assured the Bangladeshi part that they will take initiatives so that their fishermen do not cross the maritime border.  The national seminar was presided over by State Minister for the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock Md Ashraf Ali Khan Khasru. In his speech, he said: \"Fishermen may not be aware about the ban, but the trawler owners know about it. So, they have to follow the government directives as well as think about the safety of the fishermen.\" Secretary of Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock Md Raisul Alam Mondol, Fisheries Research Institute Director General Yahya Mahmud, Secretary (Maritime Affairs Unit) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Khurshed Alam, leaders from different fishing vessels, and associations, among others, were present at the seminar."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-28 00:00:00      \nBangladesh's insurance sector is a vital area that requires more attention The role of insurance in managing risks in an economy cannot be overstated. On a micro scale, it safeguards households and companies from a myriad of risks. On a larger scale, it reduces the financial burden on a government and creates a stable environment in which businesses can thrive and succeed.  While Bangladesh has made gigantic strides on the path to economic prosperity, its insurance sector is a vital area that requires more attention and would benefit from regulatory reform. Currently, Bangladesh's insurance sector comprises 45 general insurance companies and 31 life insurance companies. In addition, the country has two state-owned insurance corporations -- one in the general segment and the other in the life segment. Within Bangladesh's insurance sector, life insurance constitutes a 73.5% share of its insurance market and non-life insurance a 26.5% share. Micro-insurance and Islamic Insurance (Takaful) are also a part of Bangladesh's insurance sector.In 2017, non-life insurers earned a gross premium income of Tk2,908.1 crores and life insurers Tk8,203.1 crores. The assets of all the insurance companies stood at Tk44,328 crores by the end of 2016. Investments in both life and non-life insurance companies have grown significantly during the period between 2006 and 2014. Yet, despite some growth, a comparison with other countries paints a dreary picture. Overall, insurance penetration (insurance premiums as a fraction of GDP) in Bangladesh was a meager 0.7% in 2016 and has mostly been on a downward trend since 2009 (see Figure 1).  Figure 2 clearly indicates that Bangladesh's life insurance penetration rate falls behind those of several other developing countries. Compared to its South Asian counterparts, including India, Bangladesh has the lowest premium per capita. According to the World Bank, from 1999 to 2004, the average gross premium income as a percentage of its GDP was 2.7% in India, 1.27% in Sri-Lanka, but only 0.51% in Bangladesh. Egypt, which like Bangladesh is one of the countries featuring in Goldman Sachs' Next Eleven (N-11), has been implementing regulatory reforms. These reforms have helped Egypt strengthen its insurance sector significantly, as is evidenced by the growth of its insurance density premium per capita from $8 in 1999 to $23 in 2016 (PwC Analysis). Globally, Bangladesh ranks 86th out 88 countries in terms of its premium per capita (US dollars) and 85th out of 88 countries in terms of its premium as a percentage of its GDP. Bangladesh had one of the lowest life insurance penetrations rates in 2014 Additionally, Bangladesh lacks insurance products in areas that could prove imperative to its growing economy and population.One such area is agricultural insurance. The agricultural sector is an integral part of the country's economy and accounts for more than a third of all employment, and Bangladesh suffers from agricultural production \"shocks\" every five years. Safeguards against such shocks will enable rural low-income households to keep their children in school, retain their productive assets, and protect their future economic and human development.However, apart from NGOs and public insurance corporations, there are very few providers of agricultural insurance products. Bangladesh has been exposed to the risk of natural calamities and this has had significant adverse consequences for its economy. Insurance can help it significantly in managing this problem. For example, Cyclone Sidr accounted for 20% of the government's expenditure in 2007. Reinsurance can play an important role in reducing the financial impact of disasters on the government budget, eg in 2011, Thailand suffered due to floods and the country's losses were monetized at $30 billion. But due to the reinsurance, $12bn was the insured loss. Consequently, its economy recovered in a short time. Health insurance in Bangladesh in both the private and public sector is virtually non-existent. The percentage of its GDP spent on health is only 2.64% -- the lowest in South Asia. Close to 9% of households pay huge healthcare payments, and 7% have to finance their healthcare costs by selling their assets. People in rural areas are especially vulnerable to falling into the poverty trap. Pension schemes are mostly seen in the Government sector and most elderly people have to rely on family support for their sustenance. And as Bangladesh develops and life expectancy rises, the proportion of elderly people will increase proportionately. Therefore, to relax the burden on government funds when this happens, the country's pension system needs to grow to accommodate employees from various sectors. So it is clear that there is ample space for expansion of and improvement in Bangladesh's insurance sector. Bangladesh's macroeconomic trends show that potential growth in the insurance sector is possible, especially since Asia in general is expected to see unprecedented growth with over a quarter of global primary insurance premiums likely to be generated from the region. The region is set to represent a large share of overall life insurance premiums between 2016 and 2025, rising from 11.6% to 21.7% (see Figure 3). Bangladesh is poised to capture some of this growth. According to a report published by the Boston Consulting Group (2015), three out of five cities in Bangladesh will see the emergence of more than 100,000 people in the middle and wealthy classes in the upcoming decade. This could easily translate into a higher demand for insurance products as individuals and companies become increasingly risk-aware. As per PwC's Analysis, the non-life segment is expected to grow at a high rate and overtake the life segment by a 1% margin. And as the country becomes more industrialized, the demand for fire and property insurance as well as workers' compensation is likely see a substantial growth in demand. Emerging Asia is projected to capture much of the growth in life insurance premiums Bank assurance (a partnership between an insurance company and bank where the bank sells insurance products)presents growth opportunities in Bangladesh's Insurance sector and can result in mutual benefits for banks, insurers, customers and regulators. Banks usually have the preexisting technological and human resources to provide the best customer services. Therefore, it is likely to be more convenient for customers to, for instance, pay premiums and withdraw cash backed by life insurance policies from their banks' ATMs.  On the regulatory side, financial institutions diversifying their product range may reduce systematic risk. In this scenario, insurers stand to benefit as well, as access to banks' various distribution channels could widen their market-reach without them having to create a network of agents. Selling a range of financial services to customers can be in banks' best interests since insurance products would give them a stable source of income. Bank assurance The insurance industry's trajectory towards higher growth is, however, not without challenges. For one, there is a lack of trust between insurance companies and their customers, because the former often engage in highly speculative investments. Claim-settlement related problems also undermine the customer-insurer relationship, and the process of settling claims can be arduous and long. Secondly, Bangladesh's labour force lacks the necessary skills and knowledge to provide insurance services of the highest standard. Therefore, there is a dire need for more actuary consultants and employees holding MBAs and Master's degrees in the country. From a macroeconomic perspective, Bangladesh suffers due to uneven income distribution where the majority of the people are poor, do not have disposable incomes and are unable to afford insurance. This hinders growth of a country's insurance penetration rate. Moreover, its technological capacities need major advancement. Globally, the insurance sector has been undergoing digitization and platforms are being created to optimize customer service and streamline processes. But in Bangladesh, there has been minimal utilization of modern technology with websites being inadequately developed and inefficient processes being used. Moreover, insurance companies do not have access to accurate and up-to-date demographic statistics to use for actuarial computations.  And last but not the least, the regulatory environment in Bangladesh leaves much to be desired. In this scenario, regulatory reform in its Insurance sector can stimulate the country's growth and generate savings by providing easy access to tools for enhanced risk management. It is estimated that a 1% increase in its insurance penetration rate can markedly contribute to Bangladesh's growth (see Figure 5). What a 1% rise in insurance penetration can mean for an economy One of the ways the insurance sector can contribute towards giving a boost to Bangladesh's economy is via the development of its funding infrastructure.Infrastructure development requires long-term investments and insurance companies tend to make such investments. This synergy is leveraged by other countries where it is mandatory for pension funds to allocate a part of their funds to make investments in infrastructure.  As Bangladesh's economy expands, so will its need to fund infrastructure projects. However, the social impact of increased insurance penetration levels in a country beleaguered by poverty like Bangladesh also needs to be kept in mind. Wide health and pension coverage would prevent many people from falling into the poverty trap. This is particularly relevant for women who have lower levels of income and a higher average life expectancy, and are consequently at a higher risk of being destitute when they are old.  Fundamental macroeconomic indicators including GDP growth, unemployment and foreign direct investment (FDI) could be strengthened by a robust insurance sector, which can promote growth by providing guaranteed access to liquidity via insurance coverage. And if increased savings are channeled to various financial savings instruments including insurance, capital markets stand to benefit greatly. A flourishing capital market contributes significantly to a country's growth. Additionally, a resilient insurance sector can help to curb unemployment. Provided there is adequate training and education, young graduates will be able to find various career opportunities in the insurance sector. FDI, yet another central concern for a developing country, is also likely to be boosted by regulatory reform relating to solvency and risk management. In such an environment, financial stability, enabled by a strong insurance sector, should increase investors' confidence and attract substantial international investment. Mature reinsurance markets can increase FDI Regulatory reform must have some principal aims and insurance-related regulation should stop the sale of unfair policies and mis-pricing to consumers. This is especially important because insurance by its nature is a complex product, whereby vulnerable consumers can be persuaded to opt for complicated benefit structures, enticed by complicated policy language. Furthermore, regulators must also take steps to prevent only profitable consumers being selected by insurance companies while the majority cannot access insurance. Ideally, regulation should strive to be inclusive and prevent unfairness. Lastly, regulators must account for insolvency-related risk and ensure there is a satisfactory level of capital reserves to protect customers in scenarios where they cannot collect claims when they need to. Stipulation of risk-based capital requirements such as Solvency II in the EU or principal-based capital requirements such as in the US are regulatory paths that may also be considered.

Bangladesh's Ambassador in The Hague sought support from the Netherlands to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and become a development partner by implementing the delta plan. Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 is premised on greater attention to the grassroots through its in-built, bottom-up, approach, reports UNB. Bangladesh Ambassador to the Netherlands Sheikh Mohammed Belal highlighted the Netherlands' vast reservoir of knowledge and technology; huge pool of water and delta- related business entities plus knowledge institutions; as well as enormous goodwill for Bangladesh. The delta bond between the two countries was emphasized at a seminar in The Hague recently, the Embassy said on Wednesday. Ambassador Belal praised Dutch innovation and creativity in securing their country from the scourge of floods--despite a large part of their country being below the mean sea level--and underscored that Dutch ingenuity in delta management would be critical in implementing the delta plan; like its technical assistance to Bangladesh in formulating the plan. He recalled the historic visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to the Netherlands in November 2015 and the twin-ministerial visit from the Netherlands to Bangladesh in June 2015; towards forging institutional cooperation between the two delta countries.  Prof Dr Jaap de Heer, team leader and director of the consortium assigned to prepare the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, made a keynote presentation at the seminar. He elaborated on the genesis of Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 and explained the key features of the plan and implementation challenges. Lauding the government of Bangladesh for undertaking a long-term plan for a sustainable deltaic Bangladesh, Professor Jaap de Heer underscored the need to mobilize required funds and ensure appropriate institutions implement the plan. As the delta management in Bangladesh will largely depend upon cooperation with the Himalayan basin countries--due to Bangladesh's many trans-boundary rivers--Professor Jaap de Heer also emphasized the need to have broader regional cooperation in the water sector across the basin states. The Ambassador and Professor Jaap de Heer then responded to the questions asked by the distinguished members of the Asian Table. The event was moderated by Secretary of the Asian Table Ronald Staallekker. In the audience were: former ambassadors, civil servants, politicians, and consultants of different fields with experience in Asia, in general, and Bangladesh, in particular."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-22 00:00:00      \nAre we ready for the next cyclone?  Cyclone Fani hit Bangladesh recently. The damages do not much compare to other disasters which had previously taken place and it seemed that Bangladesh was well prepared.  This should be commended as, when it comes to natural disasters, it is very difficult to reduce the damages and destruction to zero. Although Cyclone Fani did not gather much speed but, if the cyclone had hit us with much greater power like the ones in the past, what would have happened? The number of dead bodies and destruction of property would have been higher.   The question then arises: How prepared is the government to face such natural hazards? Bangladesh is a country of natural disasters -- cyclones, floods, river bank erosion, earthquakes, droughts, and other natural disasters occur almost regularly in this country.  In the past, the concept of disaster management only remained in two phases -- relief and recovery. However, after having faced disasters, slowly, Bangladesh has adapted risk identification, preparedness, the participation of the people, and a host of other strategies for disaster management.  But, is it enough? To understand our aptitude in this regard, we need to understand the legal framework of disasters. A legal framework is needed because it gives mandatory obligations and responsibilities to appointed people.  Though a good legal framework regarding disaster management should have been prepared in the early stages but, in reality, the Disaster Management Act was passed in 2012.  The Act formed a department -- Disaster Management -- which is responsible for the application of all plans and policies regarding disasters at all levels of the country. In this framework, the Act asks to form councils and committees at different levels who will work together to protect people from disasters. There is a National Disaster Management Council in Bangladesh consisting of the prime minister as chairperson and different ministers and officers as members.  The responsibility of this council is to give the guidelines and policies of prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, and other necessary things regarding disasters. Also, there are local level committees and groups working to execute the plans with the National Disaster Response Coordination Group and national level management committees.   These committees at the local level play a very important role during hazards -- they stay close to ordinary people and execute the plans easily.  But these suffer from a lack of coordination and cooperation which causes the people from the affected areas to suffer. There is a need for participation of women and disabled people in these local committees. Their representation will help identify the problems and their recommendations will help to create a strategy for effective management.  The government usually provides relief through monetary, health, food, and other support to affected people.  It has two separate funds named National Disaster Management Fund and District Disaster Management Fund which help in this regard.  Although these funds receive donations nationally and internationally, the relief goes to the affected areas through a process which is quite corrupt. The allocated relief seldom reaches the people who have suffered. Health is a crucial factor during hazards -- health clinics and hospitals are often in full capacity. The government can alter this by including institutions, hospitals, and clinics under any private or non-government organization to come and offer any form of aid.  If necessary, it can appoint the armed forces to recover the disaster areas. Bangladesh's shelters for hazards are not sufficient and fully prepped. Emergency shelters must be appointed and stocked for disaster.  If necessary, the legal framework also said to form a research and training institute to increase the capability of disaster management. The legal mechanism of disaster management is good in theory but not in reality.  The government is still working to make a better regulatory framework to face disasters.  We have to remember Bangladesh is at high risk when it comes to natural disasters.  The application of laws and coordination among all the authority in all the phases of rescue, relief, preparedness, and recovery can reduce the harm of disasters at the highest level.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-29 00:00:00      \nEven though fishermen are netting lots of Ilish, the price is still very high and beyond the reach of most people Fishermen and trawler owners in Chittagong are very happy as now they can net Ilish  after the ban was lifted on July 23. Even though fishermen are netting lots of Ilish, the price is still very high and beyond the reach of most people. Compared to the previous year, Ilish is being sold at a higher price which is affectiing the retail market. Ilish, weighing between 800-900 grams was sold between Tk23,000 and Tk25,000 per maund and Ilish   weighing 1kg or more was sold between Tk33,000-35,000 per maund. Ilish weighing one kilogram was sold at Tk1200 at Reazuddin Bazar, which is just two kilometers off the Fishery Ghat.  Marine fishing boat owners' association leader Aminul Haque Babul Sarker said, \"It is a matter of great happiness for us that we are netting big sized Ilish  fish this year. We are supplying the fish to more than 50 markets of the city and 14 upazilas of the district.\" He also added that the price will come down quite soon .    There are a total of 2400 registered fishermen in Chittagong. Of them, as many as 2000 fishermen are involved with netting Ilish fish, said sources at the district fisheries office. Mominul Haque, District Fisheries officer told Dhaka Tribune that they undertook various initiatives in the district to raise awareness among the fishermen, traders and locals about protecting mother Ilish . \"The catch of Ilish has risen significantly this year due to better management during the fish spawning season, moreover intensified vigilance against Ilish catching during the ban period and increased frequency of drives against offenders have also helped the cause,\" said the District Fisheries officer.   According to the ministry of fisheries and livestock, Ilish contributes to one per cent of the country's total gross domestic product (GDP) and 11 per cent of the country's total fish production. A total of half a million fishermen of the country are directly involved with Ilish netting. The livelihood of another 2 million people is involved with this fish."

As the imports declined, prices went up by Tk4-3, with per kg onion selling for Tk48-52 at the port on Thursday, compared to Tk45-48 the previous day.  Although onion prices were around Tk39-42 per kg before the new Indian export policy took effect. According to sources at the Hili land port, the import of onion resumed around 5:15pm Sunday after the new MEP came into effect.  A total of 368 tons of onions, on 17 trucks, were imported through the port on Sunday. The imports rose by 561 tons on Monday but then again fell to only 297 tons on Tuesday. The downward trend continued on Thursday also. Rashed and Sweet, onion importers at the port, said onion prices in Bangladeshi kitchen markets depend heavily on imports from India. So, if import falls, prices go up automatically, they added.  Harun-Ur-Rashid, an onion importer at the port, said: \"Previously, the import cost of per ton onion was $250-300. In recent months, prices went up in the Indian market due to stock shortage caused by floods. \"Recently, the Indian government also hiked the export price to check price hike in their market. On Friday, India fixed the export price at $852 per ton,\" he said.  Moreover, the new MEP had negatively impacted traders, as they were now forced to open new letters of credit (LCs) spending more money.   Previously, it would cost around Tk23-30 lakh to import 100 tons of onion which now increased to around Tk73 lakh.  As a result, the Hili port was witnessing a major slump in import, he said. \"However, new onion will come up in different areas of India within the next 20 to 25 days. We hope that price will come down to a tolerable level soon,\" Harun added. TCB's open market sale of onion The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) began sale of onion at a subsidized price in the open markets in Dhaka on Tuesday. The corporation started selling onion at Tk45 per kg at five spots in Dhaka on Tuesday. A buyer can purchase a maximum of two kilos of onion from the spots. Govt to import from Turkey, Myanmar, China The government has decided to import onion from Turkey, Myanmar and China to improve supply and bring down prices of the essential cooking ingredient at kitchen markets. The move came after the Indian government recently fixed minimum export price of onion to rein in soaring prices in their domestic market."

Cultivators in Madan, Mohanganj, Khaliajuri, and nearby upazilas said they could not make seed-beds due to excessive rainfall brought by cyclone Bulbul that hit the area recently. Boro farming will be delayed if we cannot prepare seed-beds in due time, said the farmers, adding that the delay is more likely to increase the chances of crop damage in early floods. However, Agriculture Department officials said they have advised farmers to cultivate early-season paddy varieties in these regions to avoid the damage.  According to district Agriculture Department, a total of 11,875 hectares of land in 10 upazila of Netrokona has been targeted for preparing Boro seed-beds this year. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, the target for Boro production has been set at 7,45,362 metric tons from 1,83,870 hectares of land in Netrokona. Sanjib Dey, a farmer from Khaliajuri upazila, said: \"It seems that sowing Boro saplings will be late this year, which will minimize the chances of good yields. Winter season begins in two weeks, and it will be too late if we have to start the cultivation process then.\"  \"We won't get healthy saplings in winter, which won't bring robust outcome eventually. Besides, it will take more time for the Boro plants to become mature, and so the crops might get damaged in early flood,\" he added. Expressing similar concerns, Sukomol Sarker, a farmer from Kadirpur village in Khaliajuri upazila, said: \"Crops get damaged by untimely floods almost every year. Since, the preparation of seed-beds is being delayed this year, it will significantly increase the chance of crop damage.\" Sadhan Chowdhury from Tatianagaon village of the same upazila said: \"There are some areas, surrounded by rivers, which are relatively high ground. However, some areas are low lying and it is necessary to dredge some portions of rivers in these areas, starting from the estuary of Meghna river towards northern direction. It is not possible to save crops from flood water without river dredging.\"  Agricultural expert and people concerned in haor regions said water is not receding due to a couple of reasons including lack of river dredging, making unplanned embankments in different places of haor regions.   Habibur Rahman, deputy director of Agriculture Department in Netrokona, said: \"We are advising farmers to cultivate early season paddy varieties in haor region. For example, cultivating BRRI dhan 28 reduces the risk of crop damage in early flood. However, farmers have started planting seeds after preparing seed-beds in some areas, and hopefully others will be able to do the same within a week.\" Netrokona Deputy Commissioner Moinul Islam said: \"We are encouraging farmers to cultivate early season paddy varieties that are high-yielding and grows up in a short time.\""

Local farmers prioritized cultivating potato, along with Ropa Aman paddy, because flash floods were less of a problem last year. They were inspired to cultivate potatoes after being provided agricultural equipment, fertilizer, and guidelines--free of cost--as part of a government initiative. Along with government support, the farmers also made significant efforts for a good potato harvest. According to sources of the upazila agriculture office, potato cultivation exceeded the targeted farmland allocation of 2,800 hectors in the eight unions of this upazila.   \"The farmers were also provided with technical support and guidelines, which significantly lowered infections and diseases that commonly affect the harvest,\" Upazila Deputy Assistant Agriculture Office Shafi Uddin told the correspondent. Farmers of several upazilas, including Shahagola and Moniyari had planted a large number of potatoes, said a source from the local agricultural office. Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, farmer Akkas Ali of Rasulpur village said: \"I planted potatoes on two acres of farmland. The harvest looks good, and I am optimistic that I will make a hefty profit this year.\" Echoing the same opinion, farmer Sultanur Alam said: \"I planted potatoes on more than 3 acres of farmland. So far, my crops are unaffected by natural disasters and diseases. I am hoping for a large harvest this season.\""

Already in the first weeks of summer, the stagnant Buriganga's water now resembles discarded engine oil, black and thick, billowing toxic stench over the kilometres of neighbouring areas. Mostafizur Rahman, deputy director of the Department of Environment (DoE), said that during dry season, the Buriganga becomes uninhabitable, utterly devoid of oxygen and of all aquatic lifeforms. The DoE conducts a monthly test on the water of the river. The extent of pollution is visible everywhere on the 27km stretch of the river. The tanneries in Hazaribagh were ordered by the court to relocate because they were held responsible for releasing tons of toxic waste into the river every day for decades. The state largely paid for the dearly expensive relocation, out of an untenable hope for a cleaner river. Also Read- In pictures: Black tides of Buriganga Several Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA)officials derisively refer to the Buriganga as \"the largest sewer in the world.\" One of the officials requesting anonymity, said: \"For decades, every government has emphasized the need to protect the rivers. But look at Buriganga, Turag and Balu today. They are nothing but sewerage lines,\" said the BIWTA official requesting anonymity.      Dr Monowar Hossain, executive director of the Institute of Water Modelling (IWM) said the level of pollution in the rivers around the capital is increasingly becoming irreversible.  He said: \"During monsoon, you cannot see the pollution because it gets diluted. Now that the river is at its lowest, the pollution has become visible. Industries and various other sources are indiscriminately polluting the rivers - especially the Buriganga. You cannot have a sustainable development by destroying the environment around you,\"  He noted that the country's huge population is yet another factor: \"If our current population is 18 crore, we should immediately have a population policy like many other countries. By the time the mighty industrialists, the government and the people decide how to address the pollution problem in our rivers, it will be too late. You might be able to bring back some fresh water, but aquatic life will take a long, long time to recover.\"  Black water, silent killer Along the Buriganga, millions of people are exposed to the noxious air. Residents of Kholamora said their lives are sluggish and dreary due to the river pollution.  Ahmed Fazle Rabbi, a primary school teacher in Kholamora said instead of having any benefits of living by a river, they suffer: \"During the dry season, we do not dare touch the ebony water of the river. Children suffer from various health problems due to toxic air pollution, at times it becomes difficult for us to breathe.\"  Boatmen who ferry people across the river reported suffering from skin disorders. \"We make a living by ferrying people across this dead river. Our work is hazardous, as the continued exposure to the water has left our skin scarred and diseased,\" Gazi Sheikh, a boatman, said, revealing ugly rashes on both of his hands.  The Buriganga and other rivers around the capital remain stagnant for eight months between September and May. During this period, the only movement of the river water occurs during high and low tides in the Meghna River, 25km downstream.  The rivers Brahmaputra and Jamuna in Tangail and Manikganj are the only waterfeeders for the river system around the capital. As soon as floodwater recedes upstream, the Ghior Canal in Manikganj and the Old Brahmaputra River in Tangail stop flowing due to siltation at the confluences of Jamuna and Brahmaputra. The water stops feeding the channels, turning the rivers around the capital into stagnant cesspits. When the floods revive the rivers in June or July, the accumulated waste is flushed downstream through Meghna into the Bay of Bengal. Resuscitating the rivers In order to revive the rivers, in 2010 the Water Development Board (WDB) took up a Tk 1000 crore project called \"Rehabilitation of Buriganga, Turag, Balu and Sitalakhya and Augmentation of Dry Season Flow\". The project envisaged, among other components, dredging of 160 kilometers of waterways from Tangail and Manikganj to Dhaka. The IWM did a feasibility study on the scheme. The project came to a standstill when several government bodies failed to reach a consensus.  A WDB official confided that the Local Government and Engineering Department for one, was unable to say what to do with dozens of culverts, link roads they had built on top of the waterways connecting the capital from feeder points.  But many feel that an isolated and expensive project to restore water flow will not solve the problem alone. For instance, the Dhaka Wasa and both Dhaka city corporations dump a significant portion of their untreated waste into the Buriganga every day.  Thousands of small to large industries along the river also dump their liquid and solid wastes in the river. At densely populated areas along the river, all human and household wastes find way into the river. At the Sadarghat launch terminal, hundreds of large vessels arrive and depart every day, carrying thousands of passengers. And all the waste produced by them, ranging from mainly polythene wrapping, dirt and food residue generated on the launches, is nonchalantly swept into the river. Humayun Kabir, a senior engineer with the WDB, said: \"A single project cannot solve this problem, no matter how much money you pour into it. The problems need to be identified, analyzed and addressed. It should become a national priority first for at least a few months. Law enforcement agencies could help train and create awareness among people.\""

Quader, also the road transport and bridges minister, said the historic June 7 is an unforgettable and significant day in the history of Bangladesh. He said the historic movement for six-point demand, declared by the greatest Bengali of all time Bangabandhu, took an important turn on June 7, 1966.  Quader added, \"We got independence under the dynamic leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. And now the country is moving ahead under the visionary leadership of Bangabandhu's worthwhile daughter Sheikh Hasina.\" On this day in 1966, the Awami League (AL) under the charismatic leadership of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called for a day-long strike throughout East Pakistan, pressing the demand for autonomy to end the exploitation, deprivation, subjugation and tyranny of the then central government of Pakistan on the people here. People took to the streets during the dawn-to-dusk strike throughout the province and the law enforcement agencies, including the East Pakistan Rifles (EPR), opened fire on the demonstrators in Tongi, Dhaka and Narayanganj that left 11 people, including labour leader Monu Miah, Shafique and Shamsul Huq, dead."

Farmers in six upazilas of the district have cultivated the Ropa Aman paddy in most of the farmlands during this Aman season. They are now eagerly waiting for the harvest.  However, not all lands were suitable for Aman farming. As low-lying lands have been flooded due to excessive rainfall, they have had to cultivate various winter vegetables such as cauliflower, cabbage, tomato, radish and eggplants etc, in the high and unoccupied lands. According to Met office sources, on average of 547mm rainfall was recorded in the beginning of the monsoon season which declined later. However, the volume of rainfall doubled at the end of the season triggering floods in the area.  Despite suffering a great deal of stress in vegetable farming due to the ill-timed flood, farmers did not sit idle. They overcame the situation by making bamboo shelves and began early farming. Majority of the farmers in Nilphamari made these elevated shelves with bamboo sticks and created seedbeds on them.   Komola Thakur, a farmer from Malipara village in Nilphamari sadar upazila, said: \"My land was flooded and I had to make three cauliflower seedbeds all of which are 10 feet in length and 4 feet in width. It will give me a head start because the saplings will ready for plantation by the time flood water recess.\" Dulal Chandra, another farmer of the village, said: \"I made similar seedbeds last month. It gave me enough saplings to cultivate cauliflowers on one Bigha of land. The vegetable will be ready for sale soon. I am hoping for robust yields and good price.\" Another farmer Abul Kalam Azad said: \"It cost me around Tk15,000 to cultivate 3,500 pieces of cauliflowers on one Bigha of land. If it can be sold at Tk10 a piece, then we get around Tk35,000 which is pretty reasonable.\" Abul Kashem Azad, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension in Nilphamari, said: \"Different types of vegetables will be cultivated on an estimated 5,826 hectares of land in the current 2019-20 fiscal year. Farmers are now more aware and innovative.\" \"Bamboo shelf farming is their idea. This method can protect the seeds from natural disasters, excessive heat and insecticides. This way, the seeds can be grown healthy resulting in robust production and fetching more profit.\""

According to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) sources in Tangail, due to heavy rains, the Jamuna river water level rose resulting in river erosion in Mamudnagar Union of Nagarpur upazila. Union ward 7 is completely engulfed by the river. Villages affected by the erosion are: Kukuria, Keshob Majhail, Majhail, Shona-majhail, Barbaria, chala-Bakla, and Baniapara, where about 500 families were forced to vacate their homes and lands this year. To control the damage by reducing the speed of the river current, the authorities have dumped 36000 of Geo bags in 550 meters of the eroded land since June 17, but the improvement is negligible. Locals say they have sheltered with relatives, or otherwise poor living arrangements. The erosion swallowed large tracts of land this year, including paddy, jute, and peanut fields, and schools, madrasa and mosques in ward 7 of the union.  Karim Sheikh of Kukuria village said: \"River erosion over the years has cost me 16 bighas of my cultivatable land.  Now I only have my home left.\" Abu Sayeed of the same village said his family once owned 150 bighas of land, all of which is now under the Jamuna river. Many other villagers in the erosion prone areas, like Abdul Hye, Sirajul Islam, Mannan, and freedom fighter Abdul Jalil, say they have lost their properties to the Jamuna river because of annual floods . Mamudnagar Union Parishad Chairman Majedur  Rahman Talukdar said: \"If the authorities could build a permanent dam in the river erosion areas, the lands of people in this union could be saved.\" Tangail BWDB Executive Engineer Serajul Islam said: \"We have proposed a project to the higher authorities to build a permanent dam.  Dam construction will commence when the proposal is approved.\""

Even on Thursday, it was sold between Tk105-110 per kilogram, while on Saturday it was sold for Tk60-70 per kg. Traders remarked that the price dip was due to adequate stock availability in the local market. Sources at the land port said, after a restriction of almost a year, import of green chilies began from July 20. Until yesterday, 230 tons of green chilies were imported through 31 trucks in the past six working days. The price dip was also attributed to the strong presence of locally produced green chilies, which caused its retail price to fall from Tk130-140 per kg to Tk110.  Anwar Hossain, a green chili importer at Hili land port, and Mostafa Hossain, a retail chili trader, said the price of chilies had spiked a few weeks ago thanks to the floods, which prevented farmers from being able to meet the national demand. It was for this predicament that the government had decided to lift the chili import embargo, they remarked. \"Recent bumper yields in Rajshahi, and Meherpur had benefited the local markets, which caused the price of chilies to drop in both the wholesale, and retail sectors,\" they said. But this fall in price had also caused a section of importers to incur losses, as they had to sell them off at significantly lower rates, Anwar and Mostafa added. This has also caused them not to import any more green chilies for the time being."

Fertility, foetuses and children are also affected by toxic air, the review found Air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body, according to a comprehensive new global review. The research shows head-to-toe harm, from heart and lung disease to diabetes and dementia, and from liver problems and bladder cancer to brittle bones and damaged skin. Fertility, foetuses and children are also affected by toxic air, the review found, reports The Guardian. The systemic damage is the result of pollutants causing inflammation that then floods through the body and ultrafine particles being carried around the body by the bloodstream. Air pollution is a \"public health emergency,\" according to the World Health Organization, with more than 90% of the global population enduring toxic outdoor air. New analysis indicates 8.8 million early deaths each year - double earlier estimates - making air pollution a bigger killer than tobacco smoking. But the impact of different pollutants on many ailments remains to be established, suggesting well-known heart and lung damage is only \"the tip of the iceberg.\" \"Air pollution can harm acutely, as well as chronically, potentially affecting every organ in the body,\" conclude the scientists from the Forum of International Respiratory Societies in the two review papers, published in the journal Chest. \"Ultrafine particles pass through the [lungs], are readily picked up by cells, and carried via the bloodstream to expose virtually all cells in the body.\" Prof Dean Schraufnagel, at the University of Illinois at Chicago and who led the reviews, said: \"I wouldn't be surprised if almost every organ was affected. If something is missing [from the review] it is probably because there was no research yet.\" The Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, which has tracked atmospheric CO2 levels since the late 1950s, on Saturday morning detected 415.26 parts per million (ppm). It was also the first time on record that the observatory measured a daily baseline above 415 ppm.  The last time Earth's atmosphere contained this much CO2 was more than three million years ago, when global sea levels were several metres higher and parts of Antarctica were blanketed in forest. How does air pollution affect our body This results in breathing problems, from asthma to emphysema to lung cancer. There is now overwhelming evidence that air pollution results in serious harm not only to the lungs, but also to the heart. Strokes, dementia and reduced intelligence are all conditions affecting the brain that have been linked to air pollution. Perhaps the most disturbing impact of toxic air is the damage to reproduction and children. Fertility is reduced and miscarriages increased by exposure to air pollution. The unborn are also affected, with a recent study finding pollutants in the placentas that nourish foetuses. Bangladesh, one of the most densely-populated countries in the world, has long been struggling with air pollution, and Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Dhaka is the second most polluted capital, with Bangladesh having the most polluted air in the world, according to the 2018 World Air Quality Report by Greenpeace and AirVisual, that present PM2.5 air quality data aggregated through the IQAir AirVisual platform."

Illegal sand extraction is causing problems to the residents of three nearby villages, as hundreds of heavy trucks ply and damaged the dam to a large extent. An influential group of people, wielding local Awami League leaders' name, are extracting sand from the river, and no action is taken on any complaints placed. During daytime, they extract sand from lands they have taken on lease. However, during the night they use industrial vacuum to extract sand directly from the river. Back in 2000, the 47km long Pouli River dam was built under the \"Compartmentalization Pilot Project\" (CPP). Since then the dam has not undergone any renovation, with various parts of it getting damaged to the point of breaking up. If the dam was to breach, houses, crop fields, schools, mosques, and temples in a massive area will be washed away by water.  Last year, the people of Ramdevpur village in Kalihati upazila repaired the dam in order to protect themselves from being washed away. An influential group of people, wielding local Awami League leaders' name, are extracting sand from the river, and no action is taken on any complaints placed | Dhaka Tribune However, with the danger of floods looming ahead, their future appear uncertain. Local people said hundreds of sand trucks ply over the dam every day, damaging the only path they use to commute. They cannot say anything in protest because of the powerful influence of vested quarters. They face life threats if they protest. Moreover, there is sand everywhere; inside their foods, clothes, and everything else. It is getting increasingly difficult to survive here, they said.  Requesting anonymity, a sand extractor said: \"A part of the dam in Mohela was damaged last year, and more parts will suffer the same fate. We have to do what the owners' say.\" \"Many that took lease of the land along the river bank, carry out illegal sand extraction directly from the river. Nobody can say anything to them.\" Tangail's Deputy Commissioner (DC), Shahidul Islam said: \"I have assigned the executive officer of Kalihati upazila to look into this. We will take proper actions to preserve the dam that protects Tangail city.\" * Illegal sand mining going across the Pouli River Dam  * Heavy sand truck movement damaging the dam * Some parts of the dam are damaged to the point of breaching * No complaint works against influential sand mine owners * Locals facing difficulties in surviving - commutes and environmental surroundings are affected * Without proper measures, river will devour massive areas  "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-30 00:00:00      \nMedia reports had earlier spoken of about 30 dead, with the radio reporting that four pregnant women were among the victims At least 42 people were killed after their houses were swept away Tuesday in a landslide caused by torrential rain in the western Cameroon city of Bafoussam, state media reported, showing images of rescuers desperately sifting through rubble for survivors. \"Searches are ongoing. We fear there are further deaths,\" a senior local official told AFP on condition of anonymity as nightfall neared. A total of 42 bodies were taken to the hospital in the city, according to an official statement read on Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV). Media reports had earlier spoken of about 30 dead, with the radio reporting that four pregnant women were among the victims. Pictures of the tragedy in Bafouassam posted on social media showed ramshackle houses having crumbled into the ochre-coloured terrain and men clad in hard hats digging away at piles of mud in the search for survivors. \"The houses that collapsed were built on the side of a hill in a risk zone,\" said the local official in the West Region, of which Bafoussam is the capital, some 300km northwest of the capital Yaounde. He said the landslide was caused by torrential rains that have fallen in the country over the past few days as well as the wider region, with neighbouring Central African Republic and Nigeria also seriously hit.  Cameroon President Paul Biya offered his condolences to families of the victims in a message broadcast on CRTV. Landslides are quite exceptional in the area although further south they are less rare in the rainy season, notably in the English-speaking southwest.  It was in the south-western coastal resort town of Limbe that five people died in a landslide following flooding in July last year. Neighbouring Central African Republic, already mired in a brutal civil war, is reeling from 10 days of torrential rain which have plunged swathes of the country underwater, creating a new emergency in one of the world's poorest nations. Tens of thousands of people have been left homeless after the CAR's largest river, the Oubangui, burst its banks at the height of the country's worst floods in decades which have left parts of the capital Bangui submerged, prompting authorities to warn of the risk of cholera. Several agrarian states in another Cameroon neighbour, Nigeria, have also been hit by flooding. A torrential downpour Monday allowed dozens of inmates to escape from prison in the central state of Kogi."

      "authors": "Anna Plowman",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-09 00:00:00      \nQuestions of 'gender' and vulnerability to climate change What does it mean when we talk about climate change with a focus on gender? What is 'gender' in this context, and what is a 'gender-based' approach? Most ongoing discussions around 'gender' and climate change are dominated by issues concerning women. This is for good reason. Women are set to be disproportionately impacted by the exacerbation of extreme weather events associated with climate change.  'Gender' and the existing focus on women In regions suffering from crop loss and food scarcity, food is often prioritized for male members of the household while women and girls receive smaller portions and are more likely to become malnourished.  Women's workload simultaneously increases as it becomes necessary to walk greater distances to collect clean water and obtain food. Further to this, as households experience stresses on income and food supply, domestic violence against women tends to increase.  Women spend more time than men in the household and away from town centres, and are less likely to own their own phone. This reduces the likelihood that they will receive timely emergency warnings - - about incoming storms, for example - - and advice on what actions to take.  Furthermore, women are more likely to avoid going to cyclone shelters due to fears of being around unknown male company, and a greater risk of being subjected to sexual harassment or assault.  Additionally, women and girls are less likely to have learned to swim, increasing their likelihood of drowning when encountering floods. This problem is compounded by their clothing, particularly sarees, which are known for having a lot of drag and becoming caught up in trees and other debris. Beyond the more immediate impacts of climate change, the longer-term challenges of climate change are also experienced differently by women and men.  It is more common that male rather than female household members will migrate out of highly-exposed areas in search of alternative sources of income, and in such situations, it is often women who are left to manage a household and child care on their own, not necessarily knowing when or if remittances will arrive.  In light of such ways in which women's experiences of climate change are expected to be different compared to men's, conversations around 'gender' and climate change tend to be dominated by the central topic of women and the extra burdens they are set to bear as the impacts of climate change become more severe.  Broadening considerations of 'gender' Yet 'gender' encompasses more than traditional binary groupings of 'women' and 'men'. A more inclusive interpretation of 'gender' further includes transgender people (who identify as a gender different to that which they were assigned and socialized as at birth) and gender non-binary people (who feel that they fit into neither the category of 'woman' or 'man').  Yet, discussions around 'gender' and climate change generally do not consider the ways in which the experiences of these groups with climate change may be different from cis-gendered women and men (people who identify with the gender which they were assigned at birth).  In what ways does a person's non-cis gender identity - - as something which is either known by the wider community or as something which is hidden from the wider community - - impact the way they engage with society and economy, and impact the way in which other people engage with them?  Based on these differences, in what ways are trans and non-binary people likely to be differently impacted by climate change? Once considerations of gender and climate change are broadened in this manner, this subsequently invites further questions, for example, about ways in which non-heterosexual people (gay, lesbian, bi- or other) may also be differently impacted by climate change.  If a person suffers social exclusion and discrimination based on their gender orientation or sexuality (be it something that is known to the wider community, or even based on rumours) this may impact the extent to which the person is included by the wider community in preparations for or responses to an environmental event.  Threats of violence and discrimination from the wider community may further impact the willingness of such people to seek access to available forms of assistance. In situations of economic downturn due to infrastructure damage and crop loss, they may be more likely to be turned away from paid employment.  They may additionally be less likely to be part of an integrated wider family network to whom they can turn for help in preparation for, or in the wake of a disaster. This includes local family members who could offer immediate local help, or even migrant family members who could facilitate the person's subsequent migration.  The impacts of discrimination and exclusion from the family are even more acute for elderly individuals who are more prone to suffering in extreme temperatures and less able to travel to shelters on their own. By considering these scenarios, it becomes apparent that there are many factors beyond a female gender identity which can shape a person's experience with increasingly extreme weather events. In light of this, an intersectional approach to discussions around gender and climate change is useful.  What is 'intersectionality'? Through an intersectional approach, questions of 'gender' in the context of climate change ultimately open the doors for considerations not just for the ways in which women and men are impacted differently by climate change, but also for the ways in which such gendered differences diverge between people of varying backgrounds and social identities. As an approach within critical feminist theory, intersectionality has historical roots in the reactions of black feminists in the United States to a mainstream feminist movement which they criticized for generalizing understandings of women's struggles around a white, middle-class experience.   The mainstream feminist movement questioned, for example, the gendered division of labour whereby (white, middle-class) women were assigned to roles in the household and excluded from formal employment opportunities.  Contrarily, the fight for the right to engage in paid employment outside the home had little relevance to working-class women of colour who had for a long time been forced to undertake the compacted responsibilities of both low-wage employment and household-based labour.  In addition to their exclusion from the mainstream feminist movement, women of colour struggled to have their voices and gender-based experiences of racism represented within the civil rights movement, as leadership positions were largely held by men.  Suffering further sexism within these groups, it was evident that neither the feminist nor civil rights movements on their own were going to adequately address the intersecting forms of oppression that women of colour experienced based on their gender, race, and class. It was understood that liberation for all women would not take place while issues of race-based and class-based oppression remained unaddressed by the wider feminist movement. Through an intersectional perspective, experiences of oppression are understood as being inherently bound up not only in gender but in additional interacting factors (which carry their own social power dynamics) such as class, economic status, place/location, religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, sexual orientation, gender identity (beyond cis -gendered male and female identities and including those transgender or non-binary people), physical ability, and health. How does intersectionality relate to climate change?  In the context of climate change, understandings of vulnerability can be made more nuanced through an intersectional approach. Class, place/location, and livelihood are already prominent factors in consideration when gauging vulnerability to climate change.  Someone who lives in a coastal area (which is highly exposed to storms, flooding, and erosion), and who is additionally both a low-income earner and dependent on agriculture or aquaculture for their income is widely understood to be highly vulnerable to climate change.  Climate change policy discussions and program designs already tend to acknowledge the intersections of a female gender identity with these factors (class, location, and livelihood) and the role of these intersections in shaping a person's vulnerability to climate change.  Yet beyond this, a wider and more deliberate intersectional approach can be used to identify groups of people who may be additionally marginalised and thereby more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.   In what ways are a person's experiences of climate change impacted by their other various intersecting social positions? For example, as a member of a minority ethnic group such as the Arakanese in Barisal division? Or as a Hindu person in a predominantly Muslim area? As a person of uncertain nationality and legal status such as  the Rohingya in Cox's Bazar? As a person who is very young or very old? As a person who has a non-heterosexual sexuality? Or a non-cis gender identity, such as a hijra person? As a person who suffers with mental or physical health problems? Or as a person who was born neuro-diverse or differently physically abled? For people who are marginalised by more than one of these factors (in addition to the more traditional indicators of vulnerability relating to female/male gender identity, class, location, and livelihood), how do their experiences with social life and with climate change differ based on the interaction of those specific factors?  It is useful to know, for example, how climate change may differently impact an elderly, less-mobile Muslim woman in a peri-urban embankment area, compared to a young able-bodied Hindu woman who lives in a rural floodplain region and engages in subsistence agriculture. Information gathered on this can be used to inform the design of programs and policies to improve assistance to vulnerable groups. The aim is not to introduce so many categories and complexities to the point where disaster response becomes slow, inefficient, and ineffective.  Yet this approach can be useful in identifying groups and sub-groups of people who may otherwise be left behind, forgotten, or excluded from receiving assistance, and who may be more in need of such assistance.  Further, short term programs and policies which address the immediate impacts of climate change, an intersectional approach can help better inform efforts to address underlying inequalities between groups, which form the cause for the greater vulnerability of some groups over others.  The traditional focus on gender and women's vulnerability has raised questions for ways in which women can be better integrated into social and economic life, thereby reducing their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. The same approach can be used to promote the integration of other marginalised groups, and thereby reduce their underlying disposition as vulnerable people in the face of climate change.  Acknowledging the intersections of various social aspects in the way that people experience climate change further allows discussions of gender to move beyond existing broad and simplistic portrayals of women as vulnerable victims of climate change.  An intersectional approach can further acknowledge various other factors which may make some women more vulnerable than others, and may make a non-cis person or even a man highly vulnerable to climate change.

The Nilphamari, Rangpur, and Dinajpur districts were brought under the irrigation program that was inaugurated on January 15.  The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) sources said cropland of about 40,000 hectares was irrigated in the project command area -- which should yield approximately 2,095,230 tonnes of rice priced at a minimum of Tk119 crore. Cropland   in the project command area has been irrigated and soon the Boro paddy will be harvested in: Nilphamari sadar, Jaldhaka, Dimla, Kishoreganj, Syedpur, upazilas in Nilphamari district; Rangpur sadar, Taraganj, Gangachara, Badargonj of Rangpur district; and Chirirbandar, Parbatipur, Khansama of Dinajpur district. Executive Engineer Abdullah Al Mamun--working in the Dalia sector of the project--showed in a report that the irrigation cost for a hectare of land, with an electric irrigation pump machine is Tk10,500. The irrigation pump operates with diesel costs of Tk14,000 per hectare, but in the project command area of the Teesta barrage, irrigation costs only Tk1,200 per hectare.  \"If we could have managed to get more water to flow through from the Teesta, upstream, we would have irrigated 79,000 hectares of the land in the first phase. We were only able to irrigate 40,000 hectares because of insufficient flow -- which is a lot less in comparison,\" said Engineer Abdullah. Agricultural Extension Officer of the Teesta Barrage Irrigation Project Rafiul Bari said: \"Because of insufficient water upstream, 40,000 hectares of land were irrigated in the project command area. \"Farmers were able to harvest 25-29 maunds of rice per bigha(0.2529 hectare).They also saved electricity and diesel worth Tk550 crore.\" Harvesting season is scheduled to start within  two weeks, but farmers have already harvested BR-28 rice, said farmer Bimal Chandra Roy."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-25 00:00:00      \nThe NATP-2 initiative has helped farmers in the region to reap profits after incurring losses during the floods earlier this year The char areas adjacent to the Padma River in Rajbari's Sadar upazila are witnessing a bumper cauliflower yield, thanks to the National Agriculture Technology Project-2 (NATP-2). Not only cauliflower but also a wide array of winter vegetable is blooming in the region. They are in high demand at local markets as they are free of pesticides, and good in taste. The NATP-2 initiative has helped farmers in the region to reap profits after incurring losses during the floods earlier this year. The project's outcome can be seen in Sadar upazila's Barat, Mulghar, Basantapur, and Shahid Wahab Pur unions. Apart from cauliflower, farmers in the said unions are also cultivating cabbage, eggplant, pumpkin, beans, radish and long beans in areas spanning over 850 hectares, according to sources at the district Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) office. Farmers are also receiving fair prices for their produce, they mentioned.  Md Khalil, a farmer from Gopalbari village under Barat union of Sadar upazila, cultivated cauliflower on 1.5 bigha of the exhibition plots under the local DAE office. After extracting them, he sells each kilogram of cauliflower for Tk 55-60. He only had to spend Tk20,000, which brought him a profit of Tk1.5 lakh, he added. Like Khalil, many others echoed that winter vegetable cultivation has changed their luck by reducing poverty. Sajeda Begum, another farmer from the same village, fared with similar results in pumpkin and eggplant cultivation. She sold both of them for Tk30 per kilogram. Md Bahauddin Sheikh, agriculture officer at Sadar upazila, said traditionally most of the farmers were dependent only on farming paddy and wheat, but recently the practice has been changed; instead of farming paddy and wheat thousands of farmers are now cultivating different types of winter vegetables. Not only the traditional farmers, but marginalized people who do not have any cropland are also using unused land around their house to grow vegetables, he added."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-01 00:00:00      \nOnce-powerful rivers have turned into cropland and playgrounds due to land encroachment River encroachment has continued in Nilphamari; structures are built, plus paddy and vegetable is cultivated, on riverbeds. Nilphamari is home to nearly 600km of rivers. These include the: Paramatta, Tista, Buri Tista, Charalkata, Burikhora, Dhum, Bamandanga, Panga, Kumlai, Nautara, Jamuneshwari, Ichhamati, Kalamdar, Kharkharia, Bullai, Deonai, Shalki, Kherkati, Chara Nodi, Kherua, Chikli, and Auliakhana. Most of these rivers are on the brink of extinction due to their decreasing water levels. They have been filled in and often turned into cropland. Structures have been built upon some of them. Powerful land grabbers drying up river beds The once fast-flowing Jamuneshwari River is now farmed for different kinds of crops. The main course of the river, upstream from the Haratkitala Bridge, is surrounded by a tin fence. Locals said a company has recently bought all the river land. Former Union Parishad (UP) Chairman of Palashbari union, 95-year-old Shyamcharan Roy, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"I have seen how fast the Jamuneshwari River flowed. In my childhood, fishermen used to earn their livelihoods by catching small and big fish from the Jamuneshwari. \"Traders from far away used to come for commerce,\" he said. \"My forefathers would tell me about steamers on this river. And now, encroachment has left it almost dead.\" Rahidul Islam, 82, from Kamarpara village under the same union, said: \"No one can deduce from the river's current flow that it was once fast flowing. People are grabbing land however they can.\" Meanwhile, Palashbari UP Chairman Momtaz Uddin Pramanik, 85, said: \"This one company has bought a lot of river land at a very low price. Some parts of the river have been silted up. If the river were excavated, it would help the locals with their farming.\" Jamuneshwari River's source lies in Bilanchal in Mekhliganj village in Kuchbihar of India, and enters through the border in Gomnati union under Domar upazila in Nilphamari. Another branch from Bilanchal has joined the Jamuneshwari, passing through Ketkibari union. The river is 50 metres wide and 116km long. The Bamandanga River flows right beside Nilphamari town. Shakhamachha Port, built around this river, was once the most important spots for trade and commerce in Nilphamari. Cargo boats, from all across the country, used to come to participate in trade. Now, after gradual filling, the river has fallen victim to land encroachment, and has turned into a playground for locals. Encroachers regularly build structures on river land.  Abdus Sattar, 75, from Sarkarpara village in Nilphamari town, said several establishments--such as rice mills, cleats for drying paddies, small factories, and houses--have been built by encroaching on the Bamandanga; all the way from Gachhbari to Anandabubu's pool.  \"These mills are further filling up the river by throwing in ash as waste material,\" Sattar said. \"Despite the issue getting everyone's attention, nobody is brave enough to speak up against the influential land encroachers.\" Nearly 42km long, 38m wide, and 2.3m deep, the Burikhora River flowing through Ramnagar union has now turned into cropland. Boro paddy and corn is cultivated on the cropland near Shyannashi Ghat in Bahalipara village of Ramnagar. \"The river has lost its retention capacity after being filled up,\" Bidyacharan Roy, 69, from Bahalipara said. \"As a result, in dry seasons, the river hardly gets any water, but during the monsoon it floods easily.\" Kalamdar River in Domar upazila has a similar situation. The river was used for washing and cooking by guests who would come to visit the Peer's fair hosted on the banks of Kalamdar. However, just like the other rivers in Nilphamari, it has been filled up for cultivation. Water Development Board Executive engineer Abdullah Al Mamun told the Dhaka Tribune: \"There are 18 small and large rivers in Nilphamari. We will start an operation soon, to keep these rivers from being encroached on. We have sent a list of the rivers to the National River Protection Commission.\" \"There is no river in the country that has not been grabbed,\" River protection and research institute foundation Riverine People Bangladesh's Director Dr Tuhin Wadud said. \"We need to bring changes to laws on river encroachment. The River Protection Commission needs to be strengthened by coordinating it with other ministries.\" Meanwhile, Nilphamari Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) (revenue) Shahinur Alam said: \"We have instructed all Upazila Nirbahi Officers (UNOs) and assistant commissioners (land) to identify the rivers threatened by encroachment.  \"Other than that, the district commission and Water Development Board have taken a joint initiative to excavate and protect the rivers,\" he added. \"Some of these rivers are being re-excavated, while others have been tendered.\"   "

However, the water transport crews stressed the importance of capital dredging alongside maintenance dredging to remedy the poor water flow from upstream which causes severe navigability crisis in the regional river routes. \"We are trying to ensure 14 feet of depth by maintenance dredging. We will avoid further dredging, as it may result in rapid erosion and other problems regarding navigability,\" said Mizanur Rahman Bhuiyan, the superintending engineer of dredging department of BIWTA.  This year's flash floods in the northern parts carried significant amounts of silt and sediments downstream and deposited them in the southern parts of the country, he added. Regarding the dredging process, Mizanur said seven dredging machines have been mobilized at different points around Barisal while three more would be added to the fleet soon. About 30 lakh cubic metres of sediments would be dredged from Barisal regional rivers including one lakh cubic metres from Barisal river port area, he added. BIWTA is planning to undertake excavation projects to make the river flow straight as river bends facilitate sedimentation, said Ajmal Huda Mithu, deputy director of marine safety and river traffic officer of Barisal River Port. Ajmal instructed people to contact the BIWTA, who wish to use the dredged sediments for free to fill their lowlands."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-19 00:00:00      \nBWDB and BIWTA have demolished 380 illegal structures in different areas of Dhaka in the past three days The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) demolished 265 illegal structures, including three belonging to Awami League MP Haji Mohammad Salim, between Saturday and Monday. BWDB Superintending Engineer Akhil Kumar Biswas said at least 241 such structures were demolished in the first two days of the ongoing crackdown against encroachers. Confirming the numbers, BWDB's Executive Engineer (Dhaka Operations and Maintenance Division-II) Dewan Ainul on Monday told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Three of the structures were owned by Haji Salim. One of them was even a four-storied one.\" He said they started the drive from Old Dhaka's Lalbagh to reclaim the encroached land along the 10km-long river protection embankment leading towards Gabtoli. \"We have recovered a stretch of 1,953 metres on the embankment till now,\" he said, and added that the drive will resume at 9am on Tuesday. However, when contacted, Dhaka 7 lawmaker Haji Mohammad Salim could not confirm the BWDB official's remarks. His Assistant Personal Secretary Sohel claimed that they did not receive any prior notice from the authorities regarding the drive. \"We still have valid documents for the buildings,\" he said, but declined to comment further on the matter.   Earlier, Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) on February 5 had demolished several semi-concrete structures owned by Haji Salim. The BIWTA, too, on Monday dismantled 120 illegal structures, including several multi-storied ones, on the banks of Buriganga and Turag rivers, raising the number of the demolished establishments to 1,620. Till now, the BIWTA has managed to reclaim at least 16 acres of land.  Amid eviction drives on riverbanks, the government on Thursday also had transferred BIWTA Chairman Commodore Mohammad Mozammel Haque. 30 acres of Dhaleshwari land encroached in Singair Meanwhile, a report submitted to the High Court on Monday said that some 30 acres of land along the Dhaleshwari River under Dhalla mouja in Manikganj's Singair upazila were occupied by 37 individuals and organizations. Of the land, 11.30 acres have been encroached by Manikganj Power Generations Limited alone, said the report placed by the district's deputy commissioner. A list of the 37 illegal land grabbers was also submitted before the High Court bench of Justice Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Md Ashraful Kamal. Later, the court fixed February 25 for the next hearing. On October 22, Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh had filed a writ petition with the court, seeking its directives to free the Dhaleshwari River from the clutches of encroachers. The following day, the court issued a rule and asked the Manikganj deputy commissioner to submit a report within 60 days attaching CS/RS records. Following an appeal filed by the power plant, the court later ordered a survey in line with the BRS record. As per the court directives, the local administration of Manikganj district submitted the report with a list of 37 land grabbers."

      "authors": "Thomson Reuters Foundation",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-03 00:00:00      \nBrazilian president authorized the military to fight the fires after several days of public protests  When Maria Augusta Almeida, 45, heard her grandson cough incessantly, she knew what was to blame: the fires raging in the Amazon forest, some of them more than 200 miles (322km) away from Porto Velho. The smoke permeating the city, the capital of Brazil's northwestern state of Rondonia, is leading concerned parents to wait for hours in line at local hospitals to get help for their children who are struggling to breathe. The Thomson Reuters Foundation visited four health centres in the city, one of the hardest hit by smoke from the burning rainforest. In all, there were reports of children, some of them infants, seeking medical care due to smoke inhalation. Last month, Brazil's space research agency, INPE, revealed the number of fires in the Amazon was the highest since 2010. That sparked international calls for the country to do more to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest - key to curbing climate change - from deforestation and other threats. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro authorized the military to fight the fires after several days of public protests and criticism from world leaders. In Porto Velho, residents said the Cosme e Damiao Children's Hospital, run by the Rondonia state government, had become the epicentre for children with breathing difficulties. The symptoms from outdoor smoke inhalation have evolved into a full-blown crisis for some parents, as they do not know how to protect their children from what is in the air. The daughter of local salesman Mauro Ribeiro do Nascimento, almost two years old, has asthma and could not stop coughing. \"I have taken her to Cosme e Damiao three times already,\" her father said. \"They were doing nothing but putting her on a nebulizer.\" The device helps patients breathe in medicine as a mist through a mask or a mouthpiece, to treat respiratory problems. Worried about the strain on her lungs, do Nascimento took his daughter to a different centre for an X-ray, which showed her lungs were \"congested\" due to irritation caused by smoke. Staff at Cosme e Damiao were not authorized to say how many children they had attended since the fires escalated, and did not respond to requests for comment. But volunteers and locals said the lines grew much longer about a month ago, when smoke began choking the city streets.  \"The city was so filled with smoke you did not know if you should keep the windows open to maybe get some fresh air, or close them to stop more smoke from getting in,\" said Sara Albino, a nursing student who volunteers at the hospital. At her worst, Albino's 20-month-old daughter had to use a nebulizer five times a day, which she has at home. Eye drops had to be applied constantly to ease the burning sensation in the child's eyes, her mother said. \"Her eyes would not stop tearing up ... they were almost glued shut; it was like conjunctivitis,\" she said. Urban fires According to the World Health Organization, fires in the Amazon pose a risk to health including from respiratory diseases, especially in children. But not all fires affecting Porto Velho are far away in the jungle, as they have become a cheap way to clear vegetation from urban areas for construction purposes, according to residents. Last week, the city's airport had to shut down after smoke from an urban fire got out of control. The vegetation on the roadsides leading to the airport was burned to a crisp. The fires in Brazil's sprawling Amazon rainforest have receded slightly since Bolsonaro sent in the military to help battle the blazes last week. Meanwhile, families do what they can at home. \"I bought a humidifier ... we keep it in my granddaughter's room,\" said Raimundo dos Santos, 71, who was selling water to people waiting in line at a Porto Velho health centre. The machine, which increases moisture in the air, has helped his eight-year-old granddaughter breathe. But the rest of the family is still struggling. \"I myself have already been to the hospital since the fires started,\" dos Santos said, adding that he was treated for smoke inhalation. "

The Indian weather service said Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Fani was expected to make landfall on Friday afternoon in Odisha state and barrel north-eastwards towards Bangladesh on a pathway that is home to more than 100 million people. In total, about 1.2 million people are expected to be evacuated from low-lying areas of 15 districts in the eastern state of Odisha to cyclone shelters, schools and other buildings, authorities said, reports Reuters. Along with \"extremely heavy\" rainfall in places, a storm surge of about 5ft is \"very likely\" to inundate some low-lying areas of Odisha, according to the Indian Meterological Department. Cyclone #FaniCyclone India's strongest summertime cyclone in the last 43 years, is likely to hit the #Odisha coast by Friday afternoon pic.twitter.com/JFhvcz5ebK A state relief department official told AFP that 780,000 people were moved to safer places overnight from at least 13 districts of Odisha, home to 46 million people, which will bear the brunt of the storm. \"We are expecting more than a million people to move out of the danger zone in next 12 hours,\" Bishnupada Sethi, Odisha Special Relief Commissioner, told AFP. Some 3,000 shelters in schools and government buildings have been set up to accommodate more than a million people. More than 100,000 dry food packets are ready to be dropped if needed, reports said. On Thursday the storm, which reports said was the biggest to hit eastern India in nearly two decades, was brewing in the Bay of Bengal and moving steadily and ominously towards the shore.  It was predicted to pack sustained wind speeds of 180-190 kph and gusts up to 200 kph, equivalent in strength to a Category 3 to 4 hurricane. It was expected to make landfall near the Hindu holy town of Puri, a major tourist hotspot. More than 100 trains have been cancelled in past 48 hours, according to Indian Railways. Three special trains were running from Puri to evacuate pilgrims and tourists. Authorities have asked tourists to leave coastal areas and avoid unnecessary travel. Special buses have been deployed in Puri and other towns. Dozens of officials were making announcements on hand-held megaphones across the coastal belt asking residents to leave their homes.

Speed of the wind may reach 200 km/hr. pic.twitter.com/YGHGlfAYLW  After Odisha, Fani was predicted to head north towards the state of West Bengal and then towards Bangladesh, where authorities were already preparing on Thursday. Other coastal states south of Odisha like Andhra Pradesh, home to 50 million people, and Tamil Nadu, population some 70 million, were also on standby. Fishermen have been advised not to venture out. The Indian Navy has also been put on alert.  Kolkata airport shutdown All flights from Kolkata's Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport will be cancelled from 9.30pm on Friday till 6pm on Saturday as Cyclone Fani is expected to make landfall tomorrow morning. All flights from Odisha capital Bhubaneswar have already been cancelled from midnight as the extremely severe cyclone nears the state's coast, south of temple town Puri. The Airports Authority of India also issued an advisory to all the coastal airports to take adequate precautions. India's biggest oil and gas producer ONGC has evacuated close to 500 employees from offshore installations and moved drilling rigs to safer locations, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported. \"Heavy rains are expected in all the coastal districts amid fears of flash floods. We are all geared up for the challenge,\" said Sethi. 'Total destruction' Forecasters have warned of the \"total destruction\" of thatched houses, the bending and uprooting of power and communication poles, the \"flooding of escape routes\" and damage to crops in some areas. Bangladesh Disaster Management chief Mohammad Hashim said that 3,600 cyclone shelters had been opened in 13 coastal districts. The country's weather bureau has told deep-sea fishing vessels to stay near the coast, while inland water transport activities were suspended.  Coastal-area farmers in Bangladesh were instructed to harvest their paddy fields as a surging tide may inundate and ruin crops. Fani is the fourth major storm to slam into India's east coast in three decades, the last in 2017 when Cyclone Ockhi left nearly 250 people dead and more than 600 missing in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.  The worst cyclone on record in Odisha in 1999, killed almost 10,000 people and caused an estimated $4.5 billion worth of devastation."

The landslide occurred shortly before sunset on Monday in West Java province. Search and rescue teams said they have found 15 people dead and are scouring the area for at least 25 missing. Pouring rain, power cuts and rough roads are preventing heavy machinery from accessing the area in Sukabumi regency, disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.  \"Relief efforts have also been hampered by a lot of people who want to get to the disaster,\" he said.  \"The roads are narrow which has caused rescue teams, logistics and ambulances to be stuck in traffic jams.\"  The search operation has halted for the day but will resume Wednesday morning.  Four people have been injured in the disaster and 60 others evacuated from the area, Nugroho said. Landslides are common in Indonesia, a vast tropical archipelago prone to natural disasters and torrential downpours. More than 20 people died in October when flash floods and landslides hit several provinces on Sumatra island, western Indonesia. In June 2016, nearly 50 people died when floods and landslides struck Central Java province."

Authorities ordered mandatory evacuations for hundreds of people as crews worked through the night to contain the so-called Sandalwood Fire, which had scorched about 500 acres near Calimesa, about 70 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. It was only 10% contained as of early Friday, Riverside County Fire Department (RCFD) officials said. The blaze, named after a local landmark, erupted on Thursday afternoon when a garbage truck dumped burning trash that spread onto vegetation, the RCFD and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said in a statement.  By early Friday, a second Southern California wildfire, dubbed the Saddleridge fire, spread to more than 4,000 acres in the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles, prompting an evacuation order for more than 1,900 homes. \"Once daylight comes, a more accurate assessment can be performed,\" the LA Fire Department said in a pre-dawn Twitter message. \"A number of homes have been destroyed by fire but the estimated number is not available at this time.\" The 2018 wildfire season was the deadliest and most destructive ever recorded in California, with about 100 residents and firefighters killed. More than 8,500 fires erupted, scorching more than 1.8 million acres and causing billions of dollars of damage. There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries from the latest blazes, among about 275 wildfires that have broken out across California as hot, gusty winds signaled the start of its peak fire season, state officials said."

According to Times of India, the minister said the state government has been writing to the federal government for the resolution of the problems caused by the dam and will do so again encompassing all issues. The Farakka barrage was constructed in the early 60s with the main purpose of helping flush out sediment deposition from Kolkata Port, besides addressing drinking water requirement in West Bengal. The dam became operational in 1975. \"It (Farakka barrage) must be dismantled in the interest of Bihar...People of Bihar have been suffering every year due to it. It has become 'sorrow' for all of us,\" Jha told reporters. \"What options do we have. Either it (barrage) should be dismantled otherwise people of Bihar will continue to suffer or it should be repaired completely by retrofitting it and carry out dredging in its upstream,\" he added.  The minister pointed out due to siltation in the upstream of the dam, the peak level water discharge from Ganga, which reaches Farakka within 48 to 50 hours in normal course from Patna, has not reached there even after seven days. Stating that Ganga's highest flow level at Allahabad and Patna was recorded at 85.09 meter and 49.79 meter respectively on September 22 this monsoon, Jha said the water reached Patna from Allahabad covering a distance of 515km in just two days, while it has already taken seven days to cover 415km of distance between Patna and the Farakka and the peak level water has not reached there yet. Making a strong plea to the central government to resolve the issue, he said if the things are not resolved, the problem would become \"grave\" especially for cities/towns situated along river Ganga in years to come. Asked as how many gates of Farakka barrage have been opened for water discharge, Jha said out of 109 gates, 76 have been opened fully while remaining 33 gates have been kept opened upto 75% which is sufficient for water discharge. \"I don't have any knowledge as when did these 10 extra gates were built over Farraka barrage,\" Jha said when journalists pointed out that Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that 119 gates of Farakka barrage were raised to prevent floods in Patna and other districts."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-07 00:00:00      \nExtending over eight countries from Afghanistan to Myanmar covering 3,500 kilometres, the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) is one of the greatest mountain systems in the world. It has more than 60,000 square kilometers of glaciers and 760,000 square kilometers of snow cover, which is a massive store of freshwater. It supports 240 million people living in this region and is also the source of 10 major Asian rivers including Ganges and Indus, providing essential resources to nearly two billion people  In recent years, the HKH - spanning over Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan - has been going through rapid changes due to climate change and a plethora of disruptions including natural disasters, infrastructure development, migration and land use change.  To evaluate the impacts of these forces on the HKH and address the environmental, economic and social pillars of sustainable mountain development, more than 350 researchers, practitioners, experts and policy makers from the region came together to develop the first comprehensive assessment of the HKH, which was developed over the last five years. The assessment report consists of 16 chapters, which assess the status quo of knowledge of the region, shed light on the various drivers of change in the region, address data gaps and provide actionable recommendations.  The report presents nine mountain priorities, aligned with the UN SDGs, including ending poverty in the mountains, universal access to clean energy in the mountains and halting biodiversity loss.  This report - the first in a series - has been produced as a part of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Monitoring and Assessment Programme (HIMAP), which is coordinated by International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).  \"The HKH is relevant to Bangladesh from water management and river management angles, as we are dependent on upstream countries. We cannot manage our water and disasters alone and trans-boundary cooperation is extremely important for Bangladesh for river water issues,\" said Golam Rasul, chief economist at ICIMOD.  \"Our dependency on upstream countries is very huge since rainfall water is not enough. So, for any planning of water resources In Bangladesh, we need to know what they are doing upstream. If they don't conserve water, we will have negative impacts in Bangladesh,\" he said.  Another important aspect for Bangladesh is disaster management. Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and China account for more than 50 percent of the world's groundwater withdrawals, and these take place mostly in the plains of river basins that originate in the HKH. The Ganga Brahmaputra Meghna basin is Bangladesh and the country drains huge amounts of water from July to September, making it prone to flooding. So, it needs collaboration regarding early warning, forecasting, planning for disaster mix management, etc.  \"The Bangladesh government should take it as a priority to work together with the HKH countries to manage disasters and develop water resources jointly,\" Rasul added. Prior to the report's launch, ICIMOD held an HKH Science Policy Forum in November 2018 with relevant think tanks, subject matter experts and decision makers. The consultative workshop explored ways to strengthen regional cooperation, including common priority actions. \"As a donor, we recognize that there will be less and less bilateral arrangements and more multilateral, so we need to invest in institutions that will take the work ahead in the long term,\" said Mandakini Suri of Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), a panelist at the HKH Science Policy Forum. \"My government believes we need cross border collaboration to solve environmental and climate change issues. We have arctic council in Europe to reduce pollution. It's an integrated part of our mission and helps secure peace and prosperity in the north,\" said Solveig Anresen, environment advisor of the Norwegian ministry of environment, and another panelist at the workshop.  \"Although the arctic countries are different, they have common goals on fighting climate change and environmental issues, and this is similar to the HKH countries. You need to engage indigenous people and women. We believe regional cooperation for development is the key to success,\" she added. The participants of this International Consultation Workshop also shared experiences and lessons learned in the context of river basin management, cross-border landscape approach, and regional cooperation.  The report finds that the effects of climate change on the HKH are particularly acute, with the number of extreme warm events, intense precipitation having increased and extreme cold events decreasing overall in the last five decades. Snow-covered areas and snow volumes are also projected to decrease in the HKH due to increased temperatures. Mountain settlements on the HKH are also highly vulnerable to natural disasters as they are located on unstable lopes that are prone to landslide, erosion, or floods, and if these trends continue, the frequency and magnitude of water-induced hazards will increase.  Moreover, even if global warming is limited to 1.5 C, warming will likely be much higher in the HKH, being at least 0.7 C higher in the northwest Himalaya and Karakoram.  However, consensus among climate models for the HKH region is weak - a result of the region's complex physical features and the coarse resolution of global climate models.  The report recommends stronger regional cooperation for greater sharing of scientific and indigenous knowledge, more reliable projections of temperature increase via better monitoring.  It also suggests that in addition to global emissions reductions to reduce temperature rise, enhancing adaptation to climate change requires transformative adaptation policies, including mainstreaming of adaptation into planning and budgeting processes.  \"20 billion USD investment is needed in the HKH for climate action. So, we need to educate businesses and build a business case for adaptation,\" said Debra Tan, head of China Water Risk - a Hong Kong based nonprofit dedicated to addressing business and environmental risks arising from water crisis.   \"Businesses just want to know how they are exposed so they can protect their assets. We need to map their assets to identify their risk exposure.\" she added. Another factor contributing to exacerbating climate change in the HKH is air pollution. Through the deposition of black carbon and dust, air pollution is speeding up the melting of ice. Mitigating air pollution requires investment in clean technologies and infrastructure according to the report.  Meeting the future energy needs of the HKH is a key focus of the report. While some HKH countries have scaled up off-grid initiatives, it is difficult to replicate those innovate business models for energy solutions in mountain communities.  In this context, the report states that Improving energy efficiency - particularly that of biomass which is widely used in the region - is the most cost-competitive strategy to meet the energy needs of the HKH.  Another option is to explore the full potential of hydropower and other renewables to combat its energy poverty and attain energy security, while also ensuring climate resilient development.  Agriculture is one of the main livelihood options in the HKH, but traditional agricultural systems in the region are under pressure with loss of agrobiodiversity and is failing to meet the food and income needs, which is affecting food security in the region. Mountain people are especially vulnerable to food and nutritional insecurity. When the high mountain areas experience heavy snow fall, people often decrease food consumption. Moreover, during bad weather conditions, road networks are often disrupted which makes food transport difficult. The high cost of transportation translates to high food prices, which often make them unaffordable, thus affecting people's nutrition. However, the challenges mountain communities face are often not properly understood or reflected in national agricultural policies. There is a lot that needs to be done to enhance food security of the HKH people, and many ideas were shared by participants of the HKH science policy forum in this regard. Agricultural production needs to be diversified, which will address the issue of farm income and increase food security. Moreover, a way of working needs to be created that transforms river basin approaches - using a multi import area development approach that looks at not only tourism but agro-tourism for instance. Market access also needs to be provided along with building human capability to understand the markets and new production techniques, and necessary land use policy changes made, which creates an enabling environment for ensuring food security.  The people living in the HKH are some of the poorest of the region, and comprise mostly of ethnic minorities, minority populations, and tribal groups. The report finds that in the Hindu Kush Himalaya, poverty incidence is one-third compared to one-fourth for the national average. The factors that predict poverty and its persistence in the HKH broadly are related to remoteness and limited access to markets and basic facilities, high dependence on natural resources, demographic, social and cultural factors and political and socioeconomic marginalization of the population. \"Poverty in the HKH is a very complex issue and the IUCN is quite concerned. One of the lessons learned is the earlier [action is taken] the better and having good metrics for measurement [of impact]. We need to focus on how we can help communities improve their livelihoods,\" said Boris Erg of IUCN.  \"We will try to look into how by making bankable and workable investment projects we can help link communities and make sectors work together,\" he added.  Because there is significant overlap of the determinants of vulnerability and of poverty in the HKH, the report suggests various measures, including allocation of resources for mountain poverty reduction programmes, with targeted approaches for indigenous and marginalized communities, social protection for climate threats, addressing multidimensional poverty and sharing of data among HKH countries.  The report presents two possible pathways that can lead the HKH to a prosperous scenario by 2080.  The first such pathway involves large-scale sustainable development investments with regional cooperation, with a focus on developing HKH's natural resources, infrastructure and human resources. This requires national and international funding through collaboration among state, corporate, and non-state actors. The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) and Indus Water Treaty are some examples relevant to this model.  The second pathway to prosperity combines investments with cooperation across multiple levels. This involves developing water and energy through smaller-scale and decentralized programs that promote self-reliance, and coordination among many non-state development and social actors. Farmer-managed irrigation systems in Nepal and local spring water management projects in India are examples of this approach. Effective environmental governance - the way formal and informal institutions act to manage the environment - is the key to address these multifaceted challenges in the Hindu Kush Himalaya, according to the report.  This involves equitable sharing of the environmental resources - forests, water, biodiversity, agriculture - as well as the costs, and risks.  While there are few existing regional policies and processes for environmental governance in the region; most are national and subnational. Environmental governance reforms require decentralization supported through subnational and national governance systems to scale up successful initiatives and empower community action, as well as transboundary cooperation.  \"Whether it is realistic in South Asia to think of a river basin wide agreement or treaty or will that always be elusive, is a key question, and we cannot put all our eggs in the same basket thinking there will be a big breakthrough with a broad region wide agreement in the future\" said Shantanu Mitra of DFID, who was a panelist at the HKH Science Policy Forum.  In spite of the political and cultural differences of the eight HKH countries, the common challenges unite them all and puts the impetus on them to cooperate to address the risks. \"There are rocky times ahead for the region: between now and 2080, the environmental, economic and social conditions laid out in the report could go downhill. Because many of the disasters and sudden changes will play out across country borders, conflicts among the region's countries could easily flare up,\" said Eklabya Sharma, deputy DG of ICIMOD. \"But the future doesn't have to be bleak if governments work together to turn the tide against melting glaciers and the myriad impacts they unleash.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-21 00:00:00      \nFrom the brink of destruction to one of the world's fastest growing economies As the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul came down to land at Kigali International Airport in the very early hours of July 3, sitting next to me, Egyptian Abdel Ismail on a business trip to Uganda, said: \"There is a gulf of difference between the Rwanda of 1994, and now.\" Referring to the notorious genocide for which Rwanda was known to the world, he said: \"This country has been able to miraculously leave it's tragic past behind, to become one of the greatest examples of reconciliation, not only in Africa, but also for the rest of the world.\" \"Enjoy yourself in this beautiful country,\" he added as we parted. In the next three days, I realized just how right my Egyptian friend was. This was my first visit to Rwanda in Central Africa. I was in Rwanda to take part in the first ever Kigali Global Dialogue at a leading hotel just opposite the Embassy of China, which has already made significant inroads in the continent of Africa. China has been described by many as the future influential player in the world. The government of Rwanda, in association with the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), a leading Indian think tank, organized the event to highlight the potential of Africa, especially Rwanda. Of course, many attending the dialogue were of the opinion that the involvement of the ORF was nothing but a counter to Chinese influence in Rwanda and the rest of Africa, a notion vehemently brushed aside by the President of the think tank. Anyway, let's forget about the geopolitics for now and focus on the tremendous transformation of Rwanda.  The Rwandan surprise for me began with the journey from the airport to the hotel in the diplomatic enclave. Kigali is a hilly green city, extraordinarily cleanl and disciplined. I never expected so many good things of this African nation. As a journalist, I did know how Rwanda suffered in the worst genocide since the Second World War. I was also aware how Rwanda clawed back from the devastation of genocide, through reconciliation. However, the extent of Rwandan development was beyond my imagination. In 1994, the Hutu-led government and it's militia massacred more than a million Tutsis and a third of the Twa people. About 70 per cent of the Tutsi population was wiped out. On July 4, 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Force, led by current President Paul Kagame, a retired General, defeated the Hutu government forces and militia and liberated the country. Since then, July 4 is celebrated as the Liberation Day of Rwanda. Following the liberation of Rwanda, which is one-fifth the size of Bangladesh with 11 million people, there were international and domestic trials to hold the perpetrators of the genocide accountable and many were punished. After a while, the Rwandan leadership realized there was no choice other than reconciliation for the nation to move forward. And the leadership, led by Kagame, who himself is a Tutsi, began the process of reconciliation by abolishing identification by ethnicity, that was introduced by colonial Belgium. Now, every person is identified as a Rwandan rather than a Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa. That was the beginning. Since then, Rwanda has come a long way, overcoming all odds . From the brink of destruction, the East African nation has become one of the fastest growing economies in the world and an example for the globe in many aspects, especially women's empowerment. It might sound astonishing to many that more than half the cabinet members are women. So is it in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament. There is also significant representation of women in the Senate, the upper house of Parliament. It's worth mentioning another aspect of their turnaround concerning the provisioning of   healthcare. In Rwanda, emergency medicines can be reached to any remote place in the country using drones, something not yet done in developed countries. Whoever comes to visit Rwanda will undoubtedly realize the power of a nation that is united."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-31 00:00:00      \nThis according to a 2018 Rajuk survey of 204,106 buildings in Dhaka  About 66% of the houses in the megacity of Dhaka have been illegally built--in plain view of Rajdhani Unnyan Katripakkha (Rajuk)--in contravention of mandatory building codes. Urban planners and architects think the unplanned urbanization and negligence by monitoring authorities has led to a situation where Dhaka dwellers are living among \"live atom bombs.\" A survey of 204,106 buildings over 1,528 square kilometres was conducted, under Rajuk's purview, in Dhaka from January-July 2018; a total of 134,925 buildings, or 66.1% of them, were found to be faulty. \"Of the 195,376 buildings already constructed, problems were found with 131,583 of the buildings. Of the 8,730 buildings under construction--that were surveyed--designs for 3,342 buildings were found to be faulty,\" Housing and Public Works Minister SM Rejaul Karim disclosed in parliament in early February this year. Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, urban planners claimed buildings which were built without following all security and safety measures are just like atom bombs that can explode at any time. They fear that thousands of city dwellers will be killed and Dhaka city will not be able to survive if a major disaster like an earthquake or fire hits the city. Rajuk member (Development Control) Abul Kalam Azad said the actual percentage of buildings that do not adhere to construction codes is much higher than the findings of the survey. \"Though the survey claims that only 66.1% of buildings violate the building codes, Rajuk found that around 95% of the buildings were constructed without adhering to Rajuk's building codes.\" He claimed that the discrepancy is down to his accounting for minor violations of the building codes.  The Rajuk official alleged that builders change approved designs while constructing the buildings after bribing the officials concerned. The Rajuk member also claimed that sometimes builders, or house owners, change the designs according to their own interests, compromising on security and safety measures. Why is unapproved infrastructure still being built? Industry insiders and urban planners state that Rajuk is conducting operations to evict the tenants of illegal constructions and demolish unauthorized installations; however, no legal action is being taken against the owners or builders of the buildings. As a result, the reconstruction of unapproved infrastructure cannot be stopped, they said. Construction sector experts say design plays an important role in protecting infrastructure from earthquake damage. A good design can considerably reduce the possibility of loss. Urban expert and architect Iqbal Habib said that Rajuk is responsible for these faulty buildings. He said: \"Considering the safety of Dhaka's city dwellers, Rajuk should identify these buildings as well as make the building lists public.\" Some who construct buildings four-to-five feet wider than their design, are not following the design approved by Rajuk. The foundations are weak, so this is dangerous in any natural disaster; starting with earthquakes.  Renowned civil engineer and former adviser to the caretaker government Professor Jamilur Reza Choudhury said there are fire risks in the entire city, and the massive population and unplanned urbanization adds to the mushrooming of illegal installations. \"The buildings are fitted together, so fire spreads quickly from one house to another.\" \"Although Rajuk takes various measures to combat the irregularities by housing companies, when it breaks down extra parts of these buildings the companies rebuild these sections some days later. So we have not been able to stop this yet,\" said Rajuk member Abul Kalam Azad. Most of Dhaka's land was reclaimed from water bodies and people established their buildings by filling the land, without hiring a civil engineer, he claimed. \"When we sent a letter to a listed responsible engineer, the engineer denied responsibility and said he was responsible only for a specific part of the building construction,\" he added. Mehedi Ahmed Ansary, professor at Buet's Department of Civil Engineering, said the risk is not rising because of a lack of design, but because of equipment and materials used. \"While constructing the buildings, the owners compromise with quality by using substandard materials. They are not setting up buildings properly as they are reducing costs in the foundations. Additionally, floods can occur because of poor construction, earthquake, or fire related problems,\" he added. The professor urged Rajuk to increase its manpower to conduct regular surveys and surveillance to improve the situation. Can third-party solutions help? Civil engineering experts think Rajuk could appoint third-parties to monitor the construction process to force builders to comply with building codes. Buet professor Mehedi Ahmed Ansary said that that developed world usually appoints third-parties to inspect building safety and they also monitor the construction processes. He claimed that they submitted a third-party proposal to Rajuk in 2016 but Rajuk has yet to accept the proposal. However Rajuk member Abul Kalam Azad said his office has signed an agreement with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) which will be responsible for monitoring all construction processes. Azad also hoped that they can sign another agreement with the Asian Development Bank soon over the issue. Warning tough action against illegal construction, the Housing and Public Works Minister SM Rejaul Karim said risky and uninhabitable buildings are being identified. \"Once the process is complete, we will move ahead [with demolition],\" he added. The minister furthered that the owners of unauthorized buildings will be asked to tear them down first, and the government will take legal measures and dismantle structures if the owners do not comply."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-02 00:00:00      \nThere is no planet B This year, farmers are in the spotlight because they did not get enough money for their production. The news created widespread anger and frustration among the masses. The government came forward to solve the problem, but they seem helpless. On the other hand, students have come forward to help the farmers in their lands, which was commendable. It shows the eagerness of the young people to reach out to the community to solve their problems. In many countries in the West, students do odd jobs to gain experience and earn money. I saw them working when I visited Canada last summer. There was no snow and the big fields were covered with strawberries, raspberries, green peas, etc. The farms were owned by the farmers and their families. As a visitor, we could pluck the berries and peas, and gather them in a basket. They charged us for them but it was very nominal. It was a great experience indeed to learn about farming. We can also do this in our country. The lesson that we should learn from the farmers in our country is very significant. They seldom protest for their grievances or rights being ignored. They are the silent heroes who work day long but are not rewarded. We should prioritize farming as much as we can. It can, in the long term, create job opportunities as well and also give us a rich dividend. Developing our farming industry is very important for the environment too. The extremely hot weather in Bangladesh, and also in the large areas of the sub-continent, tells us how global warming is already affecting our lives. People from all walks of life are waiting for the monsoon rain to come so that they can breathe a sigh of relief. But there is no respite. Aren't we responsible for this condition? As a species, we are moving forward. We are gaining more and more control over many elements of nature, but we are constantly facing the fury of nature at different places of this planet. For instance, droughts, extreme cold or heat, cyclones, floods, etc have taken away peace of mind. The way we are destroying mother nature, it is obvious we have to withstand its wrath in different forms at different places.  However, many small changes in our lifestyle and daily routine can pave the way to a greener life. First, we can reduce the use of plastics significantly. The ideas mentioned here may sound straight from old school giving the tendency of people buying plastic furniture to cookware. For instance, using boxes of stainless steel to carry food, having foods not with plastic cutlery can be a great start. For the beverage industry, avoiding straws is highly recommended. Additionally, a coffee culture is also beaming up in the city. With it, the use of plastic cups and mugs is increasing day by day, which is another threat to the environment. These plastic wastes are polluting the environment alarmingly. We should come to sense. We should go back to our old habit of using glassware or any other type of bio-degradable things. It is high time we shunned plastic goods in our day-to-day life. To add here, we can reintroduce the use of jute products in our homes. For example, jute bags can easily replace plastic bags which we use randomly. Moreover, jute represents our own cultural heritage. It is very eco-friendly too. Because of negligence, we are losing valuable forests. The Sundarbans has been under threat. But this has failed to draw the attention of most people. However, in the recent time, many organizations are campaigning for tree plantation drives. But it is not enough. They can also work with waste. Moreover, \"Clean Bangladesh\" drives should be carried out from time to time. The workers who will work under such projects should be paid too. These projects need to be well monitored. The UN will hold a climate change summit in September in New York, where ways and means will be discussed how best we can face challenges as a result of environmental pollution. This time various organization who work on the environment have emphasized on the slogan \"plans, not speeches.\" So we look forward to this summit where the leaders will come together with the initiatives that will be effective to save the world from further loss.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-01 00:00:00      \nWhole villages have been flattened and families were left mourning the death of relatives killed by trees and the debris A freak storm tore down houses and overturned cars and trucks as it swept across southern Nepal killing at least 27 people and leaving more than 600 injured, officials said Monday as a major rescue operation gathered pace. High winds battered the rural district of Bara and adjoining areas late Sunday. Five children were among the dead, the home ministry said, as rescuers battled to get relief supplies to the region and evacuate injured. The winds were so fierce that they overturned a bus carrying passengers, witnesses said. Houses, trees and electricity pylons were all toppled in the storm. Whole villages have been flattened and families were left mourning the death of relatives killed by trees and the debris, an AFP photographer in the stricken region said. Overturned cars blocked some roads. Injured victims flocked to local hospitals who were unable to cope, with some people were airlifted to Kathmandu for treatment. \"People who went back into their houses for shelter were crushed,\" said Jay Prakash Das, a Bara resident. \"We rushed out to help. A man had died right next to our building under a tree. People had fractured bones and many had head injuries,\" Das added. Hot and cold \"I've never seen anything like this. The winds took away everything, my home and my family,\" Ram Babu Patel, 45, whose wife was killed in the storm, told AFP.  \"I was at home getting ready for dinner when the storm hit - it was unbelievable. We have nothing left.\"  Prakash Tharu, a volunteer in Bara district, said the devastation caused by the storm had left \"a desperate need for food and relief.\" Rescuers struggled to reach many settlements blocked by fallen trees and electricity poles.  \"Security bodies including the army have been working intensely since Sunday night on rescues and relief,\" said Rajesh Poudel, Bara's district chief. Every year hundreds die in landslides and floods during Nepal's monsoon season, but storms causing such high casualties in spring are rare. The disaster comes as Nepal nears the fourth anniversary of a devastating earthquake that killed nearly 9,000 people and left millions homeless.  Nepal's difficult terrain and limited infrastructure often leaves emergency workers struggling to reach far-flung areas. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli expressed his condolences and said that the government would do its best for treatment of the injured.  The provincial government has announced free treatment and a financial assistance of $2,710 for families of the dead."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-22 00:00:00      \nAll acted accordingly and a substantial volume of paddy has already been harvested in the districts A hectic effort is now underway to save the Boro crop in the peak rice harvesting season amidst weather forecast of an early flash flood in some parts of Bangladesh's haor areas. With only a fifth of the Boro paddy harvested till April 20, weathermen informed the government yesterday that the Indian states of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura are expected to experience heavy downpours over the next 48 hours, thereby causing floods in some northeastern regions of Bangladesh. Sources at the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) told Dhaka Tribune yesterday that upon receipt of the flash flood forecast, officials have been instructed to further assist haor farmers in quickly reaping the standing Boro crop in the fields. They said, during the prolonged nationwide shutdown, the administration has helped farm labourers from many northern districts with transport to move to seven Haor districts for harvesting rice. Buildings of several thousand educational institutions have also been kept open to temporarily accommodate the farm labourers.   Quoting the latest forecasts from met offices of both Bangladesh and India, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) yesterday warned of possible flash floods in northeastern Bangladesh due to heavy downpours in some parts of the Indian states of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura over the next two days.   Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, a BWDB executive engineer, who regularly keeps track of flash floods and rains, told this correspondent yesterday: \"We've forewarned the concerned government departments about the possibilities of heavy rainfall-induced flash floods sometime in late April.\" \"It appears it's imminent now. All acted accordingly and a substantial volume of paddy has already been harvested in the districts, which may experience some inundation owing to heavy rainfall in Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura,\" explained Bhuiyan.    Meanwhile, the river ports have been asked to hoist cautionary signal number one on Wednesday as rain or thunderstorms are likely in some regions of the country. The regions are Rajshahi, Rangpur, Pabna, Bogura, Tangail, Dhaka, Mymensingh, Faridpur, Khulna, Barishal, Patuakhali, Noakhali, Cumilla, Chattogram, and Sylhet.      Rice farmers in seven haor districts - Kishoreganj, Netrakona, Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Sylhet and Brahmanbaria - are worried about completing the Boro harvesting before the floods.    Government on its part, has meanwhile provided haor farmers with 23 additional reapers and 128 more combined harvesters under its farm machinery subsidy scheme. And these freshly deployed harvesting machines joined an existing fleet of 383 reapers and 156 combined harvesters to help haor  farmers reap the Boro crop quickly.     The Agriculture Ministry confirmed Dhaka Tribune that the machines, apart from some 261,000 farm labourers, have joined forces to harvest Boro in the seven haor districts, which account for a fifth of the 20 million tons of Boro expected to be harvested across the country this year. Of the three rice seasons - Aus, Aman and Boro - the irrigated rice Boro contributes over 55 percent of Bangladesh's yearly output of the staple.       DAE sources told Dhaka Tribune that starting the second week of April, haor farmers have already managed to harvest rice from one lakh hectares of land till April 20. Boro acreage in seven haor districts has been nearly 4.5 lakh hectares this year. "

What is more worrying is that, according to leading global storm tracker AccuWeather, it is the first super cyclone in the Bay of Bengal since 1999, with fears that this storm will have a devastating impact across Bangladeshi coastal regions.  As we have not witnessed a cyclone of this magnitude for decades, and given Bangladesh's already precarious position in dealing with the coronavirus, it is absolutely essential that we treat this super cyclone with all the seriousness it warrants.  To that end, it is good to see Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina herself actively involved in monitoring the development of the cyclone.   This sends the right message to the rest of the authorities concerned, and indeed the entirety of the country, that this is an extremely serious situation, and everyone should be doing their best to brace for and mitigate the potential damage likely to be caused.  There is no way to truly be prepared for a cyclone, much less one of the magnitude Amphan is being touted to be. However, we must do our best, by closely monitoring the storm and evacuating people and transporting them to safety to the best of our abilities.  Already, hundreds of thousands of people from different coastal districts have been evacuated and taken into cyclone shelters -- this is the kind of response that will help us save lives and protect people from the cyclone.  Bangladesh has long been held as a leader in disaster management, and natural disasters, be they floods or cyclones, are something we unfortunately face every year. With careful monitoring and pro-active decision-making, we will be able to withstand the effects of Amphan as well."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-26 00:00:00      \nLabour crisis worries farmers in Nilphamari Local leaders, teachers, traders, students, and boy scouts have joined hands in harvesting Boro paddy in haor areas of Moulvibazar, racing against the impact of incessant rain, flash floods and the shortage of farm workers caused  by the coronavirus outbreak. Moulvibazar Deputy Commissioner Nazia Shirin, Superintendent of Police Faruk Ahmed, and Municipality Mayor Md Fazlur Rahman, are some of the many who lent a hand to farmers harvesting crops in Hakaluki, Kauadighi, and Baikkabil Hail haor regions. They hoped  their action would inspire others to help farmers, as Boro crops require timely harvesting. Hundreds of Chhatra League men, like many others across the country, have been helping farmers during the harvest season in the past three days, acting on the premier's directives, said Sahab Uddin Sabel, president of Juri upazila unit Chhatra League. The lack of public transport, triggered by the ongoing shutdown to rein in coronavirus, has confined labourers to their homes and left farmers in trouble.  \"In this crisis, we will harvest and deliver the farmer's crop to his doorstep when farmers contact us,\" added Sabel. Farmers expressed their gratitude to local Chhatra League men as they expressed their intention of continuing the task for more farmers.  Farmer Monoranjan Biswas said: \"We had a good Boro yield this season. I am a poor man. I was worried about harvesting my paddy in time, due to farmworker shortages and flash floods. Some Chhatra League men harvested my paddy and I will always be grateful to them.\" Moulvibazar Deputy Commissioner Nazia Shirin said: \"There is a shortage of farm labourers due to coronavirus fears this year. It's been raining here for a few days. I have visited fields in the haor region so that people are inspired to help farmers whose crops are at risk due to the rains and flash floods. Already, 65 percent of the paddy has been harvested in the district. We are ready to operate 35 combine harvesters and 113 reaper machines.\" Labour crisis worries farmers in Nilphamari Farmers expressed concern about arranging farm workers as Boro harvesting is about to begin in 20 to 25 days in Nilphamari. Boro rice was cultivated on 82,665 hectares of land in Nilphamari where a bumper harvest of 394,536 tons is expected this season, according to Department of Agricultural Extension sources. Abdul Matin, a farmer of Charkharibari village in Dimla upazila, said: \"I have cultivated Boro paddy on 5 bighas of land this season. But harvesting is adversely impacted due to the countrywide shutdown triggered by the coronavirus outbreak. Labourers often go from village to village during the harvesting season. If they cannot get out of their homes in time, farmers have much to worry about.\" District DAE Deputy Director Nikhil Chandra Biswas, said: \"labourers who left Nilphamari for harvesting in other districts will get back before the harvest begins here. We have 19 combine harvesters. Ten more will be readied. Hopefully there won't be any crisis for farm workers here.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-28 00:00:00      \nThe grant will support procurement of health safety materials Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $300,000 emergency grant to support Bangladesh's fight against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The grant was approved on Friday. The grant will support procurement of health safety materials including personal protective gears, N95 masks, safety goggles, aprons, thermometers, and biohazard bags.  The list has been prioritized by the Directorate General of Health Services(DGHS), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh. The materials will help the government to strengthen its efforts to contain the spread of the virus in the country.  The grant assistance is sourced from the ADB Regional Technical Assistance titled \"Regional Support to Address the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Potential Outbreaks of Other Communicable Diseases\". ADB Country Director Manmohan Parkash said ADB is fully committed to supporting Bangladesh in the fight to control Covid-19, and this is only the first of the planned support that ADB is preparing to provide the Bangladesh government to deal with this difficult situation. \"This assistance will invigorate Bangladesh's ability to strengthen prevention, improve health professionals' protection from the disease, test people to detect infection, manage severe cases, and reduce the risk of the deadly virus' mass transmission,\" said Parkash.   \"We are working tirelessly to put together further assistance in the health and financial sectors,\" Parkash added.  In the face of a threat of a coronavirus outbreak, the Bangladesh government has taken various actions and adopted measures in line with the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations. On March 18, ADB announced a $6.5 billion initial package to address the immediate needs of its developing member countries as they respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.  ADB's previous responses to Covid-19 include $200 million made available through ADB's Supply Chain Finance Program for companies manufacturing and distributing medicines and other items needed to combat the pandemic.  ADB's response to date also includes $2 million announced on February 7, to enhance detection, prevention, and response in the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Greater Mekong Subregion; another $2 million announced on February 26, to support response in all its developing members; and a CNY130 million ($18.6 million) private sector loan, signed on February 25, to Wuhan, PRC-based pharmaceutical distributor Jointown Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd to support the continued supply of essential medicines and personal protective equipment.  Another grant of $600,000 was provided to Sri Lanka on March 13. ADB has a strong track record of responding rapidly to provide targeted support to Bangladesh in times of emergencies, including natural disasters such as floods and cyclones, and other disasters like influx of people in Cox's Bazar camps from across the Myanmar border."

Visiting Ilish Mokam at Port Road area of the city (largest wholesale market of Barisal), a kg of Ilish was found selling at Tk650-800 depending on the size of fish. Last year the price was almost double during the same period. Talking to this correspondent, the fishermen said that they had been netting a huge amount of Ilish since the middle of winter though it was an off-season for the species. Most of the Ilish were caught from Elisha, Meghna and Kalabadar and other southern rivers and coastal waters, Said Sentu Mia, a local fisherman.  He believed that upstream flow of the rivers are higher this year than previous years, which was why a huge quantity of big-size Ilish were available in the rivers. Fish traders said the sudden rise in supply made the Ilish price cheaper. \"Currently, every day at least 1,000 mound of Ilish enter our Mokam,\" said Ujjal Das, a Port Road based wholesaler, adding that the supply was very high.  Traders were sending these Ilish to Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and other areas of the country, he added.  \"The sizes of most of the Ilish are between 700-1200 gram. Usually such amounts of large-size Ilish is rare during winter,\" he informed. \"Increased supply in the market made the price cheaper,\" he said, adding that last week the price fell further. Now Ilish weighing 1,000-1,500 gram per piece are selling at Tk800 per kg, while those below 1000 gram sells at Tk 650-700 per kg, added Ujjal, saying that last year it was Tk1,200 and Tk800. However officials from the Department of Fisheries claimed the high yield of Ilish as their success out of anti-Jatka drives. Dr. Bimal Chandra Das, district fisheries officer (Ililsh), said that the government had taken different steps to protect breeding of Ilish that caused the increased supply. Anisur Rahman, Ilish researcher and chief scientific officer of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI) at Chandpur centre, said that main Ilish season is from August to October.  \"There is also another short season from November to January. So it is not unusual for getting big Ilish in winter,\" he added.  Government's efforts to protect Jatka (Ilish less than 10 inches in length) and ensuring safe breeding also contributed to the increased Ilish production, he explained."

      "authors": "Jyoti Rahman",
      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-21 00:00:00      \nCan Bangladesh avert a humanitarian or financial crisis? Economists aren't known for their imagination, the lack of which among the practitioners of the dismal science is evidenced by the prevalence of the adjective \"great\" to describe economic events. Thus, the worldwide slump of the 1930s became the Great Depression, and the 2008-09 financial crisis led to the Great Recession. Enter into this dubious pantheon of greats the Great Lockdown -- the moniker given by the IMF to the shutdown of economic activities around the world in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The World Economic Outlook -- the IMF's flagship publication -- is released twice a year, in April and October, at meetings in Washington DC that are attended by the finance ministers, central bank governors, and other econocrats from around the world.  There was no DC gathering this April, and the first chapter of the Outlook was released last week. The Fund projects the world economy to shrink by 3% in 2020. Not only is this a sharp downgrade from January projections, but if realized, this will be a worse performance than what happened in 2009 across the world (Chart 1).  Chart 1: GDP growth   Source: IMF. If the real world was a textbook economic model, the Great Lockdown would have been followed by the Gala Reopening -- the consumers would have spent on the pent-up demand, and the firms would be busy filling the shelves. Unfortunately, the real world is not so simple. The scary thing about the Fund's forecasts is that they are based on assumptions that may well be too optimistic. The IMF assumes that the pandemic will fade in the second half of the year, allowing for a gradual lifting of containment measures around the world. These are strong assumptions.  Medical and life scientists' understanding of the virus is evolving by the hours, but as things stand, we simply don't know enough about the virus to say whether the pandemic will fade in a few months, or whether there might be a second wave of outbreak. Overlaying this is the thorny politics of lockdown and re-opening around the world. The uncertainty around the economic impact of the pandemic is illustrated by how the financial markets view 2020 growth prospects for China -- the origin of the pandemic and one with the most data points about the economic impacts of the lockdown. As of April 6, the average among the blue chip forecasting firms' projection for China was 2% growth for 2020, compared with 5.2% forecast a month earlier. Underneath this average forecast was, however, a remarkable spread, with some forecasters still expecting China to grow by 5% or more this year, while others expecting a contraction of up to 3%. The IMF's forecast for Bangladesh will be included in the complete World Economic Outlook, which is scheduled for May. The World Bank, however, has released a detailed analysis of the economic impact of the pandemic on South Asia. The Bank forecasts the Bangladesh economy to grow by 2-3% in the fiscal year 2019-20 and 2.2-2.9% in the fiscal year 2020-21. To put these numbers in context, in the five years to 2019, average annual growth rate was 7.5%, while as of October 2019, the IMF was expecting the economy to grow by 7.3-7.4% a year into 2024, and the last time the country experienced a growth rate below 3% was when HM Ershad was still president (Chart 2). Chart 2: Economic growth in Bangladesh (%)  Source: IMF, World Bank.World Bank forecasts are for fiscal years. Considering the huge uncertainty around the assumptions that underpin these forecasts -- both the IMF's global ones as well as those by the World Bank for South Asia -- it might be more useful to focus on the detailed mechanisms behind the headline numbers. And such, a detailed examination would highlight the complex policy challenges of this multi-layered crisis. As best as one can guess, with a determined effort and a bit of luck, Bangladesh may be able to avert a humanitarian or financial crisis in the near term. But the pandemic will likely leave the country much weaker in the medium term, derailing the hard earned development trajectory of the past decades. In the near term, like the rest of the world, Bangladesh is also facing what the Economist calls the grim calculus (the London magazine is better in the profession when it comes to coining phrases). But the trade-off between lives and livelihood is particularly acute in Bangladesh, which is potentially at risk of a humanitarian crisis -- what Asif Saleh of Brac calls the pandemic of hunger. Largely reflecting the collapse in global oil prices, the World Bank expects inflation to remain moderate (Chart 3). But it does acknowledge the risk of food price spikes. If countries ban food (particularly rice) exports and transport routes are disrupted, risks to food security and social disruption will heighten. Chart 3: CPI inflation (%)  Source: IMF, World Bank.World Bank forecasts are for fiscal years. Of course, an important threat to food security is from various social distance measures. However, it is not at all clear that social distancing as practised in the advanced economies is appropriate for Bangladesh. Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, a Yale economist, puts it succinctly: \"If you're a day-wage labourer in a rural area of a developing country, and you don't have much of a buffer of savings, you may be reliant on your wage earnings in a given day or a given week in order to feed your family. \"Now, in a country where there's social insurance and you can target social protection to people who are in that situation, maybe you can tide them over for this period of need. But in a country where it's not easy for us to identify people who need that social protection and provide aid to them directly, it's going to be very difficult for us to ensure that they abide by those guidelines. \"If their family is going hungry that week, they're not going to follow all of your guidelines.\" Mobarak is repurposing his existing research to explore public health measures that are more fit for purpose for our conditions. We can also learn from two other densely populated, manufacturing and remittance dependent monsoon lands that have done well to tackle the pandemic. Tightened border controls, agile health departments, tech platforms, and a hand-washing song that went viral helped in Vietnam. Aggressive testing, contact tracing, cooked meals helped in Kerala. In both cases, public awareness played a crucial role. Is Bangladesh behind the curve when it comes to flattening the curve through public awareness? Even as the world was shutting down, Dhaka saw a huge concert on March 7 and large public gatherings on March 17, to say nothing of the RMG worker return to Dhaka fiasco in the first week of April and the massive janaza in Brahmanbaria as recently as April 17.  Well, if we are late then it's all the more urgent to put the effort into a 360 degree campaign to raise public awareness.  Few regimes in the world have a friendlier media and civil society. Crisis is the time for all that chumminess to turn to concerted action-oriented camaraderie.   What else can be done? The government has announced cash handouts. A variation of the \"universal basic income\" concept that is popular among progressive activists and wonks in the West, this is being tried in a number of countries (the Pakistan example would appear to have caught the fancy of Bangla social media). The idea here is that government programs are complex and inefficient, people know what they need, so give them cash and trust their judgment. Forrest Cookson, a Dhaka-based American economist, suggests using the voter list and puts a price tag of 2% of GDP. His approach may well be feasible, and is worth pursuing. But it may not be enough on its own. Exactly how will a cash handout help by itself if there is no rice in the market? If there is a food shortage, and prices are rising, cash handouts will risk fuelling that inflation even higher. If we are worried about the poor going hungry, we need to give them food, not just cash. And if there is any country that knows how to distribute relief efficiently and forestall famine, it is Bangladesh.  As Asif Saleh puts it: \"Covid-19 is new and different in important ways, but we are home to premiere public health experts and institutions. We have one of the world's best networks of community health workers, a rich history of public-private partnerships in emergencies, and communities with incredible levels of resilience. We have weathered cyclones, floods, and so much more.\" Of course, the pandemic is different from cyclones and floods. The contagion element has to be addressed in the relief operation. For example, the World Bank report shows that Bangladesh performs the worst in the region when it comes to access to soap for hand washing. Shruti Rajagopalan and Alex Tabarrok of George Mason University recommend trucking in water and soap for hand washing. Something similar should be feasible in Bangladesh. The authors also recommend: Using cell phones to survey, inform, and pre-screen for symptoms, and subsidizing phone accounts alive; and requisitioning and repurposing government buildings as quarantine facilities. Both may well be feasible in Bangladesh. Even without any food crisis, the pandemic is already wrecking lives and livelihoods. Depending on the measure, over three-quarters of Bangladeshis work in informal sectors. The Great Lockdown is hitting them particularly hard.  Using cell phone data, the World Bank report notes that 10 million people may have left Dhaka as their incomes dried up. Unsurprisingly, the Bank forecasts a sharp slowdown in service sector and household consumption growth. As a result, the World Bank estimates 15 million people will fall below the poverty line -- that is, people earning less than US$1.90 in 2011 prices -- by 2021-22  In the short term, that is over the next weeks and months, as the global economy remains frozen, orders, production, profits, and jobs are taking hits. The chaos and despair in the garments belt north of Dhaka is visible to all.  Reflecting the global slump, the World Bank forecasts a nearly 20% fall in exports in 2019-20. Meanwhile, factories in Bangladesh's major competitors are partly (Indonesia, Cambodia) or fully open (China, Vietnam). If the rest of the world recovers as the IMF optimistically assumes, it's important that Bangladesh doesn't miss out on the winter production schedule, orders for which typically would come in during May-June.  China and Vietnam are in much better shape than us when it comes to the pandemic. That may well be the case when it comes to production of the country's major export.  Even more worryingly, exports are not expected to rebound until 2021-22. Reflecting the global uncertainty, investments are also expected to remain tepid into 2021-22. Clearly, the longer the global recession continues, the more pressure businesses and firms will be under.  Bangladeshi businesses are, by and large, not cash-rich, high-margin firms. Many RMG factories will not survive if the global slump continues beyond 2020. If the country's industrial capacity is damaged because of the pandemic, longer term development prospects will dim. Contrary to the populist reactions, therefore, there is much logic to the government's support (not stimulus -- that's a misnomer!) package.  The global slump is also exacting its toll on the other driver of growth -- remittances. Remittances continued in the aftermath of the 2008-09 crisis as the gulf economies recovered and migrant workers with precarious lives sent money back to the only safe haven they know -- Bangladesh.  This time may be different. The service sector jobs whence much of our remittances come are also the ones that are affected by the social distancing policies around the world. Most of the Bangladeshi workers around the world don't have a savings buffer. As their incomes stop, presumably so will remittance.  In addition to dampening household income and consumption as remittances dry up, the country's external balances will be hit. The World Bank projects a widening of the current account deficit (Chart 4).  How concerning is that? Chart 4: Current account deficit (% of GDP)  Source: IMF, World Bank.World Bank forecasts are for fiscal years. The currency crisis As the pandemic went global in February and March, financial markets around the world recoiled. Most emerging markets experienced unprecedented capital flight -- $90 billion dollars in the first quarter of 2020, far higher than was experienced during the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Investors did not differentiate between countries -- money simply flew to the safety of the dollar. Exchange rates tumbled -- both Indian and Pakistani rupees have fallen by over 7% since the beginning of the year. So far, the taka has avoided the carnage, and foreign exchange reserves remain ample (Chart 5). Chart 5: Reserves in terms of months of imports  Source: CEIC Asia. The best way to forestall a currency crisis is to avail an IMF lifeline, which is exactly what's being done. The Fund is essentially giving free money to the developing world to cushion finances from the economic freeze. And Bangladesh has had strong macroeconomic fundamentals over the last three decades.  That is, with luck, a currency crisis should be avoided. Nonetheless, moving into the longer term, the Great Lockdown will still leave a fiscal scar. Even without any significant new policies, the World Bank expects the budget deficit to nearly double to about 10% of GDP in 2020-21. Public debt is projected to rise from 33.8% of GDP in 2018-19 to over 50% of GDP in 2021-22.  Of course, the pandemic will leave a huge fiscal imprint around the world. But as is the case for individuals, so it is for countries that the poor can afford debt the least. Ultimately, how the fiscal burden is shared between different sections of society reflects the underlying socio-political settlements. And there is no getting away from the fact that our polity was in extremely rude health well before the pandemic.  For the last four decades or so, there has been an elite consensus in Dhaka to do whatever it takes to avoid a repeat of the macabre dance of deluge and death that hit us in the early 1970s. That consensus underpinned the exports and remittance-driven growth of the last four decades and the accompanying social development.  When an economy grows at 7% a year, incomes double roughly a decade. At 3% growth rate, it takes a quarter century. A new growth and development model will be needed to revert to the faster pace of growth after the pandemic is over.  But that's in the longer term. Before that, we will need to survive the Great Lockdown.   Jyoti Rahman is an applied macroeconomist (www.jrahman.wordpress.com)."

The minister was speaking via video message from his residence on Saturday, reports UNB. \"Farmers in the haor area have managed to harvest 44% of the paddy thanks to the various steps taken by the Ministry of Agriculture,\" he said. He said farmers would be able to complete the harvest in time if heavy rainfall or early floods did not occur.  He thanked political and social organisations, voluntary groups, students and teachers of schools and colleges and the Chhatra League for helping farmers in harvesting paddy during this crisis period. Razzaque conveyed his thanks to local administrations, public representatives, police, health division, and agriculture departments at district, upazila and union levels in this regard.  Boro harvesting has begun in different areas of the country, but a severe labour crisis has been caused by the restrictions on movement over the coronavirus outbreak in the country."

It happens every year and we need a sustainable plan to avert this kind of situation in the future' Farmers are forced to harvest their half-ripe paddy in the haor regions as croplands are inundated by incessant rain and water from upstream in Bishambharpur upazila of Sunamganj.  The Surma River has risen significantly and it is keeping water in the haors, causing waterlogging in the croplands, said the local Water Development Board (WDB). Md Al-Amin of the local WDB said: \"The Surma has swollen up due to the incessant rain in the past few days. Now, we can't lower the rubber dam because that will let more water into the haors.\"  On a visit to the affected areas on Friday, this correspondent found farmers waist deep in water, busy harvesting their crops in anticipation of another flood.  Farmer Narayan Barman of Krishna Nagar said: \"Our croplands are always flooded during this time of the year and this year it's no different. We are worried that our half-ripe crops will be damaged in the coming floods if we don't harvest it soon.\" Askar Ali, another farmer from the same village, said: \"I planted 29 varieties of paddy this year, all of which have been inundated by the rush of water  from upstream and high plains. The paddy has taken its time to ripen. But I had to begin harvesting to save my crops from getting completely submerged.\"  Monju Barman said: \"We can't find farmhands to help with harvesting because no one wants to work all day waist-deep in water. We now have to pay extra to hire good help.\" Sreebash Chandra Barman said: \"The haors are full, water can't flow and has nowhere to go, and the upstream water can't drain into the Surma River. This is ridiculous that it happens every year. We need a sustainable plan to avert this kind of situation in the future.\" Bishambharpur Upazila Parishad Chairman Safar Uddin said: \"Due to incessant rain in the past few days, water from upstream, with no path to get to the rivers, has inundated the croplands in the low-lying regions. This happens every year. The upazila administration is prepared to compensate farmers for their potential losses.\" Bishambharpur Upazila Agriculture Officer Deepak Kumar Das said: \"Farmers have begun harvesting their half-ripe crops, worried about impending floods but this should not be a problem. \"Farmers of the upazila have already harvested paddy from 1,620 hectares of the total 1,820 hectares of paddy croplands in the region. Weather permitting, all farmers in the low-lying regions can gather their harvest in time.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-05 00:00:00      \n'I used to lose sleep thinking that an early flood this year may destroy all my hard-earned crops because the labour deficit may not allow me to gather my harvest in time' Farmers have successfully gathered 95% of Boro paddy in Moulvibazar, despite uncertainties over the availability of labour and an early onset of the flood, potentially threatening this year's harvest in the district. With tireless efforts from 27,135 farmhands and using 39 harvesters and 121 reaper machines, farmers have managed to overcome the challenges brought forth by the coronavirus pandemic this year, says the district agriculture department. Local farmers say the labour wages were higher compared to previous years due to this year's labour shortage. However, they all agree that they were very worried about this year's harvest and now they are delighted to have gathered it all so quickly.  Farmer Kamal Miya, of Hakaluki Haor, said: \"I used to lose sleep thinking that an early flood this year may destroy all my hard-earned crops because the labour deficit may not allow me to gather my harvest in time. But, there was no problem this year.\" According to the Department of Agriculture Extension, this year the target for Boro production was set at 53,500 hectares and due to favourable weather and absence of sudden natural disasters, farmers have managed to reach that target.  Moulvibazar Department of Agriculture Extension Deputy Director Kazi Lutful Bari said: \"Farmers have harvested 95% of Boro paddy in the district. The month of April posed some threats with potential hails and floods to damage the crops. But, farmers of haor regions have already gathered their harvest. Now, farmers in highland regions can take their time to harvest their crops.\" Regarding the preparations of an early flood in the district, Water Development Board Executive Engineer Ranendra Shangkar Chakraborty, said: \"Boro farmers have successfully saved their crops from this year's flood. But, we are also aware of the impending Aush and Aman cultivation this year.\" \"All vulnerable embankments of Monu and Dhalai rivers have already been repaired. We have taken all possible measures to quickly take actions in case of a sudden dam collapse during the rainy season.\" Meanwhile, Agricultural Minister Md Abdur Razzaque on Tuesday told an online media briefing that farmers have already harvested about 90.02% of the Boro paddy sowed in the Haors and marshlands of Bangladesh. He said that Boro paddy was cultivated across 454,399 hectares of wetlands this year, with 400,906 hectares yielding harvests."

      "headline": "Women's empowerment is vital for climate resilience - but the burden of survival in Bangladesh should not rest on their shoulders alone",
      "authors": "Basundhara Tripathy Furlong and Isobel Talks",
      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-09 00:00:00      \n                                                                    As we all know, Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Partly this vulnerability can be attributed to the physical characteristics of the country, such as the flat, low-lying topography and climactic features which render it highly susceptible to floods, droughts, cyclones and earthquakes. However, socioeconomic factors also leave Bangladesh vulnerable in this time of climate emergency. The country has a very high population density, with many living below the poverty line (Pouliotte, Smit and Westerhoff, 2009). Social risks - such as gender inequality, social discrimination, unequal distributions of resources and power at the intra-household level and limited citizenship - have been important factors in pushing and keeping households in poverty. Additionally, the country has suffered a long history of weak political governance, and many livelihoods here rely on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture and fishing (Huq and Ayers, 2008). Gender inequality has also been highlighted as a key barrier to climate resilience. In Bangladesh, unequal power relationships between men and women have resulted in a greater number of women experiencing poverty than men (Kabeer, 2003).The patriarchal system prevalent in mainstream Bengali society perpetuates oppressive gender roles. Alongside having unequal access to resources,women tend to have responsibility for care giving and the provision of food and fuel in the household. These tasks are highly affected by climactic disasters. All of these factors make it more difficult for women to recover from flooding and drought, as they are more reliant on climate sensitive resources than men and thus cannot adapt as easily as men can. Women are also less well represented than men in decision making processes at both national and local levels, so it is hard for them to advocate for changes to this inequality. However, there has been a pushback in recent years against this 'men-versus-women dichotomy' in climate change studies, as some argue that this \"feminisation of vulnerability\" reinforces a \"victimization discourse\" (Djoudi et al, 2016: 248). In fact, women are often proactive agents of adaption, and the causes of vulnerability are multifaceted and dependent on political relations beyond gender alone. It is this complexity that the panelists in the 'Embedding Gender Equality in Climate Action' session at the 4th CSD conference on 18th October 2019 sought to address. The first presentation from Dr Anastasia Seferiadis, Dr Oliver Scanlan and PhD scholar Basundhara Tripathy-Furlongaptly demonstrated the intricacy of gender and power, and inaptitude of the simplistic 'women as climate victims' discourse, in Bangladesh. Drawing on case-studies of a female centred micro-credit organisation in Jessore, a women's informal 'bondhu' group in Satkhira, and women's key role in the AchikMithik Samity in Madhupur they showed that women in Bangladesh are amassing and strategically deploying social capital, acquiring habits, skills and capacities to enable them to renegotiate their position, and appropriate elements of various projects in a DIY fashion as best suits them and their situation. However, due to the patriarchal environment of Bangladesh they are unable to dramatically rupture social ties, but instead are incrementally 'reweaving' them. The second presentation from Nasrin Siraj, PhD student at the University of Amsterdam, also disrupted the notion of a straightforward male and female divide, as her paper explored ethnic tensions in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in relation to inter-ethnic marriage. Expanding on our understanding of ethnicity within cosmopolitan sociability, this paper reflected on marriage practices (love marriage and arranged marriage) in shared neighbourhoods of Indigenous people and Bengali-muslim migrants. Through examples of inter-ethnic marriages from her ethnographic fieldwork, the presenter demonstrated shifting identities within the hill tracts of indigenous communities and their interaction with the mainstream Bengali population. The third paper, presented by Ms Sayeda Karim, Research Associate at ULAB, investigates female leaders in Bangladesh and their perception of climate change. Her research discovered that not only do women need to be given leadership opportunities so that their perspectives can be heard and needs met in climate strategies, but also that current leaders need support and opportunities to network so that they can develop an understanding of how climate change is affecting sectors beyond those that they specialise in. Finally, the fourth paper from PinashAkter, Project Officer at OXFAM, and Anushree Ghosh, MSc Student at Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science & Technology University, explored OXFAM's PROTIC project, a participatory initiative that has trained local women in how to use mobile technology to gain knowledge on climate adaptation strategies. The paper highlighted the role of gender in building climate resilience through the PROTIC project implemented in Dimla, Nilphamari. The main aim was to understand the function of the mobile phone for climate change adaptation led by women farmers.  In the discussion that followed the presentations it was reiterated, as the papers had made clear, that the solipsistic 'women are climate victims' rhetoric should be avoided. But it was also raised that there are risks to only emphasizing women's role as climate agents too. As one discussant Saydia Gulrukh, a journalist with New Age, noted; \"We need to interrogate gender as a social construct. In Bangladesh micro-enterprise has sought to empower women with knowledge, but infact women end up burdened with more work and responsibility on top of their rigid domestic roles ... so when we talk about women's role in climate resistance and how women can work towards climate adaption I worry that in the name of inclusion we may burden women with more unpaid work\". In relation to the last paper, another discussant, Dr. Samiya Luthfa, Associate Professor at the Department of Sociology in the University of Dhaka, questioned whether giving women mobile phones with climate adaptation information was enough to break through the societal and cultural barriers in rural areas of Bangladesh. As gender is a binary, it must not be forgotten that we need to redefine masculinity, and engage men in that process, in order to also dismantle fixed notions of femininity. The WID (Women In Development) approach, which arose in the 1970s within international development, was roundly criticized for utilizing a \"just add women and stir\" approach (Harding, 1995). Proponents of this school of thought hypothesized that bringing women into capitalist modes of production would increase prosperity all round, but they neglected considering how unequal gender relations had led to women being confined to the domestic sphere in the first place. The GAD (Gender And Development) approach that was formed in response to these critiques instead specifically focuses on the power relations between women and men, rather than on women alone (Plewes and Steurt, 1991:127). In the debates on climate adaptation in Bangladesh, it will be vital for this critical approach to gender to be applied so as to avoid over burdening women with the work of survival, rather than addressing the power imbalance between men and women, so that communities can become more resilient as a whole.

Almost all comms professionals, especially in Bangladesh, are now experiencing a new element in crisis communication since the pandemic struck more than 200 countries.  Almost all the companies of Bangladesh have their own crisis communication strategies, but this was something they never expected to experience. In the context of Bangladesh, crisis communication only means tackling potentially negative news in the media, or trying to mitigate the damage to a tolerable level.  Keeping comfortable and supportive relationships with the media people is synonymous to crisis communication in this country. Before I started working with a bank about a year ago, I used to work with a telecom company that had about 13,000 mobile network towers across the country.  During natural disasters such as cyclones and floods, we were needed to communicate to the people in the coastal areas of Bangladesh about how to take care of themselves and vacate their homes and go to cyclone shelters. The government always depends on the telecom companies for this.  However, the real crisis communication in Bangladesh started during this pandemic, which went way beyond our plans and thinking. But we learned a lot of aspects about both external and internal communications. We have 8,500 people working for the bank, and we felt the need to make them aware on what was coming.  At the end of February, even before the first case was identified in Bangladesh, we formed an informal core committee that started monitoring the spread, flight, and behaviour of the virus. With an enormous workforce, it was urgent to make them aware of how to remain safe from any kind of contamination.  We have an e-learning platform, which we thought could be utilized. We started gathering as much information as we could from the reliable sources, such as the government, WHO, BRAC, and some major international news organizations. By the first week of March, we were able to prepare a set of FAQs for all employees.  The FAQ was simple: What is coronavirus, how prevent it, what to do when someone is infected. However, communicating this to an enormous workforce was a challenge. Informal surveys say no one actually reads most of the emails that are sent to them.  Therefore, sharing the FAQs with team leaders and department/unit heads was very effective, and they made sure that everyone read the FAQs and knew the facts available at that time. Gradually, many more facts surfaced, and we could know about the life-threatening risks.  When the first coronavirus case was identified in our country, we had to move faster than we thought we could. The government, as well as the media in Bangladesh, began to provide various kinds of information on the prevention. We started implementing social distancing practices.   Communicating this was vital. We observed that people were already panicked, and that helped. Our communications regarding social distancing worked. When the government announced the \"general holiday\" at the end of March, we fathomed the problem in the message, and we immediately reworded the holiday internally as the \"stay-home\" holiday.  We had to ensure that our people -- who would not be working at the branches -- must remain home and not go anywhere outside their geographical locations. The banks were not closed; they had to deliver the basic services on a limited scale. Now, we had to ensure that our people as well as the customers visiting the branches knew how to remain safe.  Communicating on how to remain safe at the same time as serving the customers was highly important. At the same time, we also needed to make the visiting customers aware about the dangers of being contaminated. Apart from visiting the branches, they were also going to the ATM booths.  So, they had to be alerted and communicated on how to remain safe when they came out of their homes with all kinds of precautionary measures. We sent emails and texts to them about the dos and don'ts. We also started encouraging them to use all digital platforms, so that they remain away from the branches and bank from home.  Since the end of March, I started compiling various types of suggestions on how to remain safe, what to do when infected, where to go when infected, etc, and communicated to our workforce almost every day. No one had told me to do that; I felt the need. Yes, people were noticing those communications and calling to thank me. I was inspired.  We also noticed the psychological impact on everyone; our stress level had gone up. Therefore, this was a good opportunity to communicate some general health and safety tips that can keep everyone healthy -- both mentally and physically -- during this difficult time.  The need for constant communications with the customers as well as the workforce has multiplied manifold. The need actually arose as we monitored their requirements during this pandemic.  These are new learnings for the communications professionals. The pandemic has taken, to a different level, thinking differently and applying extreme imagination while strategizing any communication plan.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-30 00:00:00      \nWith jute, the sky is the limit Why not jute? The government of Bangladesh had banned plastic packaging nearly 20 years ago, but nothing much has happened except that drains, canals, and rivers have become more and more choked with plastic.  Government departments have failed consistently to become more eco-friendly, more active in preventing pollution. I think back 40 years when, on behalf of Oxfam Trading and championing \"fair trade,\" I used to visit Bangladesh to search out utility handicrafts from producer groups.  From the beginning of Bangladesh, Oxfam had supported and bought from organizations such as \"CORR-The Jute Works.\" 40 years ago, the Dhaka Airport Duty Free Shop, very sensibly, would provide jute bags for bottles and other merchandise, but later with the advancement of technology and more stringent security, bottles had to be packed in \"see-through\" plastic bags! The authorities at every level have completely failed to enforce the ban on plastic bags or encourage jute packaging.  Oh yes, if you go to seminars run by the government or NGOs, you are likely to get a nice conference bag made of jute, but what about using jute/burlap bags for food grains?  Having qualified in farm management, I know that if grain is stored in bags which can \"breathe,\" the grain can be at 16% moisture content, whereas in plastic or bulk storage, it has to be 14% or lower to stay in good condition. There are a number of NGOs that make attractive clothing from jute which is exported around the world, and indeed this trade should be encouraged and supported as much as possible by the government authorities.  Indeed, I have a beautiful multi-coloured waistcoat, made of jute and cotton and with natural dye colours. When the ban on plastic was announced in 2002, many shops started using \"netting\" bags. But now everything is, again, put into plastic bags -- even things that do not need bags.   The shops should \"charge\" for plastic bags as they do in other countries, which might encourage the shoppers to carry their own shopping bags.  A survey last year estimated that over 400 million plastic bags are used in Dhaka each month and that a three metre thick layer of plastic bags is on the riverbed of the Buriganga River. These statistics are most frightening! To make \"Use Jute\" an effective campaign, you need vigorous inter-ministerial cooperation so that all ministries are on the same page. Like climate change, it is essential that all ministries are involved when it comes to the use of jute.  Jute is already being used to make shoe uppers, lampshades, suitcases, paperweights, helmets, and even shower and bath units. Panels, false ceilings, and partitions are already in the market.  Jute composites are, I understand, used for covers of electrical appliances, pipes, post-boxes, roof tiles, and grain storage silos.  The construction of low cost, pre-fabricated mobile units that can be used in times of natural calamities such as floods, cyclones, and earthquakes has a huge potential in the subcontinent itself.  In addition, jute has been used to make different types of furniture. It would seem that the sky's the limit. To see a resurgence in the importance of jute during \"Mujib Borsho\" would be especially pleasing, because in 1972, only the export of jute could bring in foreign exchange.  Let the growers, workers at the jute mills, designers, and craftswomen and men join with government officials to make this an historic year.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-28 00:00:00      \nNevertheless, Netrakona farmers are expecting a profitable boro paddy yield Fearing a delayed harvest of boro paddy, farmers in Khulna and Netrakona are in distress as the monsoon rains have begun pouring and they are yet to cut most of their crops. The boro paddy is late in ripening this season due to untimely rainfall and a prolonged winter last year, and farmers are worried about their harvest due to the new problem-- manpower shortage amid the Covid-19 nationwide shutdowns. In Khulna, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) office, only 18% of the paddy has been harvested. They are worried as the district has had 124 millimetres of rainfall in the last three days. The office said the crops which have not been harvested yet would face minimal damage while the harvested grain will face even more damage. Amirul Azad, in charge of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (Met office), Khulna unit, said the district has had heavy rains since Thursday and it's possible that the rains will persist for a few more days, waterlogging most of the crop fields. Farmers and DAE sources said, along with Dumuria and the swamp areas of Singair, Baniakhali, Khalshi, Bamondia, and Gonalir are already waterlogged due to the rains and the crops are half underwater which might damage quality. Jamal Gazi, a Dumuria farmer said he had already harvested his half acre of boro paddy, but due to the rains most of it might be damaged before he can safely store it. Although Dumuria Agriculture Officer Md Mossaddek Hossain said the rain will not affect the harvest of the area, farmers Abdul Aziz, Nurul Islam, and Shahjahan Fakir say their crops are on the way to be wasted soon. The official said 30% of the 21,205 acres of crop land in Dumuria has been harvested. Pangkaj Kanti Majumdar, deputy director of Khulna DAE said the total harvest amounts to 57,540 acres of lands in Khulna this season, of which 18% has been harvested.  \"The persistent rain will have no effect on the paddy as the sunlight is also right this year,\" added the official. Meanwhile, in Netrakona, farmers are busy harvesting boro paddy--which is expected to provide a high yield this season--in 134 haors of Madan-Mohanganj and Khaliajuri upazilas of the district. Though production is abundant this year, farmers are suffering from tremendous manpower shortage due to the Covid-19 outbreak and fear early floods soon due to the persistent rainfall. According to the Netrakona DAE office, they have provided 42 combine harvesters and 8 reaper machines to assist farmers who are not able to manage additional farmworkers like in past years. Habibur Rahman, deputy director of DAE said: \"The government is paying 50% of the total cost of these machines to assist the farmers. We provided 28 harvester machines to the swamp areas as production is high there. We hope the harvest will soon end and will fetch a good price this year.\" However, Shafikul Islam, Monir Hossain, Sukomol Sarker and other farmers said the allocated machines are not enough for the large areas of cropland and the authority should allocate more machines to make the harvest sooner. Contacted, Deputy Commissioner Moinul Islam, who regularly visits the farmers, said: \"If they ask for more we will provide extra farmworkers from other districts to assist them.\" \"All necessary help will be provided to the farmers,\" the official promised. He added that more than 1.84 lakh acres of land are shining with flowering boro paddy in Netrakona district."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-14 00:00:00      \nThe government has announced an allocation of Tk100 crore to procure machines for harvesting paddy and reduce dependency on labourers Boro paddy is ready to be harvested all across Bangladesh as Boisakh (Bengali month) approaches, but it is now under threat due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Farmers are worried about harvesting as there is a shortage of farm labourers due to a countrywide transport suspension in line with the general holidays declared by the government.  Apart from this, many parts of the country are under lockdown. People are instructed to stay at home and going outside after sunset is now considered a legal offence.  According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statics (BBS), farmers from around 25 districts are dependent on farm labourers from other places during harvest time.  Districts like Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi and Chittagong are facing an acute crisis of farm labourers. Moreover, districts in the haor area-- Kishoreganj, Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Sylhet, Brahmanbaria -- as well as Feni, Munshiganj and Patuakhali also need to hire labourers and are under moderate crisis. The farmers from the acute and moderate crisis areas mostly hire labourers from Jamalpur, Sherpur, Dinajpur, Thakurgaon, Kurigram, Jessore, Netrokona, Gaibandha, Meherpur, Naogaon, Natore, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, Jhenaidah, Chuadanga, Joypurhat, Rangpur and Nilphamari districts.  However, there is a restriction on their movements due to the coronavirus pandemic.  This creates a big challenge for the farmers, especially in haor area, as they will get only about three weeks to harvest the paddy for soon there will be flash floods in the beginning of May.   During a recent visit to the haor area, our correspondents found that farmers are almost prepared to harvest Boro crops and some have already started. \"Labourers from Mymensingh districts used to come to Sunamganj to harvest paddy but this year they are not here yet,\" said a farmer from Sunamganj haor area on Sunday.  Jamshed Ali, a farmer from Balaganj upazila of Sylhet, said: \"I am worried that I will not be able to harvest all my crops in due time as there is a shortage of workers because of the countrywide shutdown.\"    Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already ordered the district administration and police to help the agriculture labourers and send them to their respective destinations. However, in reality most labourers do not want to move to other district as they do not have identity cards to prove themselves as farm labourers. \"If we move to another part of the country, we might have to stay there even after the harvest period, as the pandemic may turn deadly in Bangladesh,\" said Abul Kalam, a farm labourer from Jamalpur. \"Moreover, bus owners will increase the fares as there is no assurance that they will get a return trip,\" he added. Government initiatives Meanwhile, the government has announced an allocation of Tk100 crore to procure machines for harvesting paddy so that a fewer number of labourers is required. The government has also planned to supply some harvesting machines to the farmers from their own stock.   However, such initiatives might not be sufficient as the government is mainly focusing on the haor area, whereas there are many other districts which produce Boro paddy.  According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the government has set  a target to produce 20.43 million tons of Boro paddy in the current fiscal year. Out of the total, 3.745 million tons paddy will be produced in seven of the districts under the haor area, which is almost 20% of the total target.    According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, a total of 180 combined harvesters and 137 ripper machines have been allocated for districts under the haor area.  Ministry of Agriculture Secretary Nasiruzzaman said: \"It is time to harvest Boro paddy. Seasonal labourers from different parts of the country, including North Bengal, will start moving to the haor regions.  \"So all concerned have been requested to ensure that all their travels and movements are smooth and in accordance to the health guidelines. \"We have already provided harvesting machines to farmers which may reduce dependency on labourers,\" he added."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-19 00:00:00      \nIndian analysts also questioned BJP's reported claim that 4 million illegal Bangladeshi immigrants were now in India The Indian media has come down heavily on the country's ruling right wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and union minister of state for home affairs, G Kishan Reddy, for his ridiculous comments on Bangladesh on February 9. Reddy had said that \"half of the citizens of Bangladesh will leave the country if India offers citizenship to them.\" The Indian analysts also questioned the BJP's reported claim that 4 million illegal Bangladeshi immigrants were now in India. The Indian Express and the Hindustan Times in recent weeks have carried comments by eminent Indian scholars suggesting that Indian leaders were wrong in their perception of Bangladesh and must rethink their attitudes to the country, especially with regard to the old mindset that people from this part of the old Bengal found India to be a goldmine for employment or any other benefits. 'Bangladesh is performing far better' Karan Thapar, a reputed journalist and television commentator, writes in the Hindustan Times, \"Frankly, I blame Henry Kissinger. Way back in the 1970s, he called Bangladesh 'an international basket case.'\" \"At the time, no doubt, it was. Television images of the frequent devastating floods it suffered confirmed this characterisation. So the description stuck. Today, Bangladesh is a different country.\" Thapar had a withering response to Reddy: \"Apart from the fact that he was undiplomatic and offensive, Reddy also revealed that he's ignorant of the true state of Bangladesh. Worse, he doesn't know that, in comparison to India, Bangladesh is performing far better on many, if not most, of the indices that determine quality of life.\" \"So when AK Abdul Momen, Bangladesh's foreign minister, says, 'Some Indian nationals are entering Bangladesh illegally for economic reasons,' he may well be right.\" People migrate to improve their lives, and life in Bangladesh seems decidedly better. If you're an Indian Muslim in danger of lynching because you trade in meat, accused of love-jihad because you've fallen in love with a Hindu, or in fear of losing your citizenship, you could easily be tempted to cross over to the other side.\" Thapar's statement certainly makes sense for a wide swath of people. 'Our neighbour largely outshines us' Another analyst, Swati Narayan, a research scholar at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, wrote in the Indian Express, \"Bangladesh's economic growth rate has surpassed India. In the last decade, on a range of social development indicators, from infant mortality to immunisation, Bangladesh has fared better.\"  She also mentioned the recent victory of the Bangladesh Under-19 cricket team against India in the youth World Cup, saying, \"Bangladesh beat India at the junior world cup. So why would Bangladeshis en masse want to leave their cherished homeland?\"  \"Since economic liberalisation, Indians have grown much richer than Bangladeshis, but in terms of quality of life our neighbour largely outshines us,\" she wrote.  Swati mentioned her recent doctoral thesis - How have India's poorer neighbours forged ahead in social development? - where she sought to decode the South Asian development puzzle.  In her opinion, \"Bangladesh's most prominent factor has been its ability to dissolve inequalities through sustained investment in public services and the bridging of social and gender distances.\" \"In comparison, India is grappling with the worst unemployment levels in 45 years and sinking economic growth rates.\"  Swati writes, \"Berating our neighbours with the false bogey of illegal immigrants, in light of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), is nothing but an unjustifiable Islamophobic distraction. Instead, it would be far wiser for the Indian government to humbly learn the recipe of South Asian success to improve the lives of citizens from the impressive \"Shonar Bangla\" - a term of endearment in reference to Bangladesh. Immigration from Bangladesh in recent years India's national debate on the NRC and CAA shows little sign of drawing to an end. At the core of this debate is the fast-held belief that millions of immigrants from Bangladesh have illegally entered West Bengal, Assam and Tripura, radically altering the demographics of these three states.  A layman's knowledge about \"millions of illegal immigrants\" is mostly based on anecdotal evidence and hearsay like \"it is known..,\" \"that vegetable vendor is from...\" and \"in the border areas...\"  Beliefs and opinions, especially when not substantiated by facts, are hard to change.  In West Bengal, if there has been a massive entry of Bangladeshis into the state in recent decades, it should have led to a skyrocketing of the state's population number and substantially set it apart from the rest of the country.  But, according to census data from 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011, the growth rate of West Bengal's population has distinctly been less than the national average since the 1990s. This is true not only for the whole population, but also for both the Hindu and Muslim communities as indicated by the past two or three census figures. This punctures the myth that West Bengal is bursting with a much larger-than-expected population because of Bangladeshi immigrants. Both the Indian scholars outline Bangladesh's achievements at a very appropriate time when the two neighbours have issues to settle over CAA and NRC, but in particular the random border killings which have only to an increase in anti-Indian sentiments in Bangladesh. To end, a quote from Thapar's piece says it all: \"Life in Bangladesh appears a lot more attractive than in India.\""

These two factors are also hindering their chances of a better livelihood, education, sanitation, and healthcare.  Abdul Bari, 35, who lived in Purar Char, a char on the Brahmaputra river in Jatrapur union of Kurigram Sadar upazila, had the misfortune of experiencing river erosion not once, not twice, but 10 times.  Mentioning that he only earns Tk6,000 - Tk7,000 per month to feed a family of three children, his wife and mother, Bari said: \"I was 11 when I witnessed our home being devoured by the river for the very first time. Now I am waiting for it to happen for the 11th time. Due to this I was forced to shift my house on multiple occasions. Providing for my family is a daily struggle for me. \"Though I am a farmer, I also teach at a local private community school and so my children are being able to continue their studies. But those who are illiterate and earn less than me are suffering even more. We [char dwellers] are in a never ending fight for survival.\" The fate of other char dwellers living across the country is more or less the same as 70% of them rely on agriculture alone for their livelihood. Experts say that char people require special arrangements to cope with the adverse effects of climate change and also urged the authorities concerned to form a designated foundation and a national policy for the development of this ill-fated segment of the population.  Commenting on the issue, Habibun Nahar, deputy minister of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said: \"The life of char dwellers is totally different from those who live on the mainland. We have visited these lands to know more about the people who live there, to learn about their survival strategies and also to understand the effects of climate change on their lives. Char dwellers have their own way of adapting to the changes. We are working towards the development of these people.\"    There are 109 char upazilas, both coastal and river chars, in 32 districts across Bangladesh.  According to the \"Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016,\" 26% of households in the coastal char lands earn less than Tk7,000 per month, and 24.1% in the river char areas, while that figure stands at 22.6% nationally. More than half of the children living in char areas of the country are deprived of primary education. Only 21.4% of people living in coastal char areas have access to electricity. Adding to the misery, merely 33.6% of the households have proper sanitation in the coastal chars, and 31.3% in the river chars.   Access to clean drinking water and healthcare are other major battles that char dwellers have to fight for every day. According to research conducted by Unnayan Shamannay, a non profit and non government research organization, a student living on the mainland, on average, has to go 0.92km to get to a primary school and 1.7km for a high school. Whereas, a child living in char areas has to travel 2.5km and 5.5km respectively to get the same educational opportunities. Jahid Islam, member secretary of National Char Alliance (NCA), an advocacy platform comprising over 50 organisations working for the rights of char dwellers, said: \"Due to the lack of a designated organization, government allocation of funds for the development of char people goes unused. A foundation is needed to properly utilize  money for the integrated progress of char dwellers. \"It is not possible to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) leaving char people behind. We need a national policy for the development of chars and people living there, immediately.\""

This has taken away arable lands and homesteads in the last two weeks, and is creating panic, especially among farmers. The people of several villages, including Bhalkutia, Kostapara, and Khanurbari, are fearful with their lands and homes under threat.  Floods have damaged their crops and cattle, leaving them in despair, said local sources. Jahurul Islam of Khanurbari in the upazila said: \"Many houses were submerged in flood waters for the last three 13 days. No action has yet been taken to save the people.\" Houses, schools, and madrasas have been devoured by the Jamuna River in the upazila of the district in a wild water level rise, causing severe river erosion in the past couple of days. The riverbank erosion has hit several areas hard at a time when Covid-19 is sweeping the country, said Jahurul. Rafiqul Islam of Kostapara village said erosion has already claimed his home and lands along the river. When the water level first began to rise, locals urged authorities to take steps to check the erosion, but nothing was done, he added. \"The Water Development Board did not take any effective steps to protect the localities from the dreadful erosion earlier,\" he alleged.  The WDB dumped some sacks at Khanurbari, but those bags were filled with earth and not sand.  Tomato, brinjal, chilli and mustard fields went into the river due to the erosion. The erosion has turned acute in the areas. Another farmer of the village said he cultivated brinjal, tomato and chilli, partly on his own and partly on leased land taking a loan.   Most of his cropland was devoured by the river in the last 10-12 days, he said.  \"The way the river is eating up our crops, the burden of the loan will mount on us,\" he added. Lokman Hossain, a local, said several hundred families lost what they had, including their homesteads, to the riverbank erosion earlier.  \"Many were trying to eke out an existence growing crops on their arable land. But the untimely riverbank erosion has devastated their lives, \" he said. Locals urged the administration to take immediate measures. Contacted, Serajul Islam, executive engineer of the Water Development Board (WDB), said steps have been taken to protect the eastern side of the mouth of the river from the erosion."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-08 00:00:00      \nBangladesh has taken the lead by dismantling some 234 ships in 2019 Bangladesh has again retained top spot in the global ship-breaking industry. The NGO Shipbreaking Platform, a Belgium based advocacy organization, has published data on ships dismantled worldwide in 2019. Bangladesh has taken the lead by dismantling some 234 ships in 2019, according to the list published on February 4. According to the platform which ensures the safe and environmentally sound dismantling of end-of-life ships worldwide, 674 ocean going commercial ships and offshore units were sold to scrap yards in 2019. Of these vessels, 469 large tankers, bulkers, floating platforms, cargo, and passenger ships, were broken down on only three beaches in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, amounting to nearly 90% of the gross tonnage dismantled globally. According to 'Review of Maritime Transport 2019' published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Bangladesh secured the top position in ship breaking by dismantling 47.2% vessels of the world in 2018. According to the report, India dismantled 25.6% of ocean going vessels, Pakistan 21.5%, Turkey 2.3%, and China 2% in 2018. In 2017, the top four ship breaking countries were India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and China. No respite from workplace casualty The platform documented accidents that killed 24 workers in Chittagong, making 2019 the worst year for Bangladeshi yards in terms of fatalities since 2010. At least another 34 workers were badly injured. Differing with the platform's casualty statistics, Palash Kumar Das, Inspector,  Department of Inspection for Factories & Establishment (DIFE), told Dhaka Tribune that 19 ship breakers died on the job. Speaking to Dhaka Tribune, Tapan Dutta, convener of the Ship Breaking Workers' Trade Union Forum, said Bangladesh has become the top dumping ground for discarded ships in the world with the country dismantling the highest number of vessels due to cheap labor and lax regulations.  \"The dismantling will further increase in Bangladesh in the coming days as China and India have put a limit on the number of imports of scrap vessels on the back of environmental concerns,\" Tapan said. \"Ship demolition is a highly risky affair, yet ship breaking yard owners hardly follow occupational safety standards and wage board regulations. The ship breakers are denied their rights to form trade unions. Insolvent ship breakers retain this sort of hazardous job as they have no other options, and yard owners take advantage of the situation,\" said the labour rights activist.   Muhammad Ali Shahin, senior program coordinator of Young Power in Social Action (YPSA), an organization for sustainable development, told Dhaka Tribune that the ships brought in for scrapping should be properly cleaned before beaching. \"Ship breaking yards must ensure that scrapping does not cause any pollution and health hazards through releasing hazardous wastes. The ship breakers should also ensure occupational safety to avert workplace accidents. We are waiting for the day when Bangladesh will gain international recognition for complying with all regulations,\" said Shahin, who has been working on the ship breaking sector for 18 years. There are an estimated 3,000 permanent and 5,000 to 7,000 temporary workers in the ship breaking yards  on the 25km strip of Sitakunda upazila in the district.  Coastal degradation According to the platform, thousands of protected mangrove trees have been cut to make way for  ships discarded for scrapping in Bangladesh. 14,000 mangrove plants were felled in 2009 in Sitakunda to make space for ship breaking yards. According to an estimate by Chittagong based  YPSA, over the past few years, at least 60,000 mangrove trees have been cut along the coast near the port city of Chittagong to make way for more ships. The felling of mangroves has negative consequences as they are essential for the ecosystem and are the last barrier against the devastating effects of typhoons and floods. Long-term health impacts As per the platform, the risk of developing a fatal occupational health hazard is high as workers lack proper respiratory equipment to protect themselves against toxic fumes and contaminated materials released during the cutting and cleaning operations. In most cases, harmful substances are not even identified and therefore they put workers' health in harm's way. Some cancers, including asbestos related mesothelioma, will only develop 15 to 20 years after exposure, and cause many more casualties among former ship breaking workers. In addition to taking a huge toll on the health and lives of workers, ship breaking is a highly polluting industry.  In South Asia, ships are grounded before they are pulled and broken apart on tidal mudflats. On these once pristine beaches, coastal ecosystems and local communities depending on them, are devastated by toxic spills and other types of pollution caused by the breaking operations.  As long as ship breaking is carried out by beaching, the environment will suffer."

Since farmers lost their crops to the floods in 2017, Boro fields in Sylhet have yielded good harvests the past two years. Farmers are also expecting a good harvest this year with ripe crops in abundance on wetlands in haor areas throughout the division.  However, farmers are still fearful they may fail to bring home all their hard earned golden harvest due to a labour shortage in this lockdown across different parts of the country and a transport halt, following the coronavirus outbreak. According to the local agriculture department, this year's harvest season will begin from April 15 in all the haor areas of Sylhet.  This year Boro has been cultivated on 474,195 hectares across the division, with the highest cultivation in Sunamganj on 219,300 hectares. The department has set a production target of 1,860,000 tons of rice from Sylhet this year and they believe the target is achievable.   Kausar Chowdhury, from Dirai upazila of Sunamganj, said: \"We are anxious to harvest our crops this year! Especially because we are expecting a good yield. But all the farmers are stuck at home. I don't know how we'll manage to harvest all our crops.\" Jamshed Ali, of Balaganj upazila of Sylhet, said: \"I am expecting a good yield this year due to government incentives and support from the agriculture department. \"But, I am worried if I'll be able to harvest all my crops in time with the shortage of workers in this countrywide shutdown.\"  Sylhet Agricultural Extension Department Additional Director Sree Nibash Debnath said: \"I have visited the largest haors in the division and have found the Boro paddy to be of good quality and free of disease or rot. \"Farmers need not worry about their harvest this year. A combined harvest machine has already been allocated to Bishambharpur upazila in Sunamganj. Also, there are enough workers to help with the harvest. workers from outside the district will also aid in the harvest following local administration guidelines.\" "

As a result, the agriculture scenario in Nilphamari has undergone massive changes thanks to those incentives and subsidies. Sources at the district agriculture department office say incentives are being m given to the farmers to encourage more farming.  Additionally, the government is also undertaking agriculture rehabilitation programs to support those affected by floods and other natural calamities. On the other hand, crores of taka is being disbursed in subsidies for fertilizers and agricultural machinery to the farmers. Agriculture department statistics state 17,800 farmers from the district have been brought under the agriculture incentive program from Nilphamari in the ongoing 2019-2020 fiscal year. Under the program, the farmers received wheat, maize, onion, mustard and moog lentil. Those who received 20 kilogram of wheat for one bigha of land also received 20kg of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and 10kg Muriate of Potash (potassium chloride) fertilizers. Md Moksen Ali, 50, a farmer from Sarkarpara village of Sadar upazila said, to recuperate for his losses faced in previous floods and other disasters, he has begun harvesting maize in advance.  A paddy farmer previously, he resorted to maize cultivation as it required very little capital, and he received free seedlings and fertilizers as he was part of the incentive program. Md Rezaul Islam, a maize trader at Ramnagar union, said depending on the maize quality, a kg of the crop fetched Tk700-920 currently. Sirajul Islam, another maize farmer from the same union, cultivated the crop on two bighas of land. But as part of the incentive program, he received seeds and fertilizers for one bigha of land completely free. \"This saved me a lot of money, which I used to cultivate wheat on an additional bigha of land nearby,\" he added. Md Kamrul Hasan, agriculture officer at Nilphamari Sadar upazila, said that apart from subsidies, government surveillance and agricultural research have made it possible to achieve success in agriculture.  \"Especially since farmers are able to buy fertilizers and agricultural machinery in small quantities at hand, they have turned around,\" he added.  Sirajul Islam, deputy director at Nilphamara Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) office, said the government's incentive program has attracted a lot of farmers' interest, which helped 17,800 to be part of the program. This program will help many farmers to become self-sufficient, he added."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-31 00:00:00      \nLet's not underestimate our own ability to find the best way forward in this crisis Dhaka's streets are eerily empty. When ten million rickshaw drivers, day labourers, factory workers, maids and others raced to get home before the government \"holiday,\" the city became unnaturally quiet. Dhaka is usually full of the sounds of interaction, energy, and a growing economy. The sounds of people earning, people who were able to get by financially. Where are they now? What will they eat? How long can a rickshaw-puller like Shumi in Rajshahi, whose family of five subsists on what she can bring home at the end of the day, after she's paid a Tk350 guarantee to the rickshaw owner? According to WB data, only 15% of Bangladesh's population makes more than Tk500 a day. They can meet their daily expenses, send their children to school, and hope that they reserve enough for an emergency health crisis. Most villagers depend on remittances from the cities or abroad. Because this is a global crisis, people everywhere are out of work. Income has stopped. How long can they last? The US government is now encouraging physical distancing until the end of April. Approximately 75% of workers have access to paid sick leave, and close to 90% have health insurance.   Almost a third of people could work effectively from home. And yet we still see that, despite all of these forms of social support and benefits, many people are struggling financially with the consequences of the Covid-19 policies. In Bangladesh, where over 90% of workers are in the informal sector, health insurance is a luxury, and most homes don't have any sort of internet connectivity, how much more devastating would these policies be here? How many workers making Tk500 a day can work from home? For Bangladesh, let's admit that Covid-19 is a humanitarian crisis with a public health dimension. If large-scale physical distancing is required, we must find ways to mitigate the economic shock that will bring the majority of the country into food insecurity within weeks. Urban poor who live off daily wages will have to skip meals.  Let's find ways to keep people safe that also protect their livelihoods. If they absolutely must stay home, we will need to provide food or emergency cash transfers. Assuming that mobile money providers are able to keep their agents active during this time, we have a financial system that goes deep into the villages and could deliver money to almost every household. While there are important lessons to be learned from China, South Korea, Italy, and other countries who are deeper into their Covid-19 response than we are, we should also question how much of their policies could be imported here. China's health expenditure per capita is 10 times the average in Bangladesh; and Italy's is eight times as large as China's. It doesn't stop there. People staying at home connect to the world through their smartphones -- buying groceries, sending money to loved ones, video chatting with friends to stay mentally positive. The data from smartphones, location information in particular, have proven invaluable in contact tracing.   In South Korea, a website tracking the locations of newly identified cases enabled people to see if they had been exposed when they went to the mall or movies, and seek testing. Today, in China, people get a red, green or yellow message on their phone that lets them know whether they should prepare to leave their home and go to work, based on the latest Covid surveillance data. Contrast this with Bangladesh, where many people struggle to understand an SMS and a recent phone-based Covid survey led to widespread confusion. We can seek inspiration from the models abroad, but we should also recognize that many mitigation strategies may be out of our reach. We should also have a sobering realization that our public health care system is already overburdened and that curve, as is, is very skewed and not flattened.  There are 127,000 hospital beds in the entire country. 91,000 of them in public hospitals for a population of 170 million. It gets worse. The entire public system has 432 ICU beds with only 110 outside the capital Dhaka and if you add the numbers from the private sector, you have another 737.   This is for a population of 170 million. Italy has 4.1 doctors on average per 1,000 people and Bangladesh has 0.5 and that too based on official numbers and a significant chunk of these doctors are either abroad or not practicing. At Dhaka's medical college and hospital, the largest government medical facility in the country, over 500 patients seek critical care monthly, and over 400 are turned away due to lack of capacity. We need to think hard about an appropriate public response in a place as dense as Bangladesh, where most families' ability to eat depends on daily wages and 87% employment is generated from the informal sector?   The average household in Bangladesh has over five members, and usually includes three generations. Families share one latrine and more than 80% of the slum households share a water source with five or more households.   There is no way to separate the old and the young, the productive adults from those whose age makes them more vulnerable to serious illness and death. To practice the social distancing norms that most Western countries have relied on to reduce transmission is proving to be culturally completely impossible. How do you stock up on 30-day supplies when you can only buy a few days' worth of food? What will you do after that food runs out if your income has been cut off? While I am worried, I also have endless faith in Bangladesh's ability to rise in a moment of crisis. Even when outsiders see us as a basket case, we see an innovative path forward. When global health experts said that Bengali mothers couldn't make oral rehydration solution at home and we'd have to import packets of premade solution, which were heavy and difficult to transport to rural villages given the communications infrastructure in the 1980s, we taught families about lobon-gur and child mortality plunged.   When people in villages were dying of tuberculosis because the hospitals were too far away, we found ways to bring testing and treatment to the community level.   Covid-19 is new and different in important ways, but we are home to premiere public health experts and institutions. We have one of the world's best networks of community health workers, rich history of public-private partnerships in emergencies, and communities with incredible levels of resilience. We have weathered cyclones, floods, and so much more. Let's not underestimate our own ability to find the best way forward in this crisis, to find the best in ourselves and make sure that we help each other survive this crisis.  Asif Saleh is Executive Director, BRAC."

The Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP) has taken an initiative to send up to 1,500 labourers to the haor areas, prone to flash floods during this time of the year. Some 100 labourers have already left on fives buses on Sunday, said CMP Deputy Commissioner SM Mehedi Hasan before adding that social distancing measures were ensured.   According to him a large number of people, hailing from the haor areas, live in the port city for a living. \"We have listed 1500 people, who are willing to go back for harvesting paddy. They will travel in phases by buses provided by transport operators,\" said the senior police official.  Each of the 40-seat buses has been disinfected while in a bid to ensure social distancing, they will carry 20 people at a time, according Deputy Police Commissioner Hasan  \"The labourers will report to Oshtogram police station in Kishoreganj. They will stay at a primary school and nobody will be allowed to go home after harvesting paddy,\" he added. Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, Inspector Nejam Uddin, the officer-in-charge of Chittagon's Bakalia police station said that most of the labourers travel to their home districts in this time of year usually.  \"This year, they were stuck due to the coronavirus lockdown. The move came in line with instructions of the prime minister,\" he said."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-22 00:00:00      \nThe agricultural sector is developing, but at what cost? Now that the country is in the process of celebrating \"Mujib Borsho,\" I am fortunate to be able to look back so many years. It is a privilege to have been able to follow Bangladesh since its birth in 1971.  I had actually heard how the Pakistani authorities had tried to starve Bengalis to death after the cyclone of November 1970, and in 1971, in the refugee camps in India, I assisted the struggle for the refugees to survive in appalling conditions where malnutrition and death were widespread.  I saw in early 1972 to what extent the infrastructure and the economy of the country had been shattered. Later on, in 1974, during the famine conditions of Rowmari, Kurigram, I heard how, on one occasion, 6,000 local people waited all day for the 400 chapattis being made every day at a particular gruel kitchen. There have been so many changes -- many positive -- since those very difficult days in the early 1970s. Ten years ago, my work often took me to Rowmari, and though still a relatively poor area, I know that all communities ensure that nobody ever starves to death.  Especially during the lean months of September to November, many people may not eat three times a day, but relatives and neighbours ensure that all eat at least once.  Bangladesh may now have more than double the 1971 population of 70-75 million, but it is now in a position of being self-sufficient in staple food to feed about 170 million people.  The big challenge that still remains is that many do not have the purchasing power to obtain that food. I am often asked what has changed the most. Obviously food production, but also the huge contribution that the RMG industry has been making to the country's economy.  Communications too -- especially roads and telecommunications -- have dramatically changed how the country works. Mobile phones have revolutionized how people lead their lives, even in remote areas.  While road communications to and from Dhaka have transformed the way business is run, it is unfortunate that the mass transit facilities for Dhaka have, until recently, been completely neglected by successive governments and the great city seems to be grinding to a halt.  This, in turn, is likely to have a great negative effect on businesses and livelihoods all over the country. It is expected that the mass transit schemes currently being built will dramatically transform the situation in the near future. However, probably one of the biggest changes I have seen is the position, presence and visibility of women. What struck me when I came to Dhaka in January 1972 was the absence of women in the streets and in most offices I then visited. Though there may still be a long way to go, particularly in the rural areas, this positive change is a significant one. Change, however, often comes at a great cost. The largely mono-culture agriculture, with hybrid seeds and agro-chemicals, has and is slowly taking a toll on the land in some parts of the country.  Soil fertility is being adversely affected and, as the older generation points out, the diet of most people is less \"balanced\" than 40 or 50 years ago. Many local varieties of indigenous rice have been lost, varieties that had over hundreds of years adapted to local soil types and climate.  Some years ago, I went to an area in Tangail that I first visited nearly 25 years before, when I had visited the villages and studied the agriculture and peoples' livelihoods. Talking to the local people, especially farmers, 25 years later, was both interesting and depressing.  They said that as there were no more \"birds of prey,\" such as kites, hovering up in the sky, it was clear that the \"food chain\" had broken and that we were heading for some sort of catastrophe. In the old days, they said, the fishes and frogs in the paddy fields would eat the insects and the kites would eat them, mice and rats. There are no fishes in the paddy fields now and there are far, far fewer frogs.  This is all to do, they said, with poisoning the land with fertilizer and insecticide. These farmers may be illiterate, but they are highly knowledgeable experts whose voices fall on deaf ears.  The same illiterate farmers were telling us about \"global warming,\" now called \"climate change.\" 25 years ago, they were saying that the level of the Jamuna River was beginning to rise a few days earlier each year as a result of the earlier melt of the Himalayan snows. Getting better over time Compared to the early 1970s, Bangladesh is much better organized to react to natural disasters. I have been involved in relief and rehabilitation activities related to the floods of 1987, 1988, 1998, and 2007, as well as the cyclones of 1970 and 1991.  Therefore, I have seen how reactions to disasters by government and NGOs have improved considerably. There is still much, much more to do, however, as the effects of \"climate change\" are affecting the seasons, the patterns of rainfall, and therefore food production.  What about other changes? There have been significant and visible improvements in health and education centres run by the government and some of the many NGOs that have sprung up since independence.  However, not nearly enough has been accomplished by successive governments and everything has progressed far too slowly. Communities in remote areas such as the island chars, where I used to work, are ill-served and are lacking in most of the basic services.  Even the big NGOs do not find it cost effective to work in these remote areas and government extension services do not have budgets to move across the difficult terrain. In the 1980s, those of us involved in rural development were very much encouraged with the recommendations of the Land Reform Commission:  That all khas land (government land to which no one has title) should be distributed amongst the landless as quickly as possible, That sharecroppers should have legal protection and a just share of the crop grown on the land they till That the government should fix a daily minimum wage for agricultural labourers Another proposal to fix a ceiling of ten acres per family, would have involved land redistribution, but it failed to pass a later committee stage.  In 1984, two laws were enacted. One set the minimum agricultural wage rate at 3.5 kilos of rice or cash equivalent and the other was that all government land should be released to the landless.  However, after the passing of more than 25 years, it is clear that successive governments do not have the courage or political will to pass further laws to enable that these proposed benefits can reach the very poorest, particularly the extreme poor.  Khas lands mostly remain unregistered and are controlled by mastaans and lathiyals supported mostly by strong local political backing. If governments are really serious about assisting the extreme poor to move above the poverty line, they have to become serious and distribute khas land to the landless on an urgent basis.  The people of Bangladesh have the strength to succeed, but they need the support of a strong and courageous government. A strong and courageous government is also required to reduce the amount of leakage or corruption which affects all development processes.  I remember learning that even during the Rowmari famine of 1974-75, the chairman of a local co-operative association was systematically smuggling priceless food supplies over the border to India.  Sadly, now, a certain amount of leakage is the norm, not the exception. I am told that a PWD Contractor, for instance, normally pays out, for bribes, at least 30% of each contract's value. Therefore, most contractors inflate their tender quotations by at least 30%.  To overcome this, we need a \"sea-change\" in the way work is done. If nothing changes, the culture of corruption will continue.  In recent months, the government ministers led by the prime minister have been clear that corruption will not be tolerated. It is most important to punish those who are corrupt -- no matter who they are.  In this \"Mujib Borsho\" year, it is important to be reminded what Bangabandhu said in his homecoming speech of January 10, 1972. He said: \"I want to say, not a single employee should take bribes. Remember, it was not an opportune moment then (1971), but now, I will not forgive those who take bribes.\"  Another major form of corruption is carried out by rich people avoiding the payment of income tax. Those who avoid paying income tax, including foreigners, are breaking the law and should be strongly and urgently prosecuted. Having a brother and a son, both with severe learning disabilities, I have always been very close to people with disabilities and disability issues. Since 1971, but more so in the last few years, the government and donors are giving this sector much more attention -- never enough, of course -- and many dedicated NGOs are breaking new ground.  This is encouraging and long may it continue. People with disabilities are showing that they can be assets for the country if they are provided with a few opportunities, but there is still so much more to do! What about my dreams for the future of Bangladesh? Having lived through the tumultuous movement to bring back democracy in 1990, like many others, I am bitterly disappointed that the Jatiyo Sangsad has never been able to function properly.  An opposition giving robust constructive criticism is a \"must\" for a fulsome democracy. Successive oppositions of both major political parties have boycotted parliament on account of issues that should have been easily settled.  By not contributing to the work of parliament, the MPs can be accused of cheating the people who elected them.  This state of affairs saddens many citizens very much and I do not know who has the key to unlock this very serious problem, but this problem must be overcome for the sake of the country.  In recent years, the economy has been growing at a very good pace, but only if confrontational politics is overcome, Golden Bangladesh will have a truly golden future. These are a few thoughts as I look back over the years I have known Bangladesh, as well as daring to dream of a more peaceful and prosperous future.  In conclusion, I know how fortunate I have been to live amongst such warm, committed, and passionate people who certainly have the will and strength to succeed, and I am sure that they will.

      "headline": "Can Bangladesh follow the Kerala model?",
      "authors": "Anando Mostofa",
      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-12 00:00:00      \nKerala's approach has proven less disruptive, less costly, and more effective than any other state in India  The South Indian state of Kerala has been spearheading the country's fight against the novel coronavirus. From innovative schemes like mid-day meals being delivered at homes to South Korea-like isolation testing kiosks, the state has been at the forefront in India's battle to control the Covid-19 spread. Kerala was the first state to record a positive Covid-19 case in India. In January, a medical student returning from China's Wuhan tested positive for the virus. Kerala has been on alert mode since, trying to bring the situation under control. The state soon began implementing mandatory quarantines for visitors arriving from China, weeks before India's central government instituted similar measures across the country. In early March, a BBC News talk show referred to the success of Kerala in containing the first three positive cases of coronavirus and its previous record in dealing with the Nipah and Zika viruses. Kerala currently has 364 cases of coronavirus, making it the eighth most stricken among Indian states. Crucially, however, it has recorded the highest number of recoveries, with 123 people getting better as of Saturday. This impressive track record has also earned world attention. On Friday, The Washington Post credited the robust response of Kerala to the coronavirus pandemic. The Washington Post noted Kerala resorted to \"aggressive testing, intense contact tracing, instituting a longer quarantine, building thousands of shelters for migrant workers stranded by the sudden nationwide shutdown and distributing millions of cooked meals to those in need.\" Could Kerala provide a workable model for the Bangladesh government to follow? Need to speed up testing During the period of the lockdown, anywhere in the world, there is large scale testing. The Washington Post noted Kerala had conducted over 13,000 tests for coronavirus by the first week of April, more than larger states such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Kerala was also taking a lead in doing rapid tests and walk-in tests. According to pandemic data site worldometer, in South Asia, Bhutan has tested 1,511 people per million, followed by Pakistan (192 per million), Sri Lanka (211 per million), Nepal (152 per million) and India (137 per million), as of Sunday. Bangladesh tests only 50 people per million. It is clear that the first thing Bangladesh needs to do is to ramp up its rate of testing. Physical distancing, social solidarity Through appropriate and effective early actions, Kerala has successfully slowed the spread of infection in the state, largely by promoting physical distancing and mainly sanitary precautionary measures, and providing better protection for health staff well before the hugely disruptive and draconian lockdown imposed in India in late March.  The state government invited religious leaders, local bodies, and civil society organizations to participate in policy design and implementation, considering its specific socio-economic conditions, including urban slum environments. It has communicated effectively in different languages to educate all, including migrants, and to prevent stigmatization of those infected, even opposing the term \"social distancing,\" which has caste connotations, with \"physical distancing and social solidarity.\" Returning migrants Despite Kerala's long-standing achievements in education, health and science, highly educated Keralans tend to migrate to work out of state, if not abroad, seeking more lucrative employment. The state was still recovering from the devastating floods and Nipah virus epidemic of 2018 when tens of thousands began returning after losing jobs in the Middle East. Kerala is also the destination for a large number of Indian internal migrants. With the nationwide lockdown, non-residents, equivalent to almost 5% of Kerala's population, have returned, causing a surge of new infections, which is very much similar to Bangladesh. Such unusually high movements of people have made the state more vulnerable. Despite some controversy, the state appears to have handled the migrant issue very well. The state health department promptly went into action, setting up a coordination centre on January 26. Recognizing there was no time to lose, the Kerala government set up mechanisms to identify, test, isolate and treat those infected, quickly earning an excellent reputation. Less disruptive, less costly, more effective The Kerala government involved a range of relevant state ministries and agencies to design measures to improve consistency, coordination and communication, and to avoid confusion. At the same time, there were community consultations, including experts, to find the most locally appropriate modes of limiting infections, along with the means to monitor and enforce them. Communities were provided essential epidemiological information to understand the threat and related issues, ensure compliance with prescribed precautionary measures, and avoid panic. Credible leadership The Kerala government has set up 18 committees and holds daily evening meetings to evaluate the situation, issuing media updates about those quarantined, tested, and hospitalized. Kerala's approach has proven less disruptive, less costly, and more effective than any other state in India and even other countries in the world. After recording its first Covid-19 case on January 30, its infection and death rates have been kept relatively low despite much more tracing and testing. Surely, there is a lesson there for the Bangladesh health authorities, if they care to take heed.  "

In the last two weeks they have made catches in the thousands made possible by large numbers of ilish spawning in the estuaries of the Meghna and Tetulia rivers during the second breeding period (January-March), say experts.   This comes as a pleasant surprise to fishermen and wholesale businessmen alike, as sales are booming at wholesale fish markets after a somewhat disappointing season. Aside from the usual fish markets, ilish is now being sold at every street corner of the district. In a visit to the docks, this correspondent found prices to be more affordable with an abundant supply. Wholesale buyers from all across the country including Dhaka, Barisal, and Chandpur were there, buying and packing fish in styrofoam and ice. A local fisherman at the docks said, in the last 10-15 days a huge number of ilish were caught from the Bay of Bengal and the Meghna and Tetulia rivers. Ashraf Ali, president of the largest fish wholesaler association told Dhaka Tribune that both fishermen and businessmen did not profit much during the initial ilish fishing season. But the big catches this winter season have made up for that.   \"The price is also cheap, with ilish weighing 700-900 grams being sold at Tk25,000 per maund. Fish over 1kg are sold at Tk30,000 per maund, while ilish between 450-700 grams is sold at Tk12-20,000 per maund,\" he added. District Fisheries Officer Azaharul Islam said: \"It is a sight to behold, seeing ilish being netted in such quantities. In an effort to build a safe haven for ilish here in Bhola, we are working hard to eradicate illegal fishing.\" Last fiscal year, the ilish market target in the district was 1.3 lakh tons and actual demand was 1.61 lakh tons. This year, the target was set at 1.6 lakh tons, but by December sales exceeded 1 lakh ton, he added. Md Imtiaz Zaman, regional assistant researcher at Eco Fish, an international organization working with ilish, said: \"There was an increase in ilish spawning during the second breeding period and fishermen were able to net a good amount of fish.\" The 22 day ban on ilish fishing has worked successfully and has aided in bigger catches as well, he added."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-09 00:00:00      \nKalai Ruti is traditionally made in a special earthen pan  The land of Behula, Chapainawabganj, a district of Rajshahi, was once upon a time a vacation destination for the nawabs of Murshidabad and Daudpur Mouja before the British came to India. It is unique from other districts in its ethnicity, dialect, and its organic cuisine.  The streams of the mighty Ganges regularly flood the shores of this riverine land, giving a distinctive character to the land and its people. The fertile land with the hottest of summers and the coldest of winters gave birth to the mouth watering \"Kalai Ruti,\" a thick flat bread made of lentil flour, which is good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner on a busy day. Cooking calling for skill and excellence Kalai Ruti is traditionally made in a special earthen pan and the entire process, from kneading to rolling, needs the skillful hands of a chef to ensure its full potential.  The flat bread is at its best when served with savoury Bhhartas (Mashed Vegetable Preparations) like mashed aubergine, and Chutneys (Mashed Spice Preparations) made from chilli and onions. But always, the ingredient that makes the dish more appetizing is the homemade mustard oil drizzle The most distinctive feature of the bread is that it will keep for 3 or 4 days. It will not dry out, and it won't spoil. Gaining Popularity  It is a century old traditional staple delicacy of Chapainawabganj gaining popularity. Even the United States (US) Ambassador to Bangladesh, Earl Robert Miller, visited Rajshahi and was delighted by the tasty treat. Restaurants around Zero point, Shahebbazar, Uposhohor, Binodpur, Railgate, Ranibazar, Mianpara, and Lakhshmipur have added Kalairuti to their menus, and people of all ages try the dish with chutneys, bhhartas, and spicy meat dishes of duck, beef, or chicken. Shafiul Islam, a medical student of Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, who came to Rajshahi just to taste the dish, said the moist and juicy texture of the bread and the spicy bhhartas makes him come back to the restaurant every time he is in town. Boosting the Economy People of this largely agricultural region are mostly dependent on seasonal crops, but the regular river erosion, floods, joblessness and inflation, leave the poor  ever poorer. But with the recent popularity of Kalairuti, people in Chapainawabganj who once sold the bread as street food, are now employed in famous restaurants. Now the economy of both Chapainawabganj and Rajshahi are getting a much needed boost from this local delicacy."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-07 00:00:00      \nThe bridge was declared risky in 2015 and was closed for vehicular transport use The only bridge connecting Dhaka to Shariatpur's Naria and Bhedarganj upazila has remained inaccessible to vehicles for three years now. The inconvenience in communication has been affecting the everyday life of a few hundred thousand people, as they are forced to take a 15km detour for the lack of a better route. According to Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) sources, the Language Movement martyr Golam Mowla Bridge, was built during 1997-98 to connect Dhaka to Shariatpur's Naria and Bhedarganj upazila. The bridge was declared risky in 2015 and was closed for vehicular transport use. According to LGED's district office, LGED initiated a plan to build a brand new bridge alongside the old one, and at the end of 2017 the contract went to one Navana Constructions with a budget allocation of Tk14.87 crore. The timeframe of the contract ended in 2019 and was renewed further to allow the construction work to continue.  A local businessman Nazrul Islam from Naria bazar said: \"My business took a tumble ever since the bridge was shut down, and I couldn't conveniently transport goods. Besides, I am losing out on customers on the east side of the bridge. If things continue like this my business won't survive for long.\"  Md Haris, a Naria upazila resident, said: \"Vehicles--carrying bricks from the other side of the river to my house for construction--need to take a 15km detour, increasing my costs.\"  Another local Barkat Hossain Murad said: \"It has been three years and the contractor has just two pillars to show for it. It will take decades to complete the bridge with only just three to four workers.\" Engineer Abul Hashem of Navana Constructions claimed the construction works kept being interrupted due to many drawbacks. \"Since we began the work we have been facing problems like land disputes and floods. Also, the new bridge cannot be constructed according to the plans without knocking down the old one. However, the work has picked up pace now. We can hope the bridge will be completed within the allotted time.\" Shariatpur LGED Executive Engineer Shahjahan Farazi acknowledged that the delay in construction increases the suffering of the people of the two upazilas. \"We are taking every possible measure to finish the construction at the earliest possible time.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-10 00:00:00      \n450,000 people deprived of treatment Islampur Upazila Health Complex in Jamalpur is currently unable to provide proper healthcare to local residents due to a lack of doctors and equipment. Islampur upazila has a population of 450,000, who are largely poverty stricken and face river erosion and floods regularly, said sources.  According to local residents, 33 doctors, including consultants and junior consultants, are needed to run the health complex and its three sub-centers. However, only 22 such personnel happen to be there at present. There is also a shortage of nurses, wardboys and helping hands. The hospital also lacks modern equipment, which means patients are being deprived of pathological services. On the other hand, there is a fully functional operation theatre with equipment worth crores of taka in the hospital, where complex operations and caesarian operations used to be conducted. Sadly, this operation theatre has been rendered ineffective by a lack of an anesthesiologist and a surgeon.  Masud Mia from Bahadurpur village, who admitted his nine-month old pneumonia-affected son at the hospital and Golap Uddin of Chinaduli village who admitted his eight-year old daughter suffering from cold and cough, confirmed that there was no child specialist in the hospital.  They along with other patients complained about not getting proper treatment in the hospital. Responding to queries, Dr AM Taher, upazila health and family planning officer, said he had only recently joined. He acknowledged the absence of doctors as well as junior consultants for surgeries, anesthesia, gynecology, medicine, pediatrics, cardiology and dental surgery.  A hospital officer, wishing to remain anonymous, said that diagnostic centers had cropped up in abundance near the hospital. Locals complain that the diagnostic centers are driving away new doctors in a bid to earn money in the name of providing good treatment. Dr Gautam Roy, Jamalpur civil surgeon, said: \"There is a shortage of consultants and junior consultants in the whole district. The higher authorities have been informed and hopefully the problem will be solved soon.  \"The local administration has also been informed about the illegal diagnostic centers,\" he added."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-21 00:00:00      \nAgriculture is the bedrock of our economy -- can we protect the sector from Covid-19 and other disasters? If blood is the price of freedom, then the people of this country have gained this freedom by shedding it through the great Liberation War of 1971. The long 23 years of torture and oppression have come to an end.  The economic solvency and democracy of this country has been achieved and the brave children of the time ie the freedom fighters, played a leading role in accomplishing this impossible task. Then Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the architect of independent Bangladesh and the father of the nation, realized that agriculture was the main driving force of a country's economy. That is why he attached the utmost importance to agriculture in order to rebuild a war-torn newly independent country. At a time when the world is in turmoil due to the aggression of Covid-19 and my beloved motherland is not out of it, I am feeling the urge to express my expressions in writing at this juncture of the country.  According to experts, the world has never faced such a crisis since Second World War. Even Bangladesh's economy is under the most pressure in the last ten years. The number of corona attacks is increasing day by day and this number is not comfortable. Our present Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already given the right steps and timely instructions to address this crisis.  At the same time, he advised all to work with courage to get out of this calamity, which will undoubtedly play a vital role in creating our metal resilience, enthusiasm, and working enforcement in this crisis. Worldwide public life has almost come to a standstill due to the turbulent aggression of Covid-19, many people have become unemployed which is a matter of great concern.  This is likely to lead to severe food shortages worldwide. Bangladesh is no exception. And if there is a food crisis, it is not possible to bring food from outside to feed this huge population, and the global situation seems to be that food will not be available. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of the present agri-friendly government, the minister of agriculture, the secretary, and eminent personalities of the agriculture sector have already taken major initiatives with special emphasis on agricultural production, mechanization, and marketing of agricultural products in the wake of Covid-19 aggression.  Boro paddy is expected to have bumper yields this year as there is no disease and insect infestation across the country. Farmers are waiting to take their boro paddy to homes and harvesting boro paddy has already started in the districts of the haor region and continued till mid-May. The harvesting of paddy in the haor region of the country is started first, and they are very careful and diligent to take this one crop of the year ie boro paddy in the house.  With workers from different parts of the country, they enjoyed the rice harvest in a festive way. At this crucial time of the boro rice harvest this year, the aggression of Covid-19 is threatening to take the paddy home. In other parts of the country, boro paddy harvesting will usually continue to mid-June and it is hoped that by then the corona situation will have eased and people will be able to return to normal life. In the current boro season in the country, boro paddy has been planted in 5 million hectares of land, which is 2% more than the target and boro paddy will produce about 20 million metric tons. About 10% of it has been planted in the districts of the haor region alone, which produces about 1.8 million metric tons of rice. According to the country's flood forecasting center and meteorological department, the Sylhet division is facing short-term flash floods due to heavy rains in Assam and Meghalaya in April, and the whole May is full of different kinds of natural calamities. The current agri-friendly government believes that \"the country will survive if the farmers survive.\" During the global corona epidemic, when there is a shortage of workers, the minister of agriculture, the secretary, and all concerned have come to the side of the farmers and have taken steps to cut the boro rice of the haor with the highest priority.  In accordance with the health rules announced by the government, initiatives have been taken to send workers from other parts of the country and increase the number of harvesters in seven districts of the haor region, namely Kishoreganj, Netrokona, Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Bahmanbaria, Habiganj, and Sylhet. BRRI dhan28, BRRI dhan67, BRRI dhan74, and BRRI dhan88 have already harvested and BRRI hybrid5, BRRI dhan29, BRRI dhan89 are being harvested.  For this work, workers have been taken to Haor from different parts of the country like Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Bogra, Mymensingh, Meherpur and surrounding districts under special arrangements and in the mean time about 90% boro rice of this region harvested. At present there are 362 combine harvesters and 1,056 reapers in operation in the haor area. 160 new combine harvesters and 137 reapers have been allotted on an emergency basis for seven districts of the haor region. In addition, 220 old repairable combine harvesters and 487 reapers have been repaired. BRRI has already sent three combine harvesters to the haor area on the instructions of the director general on its own capacity to finance the Strengthening Farm Machinery Research Project of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) and they are successfully harvesting paddy.   In addition to government initiatives, the non-government organization ACI-supplied combine harvester is assisting farmers in harvesting boro paddy in the haor area. With the official supply of harvesters and reapers for the haor area, the farmers of the area are able to breathe a sigh of relief. At the same time, the announcement of the government to purchase paddy at the rate of Tk26 per kg and rice at the rate of Tk36 per kg directly from the farmers has undoubtedly awakened the pulse of life among the farmers across the country.  The government has allocated Tk9,000 crore for subsidy in the agricultural sector including fertilizers and seeds in the interest of farmers. It has allocated a total of Tk206 crore, including Tk120 crore for agricultural rehabilitation, Tk50 crore for compensation and cooperative based farming for farmers affected by natural calamities and Tk75 crore for setting up demonstrations for expansion of new varieties and technologies in crops.  In this global crisis, these incentives and allocations in the agricultural sector are a landmark step of the present agri-friendly government through which countries will be able to deal with difficult situations like food shortages. As per the directives of the prime minister, in order to ensure that a piece of cultivable land does not remain uncultivated in the country, the production target for the coming aus season has been fixed at over 3.6 million metric tons, which is about 600 thousand tons more than the previous year and accordingly aus target area is 1.3 million hectares.  Distribution of aus paddy seeds among the farmers is continuing under the agricultural incentives by the Ministry of Agriculture. If the plans and targets for aman production by 2020 are adopted in advance, it will be possible to continue production by overcoming the losses of the current boro and the upcoming aus season under the influence of Covid-19.  In order to interrupt the food supply in the country, under the leadership of director general of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, in the coming aus season, seeds of BRRI dhan26, BRRI dhan48, BRRI dhan82, BRRI dhan83, andBRRI dhan85 have been supplied to Rangamati, Khagrachhari, and Bandarban hill districts for jhum and plain land cultivation.   Also, under the direction of the authorities, various divisions and regional offices of BRRI are distributing seeds to the farmers according to the capacity of BRRIin order to increase the cultivation of aus. Under the leadership of the Father of the Nation, the people of Bangladesh brought independence in 1971 by breaking the shackles of subjugation by risking their lives through the war of liberation. Today, on the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation, under the leadership of the worthy daughter of the Father of the Nation, our present Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the people of Bangadesh have once again embarked on a war which can be termed as \"Food War.\"  The number of disasters or epidemics that have hit the world and the amount of loss of life and property caused by it has been far greater than the damage caused by the subsequent crisis. Ignoring the aggression of Covid-19, those who are working to raise paddy in the homes of farmers and provide them with food security are today's brave warriors.  Under their leadership, Bangladesh will win the next food war. Our gratitude and greetings to all those who are dedicated to the tireless efforts of picking up boro paddy in the house of the farmer before the hill slope arrives in advance.  In the history of the world, women started agricultural work. To address the corona situation, our PM has advised us not to keep any cultivable land uncultivated as well as to cultivate vegetables that can be grown in the backyard.  And if women are involved in this activity, they will be able to engage themselves in productive activities at this juncture of the country by fulfilling the nutritional needs of the family. Finally, I would like to recall a quote about the old woman who took out some money from her bag and handed it over to Bangabandhu and requested him to spend it on building a golden Bengal. This small effort of mine, under the leadership of our prime minister and people's leader Sheikh Hasina, is a firm determination to stand by the corona crisis and the next possible food crisis. May Allah protect our country and the people of our country. Amina Khatun is Principal Scientific Office, Rice Farming Systems Division, BRRI, Gazipur."

      "authors": "Anwar Hussain, Chittagong",
      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-08 00:00:00      \nCPA served show cause notice   Different establishments like jetties, shops, canteens, clubs, fertilizer manufacturing companies, power oil plants, and dry docks have sprung up illegally over time on both sides of the Karnaphuli River, in the process choking the river which is known as the lifeline of Chittagong. This can be attributed to the lax attitude of the concerned authorities. An inspection report prepared by the National River Conservation Commission (NRCC) revealed the appalling encroachment scenario of the river. On April 21, 2019, NRCC Chairman Dr Muzibur Rahman Howlader made a visit to the river and found that different organizations were constructing structures encroaching on the riverbanks. The commission's full time member Md Alauddin, members Sharmeen Soneya Murshid, Moniruzzaman and Md Aminul Islam, hydrologist Sazidur Rahman, Chittagong Additional Deputy Commissioner (revenue) Delwar Hossain, and several other officials were present during the inspection. According to the commission's inspection report, construction work was underway for a new jetty adjacent to jetty no 15 of the Chittagong port. The Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) project called 'Patenga Landing Station Construction' was being implemented jointly by Chittagong Dry Dock Ltd and Bangladesh Navy over an area of 40 decimals, which is part of Karnaphuli River as per government land survey. However, no prior permission was obtained for the construction work. The commission also found that the river bank was being filled up by earth and sand which constricted and obstructed the river flow, which is in total violation of the existing rules. The CPA does not have any right to damage or obstruct the natural flow of the river. No agency can undertake any development project and obstruct the free flow of the river without protecting the foreshore the inspection report pointed out. Any jetty expansion project should commence keeping a safe distance from the river foreshore. Asking to stop the work immediately without further delay, the commission requested the district administration to evict all illegal structures from the river. It was revealed that the CPA leased out five acres of land to Incontrade Ltd. It was found that three acres of the land fell within the river boundary, when the illegal structures of the Karnaphuli were identified back in 2015. Currently, Incontrade Ltd has filled up 19 acres of area and an adjacent canal which falls within the river boundary. According to the map, the canal is 46 feet wide, but has now shrunk to 15 feet due to the encroachment. The CPA leased out land adjacent to the Chittagong Airport runway to Smart Trading which is within the river area as per land survey. The commission found that the earth-filling was ongoing in the river. As stated by NRCC's report, seven brick kilns, constructed encroaching on the river foreshore on the south side of the port, were heavily polluting the environment.  The report also mentioned that Karnaphuli Fertilizer Company Ltd and Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Ltd were constructed on the river jetty. Currently, United Power Oil Plant is constructing another jetty which is also obstructing the river flow. During the inspection, members of the commission acknowledged that the way the grabbing spree is going on, Karnaphuli River, known as the gateway of Chittagong port, would soon narrow down. Consequently, the floodplain of the river will not be able to retain additional water during floods. Moreover, the conveyance capacity of the river will sharply fall. The river will fail to combat natural calamities like cyclone, storm and tidal surge as the sea level is rising due to climate change. Furthermore, the navigability of the river will also be at risk, mentioned the inspection report. According to the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950, river foreshore cannot be leased out and no organization can build structures encroaching or filling up the river. However, river foreshore has been allotted to Karnaphuli Dry Dock Special Economic Zone Ltd, violating the aforementioned act. In its inspection report, the commission observed that no economic endeavours are allowed at the heavy cost of the Karnaphuli River and its water resources. After inspecting the river on December 12, 2018, the commission forwarded a report with a 16-point recommendation to the concerned government agencies in order to save the river. In the report, the river commission requested the district administration to evict all the illegal structures based on the list of the grabbers. The CPA was asked to cooperate with the district administration regarding the eviction drives. However, the commission condemned the lack of action regarding the implementation of the recommendations. Md Alauddin, full time member of the NRCC, told Dhaka Tribune that very little progress has been made with regard to the eviction of the illegal structures from the riverbanks. \"We have made some suggestions and recommendations in the inspection report; however, hardly any step has been taken based on them,\" remarked Alauddin. Replying to a query, Alauddin said that the district is facing fund constraints and manpower shortage, preventing execution of the eviction drives. \"The illegal structures have been built on the land of Chittagong Port. The CPA has leased out the structures to different organizations which is why CPA itself should take the initiative to evict the illegal establishments,\" he said, adding that they would follow up on the matter and ask the CPA again to carry out the evictions. Contacted, Department of Environment Director (Chittagong Metro) Mohammad Nurullah Noori said they have served a show-cause notice to the CPA to attend a hearing on March 10, on charge of damaging the environment by filling up Karnaphuli riverbank. Eminent Karnaphuli researcher Prof Dr Md Edris Ali blamed the lack of coordination among the concerned organizations for stalling the eviction drives. \"There is a serious lack of coordination among the government agencies. The CPA has leased out its land to different organizations without taking permission from the district administration.  Moreover, the river commission should be given more power so that it can take effective steps to conserve the rivers of the country,\" added the researcher."

      "authors": "Mahmuda Mity",
      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-29 00:00:00      \nMultiple working options for vulnerable communities can be a window of success Bangladesh is frequently cited as one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world due to its geographical location (Ayers 2009). Moreover, the country is highly disaster-prone with frequent incidences of cyclones, tidal surges, floods, riverbank and soil erosions, salinity intrusions and others because of its very flat topography and low land above sea level (Akter 2009). People have learned to adapt to risks over time as disasters have been a regular phenomenon for Bangladesh for a long time. However, the poor with limited capacity to cope with the changing environment suffer most due to frequent exposure to these disasters. In addition to the disaster-prone regions, the community who depends on natural resources are more vulnerable than others. For example, increasing salinity or long-lasting water logging destroys crops and soil fertility causes threat to livelihood and biodiversity.  In the coastal areas of southern Bangladesh, salinity has increased from the last few years and has made the area difficult to grow crops historically irrigated by fresh water. Especially after cyclone Aila, most of the coastal areas were inundated by saline water and local people faced huge losses of their livestock and assets. Like other vulnerable people, Jhorna's family became helpless after losing all their crops and fishes.  Jhorna is a woman who lives in Shyamnagar Upazila, under the district of Satkhira of Khulna Division. She is an example of a successful woman who saved her family from the financial crisis by doing multiple works. Though her family's main occupation was crop farming, she is now raising hens, ducks, goats, and cows in her house. Moreover, she is farming freshwater fish in her pond which was unusable after cyclone Aila. She is also involved with soft crab farming which contributes to a big portion of her family's income. She is also involved with selling seasonal fruits as an additional income source.  According to her (back in Sep 2019), 'Involving with only one income generation activity can make people more vulnerable than others who are involved with multiple works. If one activity becomes hampered during disaster then the rest of the activities can be useful to survive well.' When Jhorna first got married, she was dependent on her husband. She was not allowed to go anywhere without being accompanied by a family member. However, back in 2007, just after cyclone Sidr, she was trained by Practical Action on agriculture cultivation and started growing vegetables in her house. During cyclone Aila, all of Jhorna's families and her neighbour's crops and vegetables died due to excessive saline water. That time Jhorna had to go outside to collect water and relief. Jhorna's family had suffered for over a year since the cyclone Aila had hit, but its aftermath helped her to become an independent woman. As her family couldn't continue the agricultural work due to excessive salinity, her husband had started to work as day labour and she started to attend several training sessions on alternative livelihood practice offered by different NGOs namely Shushilon, Practical Action, Oxfam, Gono Mukhi and others. Because she realized the importance of training sessions from her previous training experience which she gained from Practical Action. Through these training sessions, she learned how to grow rice; fish and vegetables in saline areas; which kinds of beds would be good to; use for planting vegetable; how to plant seeds in beds and sacks; how to make organic fertilizer and pesticide; which fertilizers to use in each season; which crops to harvest; which repellent to use for insects; and how to increase the crop production. She also learned how to keep her poultry healthy by using more nutritious food rather than medicine. Then she started getting involved with multiple income-generating activities by staying at home. Her knowledge acquired from various training had helped her to become capable of successfully growing vegetables and other plants in saline soil. Now her family is also adopting these techniques to produce saline tolerant rice seeds.  Now Jhorna has started to earn more than her husband and has gained decision making power in her household through her economic empowerment. Her husband respects her advice and opinions, he looks up to her and consults with her. Now no one stops her to go anywhere or to do anything. Day by day, her confidence has increased now she not only raises livestock and poultry but for the last one year she has started raising pigeons.  She is a member of the managing committee of a primary school. She learned a lot at different meetings and that is how she increased her self-confidence. Now she can raise her voice without any fear. Everybody listens to her, including government members. That's why she's become more interested in working with the local government. She goes to a monthly meeting at the Village Development Committee where they discuss all the problems of the village, write them down, and hand them over to the chairman or members of the local government. Her father-in-law is now her biggest support. When she has to attend a meeting, her father-in-law helps out with housework. According to her father-in-law, 'My daughter-in-law has gone to work for the good of my family, and if I do not support her a little, she will not be able to improve her life. Although I used to be very angry with her going outside at the beginning, I now understand that she learns a lot from these meetings, that are helping to solve our financial problems'. In the future, she dreams that her three daughters will be highly educated. She believes that none can develop their life without education. She also wants to train her neighbours and wants to start a large poultry farm with hens, ducks and pigeons. Besides, she has a plan to increase her soft crab farming work. Jhorna's Story reiterates the never-ending perseverance and aspirations of our rural women who have used their knowledge gained to become empowered. These independent individuals are contributing to helping their families and communities break free of their vulnerabilities to climate change. However, more training with future adaptation plans can be useful to minimize the vulnerability to both disaster and climate change.

Her research interest lies in climate change and adaptation, capacity building, migration and urbanization."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-17 00:00:00      \nThe rains gave exhausted firefighters a boost in battling some of the blazes, with more relief expected over the weekend as the wet weather is forecast to hit other hotspots Drought-breaking storms dumped desperately needed rain on some bushfire-ravaged parts of eastern Australia on Friday, while giving joy to many farmers who have faced losing precious livestock and crops. The rains gave exhausted firefighters a boost in battling some of the blazes, with more relief expected over the weekend as the wet weather is forecast to hit other hotspots. The unprecedented fires, fuelled by climate change and a years-long drought, have claimed 28 lives over the past five months. They have scorched massive tracts of pristine forests in eastern and southern Australia, decimated livestock on already barren farms and destroyed 2,000 homes. Following extreme hot and dry weather that have fuelled the fires, Friday saw the heaviest rainfalls in nearly a decade in some areas close to hotspots. \"Rain has fallen across most fire grounds over the last 24 hours, which is great news,\" said the Rural Fire Service of New South Wales, the eastern state where many of the worst blazes have raged. \"Our fingers are crossed that this continues over the coming days.\" Crisis not over However the rains have not hit all fires in New South Wales, nor in the state of Victoria to the south, where many of the worst blazes are raging. The rain has also completely missed Kangaroo Island, the nation's third, biggest off the southern coast of the mainland that is famed for its pristine wilderness. Fires have devastated the national park on the island, wiping out much of its koala population and threatening to completely eradicate bird and other endemic marsupial species. Authorities have warned the crisis could worsen again with Australia only halfway through its summer. Celebration Still, the prospect of more wet weather across eastern and southern Australia over the coming days offered further hope. The bushfires and the drought have pushed many farmers in Australia to the brink, and this week's heavy rain gave many rare cause for celebration.  \"What can I say, we are so lucky. Before this, dams were dry, and we were carting water and feeding stock for months,\" Stephanie Stewart, who lives on a farm in northern New South Wales, told AFP. \"This has made life a lot easier on the land, that's for sure. Now hoping it spreads and can ease the burden for so many other amazing farmers who have been and still dealing with this dreaded drought.\" Animal rescues Roughly a billion animals are estimated to have died in the fires nationwide. With huge tracts of their habitats destroyed, environmental groups have warned the blazes could drive many species to extinction. Much attention has focused on Australia's tree-dwelling koalas, with images of the cuddly-looking animals being rescued from wildfires making world headlines. But on Friday morning, some koalas and other native animals at the Australia Reptile Park on the east coast of New South Wales had to be rescued from floodwaters. \"This is incredible, just last week, we were having daily meetings to discuss the imminent threat of bushfires,\" park director Tim Faulkner said. \"Today, we've had the whole team out there, drenched, acting fast to secure the safety of our animals and defend the park from the onslaught of water. \"We haven't seen flooding like this at the park for over 15 years.\" Rain dangers The heavy rain is being seen as a double-edged sword. The water could also make it harder for firefighting trucks to venture deep into forests on muddy tracks, authorities have warned. Flash floods are another concern, with scorched mountains unable to hold the water and potentially sending torrents of muddy ash into waterways. Such torrents have already led to huge numbers of fish dying in rivers that were poisoned by the muddy ash, local media have reported."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-20 00:00:00      \nThe pandemic and measures some countries took to secure domestic supplies have inhibited normal trade and supplies, and caused some major price fluctuations The global coronavirus pandemic threatens to cause a huge shock to international food trade and trigger a new food crisis, a top agriculture official in China said on Monday. The comments came as coronavirus outbreaks roiled global agriculture supply chains and upended trade, and after some countries restricted exports of main grains and increased procurement for reserves. \"The fast spreading global epidemic has brought huge uncertainty on international agriculture trade and markets,\" said Yu Kangzhen, China's deputy agriculture minister. \"If the epidemic continues to spread and escalate, the impact on international food trade and production will definitely worsen, and might trigger a new round of food crisis,\" Yu said during a video conference on the country's agriculture outlook. The pandemic and measures some countries took to secure domestic supplies have inhibited normal trade and supplies, and caused some major price fluctuations, Yu added. The coronavirus pandemic, which started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has infected 2.3 million people and killed 159,000 people worldwide. Strict lockdowns and quarantines to control the coronavirus outbreaks have disrupted China's supply chains and made it difficult for many industries to find enough workers, delayed poultry and pig production in the world's top meats market. Though China has sufficient grains to meet domestic demand, some other import-reliant farm products like soybeans and edible oils may be impacted by the global pandemic, Yu said.  China's exports of aquaculture, vegetables, and tea will be affected due to the disease, Yu added. Speaking at the same conference, Agriculture Minister Han Changfu ruled out a food crisis in China, saying it had the confidence and ability to secure supplies of grain and other major agricultural products. While the pace of domestic virus transmissions has slowed, China is focusing on infections from overseas arrivals as it guards against a major resurgence and monitors the spread in northeastern Heilongjiang province. \"The risk of imported coronavirus is still huge and will put considerable pressure on livestock production,\" Yu said. China is also fighting with the deadly African swine fever, which has slashed its pig herd by at least 40% and is still spreading. The country has reported 13 new cases of African swine fever since March. \"African swine fever risks have significantly increased, as pig production recovery accelerates and more piglets and breeders get transported,\" Yu said. China's farmers, lured by good profits and a series of government policies, have sped up efforts to rebuild pig herd. Pests, drought and floods also present harsher threats than usual to output this year, Yu added."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-15 00:00:00      \nEast Asia, Iran and European countries have been the worst hit so far, but the map showed a small number of cases in about 20 African states, and more across Central and Latin America Governments and health systems in wealthy nations are struggling to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, suggesting the poorest countries may be hit far harder if the virus gains a foothold there, a top UN official warned. Mami Mizutori, head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), said even in developed countries, health services were under stress and did not have enough equipment to treat people in need as the numbers infected rose rapidly. \"It is easily imaginable that if this becomes the case in a country where the health system is not as sophisticated, then that could lead to possibly higher mortality,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Geneva. A coronavirus tracker map from John Hopkins University showed there were more than 150,000 confirmed cases worldwide on Saturday, with the death toll topping 5,600. East Asia, Iran and European countries have been the worst hit so far, but the map showed a small number of cases in about 20 African states, and more across Central and Latin America. Even in wealthy parts of the world like Europe and the United States, the virus has exposed how risk affects everyone differently depending on their economic status, Mizutori noted. People living in poverty and lacking health insurance or secure employment cannot afford to be sick or miss work, she said, pointing to the virus as an \"equity issue.\" \"We need to really make sure that the vulnerable people are protected,\" she added. Large numbers of office workers have been told or have opted to work from home but this is not an option for many people. \"The day that you can't go to work may be the day you stop getting food for yourself and your family,\" she said. If coronavirus expanded in poor countries, the economic impact on individuals would likely be greater as economic losses would be a bigger share of gross domestic product, she added.  Crash course The slower spread of the virus to Africa, however, may have bought the continent valuable time to take preventive measures. Some African countries, like Rwanda and Uganda, are implementing strict controls at airports as well as simple hygiene practices such as setting up public sinks to wash hands. \"Hopefully the lessons that are rapidly being learned in other countries where it has happened earlier will prevent that this becomes a serious situation in less-developed countries,\" Mizutori said. Malka Older, an affiliated researcher at the Sciences Po Center for the Sociology of Organizations, said there was an element of \"elite panic\" to the pandemic as leaders, politicians and top sports personalities contracted the virus. \"Part of the reason we have been seeing so much global attention ... to this is that it affects the rich too - more than quite a lot of disasters do,\" she said. Mizutori urged all states to invest more in their health services, including medical staff and data collection, to boost resilience to health threats, as they agreed five years ago. In 2015, after epidemics like Ebola, MERS and bird flu, most governments signed up to a disaster prevention roadmap, called the Sendai Framework, which gave higher priority to health threats alongside natural risks like earthquakes and floods. But they have yet to implement the joined-up measures needed to head off serious outbreaks like coronavirus, Mizutori said. \"We haven't done enough and this is a very clear wake-up call to everyone globally,\" she said."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-06 00:00:00      \n18 families were shocked when they noticed drinking water from the taps tasted like alcohol In a bizarre incident in the southern Indian state of Kerala, taps in a residential building in its Thrissur district started to pour foul-smelling mixture of alcohol and water. According to The News Minute, 18 families were shocked when they noticed drinking water from the taps tasted like alcohol. The incident that took place in Solomon's Avenue Flat in Chalakkudy, Thrissur, last week, was traced back to excise department's callous destruction of seized illegal alcohol bottles, Manorama Online reported. According to the report, excise department officials seized around 6,000 litres of alcohol from a shop in the vicinity of the residential building.  The court had then ordered destruction of the illegal alcohol bottles following which the excise officials disposed the liquor by digging a pit on the bar premises and emptying bottles one after another. In the bizarre turn of events, the alcohol slowly seeped into the soil and \"mixed\" with the apartment's open well located next to the dug up pit. The alcohol mixed water was pumped to tanks of the residential building, leading to the shocking outcome.  Apartment complex owner Joshy Maliyekkal says he noticed the alcohol smell when he switched on a motor to fill a water tank outside his home. \"All of a sudden, the pipe started to smell very bad,\" he told the New Indian Express. \"We were suspicious as to why such a smell was coming from the water drawn from an open well.\" He said locals have been using the well for years and have never had a problem. Deputy Excise Commissioner TK Sanu has been quoted as saying: \"These bottles had been seized from bars whose licenses had been cancelled six years ago. We couldn't have known that our operation would raise such a stink.\" The Manorama report also noted how officials found themselves \"in a spot\" and were \"struggling to come up with an escape route\" after a probe was initiated on the issue. Chalakudy municipality ward councillor VJ Joji has been quoted saying that alternative water-supply arrangements have been made for the affected families. \"These families had been using water from the contaminated well for several years. It was their only water source.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-08 00:00:00      \nImages on social media showed extensive damage at Nausori, just outside Suva, with corrugated iron roofs peeled back by the ferocious winds A deadly Pacific storm slammed into Fiji on Wednesday, tearing off roofs and flooding towns, after leaving a trail of destruction in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Tropical Cyclone Harold weakened slightly overnight from a scale-topping Category Five to a Four, but was still lashing Fiji with winds of up to 240 kilometres per hour, forecasters said. The official NaDraki weather service said the cyclone was offshore south of Fiji's main island Viti Levu, but passing closer to land than initially expected. Despite the downgrade, it said Harold remained \"extremely dangerous\" and advised residents in the island's south to shelter in churches, schools or other substantial buildings. Images on social media showed extensive damage at Nausori, just outside Suva, with corrugated iron roofs peeled back by the ferocious winds. The main street of Ba, in the island's north, was submerged after the local river burst its banks. The National Disaster Management Office said residents along much of the south coast, home to many of the country's major tourist resorts, should evacuate. \"We are expecting a significant storm surge to be very dangerous for those living in coastal areas, we urge you to move to higher ground,\" it said. NDMO director Vasiti Soko said evacuation centres had been set up and officials were attempting to maintain social distancing to ensure Covid-19 did not spread among those fleeing the cyclone. Fiji has 15 cases of the coronavirus, with all known sufferers in quarantine before the cyclone hit. Town 'obliterated'  Harold claimed 27 lives in the Solomon Islands last week, and on Tuesday tore through Vanuatu, destroying much of the country's second-largest town Luganville.  World Vision's Vanuatu director Kendra Gates Derousseau said an aerial survey carried out by disaster officials late Tuesday showed the town of Melsisi on Pentecost island had also been devastated. \"We've done some programming there in the past, so I can recognize the landmarks -- you can see that 90% of all buildings are obliterated, is the term I'd use,\" she told AFP. A massive international aid effort was launched after the last Category Five storm to hit Vanuatu, Cyclone Pam in 2015, flattened the capital Port Vila. But Vanuatu's international borders are currently closed as the impoverished Pacific nation bids to remain one of the world's few places with no confirmed Covid-19 cases. The government has revoked a domestic travel ban imposed as part of its virus response, which will allow disaster relief to flow from Port Vila to the worst-hit islands in the north. New Zealand said it had deployed a P-3 Orion aircraft to help with damage assessments and allocated US$300,000 in aid funding for essential supplies. Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Wellington would provide further assistance if requested by Vanuatu. \"We are aware that the Government of Vanuatu is running a 'keep it out' strategy, and we will give serious consideration to ensure that any response to the Cyclone does not lead to the spread of Covid-19 to Vanuatu,\" he said. The cyclone formed off the Solomons last week, where it washed dozens of passengers from an inter-island ferry into the sea. It was initially expected to only reach Category Three. Latest forecasts say it will brush past Tonga early Thursday, still at Category Four strength, before petering out over the sea by the weekend."

Hindu couple, Anju and Ashokan, tied the knot amidst the crowded premises of Cheravally Muslim Jamath Mosque on Sunday, reports Times of India. The marriage took place according to Hindu tradition and practices, and was solemnised by a Hindu priest. According to the report, the bride's mother had been struggling financially since the death of her husband two years ago. While she struggled to save money for Anju's wedding, her neighbor who is a Jamaath secretary, suggested she approach the Jamaath committee.  She did exactly that and found that Jammath committee was willing to help. Apart from hosting the wedding, the mosque committee also served a vegetarian 'sadya' to around 1,000 guests, added The Hindu. Members of both the Hindu and Muslim communities turned out in large numbers to witness the marriage."

My children and husband had dinner last night with the leftovers from lunch. We have not eaten anything since morning,\" she added, worried about how she was going provide her family with the next meal.The no man's land, where Jamila's family and other Rohingyas are currently residing, lies on the international border between the Konarpara area of Bandarban's Naikkhyangchhari upazila in Bangladesh, and the Tambru area of the northern part of Rakhine state in Myanmar.The 5,000 Rohingyas took refuge in the hilly area in August last year, when the Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown in the Rakhine state - home to Rohingya Muslims - in retaliation of an attack on Myanmar border police by Rohingya insurgents earlier that month.Bangladesh has been experiencing a heavy bout of monsoon rain for the last few days. The flash flood down the hills in the area, caused by the rain, has inundated the makeshift refugee camp on the no man's land.\"This time, the flood is worse than what we experienced in the past,\" said Dil Mohammad, a Rohingya refugee leader in the area. \"We cannot cook our food. Our children have been starving since this [Wednesday] morning.\" Jamila Khatun's shack has been destroyed by the flash flood coming down the hills in Bandarban on Tuesday, July 24, 2018 | Tarek Mahmud  Also Read - 25,000 Rohingyas at risk of mudslides during monsoon The Rohingyas are now worried about waterborne diseases and snakes, not to mention landslides, he added.The situation is much worse in Cox's Bazar, where over a million refugees are living cramped up inside the camps in the district's Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas.  \"A number of shanties are damaged by rain, floods, and landslides every day,\" said Mohammad Amin, resident of D5 block in Ukhiya's Kutupalong refugee camp. \"The flash floods and landslides happened so suddenly, we had no time to move away. Our camp is waterlogged now.\"The condition of the refugees living camps deeper in the is terrible as they are in dire need of food, drinking water and medicines, said Abdul Mannan, who lives in the Balukhali camp in Ukhiya.More than 500 incidents of landslides, flood, storms and water-logging, lightening and other monsoon calamities were reported from May 11 to date that affected about 50,000 Rohingya refugees, according to the Inter-Sector Coordination Group, that is coordinating the aid activities in Cox's Bazar.Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, the government's Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Md Abul Kalam said: \"We have already relocated about 35,000 camp-living Rohingyas who are at high risk of landslides and flood to safer places. We also have plans to evacuate others who may face any kind of disasters.\"In its weather forecast yesterday, Bangladesh Meteorological Department said light to moderate rain with temporary gusty wind was likely to occur in most places in the Chittagong division in the next few days, while heavy rainfall was likely to occur across the country.The aid agencies working in the refugee camps said winds and heavy rains pound the fragile landscape sheltering the refugees, triggering landslides and floods, and more emergency response was needed to tackle the situation.The Cox's Bazar district administration said supports and aids were being distributed to the affected people of landslides and flash floods."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-03-18 00:00:00      \n\nAs floods rise in Bangladesh, crab farming helps families tread water\n\n\n\n\nRifat Islam Esha\n\n\n\n\n Published at 03:39 pm March 18th, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nKishore Mondol, a farmer in the low-lying deltas of southern Bangladesh, points at the four-foot-high platform of grey clay he and his wife have just struggled to build.\nThe mound is intended to keep their next home above ever-rising floodwaters. But even it won't last long, he fears.\n\"Within the next 10 years, monsoon high tides will be flowing over this level,\" he predicts.\nWith tidal floods fast worsening as a result of more intense rainfall and sea level rise, \"this is the third time within 20 years we are moving our home higher,\" complained Mondol, whose village lies in Khulna district, at the head of southwestern Bangladesh's Sundarbans tidal forests.\nSea level rise and worsening storm surges are making life increasingly precarious in southern Bangladesh's low-lying deltas, flooding homes and filling fields with salty water that keeps rice from growing.\nMany former farmers have switched to raising tiger shrimp - now Bangladesh's second biggest export after garments - in shallow ponds. But even the shrimp are now dying in many areas, hit by viral infections, local people say.\nInstead, as waters continue to rise, women in the region have hit on a new, tough and flood-friendly harvest: mud crabs.\nMore floods, less rice\nIn a village where most land lies 10 feet or less above sea level, and is flanked by major rivers on either side, flooding is an ever worsening worry for residents of Joymoni.\nWhen this year's monsoon arrives, \"we fear water may come as high as 3 feet, especially during the full moon, as our side of the village has no protective embankment since Cyclones Sidr washed it away\" in 2007, Tripti Mondol, Kishore's wife, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nAlready, \"salt is seeping into the very heart of our soil,\" she said.\nSubrat Chandra Gayen, 50, another resident of Joymoni, said nearly 80% of families have had to give up on rice farming, which once provided food and an income for most people in the area, including women who sowed, harvested and threshed it.\nThe loss of income has driven some farmers - particularly men - to migrate and look for work in cities, while many families raising shrimp have fallen into debt after taking high-interest loans from shrimp traders that they are now unable to pay back, local people say.\nThe Bangladesh government predicts rising sea level could displace about 20 million people from Bangladesh's coastal districts by 2050.\nCrabs, however, may help solve a big share of the problems, the village's women say.\nCrabs for export\nKhadija Begum, 43, now does a brisk business buying and releasing batches of baby mangrove mud crabs into a shallow pond she has rented for $48 a year from a local land owner now living in Dhaka, the capital.\nThe tiny crabs, their shells still soft, are caught in local creeks by fishermen. She feeds them small amounts of waste fish once a day, she said, and within two weeks they are six times their original weight and have developed hard brown shells.\nBegum catches them, ties their legs with jute string or straw and packs them carefully into large bamboo baskets, which she sends her husband to sell at the Buddhamari local market, 2 km away.\nFrom there they are transported to Dhaka and flown live to major importers China, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and Hong Kong, she said.\nFish traders grade the catch, with crabs with claws broken worth less, but those with a clump of bright orange-yellow eggs on their bellies - a delicacy for which South East Asians are willing to pay more - worth up to $26 a kilogram.\nBegum and her husband's earnings from crab sales now add up to between $780 and $840 a year, she said. The money has helped them send their eldest son to college in Khulna - a source of huge pride.\nBangladesh's fisheries department, working with non-profit organizations, has been encouraging farmers with salt-tainted fields to take up crab farming since 2011, with poor women a particular target for help.\nUnlike shrimp farming, crabs can be raised in small ponds and demand less up-front investment, said Muhammod Zulfikar Ali, mayor of Mongla Port municipality.\nReturn are also quick and, at the moment, higher than for shrimp and with lower disease risk, he said.\nCrab farming's growing momentum is reflected in Bangladesh's export figures. According to the government's Export Promotion Bureau, crab exports have climbed from $7 million in 2011 to more than $23 million in 2016.\n20% of the country's current harvest is coming from back-yard pond farmers in the country's coastal Satkhira, Bagerhat and Cox's Bazar districts, according to government data.\nTo further boost the industry, the government fisheries department is now trying to establish crab hatcheries. Currently most young crabs are caught in the wild, and catches have been falling with growing demand.\nWhat is the solution long-term?\nSome experts, however, warn that crab farming may not be enough to sustain families in increasingly risk-prone southern Bangladesh.\n\"Although crabs farms can be a lifeline against climate impacts they will only aggravate this unsustainable high-salinity\" situation, said Pavel Partha, a researcher with the Bangladesh Resource Centre for Indigenous Knowledge (BARCIK).\nCoastal villages, for instance, are running out of water they can drink. Many now have to buy potable water for nine months a year, from October to June, they say. Buying about 5 litres a day per person costs Mondol's family about $3 a month.\nHarjeet Singh, the global lead on climate change for charity ActionAid, said local peoples' ability to adapt to the changing conditions was limited.\n\"This place is going to vanish in the next 20 years, the way the sea is rising,\" he said, while visiting Joymoni. \"Unsafe migration or crab farming are people's own efforts, what we call autonomous adaptation, but it can only provide limited relief.\"\nGovernment loans, to help communities scale-up adaptation efforts that work, could help, he said. But \"there is a limit to how much [people] can raise their houses.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-07-06 00:00:00      \nMany refugees live under constant threat of landslides, flash floods in the camps Flash floods and standing water, triggered by water running down the hillsides after heavy rains have damaged makeshift shelters, infrastructure, stored food and other establishments in the Cox's Bazar Rohingya camps since the beginning of the monsoon. An Oxfam survey of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh found that more than half of them were unprepared to face the calamities that come with the monsoon. \"The monsoon rains are causing flooding, landslides, and disease outbreaks in the Rohingya refugee camps,\" said Oxfam's Humanitarian Program Coordinator in Bangladesh, Gabriela Luz-Meillet. \"Hundreds of thousands of people are living in temporary shelters, on hills of compacted mud which are completely shorn of protective trees and plants. Those hills could melt into the earth. There are refugees alive today who will not make it through to the end of the rainy season.\" Kutupalang D5 camp dweller Mohammad Reaz told the Dhaka Tribune that they become anxious whenever it rains. \"Every day, a number of shelters are damaged by rain, flash floods, and landslides,\" he said.  \"But water logging causes more suffering in the camps,\" added Mohammad Arafat, another refugee at the Balukhali camp. The Bangladesh Water Development Board's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre recorded 116mm rainfall in Cox's Bazar during the last 24 hours. It has forecast 945.60mm rainfall in the district this month.  The worst affected by the monsoon are the 4,000 or so Rohingya stranded at no man's land of Tambru and Konarpara under Naikhongchhari's Ghumdum union.  Rohingya leader Dil Mohammad said flash floods over the last two days had damaged their food. \"We are facing scarcity of drinking water, medicines, food and other necessities,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune.  'Untenable, inhuman situation' The latest spate of torrential rain that started on Tuesday morning damaged more than a hundred shelters in Kutupalang camp, the refugees said. Lalu Majhi, the designated Rohingya leader of a particular camp area of Balukhali, said many shelters had been set up on the hill slopes. The local administration evacuated more than 200 families from the risky hillsides but many families are still residing in areas at risk for landslides and floods. He said they had received reports over the last two days, of minor landslides in the camp area. Similar reports have come in over the last two days from Tanjimarghona, Balukhali-2, Moynarghona, Shafiullahkata, and Lombashia in the camp area. Many of the affected families are now living under the open sky.  Cox's Bazar district administration said the Rohingya population affected by landslides and flash floods is getting support and aid. International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies expert, Steve McAndrew, after finishing a four-month assignment as head of emergency operations for IFRC in Bangladesh, said the monsoon rains are already causing chaos in the makeshift camps. \"Each year [with IFRC] I see more need, but this last operation in Cox's Bazar was to me some of the worst conditions I've ever seen in my career. One of the things that's lacking here is hope - there's no end in sight, there's no light at the end of the tunnel for the people we're serving,\" he said. \"We're letting them know that we're listening, and we are spreading the word so that the world knows this situation is difficult, untenable and inhuman,\" McAndrew added."

A fax message forwarded by the Bangladesh High Commission in Delhi to the Foreign Affairs and Water Resources ministries on Wednesday contained the ominous warning, reports UNB. China recently alerted India that it would release excess water into the Brahmaputra River following heavy rainfall on the upper course of the river, known as Tsangpo, located in Tibet, read the fax. The message also said reports indicated that the water level in the Tsangpo River has now reached the highest mark in 50 years, forcing local authorities to discharge excess water into the Brahmaputra River. Also Read- Flood alert as 'unprecedented' volume of water flows down Brahmaputra  Diplomatic sources said India has informed the officials concerned in Bangladesh of the matter. The Indian government is on high alert as well, as the river also runs through Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. According to reports from our Sylhet correspondent Md Sirajul Islam, the chief engineer of the Sylhet Water Development Board said Bangladesh has been alerted about the release of excess water by China, which may have a possible impact on Bangladesh. According to the message forwarded by Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, there are fears that the release of the excess water by China may cause floods downstream of the Brahmaputra. Sirajul Islam added that he had received a message from the ministry saying that Sylhet would not be affected by the possible swellingof the Brahmaputra, as the region is situated in the Meghna basin."

Most rivers of the Surma-Kushiara basin were above the danger level at 9am on Saturday, according to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of the Bangladesh Water Development Board. \"The Sylhet division of Bangladesh is experiencing floods due to the heavy rainfall in Assam and Meghalaya for the last few days,\" said FFWC Executive Engineer, Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan. \"It is normal in the monsoon season,\" he added. The flood waters will recede in the next 48 hours, if the rainfall subsides upstream, Arifuzzaman said. According to the FFWC flood bulletin, the Khoai, Monu, and Kushiyara rivers are at 205cm, 33cm, and 14cm above the danger level.  The water level of the rivers in the Brahmaputra basin is also rising since retaining flood waters coming down from Assam. June is considered the beginning of monsoon. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is normal during this time across the whole river catchment in Bangladesh, originating in Northern India. With heavy rains in the upper catchment of the trans-boundary rivers, water levels might rise more in the next few days, the FFWC official said. According to the Indian Meteorological Department, the Assam and Meghalaya regions might experience heavy rainfall till tomorrow. Places upstream of Bangladesh's north-eastern border have recorded heavy rainfall. Sohra, for example, recorded 211.5mm of rainfall, Silchar 114.6mm, Majbat 121.4mm, Kherunighat 145.8mm, and Lumding 89.4mm.  The Bangladesh Meteorological Department recorded 109mm of rainfall in Sylhet's Kanaighat, and 60mm in Sunamganj on Saturday."

Shariatpur Our correspondent reports that Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya said the government has taken all measures for people who have been affected badly by the Padma River erosion in Naria upazila of Shariatpur recently. The minister made the announcement when visiting Kedarpur, Mulfotganj, and the Bashkhali area on Tuesday morning. The minister announced the allocation of 500 bundles of tin sheets, Tk1.5 crore in cash, and 4,000 packets of dry foods as relief. Each family will also get 30 kg of rice per month by VGF card till December, the minister said. The government has enough relief goods for the affected, he told the media. MP Col Shawkat Ali (retd.), MP BM Mozammel Haque, AL leader Enamul Haque Shamim, Advocate Sultan Mahmud, UNO Sanjida Yasmin and Mayor Shadidul Islam Babu were present, among others, during the visit. With the continuing erosion of the Padma River at different points, some 100 families have been rendered homeless in Naria upazila since Friday last. Including the latest, some 6,000 families under three unions of the upazila have been rendered homeless due to the scourge of riverbank erosion in the last three months. Besides, several thousand acres of croplands have been devoured by the river as the erosion has taken a serious turn in the upazila. A big portion of Naria Upazila Health Complex and a mosque adjacent to the hospital also washed away. At least 12 hospital buildings are at risk of being washed away at any time, said locals. In the last month, the river has devoured several multi-storey buildings, a mosque, 2,000 business centres, 300 shops, and other establishments located on the riverbank. A 1.5km area, from Naria Banshtola to Purba Naria, was washed away by the river. Locals are expecting some respite in the current spate of erosion of the Padma River in the upazila due to rising waters and slow currents, in the river, but they also feared that if the river water starts to recede then the erosion may take a serious turn again. Jamalpur Our correspondent reports that low lying areas of eight unions in Islampur and Dewanganj upazila of the district have been inundated by flood waters for the last 24 hours. Flood situation in Jamalpur hampers daily life |Dhaka Tribune Water Development Board (WDB) officials said though the Jamuna River water level dropped by 1 cm during the last 24 hours as of 12 noon on Tuesday, it was still 4 cm above the red mark at Bahadurabad ghat point. Flood waters affected the five unions of Patharshi, Kulkandi, Belgachha, Chinaduli, and Noarpara in Islampur upazila, and the three unions of Bahadurabad, Chikajani, and Chukaibari in Dewanganj upazila, they said.  District administration allotted 10 tons of rice and 400 packets of dry foods for Islampur upazila and 5 tons of rice and 250 packets of dry foods for Dewanganj upazila for distribution to flood victims. Bagerhat Dhaka-Pirojpur Highway in Bagerhat totally washed away on Tuesday evening as the erosion of the Madhumati River has taken a serious turn in Chitalmari upazila. Locals said thousands of acres of land, homesteads, and several business establishments and shops in the upazila have gone under. Lal Mian, a trader of the upazila said, \"We have already lost many business establishments and villages to the river and if the present situation continues, we will become paupers.\" Local people have demanded the authorities take immediate action. Gaibandha Overall flood situation in the char and river basin areas of the Brahmaputra and Teesta rivers in the district worsened further as the river rose more in the last 24 hours till Tuesday morning, reports our correspondent. The officials of the Water Development Board (WDB) said the water level of the Brahmaputra was 7cm above its danger level at Fulchharighat point in the district. Water level rising of Brahmaputra floods five villages and crops of 350 hector agricultural land in Gaibandha |Dhaka Tribune With the rising water levels of the Brahmaputra and the Teesta, the fresh char areas and the river basin in 26 unions of Sundarganj, Sadar Fulchhari, and Saghata upazila are submerged. On Monday midnight, a large portion of an embankment near the Kalsi Railgate area washed away. Standing crops on 350 hectares of land went under in the Kanchipara, Kayarhat, Kholaihara, Mashamari and Uria areas. WDB engineer, AKM Monayem Hossain, said they had already started to repair the embankment. \"It is difficult to do the work as there are rivers all around the embankments in char areas,\" he added. Tangail The Jamuna River has devoured many areas in Tangail creating panic among locals, reports our correspondent. Lands lost in Jamuna river due to serious erosion inTangail |Dhaka Tribune Initially geo-sacks are being dumped to thwart erosion, said sources at the Water Development Board. The erosion turned serious on Tuesday morning as the river started to rise."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-06-11 00:00:00      \nMonsoon begins doing its worst to the refugees in the cramped makeshift camps in Ukhiya upazila and Tambru no man's land Heavy rains and squally weather have started battering the Rohingya refugees living in makeshift camps in the Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya upazila and no man's land between Bangladesh's Konarpara and Myanmar's Tambru border points. A Rohingya minor boy was killed and his mother injured after a mud wall of their hut collapsed on them during a storm at the Kutupalong refugee camp in Ukhiya on Monday morning. The boy was identified as three-year-old Faruk, son of Abdur Shukkur and Sokhina Khatun, according to sources from the camp and Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Md Nikaruzzaman Chowdhury. The child died on the spot while Sokhina survived with injuries after the wall of their hut at the Block H of Camp No 7's Hill No E3 collapsed during heavy rain, Nikaruzzaman said. Faruk's body was kept at a camp hospital and Sokhina was admitted to Ukhiya Upazila Health Complex. Since Saturday, the first monsoon rains had started hitting the Cox's Bazar camps housing over one million Rohingya refugees, triggering flash-floods and landslides and destroying the makeshift shelters. Apart from the three-year-old boy's death, there were, however, no reports of any major casualties. Aid agencies have been warning that the monsoon season could prompt a humanitarian catastrophe in coming months at what is the world's biggest refugee camp, sheltering people that have fled violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state over the years. Waterlogging, due to landslides, has proved to be a curse at the Balukhali Rohingya camp too, adding to the refugees' woe. Also Read- First monsoon rains pound Rohingya camps UNO Nikaruzzaman confirmed that the squally weather and landslides were responsible for the destruction of more than 50 shelters at the D-4 and D-7 blocks at the Kutupalong camp.  Other than the death on Monday morning,  only one person was injured in one of the incidents so far, he said. Refugee leader Abul Kashem said, apart from the landslides, several areas of the camp were inundated following heavy rain in the past two days. Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission officials said that more than 600 shelters were destroyed in the past three weeks following heavy downpour and landslides. UN refugee agency spokesperson Caroline Gluck on Sunday told AFP that so far nearly 29,000 refugees had been relocated to new areas out of an estimated 200,000 people at very high risk of landslides and flood, who need to be moved to safer areas. Meanwhile, the Rohingya refugees' camp in the no man's land between Bangladesh's Konarpara and Myanmar's Tambru was inundated after flash-floods on Sunday. Rohingya leaders Dil Mohammad told the Dhaka Tribune that many of their shelters at the camp were submerged after Tambru Canal's water level rose following heavy rain and flash-floods since morning. The refuges were immensely suffering after losing their habitats and forced to take shelter on the hills in the no man's land, he said, adding that many Rohingyas had also taken shelter in Bangladesh territory. Another refugee leader Md Arif said the Border Guard Bangladesh personnel were helping the Rohingyas to cross over and find shelters. \"But we are worried as we will have to build the roofs over our heads again from scratch. We are also worried about food and medicines for the ailing ones,\" he added. Over 5,000 Rohingya people had taken shelter in Tambru's no man's land, near Ghumdum border area under Bandarban's Naikhongchhari upazila, since August 25 last year, when ethnic conflicts in Rakhine sparked the most rapid human exodus seen since the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Since then, more than 700,000 Rohingyas crossed into Bangladesh fleeing brutal persecution by Myanmar's security forces, joining more than 400,000 others who were already living in cramped makeshift camps in Cox's Bazar."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-05-02 00:00:00      \n\nConcerns of flood: Bangladesh Army, Navy to stand at ready\n\n\n\n\nShafiqul Islam\n\n\n\n\n Published at 03:23 pm May 2nd, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe government is expecting floods to hit most regions of Bangladesh this year. Last year, around 22 districts were affected by floods, but there are concerns that this year's floods will surpass even the serious flooding of last year, when the affected districts went underwater for months.\nThe Meteorological Office has warned that there is a possibility of flooding in 37 of the 64 districts, caused by incessant heavy rainfall during the monsoon season.\nAs part of the preparation, Relief and Disaster Management Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya and Secretary of the ministry Shah Kamal, held a series of meetings with various organizations and officials concerned, in the past few days.\nRepresentatives from Bangladesh Army and Navy were also present in those discussions.\nOn Tuesday, in one such meeting organized by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, the army and the navy were directed to be prepared for tackling any possible natural disasters, including floods.\nConfirming the matter to the correspondent, Secretary of the ministry concerned revealed that emergency messages were also sent to the deputy commissioners of the 64 districts.\nSpeaking to the correspondent, Mofazzal Hossain said: \"The government has distributed 200,000 tons of rice, Tk5 lakh in cash, blankets and two bundles of corrugated tin sheets in district relief funds across the country.\"\n\"A control centre has also been established at the Department of Disaster Management.\"\nThe minister added that officials concerned have been instructed to keep school, college and madrasa buildings across the country in top shape, so that people can use them as shelter during natural disasters.\nWhen it rains, it pours\nBangladesh is witnessing incessant heavy rainfall even as the monsoon season is yet to come. The Met Office forecasts torrential rainfall in some parts of Bangladesh from May 4 to 7.\nLandslides are also a serious threat to public safety during the monsoon season. A series of landslides claimed 166 lives in the hill tract regions of Bangladesh last year.\nMeetings were held from April 22 to 26 in Cox's Bazar, Chattogram, Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari to chalk up emergency response during the times of crisis.\n\n\nTerming the amount of recently recorded rainfall alarming, the ministry concerned has warned the deputy commissioners across the country.\nFarmers of flood-prone regions have been instructed to harvest their crops on an emergency basis, to save them from possible flood.\nLocal deputy commissioners have arranged for public service announcements to raise awareness on this issue.\nSources from the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, quoting DC offices from wetland districts, confirmed that 88% crops have already been harvested from these regions. The farmers also witnessed a bumper harvest this year.\nHail and thunderstorms\nThe people are also at serious risk of death and injury caused by hailstorms and lightning strikes.\nSources from the ministry concerned stated that frequency of hailstorms and the average size of hailstones are getting larger. There are also reported incidents of hail penetrating tin roofs of homes and injuring the residents inside.\nIn 2015, the Bangladesh government declared lightning strikes a natural disaster. The ministry believes that a significant reduction of tall trees, such as palm and coconut trees, are contributing to increasing deaths by lightning strikes.\nAccording to ministry sources, lightning strikes killed 307 people across the country in 2017, and 380 in 2016.\nIn May 2016, 81 people died of lightning strikes in a span of four days, and on March and April, another 70 people died of the natural disaster.\nThe Disaster Management Ministry advised the public to keep their distance from tall trees, electric poles, transmission wires, and mobile towers during thunderstorms.\nThe officials concerned also instructed people, especially children to avoid playing outside during storms, and advised fishermen to refrain from venturing out into rivers and the sea.\nThe disaster management minister, while addressing the May 1 meeting, said: \"Bangladesh is witnessing more and more lightning strikes. We have installed lightning detection machines in eight districts of the country, including in Dhaka, Sylhet, Mymensingh, Satkhira and Naogaon.\"\nRohingya refugees at risk\nRelief and Disaster Management Ministry Secretary Shah Kamal told the correspondent: \"A total of 1,100,000 Rohingya are currently staying in Bangladesh, and landslides pose a serious risk to around 200,000 among them.\n\"The refugees are being shifted to an area between Kutupalong and Balukhali for their own safety. Among the 50,000 families at risk, 25,000 have already been shifted to abovementioned safe area, and the rest are to be shifted soon.\"\nPointing out the army and navy's significant contributions during past events of disaster in the country, Shah Kamal said: \"Bangladesh Army and Navy personnel has a history of risking their lives for the people affected by disasters. So, this year we have asked them to be prepared to tackle any emergency situation.\"\nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-06-21 00:00:00      \nThe Kushiara River was flowing 118 cm above the danger level at Fenchuganj Bazar on Wednesday Even though waters in Monu and Dholai rivers are flowing under the danger level, a number of low-lying and new areas adjacent to the rivers remain flooded in Moulvibazar, marooning and severely affecting thousands of people. Ranendra Shankar Chakrabarti, the executive engineer of Moulvibazar Water Development Board, said the situation was improving gradually.  Since the water flow from upstream and rainfall have declined, the risk of damage to the protection embankments in Manu, Dholai and Kushiara rivers also decreased, he said. \"The rivers are very curvy and there are bends in the rivers in border areas. The capacity of these rivers has decreased to 60% because of sedimentation. So when there is heavy water flow from upstream, it creates flooding.\" Meanwhile the flood situation in Fenchuganj upazila of Sylhet has deteriorated further, leaving 30,000 people of 25 villages in five unions marooned. The Kushiara River was flowing 118 cm above the danger level at Fenchuganj Bazar on Wednesday, said sources at the local Water Development Board office. At least 30,000 people remained marooned. Dire conditions The residents of the flood-affected areas in Moulvibazar are suffering from acute shortage of pure drinking water and sanitation crisis. Locals have also become afraid of outbreaks of waterborne diseases as the affected people have been using floodwater for daily uses and defecating in open places. During visits to different affected areas, this correspondent saw that many households are still under floodwater and many people have taken refuge in different shelter centres and rooftops of buildings. Some people have also taken shelter on different embankments and are living in dire conditions - without any source of clean drinking water and necessary hygienic facilities. There is an acute crisis of foods although relief distribution from government and non-government initiative is underway, locals said. People who have lost their homes in the flood are living in makeshift shelters on the town protection dam in Barahat Dhaka TribuneBabli Begum, who has taken refuge on the Barahat embankment along with around 400 families, said: \"I have managed to come here with my mother and two children our village was suddenly flooded. My house is still under waist-deep water. We have nothing here with us - no food, clothes, money or other daily essentials.\" \"I am the lone income source of my family. I have no money since I cannot work. I do not know how I will provide if I lose my sewing machine,\" she said. Only few days ago, these people were preparing to celebrate the Eid-ul-Fitr with much festivity, but the sudden flood has changed everything, taking away their homes, cattle and crops. The floodwater has ravaged many villages and fields of Aush paddy and other vegetables, locals said, destroying their livelihood.  Ismail Ali said their home went underwater after the Baroikona embankment of Monu River collapsed in the early hours of Wednesday. \"The embankment was already vulnerable with numerous rat holes and foxholes on it. But it gave in at the end when it could not take the enormous pressure of the floodwater.\" At the Barahat town protection dyke, around 50-60 men, women and children had crowded this reporter seeking aid. One of them, Saleha Begum said: \"If we had not received 5kgs of rice on Monday, we would have had to starve. Lack of toilet and drinking water is the major problem now. However, a local female politician had one tube-well installed here and that is now the only source of drinking water of 400 families. \"We have to wait in a long queue to get water from the morning. The women are suffering mostly for the lack of toilets while children from different diseases.\" The reservoirs of pure drinking water in every household of Moulvibazar town provided by the municipality are currently under several feet of water. The reserve system of tube-well water is also out of order as there is no power supply in most of the flood affected urban and rural areas, leading to massive public suffering. \"There was no Eid for us. We only managed to save our lives,\" said Khaleda Begum. The flood-hit people have alleged that they are not getting enough aid and relief materials from the government. However, some non-government and volunteer organizations along with people from home and abroad have come forward with aid - providing cooked food, water purifying pills, oral saline, candles, matchboxes and dry food to the affected helpless people. Moulvibazar Civil Surgeon Dr Abu Jaher told the Dhaka Tribune that 74 medical teams were working to provide medical support to the flood victims across the district.  \"The teams have been sent everywhere. They are providing water purifying pills, oral saline and primary treatment including essential medicine,\" he said.  The civil surgeon also advised people to stay safe from water borne diseases. According to Moulvibazar district administration, some 50 shelter centres have been opened and 5,390 people rescued and sent to the centres. The military has sent four teams to work in the flood-hit areas. The government has allotted Tk9.4 lakh and 743 metric tons of rice for the flood affected people. "

Numerous potholes and puddles have developed on roads constructed by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) in Kulaura, Rajnagar and Sadar upazilas, hindering smooth vehicular communication to and from the north-eastern district. Some roads were still submerged under knee-deep water on Friday, while two culverts in the district have also suffered damage, worsening the traffic situation. According to the RHD, cracks had also developed on the regional roads and highway of Juri,  Borolekha, Kulaura, Rajnagar upazilas, and in Sheola and Charkhai areas. The scenario was almost as bad on the Moulvibazar-Rajnagar and Fenchuganj-Sylhet, Kulaura-Shamshernagar and Kulaura-Sreemangal roads.  \"There are as many as 500 roads in Moulvibazar,\" said the district unit LGED's Executive Engineer Kamrul Islam. \"We are assessing the amount of the losses and hope that the actual figure will come out in a few days. However, we cannot repair the roads right now since there are no funds available.\" The district administration is maintaining a list of losses incurred due to the flooding between June 12 and 20. Mintu Ranjan Das, executive engineer of RHD, Moulvibazar, estimated the cost of repairing the damaged roads at Tk12.85 crore. Situation is 'normal', says DC Contradicting reports from Moulvibazar, the district's deputy commissioner, Md Tofail Islam, said the overall flood situation was \"improving\", while denying there were any instances of water-logging in the district. \"Water has gone down from the roads and the traffic was normal,\" he claimed.  \"Several villages were flooded as a river protection embankment collapsed in Rajnagar upazila; however, the embankment was repaired while Kamalganj was seeing improved flood situation as well.\"    Photo:Dhaka Tribune Ranendra Shanker Chakraborty, executive engineer of Moulvibazar Water Development Board, said the Kushiara river protection embankment had been repaired in the Rajnagar upazila's Haldigul and Kalaigul areas. Official accounts did not match with the experiences of families on the saturated ground.  Up to Thursday, at least 6,322 families had been affected in Kulaura upazila, where there had been two fatalities. One person died in the floods in Rajnagar, where there were 7,180 affected families.  In Sadar upazila, the affected families numbered 10,508, while there were 27,920 affected families in Kamalganj upazila and 2,090 in Sreemangal upazila.  Trade hit The passage of freight to and from India through the Chatlapur land port has been suspended for the past ten days, with the Chatlapur Bridge approach deemed too risky for traffic.  Private vehicles and foot passengers were also encountering difficulties both ways through the border crossing. Sub-Inspector Jamal Hossain, of the land port's immigration department, said around 100 vehicles ply the route on a normal day.   \"Since June 13, traffic through the land port has dropped drastically, with most left to commute on foot while entering and leaving Bangladesh,\" he said. In a further blow to the local economy, Aush paddy cultivated on at least 4,160 hectares of land in Kulaura, Rajnagar, Sadar, Kamalganj and Sreemangal upazilas had been damaged.  "

According to reports of our Bogra correspondent several areas of Sariakandi and Dhunat upazilas in Bogra district have been flooded by the rising Jamuna River following continuous rainfall and water from upstream. The water at Mathurapur point of Sariakandi and Dhunat point of  Dhunat upazila was flowing 11 centimeters above the danger level at 12.00 pm on Sunday, the Water Development Board said. Thousands of houses on the river bank in two upazilas got flooded in the morning. According to local sources, standing crops of 622-hectare land  got damaged in char areas of the upazilas. Meanwhile, croplands, homesteads, establishments of  Chaluabari, Kazla, Bohail, Hatsherpur, Kutubpur of Sariakandi villages went under water leaving thousands of people homeless.  Locals have moved their belongings and domestic animals to safe places as the river water was flowing above danger level, said WDB Engineer Hasan Mahmud. Abdul Karim Apple, chairman of Bhandarbari Union Council, said more than 500 families have been marooned as the Boishakhichar went under water. Sairakandi Upazila Agriculture Officer Md Jahangir Alam said aman paddy of 42 hectare, vegetables of 20 hectare and sugarcane of 5 hectare went under water in last few days. Our Gaibandha correspondent said water level of major three rivers Brahmaputra,Teesta and Karotoa has been continuing to rise alarmingly for few days last causing flood in char and river basin areas of several areas in the district. The officials of Bangladesh Water Development Board said water level of the Brahmaputra River crossed the danger level at Phulchharighat point of the district inundating vast areas particularly the chars and the river basin areas of Sundarganj, Sadar, Phulchhari and Shaghata upazilas.

      "text": "Date Published:2018-11-17 00:00:00      \nSmaller crises and non-economic damages should also be considered, experts say Despite being one of the nations most vulnerable to climate change, Bangladesh has little information on assessing losses and damages caused by it. This has become a bar to demanding sufficient compensation in the world forum. Bangladesh has collected information on only seven major disasters,which count damages of only $11.6 billion in the last 20 years (1998-2017).Meanwhile, the most polluting country United States of America has collected information on 482 disasters that occurred in the same period, and have estimated economic losses of $945 billion. China has calculated its losses and damages at $492 billion from its 577 disaster events during that time period. Among others, Japan recorded economic losses and damages of $376.3 billion, India of $79.5 billion, Puerto Rico of $71.7 and Germany of $57.9 billion. According to the Disaster Management Department (DMD), Bangladesh has recorded only 7 major events. Heavy floods in 1987, 1988, 1998, 2004, 2007caused Bangladesh an economic loss of $8.4 billion; and cyclone Sidr in 2007 and Aila in 2009 caused $3.2 billion in losses. That brings the total losses and damages to $11.6 billion in that time period.  A recent global study titled \"Economic losses, poverty and disasters 1998-2017\", jointly conducted by the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), shows that in the last 20 years,disaster-hit countries reported direct economic losses valued at $2,908 billion. That includes both climate-related and geophysical disasters, of which climate-related disasters caused 77% or $2,245 billion.  Among the disasters, earthquakes and volcanic activity are recognized as geophysical,while floods, cyclones, drought and wildfires are the most dangerous forms of climate-related disasters. On the whole, reported losses from extreme weather events rose globally by 151% during two terms of 20-year periods. The World Bank has calculated the actual cost to the global economy is a staggering $520 billion per annum, with disasters pushing 26 million people into poverty every year. Experts term it as alarming, and say that besides giving serious thought to the issue, we should also demand compensation at the global forum, and should maintain data on losses and damages to build our own capacity to adapt to these situations. Shashanka Saddi, head of the emergency preparedness and response program at BRAC, said we have to calculate actual losses from all events via a proper and internationally acceptable mechanism, as we face small floods, droughts and storms every year that are being  unrecognized. \"We can make demands only when we have related data about our losses and damages. At the annual conference of parties (COP24), we should play more a active role within LDC and G77 groups to negotiate,\" he said.  \"How can we demand compensation if we are ignorant about the issue?\" he asked. A report says developed countries of the world keep records of most of their losses and damages. On an average, they record data of 53% of disasters, while lower middle income countries like Bangladesh calculate losses and damages of only 31% of disasters. About 87% disasters of lower-income countries were not recorded, as they were able to keep records of only 13% of disasters. And upper middle-income countries keep records of 40% of disaster-related information.   Among the reported disasters, floods occurred 3,148 times, storms 2059times, earthquakes 563times, extreme temperature 405times, landslides 378 times, drought 347times, wildfires 254times, volcanic activity 99times and mass movement (dry) 12 times. People were mostly affected by floods. Two billion people were affected by floods, 1.5 billion by drought, 726 million by storms, 125 million by earthquakes, 97 million by extreme temperatures, 4.8 million by landslides, and wild fire, volcanic activity and mass movement (dry) affected 6.2 million people.  Developed countries, including neighbours China and India, are mostly responsible for global warming, which has made Bangladesh one of the most vulnerable countries to climate-related disasters. COP24 will be held from December 2 this year at Katowice in Poland, where losses and damage-related issues will be among the most debated issues.  Dr Md Shamsuddoha, chief executive of the Center for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD), said developed nations are interested in direct economic losses through insurance mechanisms, which is also a business tool. They are not interested in the other non-economic losses which are also important and caused by climate change. \"Pressure is being created on developed nations to compensate both for economic and non-economic damages. We hope we will have some achievement in the international forum, especially at the upcoming COP24,\" he said. \"Bangladesh should develop a mechanism to assess climate-related losses and damages. The government should realize its importance and decide which ministry or department will play the key roles.\" Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief Satya Brata Saha told the Dhaka Tribune that we have data on economic losses and damages of major disasters, but we need to count minor disaster-related losses too. For a sustainable economy, it is necessary to keep records of losses and damages. \"We have already developed a model for loss and damage assessment. We are going to take up a pilot project in this regard, and if needed we will amend the assessment mechanism model in the light of that experience,\" he said. \"The model will be placed at COP24 with a hope that other countries, both developed and least developed, will accept it,\" he added.  In March this year, a committee was formed for developing a national mechanism on climate change induced disaster-related losses and damages,in light of a study report from the ministry of disaster management and relief. The process was started in 2016. "

      "text": "Date Published:2018-06-14 00:00:00      \nTwo Rohingyas have been killed and at least 10 others injured in mudslides since the monsoon started Thousands of Rohingyas living in tents and makeshift houses on the hills and slopes are vulnerable to landslides as heavy monsoon rains batter the coastal district of Cox's Bazar. Over 200,000 refugees in the camps are still living in areas considered to be at high risk of flooding and landslides, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre, operating within the European Commission's Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations department, said in its June 12 report.  Twenty-five thousand refugees are at very high risk, the ERCC said. Poor drainage system in Rohingya camps have added to the refugees' woes Tarek Mahmud/Dhaka TribuneIt has reported 60 incidents of landslides, floods, and storms between June 9 and June 11 in which 855 shelters were damaged. More than 700,000 Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh to escape a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar security forces. They have taken shelter in Cox's Bazar, a district bordering Myanmar. The refugees have cut down trees and razed hills to set up temporary homes. Six days of heavy rains have made the topsoil of the hills fragile. The makeshift houses stretch over several thousand acres of hilly area. The roads have already become muddy, and some are inaccessible.  Monsoon and deforestation often trigger deadly landslides in Bangladesh that kill dozens every year. Landslides in the densely populated camps can be disastrous. Ukhiya upazila administration said two Rohingyas have been killed and at least 10 others injured in mudslides since the monsoon started.  Rohingya youth, Md Rafiq, a volunteer working for the Rohingya camp management authorities, said he was worried about his family living in a makeshift shelter on a hill slope in Balukhali camp. Another refugee, Kalam, said a landslide damaged his house on a hillside in the Shafiullah Ghata area of Balukhali camp on Wednesday. \"We have been hearing reports of landslides for the last couple of days and we are really scared,\" he said. In Myanmar, the Rohingyas said they always lived in fear of being attacked by the army and the Moghs. \"In Bangladesh, our current worries are the rains, floods, and landslides,\" said octogenarian Yusuf Mia, who hails from Maungdaw. He lives at the Kutupalang extension camp where about 50 makeshift houses were damaged by landslides in the last five days. A UNHCR report said the pathways and stairs have developed cracks or broken away, and hillsides have crumbled pounded by rain. The International Organization for Migration said humanitarian agencies reported some 88 incidents of landslides and flash floods in the camps in just three days, affecting over 21,500 people back in May. They said the number would increase with the rains. The IOM, in its latest report, said conditions in the camps are \"further deteriorating as torrential rains that began on June 9 continue to trigger landslides and flooding.\" Refugee Rehabilitation and Relief Commissioner, Abul Kalam, said the government's concerned bodies and humanitarian organizations are working round-the-clock to provide aid and secure infrastructure."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-06-13 00:00:00      \nFollowing heavy rain and onrush of water from the hills, rising water levels of a number of rivers in several districts around the country have left people marooned after damaging protection dams and flooding the areas. Thousands of people have also been marooned in many areas of the hill districts of Chittagong as they went underwater after incessant downpour and flash-floods. In Moulvibazar, persistent rain and steady onrush of hill waters have raised the water levels of Monu River in Sharifpur of Kulaura upazila by 175 centimetres above the danger level. Local journalist and resident of Hajipur area in Kulaura Saiful Alam said: \"Due to incessant rain for the last three days, the water levels of Monu and Dholai rivers have increased dangerously since the early hours of Tuesday. \"Locals are trying to stop the water flow by using makeshift dams,\" said Saiful. \"The waters in Monu River near the Monu railway bridge and station in Hazipur union are flowing over the danger level. The dams in Matabpur, Madanagar, Chak Ranchap, Hashimpur, Baroigao, and Mondira are in risky situations.\" Since Tuesday afternoon, the dams around Chak Ranchap, Madanagar, and Nischintapur, Chatla Bridge, Chanpur, Amtola BGB camp area, and Datta village of Sharifpur union stand at risk of breaking down. Local mosques are using loudspeakers to ask aid for the locals, while the locals are trying their best to reinforce the dams. On the other hand, the water levels of Dholai River in Kamalganj upazila have also increased above danger level, causing floods in localities and croplands. Md Jewel Ahmed, mayor of Kamalganj Municipality in Moulvibazar, second from right, visits an area flooded after the water of Dholai River went above the danger level on June 13, 2018 | Dhaka Tribune As a result, parts of the dam in nine places in Dholai River, including Madhabpur of Kamalganj upazila, Islampur in Kamalganj Sadar, and Adampur union, are now at risk of being overflowed. Water Development Board Inspector Abdul Awal informed: \"The waters of Dholai River are flowing 25 centimetres over the danger level. The rate at which rainfall is going on, the waters might increase further.\" In Karimpur village of ward no 1 of Kamalganj municipality, waters have entered localities and croplands by shattering the dams. The water level is still on the rise.  Mayor of Kamalganj municipality Md Jewel Ahmed said: \"Over 200 people have become trapped inside the village due to Dholai river erosion.\" A 100-foot area in the Dholai River dam was eroded due to constant rainfall in Surandpur village of Munshibazar union in Kamalganj upazila. As a result, 250 families in Surandpur village have become trapped inside.  In total, around 500 families have become trapped in Karimpur and Surandpur villages in Kamalganj. Due to water entering through two eroded parts of the Dholai River dam, the streets of Karimpur and Surandpur have become submerged under 2-3 ft of water. Kamalganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Md Mahmudul Haque and Mayor of Kamalganj municipality Md Jewel Ahmed have inspected the areas around Surandpur and Karimpur where the dams have been damaged most seriously. Persistent rain and steady onrush of hill waters have raised the water level of Monu River in Moulvibazar's Kulaura upazila by 175 centimetres above the danger level | Dhaka Tribune Ranendra Sankar Chakrabarty of Water Development Board in Moulvibazar said: \"The dams in three places have eroded due to the overflow of Monu River. The waters are increasing due to flooding, and might increase further. \"Everything is in a risky position,\" said Ranendra. \"The flood water this year is greater than last year's. On Tuesday, water flowed 80 centimetres above the danger level in the Monu River.\" He added that without any government allocation, he had personally renovated the dams in Monu and Dholai Rivers by spending more than Tk8 crore in the past.  Meanwhile, in Habiganj, the water levels of Khoai River besides Habiganj town have increased by 170 centimetres on Tuesday due to torrential rain in hills in Tripura province of India. As a result, the villages around Habiganj town are at risk of flooding.   Alarmed villagers have been keeping a keen eye on the dam in Khoai River so no leakages occur at any place. Habiganj Water Development Board Executive engineer Tawhidul Islam said: \"The waters in Khoai River have been flowing 170 centimetres above the danger level since 9:30am on Wednesday.  \"The water level would have decreased if the overflow from Tripura province was dampened,\" said Tawhidul. \"Right at this moment, Habiganj town dwellers are at risk.\" Tawhidul informed that to fight the overflow of water, Water Development Board has additional sacks of sand in stock. \"We are paying attention so that we can take immediate measures if leakages are found at any place in the dam.\" However, he said the water level may decrease by afternoon. A house submerged in floodwater in Feni is seen in this photo taken on June 13, 2018 | Dhaka Tribune In Feni, parts of the dam in eight places around Muhuri River have broken due to heavy and torrential rain in India, causing streets, croplands, homes, and fisheries to be submerged in Parshuram and Fulgazi upazilas. Due to waters flowing three centimetres above danger level, the parts of the dam broke in these areas. Kohinoor Alam, executive engineer of Feni Water Development Board, said: \"Two parts of the dam in Chitholia union of Parshuram upazila, and parts of dam in eight places in North Daulatpur of Fulgazi Sadar upazila, Dhanimurar, Bairoya, and Banik para broke down.\" He said the work for reinforcing the dams at these places could not proceed due to the heavy water flow. The Water Development Board is working to find out the number of villages that have submerged under water, said Kohinoor. Meanwhile, the goods in shops in Fulgazi bazar have been damaged due to water entering the shops, while streets in Parshuram have gone under water as well. In Rangamati, at least 14 villages in Baghaichhari upazila were submerged due to rain and onrush of hill water for the last three days, rendering 60,000 people marooned, according to UNB. Torrential rain flooded different villages including Karengatoli, Baghaihat, Bangaltoli, Rupkari, Kadamtoli, Tulaban, Gucchagram, Muslim Block, Imam Para, Master Para, Gunia Para, Sarkar Para, College Para and Old Marishya. A vast area of cropland went under floodwaters, forcing people to take shelter in nearby schools, colleges and madrasas. A woman looks out of her home submerged in floodwater in Khagrachhari on June 13, 2018 | Dhaka Tribune Besides, the water level of Kaptai Lake was flowing over the danger mark, inundating low-lying areas of the upazila, including Longdu, Jurachhari, Barkal, Bilaichhari and Naniarchar. AKM Mamunur Rashid, deputy commissioner of Rangamati, said several villages were flooded as the water level in the Kachalong River rose following the rain. Several shelters were opened for the flood-affected people, and around 10 tons of rice was distributed among them, he said. In Khagrachhari, the flooding situation has not yet returned to normal.  Several hundred houses and businesses were flooded, as water levels in the Chengi and Maini rivers rose on Monday following rain. Md Rashedul Islam, deputy commissioner in the district, said they had already taken necessary preparations to shelter vulnerable families during any natural calamities."

The flood situation was already worsening in different areas of Kurigram on Friday, with the swollen Brahmaputra, Teesta, Dharla and Dudhkumar rivers leaving around 50,000 people marooned. Water had also started to inundate many areas of Islampur upazila in Jamalpur, while a number of villages in Nilphamari's Sadar upazila were deluged following the onrush of water from hills and incessant rainfall upstream. \"Kurigram, Jamalpur, Bogra, Sirajganj, and Tangail districts are likely to bear the brunt of this monsoonal flood, as the water is gradually coming down from Assam in India,\" FFWC Executive Engineer Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan said. According to the FFWC - an arm of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) - the water level of the rivers in the Brahmaputra basin was still rising on Friday, and would continue to do so \"for the next three to four days.\" Following the rainfall, 54 of 94 river monitoring stations were experiencing rising water levels, while the level fell in 39 stations and remained unchanged at one station. It meant that 10 distinct points along the Surma, Kushiyara, Old Surma, Dharla and Teesta rivers - located in the country's north and north-eastern zones - were already flowing above the danger level. Of those, water levels of the Dharla at Kurigram were 31cm above the danger level, BWDB officials said. The FFWC were also forecasting more points along the Brahmaputra basin to be flowing above the danger level by the end of Friday. Next door in India, the country's meteorological department has projected that the Assam and Meghalaya states will see widespread rainfall until July 11. This spells bad news for the north-eastern region of Bangladesh, which is located downstream from Meghalaya state and has already been experiencing flooding for the past few days.  Flood hits Kurigram Low-lying areas of many unions in the district's Sadar, Bhurungamari, Phulbari, Rajarhat, Ulipur, Chilmari and Nageshwari upazilas were flooded on Friday, leaving thousands of people marooned in more than 50 villages. Hundreds of families, who have lost everything in the flood, are yet to receive any kind of relief. Road communications in all these areas were also cut off due to the rising waters. Apart from Dharla, the water level in the Brahmaputra went up by 35cm, in Dudhkumar by 32cm, and in Teesta by 25cm in only 24 hours. The unions that were either flooded or facing inundation due to the overflowing rivers, collapsing dams and erosion included Holokhana, Bhogdanga, Panchgachi, Gharialdanga, Begumgonj, Buraburi, Thetrai and Ranigonj. The flooding has destroyed crops and vegetables in numerous fields around the district.  Local BWDB officials said they were working on repairing the dams damaged due to the overflowing water in different upazilas. Parts of a village inundated by floodwater in Kurigram after water in nearby rivers rose above the danger level on July 6, 2018 l Dhaka Tribune Also Read- Floods likely in the north this week Water enters Jamalpur The water flowing from upstream had started flooding the low-lying areas of Shapdari, Noarpara, Chinaduli, Belghacha and Kulkandi unions in the district's Islampur upazila on Friday. \"The water in Brahmaputra was flowing 40cm below the danger level at Islampur's Bahadurabad Ghat point at 5pm,\" the local BWDB deputy assistant engineer, Ashraful Islam, said on Friday. \"At this rate, the water level would cross the danger mark within the next 24 hours.\" The flooding in the district has also severed road communications between different upazilas, adding to the sufferings of the people. Nilphamari hit Around 20 chars and villages in the district's Dimla and Jaldhaka upazilas were inundated by floodwater, leaving hundreds of families marooned. BWDB sources said the Teesta River was flowing 6cm below the red mark on Friday afternoon. \"All the sluice gates of the Teesta Barrage have been opened to manage the pressure of water,\" Rafiqul Islam Chowdhury, BWDB executive officer at Dalia point, said. Sylhet getting better The situation improved in Sylhet on Friday, however, with floodwaters receding far enough in Gowainghat and Companiganj upazilas to enable vehicles to return to the Sari-Gowainghat and Sylhet-Gowainghat roads. The onrush of water from the hills on the Indian side had been slow up to Friday, keeping the water level in the Sari and Piyain rivers below the danger mark. However, local farmers reported that seed beds and arable land in large swathes of the upazilas had already been destroyed due to the floods. Meanwhile, the body of Abdur Rashid, 26, who went missing after a boat capsized in Gowainghat upazila on Wednesday, was found floating in the floodwater around 2pm on Friday."

Experts are saying that due to lack of water flow, the ecosystem of the Teesta River is in peril.\nIndia has built an irrigation barrage on the Indian portion of the Teesta River at Jalpaiguri district's Malbazar town. This is creating a major water diversion which has caused the Lalmonirhat's Teesta barrage irrigation area to dry up. The river bed is now filling up with piles of sand.\nThe Teesta River enters Bangladesh through Lalmonirhat's Patgram upazila's Dahagram. From its entrance to Hatibandha Teesta barrage, the water flow is around 800-900 cusecs (a unit of flow, especially of water, equal to one cubic foot per second). However, the flow is much lower from Teesta barrage to Lalmonirhat-Rangpur's Kaunia area. The water flow there is around 300-400 cusecs.\nLocal farmers are planting corn and pumpkin on the dry river bed. The Hatibandha Teesta barrage is almost empty. There is virtually no water from Teesta barrage to the Lalmonirhat-Kaunia area.\nThe Teesta River is around 315km long. The 115km it travels across Bangladesh is in a critical state.\nBangladesh and India have had many meetings regarding the river but none have proved to be fruitful. The ecosystem and biodiversity are suffering due to delays in resolving the water sharing issue.\nWith the national polls up ahead, discussions regarding the river Teesta is coming to light again. The people living near the river hope the government will sort out the matter soon. But no one knows for sure when that will happen.\nNegotiations on how to share the water of the Teesta have been going on since 1983.\nIn 2007, a meeting between Bangladesh and India Joint River Commission decided that they will divide 80% of the water between them and the rest 20% will be kept free to maintain the flow of the river. Mamata Banerjee disagreed to this and the deal remains unsigned.\nA 2011 interim deal - that was supposed to last 15 years - gave India 42.5% of the Teesta's waters and Bangladesh 37.5%. This deal was ultimately left unsigned too.\n[caption id=\"attachment_255345\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] In 2007, a meeting between Bangladesh and India Joint River Commission decided that they will divide 80% of the water between them and the rest 20% will be kept free to maintain the flow of the river. Mamata Banerjee disagreed to this and the deal remains unsigned Moazzem Hossain/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nMore than one lakh hectares of land across five districts in Bangladesh are severely affected by withdrawal of the Teesta's waters in India. Several districts in Bangladesh face acute shortages during the dry season.\nAccording to experts, if this goes on, the existence of the river will be severely threatened in the next few years. The ecosystem surrounding the river is already critically endangered.\nAccording to sources from Bangladesh Water Development Board's Teesta barrage irrigation project, a 650-metre long structure with 52 gates was constructed from 1979 to 1990. The project was officially inaugurated on August 5, 1990.\nThe project was first attempted in 1937 by the then government; the main project plan was accepted in 1953. Later in 1957 the project started to take off but was cancelled due to complications.\nHistory of the Teesta River\nThe Teesta River originates in Chitamu Lake in the Sikkim Himalayas at an altitude of about 7,200m and comes down first to the Darjeeling plain and then to the Duars plain of West Bengal. It flows through a gorge known as Sivok Gola in Darjeeling. It is a wild river in the Darjeeling Hills where its valley is clothed with dense forest, but its drainage area in the mountains is only 12,500sq km. It enters Bangladesh at the Kharibari border of Nilphamari district.\nUp to the end of the 18th century it flowed directly into the Ganges. The excessive rains of 1787 created a vast flood and choked the original Atrai channel. This resulted in the Teesta bursting into the Ghaghat which at that time was a very small river. After passing through Lalmonirhat, Rangpur, Kurigram and Gaibandha districts this deluge falls into the Jamuna south of Chilmari riverport. The total length of the river is about 315km, of which nearly 115km lies within Bangladesh.\nLand movement, earthquakes, floods, and geological structural changes in the northern part of Bangladesh affected the original flows of the Karatoya, Atrai, and Jamuneshwari rivers. The present Teesta is the result of these changes and the accumulated flows of the Karotoya, Atrai and Jamuneshwari rivers. The Bangla name Teesta comes from Tri-Srota or three flows. The river has a mean monthly discharge of about 2,430 cusecs. A number of old channels that were occupied by this river and the Karatoya through which it joined the Ganges are still known as the Buri Teesta or Old Teesta.\n[caption id=\"attachment_255350\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] The Hatibandha Teesta barrage is almost empty. There is virtually no water from Teesta barrage to the Lalmonirhat-Kaunia area Mozzaem Hossain/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\n What the locals are saying\nA local by the name of Motabel Hossain lives near the Teesta road bridge area. Land owned by his family and neighbours was destroyed by flooding from the Teesta river. In the dry season, since the riverbed is exposed, he cultivates garlic, pumpkin, and corn on the land. He said: \"If there is no water in the river, we will be in an even worse state. If there is water in the river we will be able to farm in the nearby lands. Due to the lack of water, the plants surrounding the area are dying. There is no more fish either. If the treaty between Bangladesh and India is signed, both the countries will benefit from it.\"\nHatibandha upazila's Goddimari union chairman Atiar Rahman said: \"The artificial flood created by India greatly harms the locals and we face major damage. This whole upazila's tragedy is the flood we face each year. But in the dry season, the river is utterly dry and that harms us too. The fishermen are changing their profession. There is not enough water for irrigation either. This is affecting the lives of the people and the ecosystem is a very negative way. We want the Teesta water sharing agreement to be finalized as soon as possible. Both the Bangladeshi and Indian government need to step up and take necessary steps.\"\nWhat the authorities are saying\nThe Teesta barrage irrigation project expansion officer Rafiul Bari said: \"Even though we built Teesta barrage irrigation project-1 to provide 11 upazilas with water for irrigation, due to lack of water in the river, the farmers are not benefitting from it. We are able to provide water to only five upazilas. Even that is irregular. We were only able to give 500 cusecs of water in the last five years. The river contains less water now. The Teesta water sharing agreement should be finalized as soon as possible so Bangladesh can finally have its fair share of water. The river will come to life again and we will be able to use the water for irrigation.\"\nTeesta Barrage Water Development Board executive engineer Rafikul Alam Chowdhury said: \"We need around 20,000 cusecs of water flow to keep the river flowing properly and to provide the people with water for irrigation. We need around 4,000 cusecs of water to simply keep the river alive; we are not even getting 1500 cusecs of water on average. If this continues, we will not have even a drop of water in the Teesta River in a couple of years. The whole irrigation system will have to be shut down. Bangladesh and India need to sort out the water sharing problem. Otherwise the river will die out for good.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-12-06 00:00:00      \nBangladesh's climate risk ranking is 9th in 2017 against 13th position in 2016 Bangladesh is the seventh most affected country in the world due to \"extreme weather events\" over the last 20 years from 1998 -2017, says a new global report. The other top nine affected countries are Puerto Rico, Honduras, Myanmar, Haiti, Philippines, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Dominica, according to Global Climate Risk Index-2019 released in Poland on Wednesday. Of the 10 most affected countries and territories (1998-2017), eight were developing countries in the low income or lower middle income country group, one was classified as an upper-middle income country (Dominica), and one an advanced economy generating high income (Puerto Rico). Bangladesh's climate risk ranking is 9th in 2017 against 13th position in 2016. The report says massive rainfalls have led to floods across Nepal, Bangladesh and India, which affected more than 40 million people. Around 1200 people lost their lives in these three countries and millions were displaced throughout the region. The floods spread across the foothills of the Himalayas and caused landslides leaving tens of thousands of houses, and vast areas of farmland and roads destroyed. Nepal experienced flash floods and landslides in August across the southern border, amounting to US$ 600 million in damages. Nearly 250 people were killed by collapsed buildings or drowning in regions of India, Nepal and Bangladesh. 950,000 houses were damaged or destroyed in the floods. Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka and Dominica were at the top of the list of the most affected countries in 2017. Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar were the countries most affected by extreme weather events. Altogether, more than 526,000 people died as a direct result of more than 11,500 extreme weather events; and losses between 1998 and 2017 amounted to around US$ 3.47 trillion (in Purchasing Power Parities). Storms and their direct implications - precipitation, floods and landslides - were one major cause of damage in 2017. Of the ten most affected countries in 2017, four were hit by tropical cyclones.  Recent science has found a clear link between climate change and record-breaking precipitation of 2017's hurricanes. It also suggests that the number of severe tropical cyclones will increase with every tenth of a degree in global average temperature rise. In many cases, single exceptional disasters have such a strong impact that the countries and territories concerned are also ranked high in the long-term index. Over the last few years another category of countries has been gaining relevance - countries like Haiti, the Philippines and Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long-term index and in the index for the respective year. The Climate Summit in Katowice should adopt the \"rulebook\" needed for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, including the global adaptation goal and adaptation communication guidelines, said the report. Furthermore, COP24 must increase efforts to properly address loss and damage, which appears as a cross-cutting issue referenced throughout various negotiation streams, with significant risk of being omitted from final negotiation text, reads the report. The risks of future climate-related losses and damages are far too severe to simply function as a negotiation chip. The Global Climate Risk Index 2019 analyses to what extent countries and regions have been affected by impacts of weather-related loss events (storms, floods, heat waves etc.). The most recent data available - for 2017 and from 1998 to 2017 - were taken into account. The countries and territories affected most in 2017 were Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka as well as Dominica. For the period from 1998 to 2017 Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar rank highest. This year's 14th edition of the analysis reconfirms earlier results of the Climate Risk Index: less developed countries are generally more affected than industrialized countries. Regarding future climate change, the Climate Risk Index may serve as a red flag for already existing vulnerability that may further increase in regions where extreme events will become more frequent or more severe due to climate change."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-10-22 00:00:00      \nGlobally, assets worth about $163 billion are not insured against catastrophes, posing a \"significant threat\" to livelihoods and prosperity, London-based insurance market Lloyd's said in a report Disaster-prone developing nations, including Bangladesh and Indonesia, are exposed to crippling losses when storms, floods or earthquakes strike because they suffer from a dangerous lack of insurance, industry experts said on Monday. Globally, assets worth about $163 billion are not insured against catastrophes, posing a \"significant threat\" to livelihoods and prosperity, London-based insurance market Lloyd's said in a report. The value of \"underinsured\" assets has shrunk by only 3% since 2012, it noted. Many countries with the lowest levels of insurance are also among those most exposed to risks, including from climate change impacts, and are least able to fund disaster recovery efforts, it added. \"If insurance is not available, catastrophes can have a much greater impact on economies and lives,\" Lloyd's Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said in a statement. Emerging and low-income economies account for almost all of the global \"insurance gap\", the report said. Insurance penetration rates - total insurance premiums as a percentage of gross domestic product - are on average twice as high in rich nations as those in developing countries, it noted. Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt and Nigeria all have an insurance penetration rate of less than 1%, it said. After a disaster, uninsured losses usually have to be paid from government funds - a problem for poorer countries that cannot afford to rebuild. \"Catastrophes coupled with underinsurance can be seen as one of the significant factors that holds back economic development and perpetuates global inequality,\" the report said. Some risks in richer nations also are not well-covered by insurance, it noted, including earthquakes in Italy and floods in the United States. Slow progress on expanding the use of insurance to protect against risks is \"concerning\", the report said - and remains the case despite many economies bouncing back from recession in the six years since the \"insurance gap\" was last measured. It is particularly worrying given the upsurge in \"more severe, frequent and costly natural disasters, driven in large part by climate change\", the report added. Last year was one of the costliest for natural catastrophes in the past decade - and expected economic losses from such disasters now total $165 billion annually, Lloyd's said. Unafforadable  One of the main barriers to taking out disaster insurance in developing countries is that it is too expensive for many. Limited understanding of its value and lack of trust in insurance companies also stand in the way of policies being sold, the report said. But insurance, combined with investment in improving resilience to disasters, can cut losses, the report said. Studies suggest each dollar invested in reducing disaster risk saves about $4 in recovery costs. Another report also released on Monday by Lloyd's and the UK-funded Centre for Global Disaster Protection outlined four innovative financial instruments that could generate cash to invest in resilient infrastructure and boost insurance coverage. They include loans that incorporate insurance to keep interest payments low, and bonds whose payments are linked to the success of resilience measures. Another idea is \"resilience service companies\" that would retrofit buildings to better withstand natural hazards, for example, reducing risks and lowering insurance premiums. Daniel Stander, global managing director of Risk Management Solutions, which worked on the report, said the instruments aimed to ease the initial costs of building to withstand disasters, and to finance the risks that remain. \"In this way the benefits of insurance can be enjoyed by those who need it most,\" he said in a statement. But some climate change experts argue that insurance is not the best method to help the poor cope with the growing damage caused by wilder weather and rising seas as the planet warms. In a September report, the Heinrich Boll Stiftung North America, an environmental foundation, said regional insurance schemes, from which African, Caribbean or Pacific states can buy coverage, had paid out too little, too late in recent years. It proposed other options to support developing countries, such as international funding to build up social safety nets, relocate vulnerable communities and develop new ways of making a living for those at risk. Carnegie-Brown of Lloyd's said that, for poorer nations such as Bangladesh, buying insurance was a \"low-order issue\" compared to other economic problems. He urged donor governments to work with financial markets to find ways to use aid money to boost protection, adding that current efforts are fragmented and not expanding fast enough. \"The developed world is not really assisting the countries least able to afford the resilience investment that we think they need,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-08-12 00:00:00      \nIn Barisal's wholesale fish market in the Port Road area of the city, prices are dropping every day The haul of ilish from the coastal Bay of Bengal and the Meghna estuary is exceptional this year, bringing good news for consumers and traders, but bad news for the fishermen. In Barisal's wholesale fish market in the Port Road area of the city, prices are dropping every day. River ilish, however, is rarer this year. On Wednesday and Thursday, this correspondent found more than fifty fishing trawlers, carrying ilish netted from the Bhola coastal area, anchored at the Barisal Port Road Ilish Mokam. The fish were netted from the coastal Bay of Bengal and Meghna River estuary. Nirob Hossain Tutul, secretary of `Port Road Matso Arotdar Samittee,' the fish traders' association, said on average 2,500 maund (approx. 40kg) of ilish from the sea are coming to the market daily. Most of the ilish are 500-600 grams and due to the massive supply, the prices are lower compared to the last year. Ilish, the most popular fish in the Bangali cuisine, provides employment to about 450,000 fishermen and its trade involves another four to five million. According to 2015 data, the national fish of Bangladesh contributes about 12% of the total fish production and about 1% of the GDP. Nirob said traders and their workers were busy packing the fish with ice to be sent to Dhaka, Chittagong and other districts of the country. The going price for ilish from the sea is Tk19,000 - 23,000 per maund, and for ilish netted in the rivers it is Tk35,000 - 36,000, he added.  \"The supply of ilish netted from local sweet water rivers has dropped and therefore its price is higher,\" he said. Ilish netted from sweet water is considered tastier and fresher.  Bimal Chandra Das, district fisheries officer (ilish), said mother ilish enter the rivers to lay eggs and then return to the sea.  The young fish, Jatka, start their journey to the sea around two to three months later.  Round the year restrictions against catching and selling Jatka appears to have increased the ilish stock, the officer said. \"But due to rough weather prevailing in the sea this season, fishermen had not been able to fish for ilish,\" he added. Rashid Majhi, a fisherman from Bhola, said this year the rains started late but still he had netted a satisfactory amount of ilish. However, big hauls had caused the price to drop. Samad Majhi, another ilish trader from the Charfasson coast of Bhola, said if the weather conditions were better, even more fish could have been caught. Awal Majhi, from the same area, said: \"I was at the sea for a week with 13 crew and fishermen. We brought in a giant haul, but on reaching the Barisal market, I felt disappointed with the falling price.\" \" I am anxious now, not about repeating profits, but about recovering my costs,\" he added. On other hand ilish trader Bazlu Mia from Kalapara, Patuakhali, said he had come to Barisal with truckloads of fish instead of selling his haul at Patuakhali in the hope of better prices. \"But it was of no use. We are now thinking of preserving the fish supply in ice to get a better price in the future,\" he added. Retail ilish trader Akbor Hossain said the massive supply had lowered the price because ilish is a perishable item.  "

But, the local markets are yet to reap the benefits of the decision.\"\nVisiting a number of local retail markets in the capital, the correspondent has found that the local onions are being sold at a price of Tk60 to Tk65 Kg, and imported onions are being sold at Tk55 to Tk60 per Kg.\nThe traders defended their price by saying that the onions that are currently being sold were bought with a high price and the new imports of onions are yet to arrive in the markets.\nJust a few weeks ago, the local onions were priced at around Tk130 per Kg, and onions imported from India were available at Tk110.\nCompared to January, 2017, the price of onions has increased by at least Tk20 to Tk25 in January this year.\nLast season, the production of onions in India went down due to a severe drought, which in turn increased the prices both in India and in Bangladesh.\nThe prices saw yet another increase after torrential rain caused floods in several states of India last year, further pushing the onion price to Tk120-130 per Kg in most markets throughout Bangladesh.\nAround two years after withdrawing the MEP, the Indian central government re-imposed MEP on onions on November 23, 2017 at a price of $850 (Tk70,472) per ton, which was reduced to $700 (Tk58,036) on January 19 this year.\nIn a latest development on February 1, the Indian government completely removed the minimum export price (MEP) on onions.\nOn February 2, directives regarding the removal of MEP arrived at the Hili customs station, effectively withdrawing the requirement of minimum export prices, and it came into effect on February 3, 2018. The customs server has also been updated with accordingly.\nSources from the Hili customs station have confirmed the matter to the correspondent.\n\nAlso Read- India removes minimum export price on onions\n\nThe correspondent has also learned that two of India's largest marketplaces named Lasalgaon Onion Market and Kashik Onion Market, had witnessed a major drop in onion prices only a few months ago.\nIn August, 2017 per one hundred Kgs of onions were priced at 2,600 Rupees, but the price came crashing to 900 Rupees in September the same year.\nOther marketplaces in India also witnessed the same trend of onion price drop. But the onion prices in Bangladesh are not reflecting the major price cut in India. Compared to major marketplaces, the onions prices are even higher in markets littered around different neighbourhood in Dhaka, frequently reaching Tk65 per Kg.\nThe Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB), however, claimed in a recent statement that the price of onions has gone down by Tk10 since the last week.\nTo counter the price hike of onions in the Indian market during July, 2017, decision was taken to import onions from Egypt.\nCommenting of the matter, Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed at the parliament recently said: \"No syndicates interfered with the production, import, distribution and caused the skyrocketing prices of onions. Bangladesh's primary source of onion import is India.\"\nHe pointed out that the floods in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra last year had damaged onion production there, causing the MEP to hit $850.\n\"The high import cost affected the local markets of Bangladesh but onion price is starting to drop, and it will drop further soon,\" Tofail said.\nAccording to the sources from the Commerce Ministry, Bangladesh has an annual demand of 2,200,000 to 2,500,000 metric tons of onions. Last season, the country produced 1,750,000 metric tons of onions, while the deficit of around 700,000 metric tons is usually covered through imports.\nThis article was first published on bangaltribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

More than 10,000 people are trapped in the flood water, so far, reports UNB. The trans-boundary Teesta River was flowing 8cm above the danger level at Doyani point on Tuesday morning. The officials of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) said the situation became worsened when India opened the sluice-gates of the Gazaldoba barrage. \"Now, water is gushing into Bangladesh,\" they added.  Meanwhile, 44 gates of the Teesta barrage have been opened to control water flow. Additionally, the temporary dams of Dhurni village of Hatibandha upazila in Lalmonirhat are also at risk, they said. According to locals, the water level started to rise on Monday morning and the condition is gradually worsening. BWDB Executive Engineer Rafiqul Alam Chowdhury of the Teesta Barrage Irrigation Project said the situation will be worse if the onrush of water from upstream hilly areas continues."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-08-19 00:00:00      \nIndia's national carrier Air India will operate ATR flights from the naval airport in Kochi to Bangalore and Coimbatore, starting Monday A deluge in India's flood-stricken southwestern state of Kerala finally let up on Sunday, giving some respite for thousands of marooned families, while authorities feared an outbreak of disease among two million people crammed into relief camps. Incessant rains since August 8 have caused the state's worst floods in a century, and at least 357 people have perished, many of them killed by landslides. The beaches and backwaters of Kerala are top destinations for domestic and international tourists, but far fewer visit during the monsoon season. The India Meteorological Department forecast heavy rainfall only at one or two places of Kerala on Sunday and withdrew a red alert in several districts. Flood waters too began to recede from several places. Using boats and helicopters, India's military has led rescue efforts to reach people in communities cut off for days by the floods, with many trapped on roof tops and the upper floors of their homes, and in desperate need of food and potable water. Rescue teams were focused on the town of Chengannur on the banks of the Pamba River, where some 5,000 people are feared to be trapped, officials said. More than 200,000 families have taken refuge at relief camps set up across the state, an official at the Kerala State Disaster Management office said. Kerala's chief minister had earlier said two million people had taken shelter in camps since the monsoon rains began three months ago. Anil Vasudevan, who handles disaster management at the Kerala health department, said authorities had isolated three people with chickenpox in one of the relief camps in Aluva town, nearly 250km from state capital Thiruvananthapuram. He said the department was preparing to deal with a possible outbreak of water-borne and air-borne diseases in the camps, where an estimated two million people have taken shelter since the monsoon rains began three months ago. Kerala, which usually receives high rainfall, has seen over 250% more rain than normal between August 8 and August 15, causing the state authorities to release water from 35 dangerously full dams, sending a surge into its main river.  As the rain abated on Sunday morning, one resident in Cheranelloor, a suburb of Kochi situated on the banks of the Periyar river, visited his home to see when he and his family could return. \"The entire house is covered with mud. It will take days to clean to make it liveable. All our household articles, including the TV and fridge have been destroyed,\" 60-year-old T P Johnny told Reuters. Kochi's airport is closed due to waterlogging, and Jet Airways has arranged additional flights from Thiruvananthapuram for passengers holding confirmed tickets from Kochi. India's national carrier Air India will operate ATR flights from the naval airport in Kochi to Bangalore and Coimbatore, starting Monday. Late on Saturday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that there was no shortage of food in the state as traders had stocked up ahead of a local festival. \"The only problem is transporting it,\" he told reporters. \"The central government and public have cooperated well in this effort to fight this disaster.\" He also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited the state on Saturday, announced an assistance of Rs5 billion against his request for Rs20 billion. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of the United Arab Emirates, where many Keralites work, has also offered assistance to the state."

Water has been rushing in through the damaged dam, flooding the low lying areas, said Executive Engineer Kaiser Ahmed of Bhola Water Development Board (WBD). Dalalkandi, Chowkidarkandi, and Mawlanakandi villages of the upazila have been flooded, causing difficulties for around 400 families.  Around 300 families in Mujibnagar union of Char Fasson upazila have been marooned following the onrush of tidal water through a km-long damaged embankment in Char Motahar point of the union. Replying to a query, the WDB official said the embankment could not be repaired for lack of funds. Several areas of Kolatolir Char and Char Nizam have also being inundated."

It is extraordinary when one takes into account the scanty 7,100 tons imported in the previous fiscal year.\nFloods and pests had a devastating effect on major rice basins during both the Aman and Boro seasons, prompting the government to import rice in a vain attempt to stabilize prices.\nThe leap in rice prices at the consumers' end reflects the increased price of paddy sold by the farmers. Since most farmers suffered huge losses because of the floods and pest attacks, the increase in price can be considered a tawdry compensation.\nAzizar Rahman was issuing instructions to farm labourers he hired to harvest the crop on the morning of December 1. Azizar, a farmer from the village of Makhmalpur in Naogaon, needs the extra hands during the harvest like most large-scale farmers.\nIn the previous Aman season, he sold coarse paddy varieties at the rate of Tk800 for every 40kg (1 maund*). This time around, brokers scouting the neighbourhood are offering as much as Tk1,000.\nBut the yield this season has been disappointing. A storm in October ravaged the paddy fields, cutting down the output of every bigha of farmland (1 bigha = 33 decimals) by at least 200kg.\nAzizar could usually harvest around 3,200kg of paddy from his lands, but his final yield was only around 2,000kg.\n\"I had to buy seeds at Tk35 per kg. I spent money on fertilizers and insecticides. The market price of paddy is around Tk980-1000, this cannot cover my expenses. I could only make a profit if the price was Tk1,200 or more.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_244023\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Workers are seen drying paddy out on the floor of a rice processing mill Photo: Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nNurullah Miah, who brought his fresh harvest to a haat (weekly market) in Mohadevpur on December 2, said: \"Brokers usually offer low prices before the harvest. I brought my harvest to the haat so that I can directly sell to miller agents to fetch a higher price.\"\nHe complained that brokers and millers are the ones who control the price and reap the benefits when the rice is sold at higher prices in cities.\nNurul Islam, a broker at Mohadevpur haat, claimed buying the paddy before the harvest is the only way to make any profit.\nSeveral other brokers agreed, noting that they lack the facilities to stock paddy. Brokers make a profit of Tk10-50 for every 40kg of paddy when they sell to millers, who in turn make profits of Tk10 for every 40kg.\nThey also claim that paddy prices have risen because the millers' demand is always greater than the market supply. When compounded with the drop in supply due to disasters, the rice price hike is the result, according to several brokers.\n\"The government has fixed Tk39 per kg to buy Guti Swarna (coarse rice) from us, but after processing, it costs Tk41 per kg. We are now purchasing paddy at Tk1,013-1,020 for every 40kg,\" he added.\nMd Anisur Rahman, proprietor of Messers Tosiron Automatic Rice mill in Naogoan sadar, said the wholesalers in big cities and brokers who buy rice from the millers are the ones who manipulate the market price.\n\nDhaka's wholesalers, however, denied the allegation saying: \"A wholesaler in Dhaka can store 50-60 tons of rice at most. Auto rice mills can store at least 1,000 tons. You tell me who can hoard enough rice to manipulate the price,\" said Rafiqul Islam, organizing secretary of Babubazar and Badamtoli Wholesale Rice Market Owners' Association.\nThe market price does not establish that wholesalers and their agents are making a lot of profit. Sacks of 50kg of rice was bought at Tk1,950 in early December. The rice was sold at Tk41-45 in Dhaka, a profit of roughly Tk1-6.\nCurrently, retail price of coarse rice in Dhaka stands between Tk45-46 per kg\nDr Asaduzzaman, research fellow at Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, told the Dhaka Tribune that the rise in rice prices was to be expected due to the twofold floods and pest attack.\nHe, however, pointed out that the government acted promptly by cutting import duties to increase rice import to meet the shortfall, and the current erratic nature of the price is out of fear and speculation.\n\"Maybe farmers are afraid, and they are hoarding some. Maybe the millers also feel the same way and stockpiling,\" he observed.\n\"There is no denying the production loss this year. But if about two million tons of rice has already been imported - it is a record amount and far surpasses the estimated crop loss - the market must have been flooded with rice. The government should not have let permitted such a huge import of rice.\nThere should have been conditions on the importers to sell whenever the government asks. The state can always regulate, if it is willing,\" he added.\nA recent report by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecast that the Aman output in 2017 would stand at 13 million tons, down by 350,000 tons from 2016.\nFloods ruined 591,647 hectares of Aman paddy field in 32 districts last year, according to a government estimate.\nDhaka Tribune correspondents from Nilphamri, Naogaon, Sylhet, Narail, Habiganj and Chapainawabganj also reported pest attacks late in the Aman season.\nThroughout March-April, a series of flash floods hit the northeastern districts. The government admitted the Boro output would be some 450,000 tons less than the 19.1 million tons target.\nAccording the Ministry of Food, as of December 21, 2017, about 464,000 tons of rice was imported by the government and 1.705 million tons by private importers in the current fiscal year.\n \n\nAdditional reporting by Sazzadur Rahman Sazzad, Khondaker Md Abdur Rouf, and Md Faruk Hossain\nNote: In rural Bangladesh, paddy is usually measured and sold in bulk using the maund unit of measurement. 1 maund = 40kg. The metric system is used throughout the article\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-05-07 00:00:00      \nBangladesh is one of the most vulnerable nations when it comes to climate change. It has already observed seasonal variations due to the adverse effects of climate change. For instance, we hardly notice the spring season in Bangladesh anymore. There is hardly rain (like before) in the monsoon but, surprisingly, there is a good amount in winter. The temperature in the atmosphere is increasing alarmingly, and the pattern of rainfall has become unpredictable. Due to environmental degradation, Bangladesh encounters natural disasters like floods, cyclones, storms, sea level surges, riverbank erosion, earthquakes, intermittent droughts, salinity intrusion, tsunamis. There has also been a drastic drop in air quality, as well as frequent thunderstorms and hailstorms.    A report of BBS revealed that Bangladesh has lost Tk18,425 crore due to natural disasters from 2009 to 2014 -- while the total cost of damage and loss by hailstorms was Tk1,147.169cr. The latest deadly storms and lightning in different parts of Bangladesh reflect the wrath of nature. Every year, many people and animals are killed or injured by lightning. In Bangladesh, more than 80 people have been killed by thunderstorms and lightning in the last two months. This is a result of climate change. The air we breathe  Bangladesh has been repeatedly ranked as the most polluted and unliveable cities in the world. It is widely acknowledged by scientists that air pollution is one of the key effects of climate change. It not only fuels climate change, but is also a major threat to human health. It is one of the major environmental concerns in Bangladesh due to our inadequate and dysfunctional disposal sites that create acute health problems. The continuous inhalation of particulate matters consisting of dust, fumes, mist, and smoke cause long-term health problems such as chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease, and even damage to the brain, nerves, liver, or kidneys. Repeated exposure to air pollution affects children's lungs and can worsen or complicate medical conditions in the elderly. According to a World Bank report, 15,000 people are killed due to air pollution every year in Bangladesh. Among the top 10 causes of death in Bangladesh, five of them are: Lung cancer (13%), lower respiratory tract infections (7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7%), ischemic heart disease (6%), and stroke (5%) -- all related to air pollution.  According to the National Institute of Diseases of Chest and Hospital (NIDCH), nearly seven million people in Bangladesh suffer from asthma -- over half of them children. However, the big questions are: How can we curb air pollution? What are the causes of pollution? Who is responsible for such pollution? How are we responsible for this? A few decades ago, scientists began warning us. However, we were very reluctant to accept that human activities are responsible for climate change. But we continued to pollute the air with exhaust fumes and smoke from our vehicles, factories, and industries. We contribute to greenhouse gas emissions by burning fossil fuels, gasoline, diesel, and other fuels. In order to protect human lives and the environment, it is high time that we create public awareness of all these environmental issues Reckless activity Deforestation is another eminent reason for thunderstorms, which accelerate the greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere -- the heat generated by electricity production, unplanned and unregulated operations of brick-fields, frequent rain-forest fire calamities, industrial productions, black fume generation from the fuel burning engines like street-plying vehicles, water-vehicles, buses, and trains. All this has a monumental impact on the environment. In order to protect human lives and the environment, it is high time that we create public awareness of all these environmental issues via print and electronic media. These frequent deadly storms are yet another wake-up call for all of us. Last but not least, there are a few things that should be considered by policy-makers to save our environment. For example, people of all classes must be concerned with improving the sanitation system, minimizing waste generation, promoting recycling, improving the disposal system, increasing the number of landfills, sorting waste, and more. Moreover, relevant authorities should update the drainage system, impose taxes on polluters, reduce deforestation, and promote plantation by the roadsides without delay.

We do not know more than this. We just sell to our customers.\"\nOnion was sold on Tuesday at Tk60-70 per kg in many markets, the price for which was around Tk20-28 on same day last year, according to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).\nCoarse rice was sold at Tk35-38 per kg and fine rice at Tk55-68 per kg, while they were priced at Tk42-45 and Tk48-56 respectively, on the same day last year, TCB mentioned.\nPotato was sold at Tk20-25 per kg on Tuesday, price of which was Tk12-18 same time last year, TCB cited.\nWheat flour (atta) was sold at Tk28-38 and flour (moyda) at Tk45-48 per kg, prices of which were Tk26-34 and Tk38-40, respectively, at the same time in 2017.\n\nCinnamon was being sold Tk350-420 per kg as opposed to prices of Tk280-350 last year.\nFive litres of soybean oil were being sold at Tk510-535 as opposed to Tk465-500 same time last year.\nBeef was sold at Tk420-440 per kg last year as opposed to current prices of Tk480-500.\nMutton was being sold at Tk700-780 per kg, price for which was around Tk550-600 same time in 2017.\nLocal chicken local was being sold at Tk350-380 per kg but it had been sold at Tk330-360 last year.\nFull cream instant milk powder (Dano) was being sold at Tk580-600 as opposed to prices of Tk560-585 same time last year, TCB mentioned.\nThe year 2017 witnessed vast sufferings of the people in low and fixed income groups, with the added pressure of the recent floods in the northeastern districts of the country, and the recent Rohingya issue.\nResidents of Dhaka alleged that some unscrupulous businessmen created this situation in the market and drove up the prices by hoarding goods. Heavy rain and the recent flood resulted in crop damage and vegetable supply crunch multiplying woes of the people.\nTabassum Tania, a resident of Kalabagan in Dhaka, said: \"We have to survive and there is no alternative to buying these goods. We are bound to buy whatever the price is.\"\nAccording to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, food production dropped by 943,000 tons in FY2016-17. Due the recent flood, crops, vegetables, livestock and fish stocks, and household food reserves have taken a major hit.\nFloods and heavy rain damaged vegetables on 900 hectares of land for which farmers of 42 districts of the country suffered immensely.\nSM Nazer Hossain, vice-president of the Consumer Association of Bangladesh, said: \"Flood, the Rohingya issue, and the government's indifference are the causes behind these hike in prices.\n\"We are now especially dependent on India as we have become import dependent for these daily goods. That is why the prices have increased,\" he also said.\n\"The prices have gone up because of manipulation by some unscrupulous businessmen. The government could bring the prices down by giving subsidies and instructing the Food Ministry to sell these goods in the open market. But we did not see such steps,\" Nazer Hossain added.\nHe also said the government could sit with the people involved and look for alternative countries to India where prices for these goods are cheaper.\n\"The government should encourage farmers to cultivate more food and vegetables. They are not interested now to cultivate these following losses day after day. So the government must assist them directly and buy the food crops from them instead of third person,\" he further said.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "authors": "UNB",
      "text": "Date Published:2018-11-20 00:00:00      \nSome 93% of education sector's requirement for Rohingya emergency remained unmet in 2017 International support is vital for countries like Bangladesh to make the shift towards inclusive education ensuring literacy for Rohingyas living in Bangladesh. The statement was made in the new global- The 2019 Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report - Migration, displacement and education: Building Bridges, Not Walls- published by Unesco on Tuesday. Bangladesh is one of only two countries in the list of top 10 host countries not providing inclusive education to refugees, though Bangladesh officially does not term Rohingyas as refugees, the report said. Some 93% of the education sector's $26 million requirement for the Rohingya emergency in Bangladesh was not met in 2017, while the food security sector exceeded its target. The report analysed the impact of the movement of people on education systems but also the impact education can have, supporting societies to respond to the challenges and opportunities posed by migration and displacement. Among the top 10 countries hosting refugees, Bangladesh has so far excluded Rohingyas from its national education system, while Pakistan has had an ambivalent stance, the report said mentioning that even there, one of the provinces, Balochistan, includes refugees in its education plan. Between the end of August 2017 and early May 2018, around 800,000 Rohingyas arrived in Cox's Bazar district fleeing targeted violence in Rakhine state, Myanmar. Over 90% resides in spontaneous and makeshift settlements or host communities in over 1,600 locations in Cox's Bazar, a district close to the Myanmar border. The government of Bangladesh also has come a long way in changing its approach, the report observed. For decades, Bangladesh refused to recognize the majority of Rohingya residing in the country as refugees since 1978. Bangladesh, according to the report, was reluctant about addressing their education needs, did not accept international assistance, to the extent that it would dismantle centres set up by humanitarian organisations, and it was sensitive on the language of instruction. In 2016, Bangladesh revised its Strategy for Myanmar Refugees and Undocumented Myanmar Nationals, listing education as an intervention area for the first time. This encouraged humanitarian efforts and sensitised local authorities before the massive influx. The report has not only listed problems but also collected evidence from all over the world about changes of heart. It mentioned that governments are rapidly embracing the inclusion of refugees in their education systems. Bangladesh, along with Malaysia and Thailand, has not ratified key treaty commitments to non-discrimination, the report said. Without this legal status and protection, Rohingya children are often denied access to education. Instead, education for refugees continues to be in separate, community-based or private schools, which may or may not be certified. The report cited the government's reluctance to support non-UN agencies providing language services during the Rohingya crisis, a key element for inclusion. Globally, only a third of the funding gap for refugee education has been filled. Had the international community used only humanitarian aid, then a tenfold increase in the share education receives would have been necessary to meet refugees' education needs, the report stated. The report called for development aid to help fill the gap and provide much needed long-term and predictable resources to national education systems for supporting refugees and host communities.  Director of the Report Manos Antoninis said considerable changes are being made in countries from Chad and Uganda to Lebanon and Turkey to let refugees attend school alongside with nationals, which they are not yet seeing in Bangladesh, Pakistan or Thailand. Antoninis said: \"Positive steps were taken to list education as an intervention area for the first time in 2016, but the government must now lead on that initiative and stop treating refugees differently.\" \"Bangladesh is signing up to the two new global compacts on refugees and migrants which shows that they recognize education as an opportunity. We hope this will be a much-awaited turning point away from discrimination in education,\" the director added. Internal Migrants & Slums Mass migration to slums has left millions without basic services, including public education in Bangladesh. Out of school rates for children and adolescents in Bangladeshi slums in 2016 were twice as high as in other urban areas, the report says. A slum settlement survey in Dhaka, Bangladesh, showed that there were fewer than 300 government primary schools in slums, and only about one-quarter of slums were estimated to have a government school. These needs are going to grow, the report said mentioning that a government census showed that, between 1997 and 2014, slums increased from 3,000 to 14,000. Globally, the 2019 GEM Report estimates that there could be 80 million more children in slums, equivalent to 2.6 million classrooms of children by 2030. Internal Migrants & Seasonal Workers In Bangladesh, more than 2.6 million rural migrant workers were employed in construction outside the agricultural seasons in 2010. Such seasonal migration can disrupt education and expose children to child labour and workplace hazards, forcing them to leave school. Internally Displaced Earthquakes, storms, floods and rising sea level damage 900 schools each year in Bangladesh, on average. A household and school survey around the time of the 2004 flood showed that, while 30% of schools closed at some point because of flooding, about 15% closed for two weeks or more. Affected schools were closed an average of seven days more than in the previous year. Attendance was one-third lower of schools that were open on affected days. The report praised the government's aim to make its education systems prepared and responsive to such disasters. The report recommended protecting the right to education of migrants and displaced people, include migrants and displaced people in the national education system, understand and plan for the education needs of migrants and displaced people, and represent migration and displacement histories in education accurately to challenge prejudices. The report suggested initiatives to prepare teachers of migrants and refugees to address diversity and hardship, harness the potential of migrants and displaced people, and support education needs of migrants and displaced people in humanitarian and development aid."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-05-20 00:00:00      \nThe influx of refugees is wreaking havoc on the environment through the depletion of natural resources Accommodating nearly a million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar is taking a significant toll on the environment. As the Rohingyas cut down trees for timber and firewood, the forests of Cox's Bazar are at immediate risk. The United Nations' Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) published a report which said the Rohingya refugees collect 700 tons of firewood every day. In order to acquire that much timber on a daily basis, forestland equal to the combined size of four football fields would have to be cut down. So far, around 2,000 hectares of forestland has disappeared. The Energy and Environment Technical Working Group of the ISCG expressed concern that the entire forestland of Cox's Bazar is likely disappear by 2019, if the current rate of deforestation continues unabated.   The humanitarian crisis is well on its way to a rapidly escalating environmental crisis as landslides and flash floods are becoming more and more frequent. The rapid and extensive deforestation has led to destruction of key watersheds causing mass erosion, landslides, flash floods, and a dramatic reduction in the recharge of ground water reserves, the report said. The Cox's Bazar area is undergoing heavy loss of topsoil and an increased risk of flash floods due to denuded slopes and hillsides.     According to the report, 86% of drinking water wells have been contaminated with hazardous bacteria E.coli from unmanaged faecal matter. Irrigation wells are not functioning due to watershed destruction and diminished water table. Agricultural lands near the refugee camps have been facing siltation and contamination from faecal matter. Massive cooking activities and garbage burning are increasing the level of air pollution. The report estimates that at least 1,500 hectares of wildlife habitat have been eradicated so far. Wild Asian elephants and other species have lost their habitats and had their natural lives disrupted. Besides, the influx of refugees has depleted marine resources due to overfishing and destructive practices. The increase in the number of fishing vessels using harmful techniques has disrupted the reproductive cycle of key species and has had detrimental impact on fish stocks.  The report says the situation requires creating awareness among fishing communities on legal standards and fishing regulations (seasonal bans and appropriate technology) as well as providing alternative income generating opportunities.  Furthermore, it recommends immediate action like providing alternative clean fuel like LPG to the Rohingyas to avoid the total loss of forestland."

The reserves dropped to $31.93 billion from $33.36 billion between February 28 and March 8, according to the central bank.\nOfficials of the central bank say import costs have increased, particularly after the rise in onion and rice prices in India. Moreover, the reserves took a hit after clearing payment for imports of Asian Clearing Union (ACU).\nA Bangladesh Bank official says there is no reason to panic at the decline of the reserves mainly because of a rise in import cost. \"It will be possible to foot import bills for the next six to seven months with the current reserves,\" the official added.\nAccording to the central bank, the import cost increased by 25.78% in the first six months of the 2017-18 fiscal compared to the same period the previous year. During July to December, food import (rice and wheat) increased by 212%.\nThe import of necessary machinery for setting up industries rose by about 35% during this period while the import of fuel oil and raw material for industries increased by 28% and 15% respectively.\nIn the first six months of this year, Letters of Credit (LC) worth $40 billion were opened. The amount is expected to cross $60 billion at the yearend.\nBangladesh's foreign currency reserves stood at $33.01 billion on June 21 last year. It came down to $32.31 billion on January 17 this year.\nThe country was witnessing a rise in forex reserves over the last few years but the import cost jumped in the election year, putting pressure on the reserves. However, remittance inflow and export income are increasing.\nBangladesh Institute of Development Studies researcher Dr Zaid Bakht said there was no reason to panic even though the forex reserves had declined a little due to increased import cost.\n\"The works of some big projects like Padma Bridge and metro rail are going on in full swing. The cost for importing necessary equipment for these projects is increasing,\" he noted.\n\"On the other hand, the import of foodgrains increased after floods destroyed crops. This is also putting pressure on the reserves,\" he added.\nInternational standards require a country to have reserves to meet import costs of at least three months. With Bangladesh's current reserves, it will be possible to meet foot import bills of more than eight months.\nMeanwhile, a big balance of payment deficit has emerged with the increase in import costs. In the first six months of the current fiscal, the amount stood at $4.767 billion.\nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-09-30 00:00:00      \nBRAC University is providing a three-year course to train midwives to improve maternal and neonatal health services in Bangladesh  Scores of midwives are working in the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar to ensure health security, deliver babies and help young mothers. About 148 midwives, who completed a diploma course under the Developing Midwives Project from Brac University,are working in the camps to deal with any critical situation, provide treatment to pregnant women and newborn babies.  They also provide emergency services for those affected by sexually transmitted diseases and sexual violence, and family planning for the displaced Rohingya community, said Dr Sharmina Rahman, strategy adviser of the project. The midwives from Brac University have so far delivered about 3,200 babies in the last six months, she said. Midwives working in the Kutubkhali Rohingya campsaid initially the Rohingya women did not want to meet doctors fearing that sensitive issues will become public.  But the situation has changed now, said Nazma Akter, a midwife who works at the Lambashia Brac village in the Kutubkhali camp.  \"Rohingya women now trust midwives as they know that we are helping them secure their health,\" she said. Language also acts as a barrier for the midwives to reach the Rohingya women, said Nazma, who completed a three-year diploma in midwifery education under the Developing Midwives Project at James P Grant School of Public Health of Brac University.  Brac University supplies midwives to the Hope Foundation that provides healthcare to underserved women and children across the country as well as Rohingyas. The foundation's Country Director Commander (Rtd) SM Ferdousuzzaman said midwives are working tirelessly in field camps to provide basic healthcare needs to the refugee population.  \"Midwives in Hope clinics have been providing maternal, newborn, and women's healthcare to ensure basic women's rights and healthcare to the Rohingya women,\" he said. Ferdous added that midwives are also working very intensively with pregnant Rohingya women who were tortured and mentally traumatized. However, he admitted that even with limited number of midwives, Hope Foundation is ensuring qualitative and successful healthcare to the Rohingya people. The midwives are working as part of a national program backed by the Bangladesh government and supported by UNFPA and the World Health Organization to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality, particularly in rural areas. The midwives at the Rohingya camps have been trained for crisis situation, including floods. The Developing Midwives Project has been implementing a three-year diploma in midwifery education under James P Grant School of Public Health, Brac University with a vision to improve maternal and neonatal health services in Bangladesh since April 2012 with UK Aid funding from the UK government. It has targeted to train 1,317 midwives by 2021."

The decision was taken at a meeting of the National Task force formed to implement the \"Mother ilish protection campaign 2018\" held on Sunday with Fisheries and Livestock Minister Narayon Chandra Chanda in the chair, reports UNB citing a PID handout. The objective of the restriction from October 7 to October 28 is to save mother ilish which lays eggs during the period.  There will be a ban on catching of all kinds of fish in the rivers of 37 districts during the period, the handout said. At the meeting, the minister urged all, including fishermen and fishermen's associations, to help make the countrywide program a success. "

      "text": "Date Published:2018-12-17 00:00:00      \nPlastic waste constitutes more than 60% of the litter found in the beaches of Bangladesh, according to a survey Bangladesh, as a part of the South Asian Seas (SAS) region, currently faces the worst case scenario of sea pollution due to plastic - one of the worst pollutants that are harming the seas and oceans around the world.Marine litter or debris, which include plastic wastes, are the persistent, manufactured, processed solid material found in marine and coastal areas - predominantly the result of poor waste management - is a fundamental problem due to its harmful effect on the environment, wildlife and human health in the Bay of Bengal, says a country report based on the reviews of scientific and policy documents together with a recent preliminary survey on marine litter along four beaches of Bangladesh.The report, titled \"National Status including Database, Proposed Recycling Enterprise and Interventions on Marine Litter,\" is the outcome of a South Asian Seas Program (SASP) called the Preparation of Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the SAS region.The Department of Environment under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change prepared the report, is the first of its kind in Bangladesh, with technical support from the South Asia Cooperative Environment Programme (SACEP) and funding from the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep).According to the report, marine litter reaches the ocean from the land through river runoff, drainage system, wind action and intentional or unintentional discharge of materials in the sea due to human activities.A total of 6,705 pieces of waste products were found on a 18.5km stretch of the four sea beaches - Laboni and Inani in Cox's Bazar, and Ananda Bazar and Patenga in Chittagong - in Bangladesh during the survey.Among the litter, 63% were found to be plastic, 13% foamed plastic, 2% cloth, 1% glass and ceramic, 1% metal, 9% paper and cardboard, 3% rubber, 1% wood, and 7% other materials.Plastic bags were found to be the most common type of litter: at least 2,182 pieces of plastic bags were found on the beaches. The survey also found 589 pieces of insulation and packaging foam, 470 pieces of cigarette butts and filters, and 300 bottles.The survey also found bottle caps and lids, drums, jerry cans, buckets, disposable utensils, straws, stirrers, drink packaging, food containers, bags, gloves, cigarette lighters, syringes, baskets, crates and trays, mesh bags, fishing gear, and many other kinds of plastic waste on the four beaches.The report made a number of recommendations to bring down and control the reckless dumping of plastic waste on the beaches. Origin and impactsAccording to the report, there are two sources of marine litter: sea and land.The sea-based sources include merchant ships, ferries and cruise liners, fishing vessels, offshore oil and gas platforms, and fish farming installations, while the land-based ones include sewage, municipal and industrial wastes.Around 80% of the litter on the beaches, including industrial products and waste, come from the second source.Most of the industries in Bangladesh are situated near the major river systems such as the Buriganga, Shitalakkhya, Balu, Turag, Karnaphuli, Rupsa, and Meghna - all of which end up in the Bay of Bengal.These industries directly dispose their industrial waste into these rivers without proper management, which ultimately end up in the Bay.Globally, plastic is one of the most dangerous pollutants for seas and oceans. It is directly affecting the ecology and biodiversity of the oceans because of its non-biodegradable nature.Plastic lasts up to a 1,000 years, and accounts for nearly 90% of the debris in the oceans around the world. Plastic also kills up to one million sea birds and 100,000 sea mammals and countless fish every year.Also, plastic litter breaks into small pieces called microplastic, which affects many species, including seabirds, marine mammals and fish through entanglement and ingestion, and humans after entering the food chain. Microplastic beads can also cause cancer in humans.  Experts and DoE's takeThe Department of Environment (DoE), together with other government and non-government agencies, have introduced many policies and strategies to control the plastic pollution over the years.\"It is the duty of the city corporations and municipalities to properly manage waste, not the DoE's,\" said Dr Fahmida Khanom, DoE director of natural resource management and research, regarding the report. \"We can ask them to collect the waste and keep the beaches, seas and ultimately the environment clean. But what we ultimately need is productive coordination among all the authorities responsible for waste management across the country.\"She further said: \"This is the first study we have prepared. The results do seem bad, but it is the starting point of something good.\"Prof Md Kawser Ahmed of Dhaka University oceanography department, who was a consultant in the survey, said: \"We surveyed only macroplastic in the beach areas, not underwater. We still do not know the microplastic scenario. We need to conduct a lot more large-scale studies to know the underwater pollution and microplastic situation.\"Environment and Social Development Organization (ESDO) Secretary General Dr Shahriar Hossain added that there was no alternative other than banning plastic from all stages in society. \"As long as it's not, we should manage our waste properly. Single use plastic materials should also be banned immediately.\"In 2002, Bangladesh became the world's first country to ban thinner plastic bags after they were found to have choked the drainage system during devastating floods. All types of production, marketing, carrying, and using of plastic bags were made a punishable crime.However, they are still widely used, ignoring the ban.Measures and recommendationsThe report recommended formulating different strategies and action plans at the regional, national and local levels to minimize the impact of plastic wastes and other marine litter.The 3R's - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle - policy has achieved much attention of many countries in tackling the issue, according to the report. Two other R's - Refuse and Redesign - were also added recently to the policy.The National 3R Strategy for Waste Management was launched in Bangladesh in 2010. The city corporations and municipalities are making efforts to incorporate the concepts and guidance of this strategy in improving their solid waste management activities.Similar strategies should be initiated and implemented on an urgent basis for better management of marine litter in the country, the report said.It also recommended raising awareness about littering through academic activities and information campaigns to convey the effect of littering - near the marine areas as well as in general - to the public and initiate a long-term behavioural change."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-08-16 00:00:00      \nOnions, the most consumed spice in the country, are a quintessential ingredient in many popular Bangladeshi delicacies, especially ones involving meat Every year as the second most celebrated Muslim festival, Eid-ul-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice), approaches, cost of two of the most essential elements of the festival- cows and onions- most certainly skyrocket in Bangladesh regardless of their flow in the market.  Onions, the most consumed spice in the country, are a quintessential ingredient in many popular Bangladeshi delicacies, especially ones involving meat. The demand for it is always high--but it multiplies twofold during festivals like Eid-ul-Adha, as does its price.  The Bangladeshi grocery market, known for being perennially unstable, predominantly offers two varieties of onions- homegrown and Indian - with the price of the former variety being comparatively higher than the latter.  Like every year, both the homegrown and imported onions have seen a sudden surge in prices ahead of Eid and marked a big rise in wholesale and retail markets of Dhaka over the last few days. The hike would be understandable if the supply of onions in the market were intermittent or halted like last season, when the production of onions in India went down due to a severe drought, which in turn increased the prices both in India and in Bangladesh. The prices saw yet another increase after torrential rain caused floods in several states of India last year, further pushing the onion price to Tk120-130 per kg in most markets throughout Bangladesh. The fluctuating onion prices in the Indian market and the resulting minimum export price (MEP) usually affects onion prices in Bangladesh due to the short supply of local production and the higher import costs of Indian onions. Nevertheless, in February the Indian government completely removed the minimum export price (MEP) on onions and as of 2016, the Bangladeshi government withdrew all taxes on onion import aiming to keep prices stable in the local market, according to sources at Benapole Customs House, which eventually should have brought the price down.   But defying the rule of economics, the price just kept increasing for most of the year. Compared to January, 2017, the price of onions has increased by at least Tk20 to Tk25 in January this year. \"Each ton of onion is being imported at a cost of $205 (Tk17, 200). So the import cost of each kg is Tk18 and on top of that, transport costing is Tk2 per kg,\" Rafiqul Islam Royal, owner of Royal Enterprise, a Benapole-based clearing and forwarding agent, said, \"Adding to that, the price is being hiked in the local market because of the shortage.\"  Benapole port authorities said that 4,738 tons of onions were imported into the country from India through the land port in the last six days (until August 13). Yet, the Indian onion is being sold in local markets at Tk35 per kg while the local variety is being sold at Tk55-60 per kg.  Behind this fake crisis-driven price hike is a money-grubbing syndicate, according to Shaheen Reza, an onion importer, who controls the commodity price in the local market. Despite all the endeavors by both governments, consumers from this side of the border failed to reap the benefits of the adjustments because of this syndicate, since some unscrupulous businessmen known for increasing the onion price, cash in on the situation. \"We sell onion to the wholesalers after keeping a minimum profit, but they sell these to others keeping a huge margin,\" he said, adding that the authorities should ensure a strong market.  Market sources also blamed lax monitoring for the sudden surge in onion prices.  According to the sources from the Commerce Ministry, Bangladesh has an annual demand of 2,200,000 to 2,500,000 metric tons of onions. Last season, the country produced 1,750,000 metric tons of onions, while the deficit of around 700,000 metric tons is usually covered through imports. A study conducted by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), predicted that the demand for onions is expected to increase by 51 percent this decade--from 1.23 million metric tons in 2010 to 1.86 million metric tons in 2020--under the business-as-usual scenario, while under an optimistic income growth scenario, it's expected to increase by 69 percent to 2.08 million metric tons. Under the circumstances, it is now imperative for Bangladesh to decrease dependency on India for onion import and vulnerability to climate-induced losses by importing onions from alternative sources. However, a careful assessment of the impacts of onion imports on prices to avoid reducing prices - so much so that they become a disincentive for Bangladeshi farmers to produce onion - is also a prerequisite.  The IFPRI study recommended that the government ensure a structured and regulated flow of the locally produced onions by being vigilant against speculative storage between September and December, when Bangladesh is most dependent on onion imports. They also suggested that in order to mitigate the dependency on onion imports, steps must be taken to increase domestic production. "

      "text": "Date Published:2018-10-09 00:00:00      \nThe prime minister said the government in its National Integrated Multimodal Transport Policy has put forward a strategy that will seek to strengthen the position of inland waterways in the transport system Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday underscored the need for proper utilization of the maritime sector for massive socioeconomic development of the people of this region. \"There is a huge potential in the maritime sector in South Asia and utilizing the sector, it is possible to make a big lead into the socioeconomic development of the people of this region,\" she said while addressing the inaugural session of the Second South Asia Maritime and Logistics Forum 2018 at a hotel in Dhaka, reports BSS. \"We don't think only about our own country, we also give importance to the socioeconomic development of all people of this region through regional cooperation and maintaining contact,\" the premier said. Sheikh Hasina said her government is committed to improving navigability of the rivers and ensuring safe and secure river routes for transportation of people and goods. \"Initiatives have been undertaken to dredge the rivers to maintain navigability,\" she said. The Ministry of Shipping in cooperation with the Colombo International Maritime Conference Events and India's Gateway Media Pvt Ltd has jointly organized the two-day event to attract investment in the infrastructure and innovation of new technology in the shipping sector. Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan, Indian Union Minister for Shipping and Road Transport Mansukh Mandaviya, Sri Lankan State Minister for National Policy and Economic Affairs Dr Harsha De Silva, Editor-in-Chief of India's Gateway Media Pvt Ltd Ram Prasad Ravi and Bangladesh's Shipping Secretary Md Abdus Samad also spoke at the function. A short audio-video presentation on Bangladesh's maritime sector was screened at the function. Pointing out that water transport is low-cost, energy-efficient and environment-friendly; Sheikh Hasina said restoring the primacy of inland water transport as a logical and competitive mode of transportation is one of the key priorities for the government. \"We've taken steps to reopen the closed river routes,\" she said, adding dredging is highly economically justified for Bangladesh.  According to experts, she said, savings of transportation costs of cargo resulting from the use of water transport rather than road are estimated at Tk7.5 billion whereas the cost of dredging is estimated at Tk0.6 billion per annum. The prime minister said the government in its National Integrated Multimodal Transport Policy has put forward a strategy that will seek to strengthen the position of inland waterways in the transport system. \"As Bangladesh is dubbed as the country of rivers, it is also famous for building river crafts,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the shipbuilding industry flourished here in the ancient time and in continuation of the past, shipbuilding industry shows the path renew of the past glory. \"The ships built in Bangladesh are being exported to various countries including, Denmark, Germany and Poland,\" she said. Quoting statistics, Sheikh Hasina said that the total import-export through waterways was 43.17 million metric tons in the fiscal year 2010-11 which has increased to 73.21 million metric tons in the fiscal year 2016-17. \"With the support of multilateral and bilateral development partners, we will scale up our investments to provide sustained navigability of our waterways, modernize existing river ports, build new ports and inland container depots to improve cargo and passenger handling, and ensure efficiency and safety of all vessels plying our waters,\" she said. Noting that Bangladesh is the largest delta of the world, the premier said its river and floodplains, which make up 80% of the country, support life, livelihoods and the economy. The prime minister said the country faces major inter-related delta challenges in water safety, food security and socio-economic development and is prone to natural calamities such as floods, cyclones, and droughts. Sheikh Hasina said there is already high pressure on the available land and water resources in the delta. She said the government of Bangladesh, in cooperation with the government of the Netherlands, has prepared and endorsed the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. \"One of the main components of Delta Plan is to accelerate the GDP growth through proper utilization of water resources,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh is a country of boundless potentials. \"In the water transport sector, new business opportunities exist such as the development of container transport at home and abroad, as well as the further expansion of dredging programs, ferry services, port management and operations by the private sector,\" she said."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-07-12 00:00:00      \nPhotos posted on social media purportedly showed houses and farmland covered in water and mud after the Panjshir River broke its banks At least 10 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed in a remote area of northeastern Afghanistan after melting snow triggered a landslide, officials said Thursday. A mountain lake in Panjshir, a province north of Kabul known for its snowcapped peaks, overflowed and sent water and mud cascading over Peshghor village, Omar Mohammadi, spokesman for the disaster management ministry, told AFP. Jamil Ahmad was lying in bed just before midnight when he said he heard a sound like \"jets\" flying overhead. \"Somebody shouted 'Flood!' and I ran away with my family to higher ground,\" Ahmad told AFP by telephone.   \"The people started firing (weapons) into the air to warn others about the flood.\" The water and mud had inundated most of the houses in the village, and destroyed a religious school, two mosques and the main market, Ahmad said. \"Three women from my neighbourhood and two labourers who didn't hear the warning were taken away by the flood,\" Ahmad said. Villagers had been worried about the possibility of landslides after several days of increasingly warm weather, Ahmad said. Most survivors were staying on higher ground for fear of more, he added.   Photos posted on social media purportedly showed houses and farmland covered in water and mud after the Panjshir River broke its banks. Villagers using shovels and other tools were desperately searching for survivors in the debris as rescue teams were deployed to the area, Mohammadi said. \"We have deployed everything at hand to help the people,\" he said. \"Some people are missing.\" Disasters such as avalanches and flash floods often hit in mountainous areas of Afghanistan as snow melts in the spring and summer. It is made worse by deforestation. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who is in Brussels for the Nato summit, said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the latest natural disaster. \"A number of people have lost their lives\" in the landslide, Ghani said in a statement. He ordered \"relevant authorities to provide urgent assistance to the affected people.\" The landslide comes as the country is in the grip of a nearly 17-year war between Afghan security forces and the Taliban.

      "text": "Date Published:2018-05-14 00:00:00      \nGDIC Deputy Senior Vice President (Underwriting Management) Ali Tareque Parvez spoke to the Dhaka Tribune's Syed Samiul Basher Anik and Mahadi Al Hasnat about their hopes for the project Bangladeshi farmers are vulnerable to climate change induced adverse weather events, such as unseasonal and heavy rainfall, droughts, and floods. These can all destroy crops, endangering their livelihoods. To help farmers secure themselves financially against such risks, Green Delta Insurance Company Limited (GDIC) is piloting a new project called \"Weather Index Based Agriculture Insurance\". The project was recently awarded third prize and a grant of US$12,000 at Inclusion Plus, a global competition from Metlife Foundation that recognizes entrepreneurs who scale up innovative projects aimed at accelerating financial inclusion in the country. Why did you create 'Weather Index Based Agriculture Insurance'? In Bangladesh, 45% of the population - or about 72 million people - depend on agriculture, (but) devastating weather and climate change are affecting this sector and our poor farmers are suffering.  Agricultural crises still cause complete losses of livelihoods, whereupon people migrate to urban centres in search for work. We are determined to solve the adverse weather issues and protect our farmers from losses. Weather Index Based (WIB) Agriculture Insurance is something that might mitigate farmers' risks (so) GDIC and International Finance Corporation (IFC) of World Bank Group joined hands to develop and deploy insurance products to address weather-related risks faced by both lenders and farmers in Bangladesh. How does the product connect with the farmers? The product is purely customer feedback driven. GDIC Agri Teams work across Bangladesh, regularly visiting farmers and identifying (their) risks and needs. Farmers receive a Bangla SMS every week with weather forecasts and crop advisory as a value added service. There is a call center with free calls for the farmers (and) GDIC also does yard meetings with farmers to raise their awareness. After designing and implementing the product we do yard meetings and awareness programs to identify the best solution for farmers. Throughout the policy period we monitor weather data in that location and give updates if any trigger is locked for claims.  How do affected farmers make a claim? Data monitoring and claim management is based on regular data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department and will be done by an Indian company called Skymet Weather Services. With the automated claim monitoring facility, farmers do not even report for loss to GDIC to claim the insurance.   WIB Agriculture Insurance has given out claims to more than 3,000 farmers for crop damage due to weather, equipping them to bounce back and reinvest for the next season.  Which crops are covered under the pilot? Under the WIB project, we have designed products for several crops, like cassava, industrial potato, hybrid rice seeds, cucumber, bitter gourd, tomato, peanuts, mung beans and rice.  We are capable of designing insurance for any crop in any season across Bangladesh using historical weather data from 1981, and satellite data. This is a totally new concept for Bangladeshi market.  How do you define innovation?  Innovation is the actions required to create new ideas, processes or products which when implemented lead to positive, effective change. Innovation also implies a value system which seeks to derive a positive outcome from the inventive act. The first step of innovation is identifying the opportunity, challenge or problem. However, innovation is sometimes challenging because if you are thinking out of the box, sometimes it is not accepted or welcomed. A person has to be creative and a dreamer to be innovative. Training can help, but without creativity it will not work. The financial industry is always looking for innovative products to change the tradition. Any innovation which can give more benefit is important for the industry. What is the future for this product? Bangladesh is now in the path to economic and social development. A strong economy needs to drive innovation forward or it will not reach the target. So a country like Bangladesh need lots of sustainable products for its financial strength. GDIC is working on more digitalization and bundling this insurance with agriculture microfinance, seed bag germination, crop clinic, input, debit card for input purchase, bank loan and portfolio level products.

Over the last 15 years, quantities of 10 species of fishes have drastically decreased and are on the verge of extinction.  According to the Fisheries Department, in 2000-01 the total number of fish caught from inland water bodies was 1,475,039 tons and in 2016-17 the figure rose to 3,496,958 tons. Data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Bangladesh show the number of country's threatened fish species in 2015 as 64, compared to 54 in 2000, showing about an 18.5% increase in threat to different species of fish.  The globally recognized Red List 2015 made by the IUCN said 253 species were assessed, of which, 64 have been found close to extinction - 25.3% of the total. The threatened fish comprise of nine species as critically endangered, 30 as endangered and 25 species as vulnerable. Twenty seven species were assessed as Near Threatened (NT), 122 species as Least Concern (LC) and the other 40 were considered Data Deficient (DD).  However, in IUCN's previous assessment in 2000, it was seen that266 species of fish were assessed, of which, 54 were considered as threatened.  Among the assessed, 12 species were Critically Endangered (CR), 28 were Endangered (EN), 14 species were Vulnerable (VU), 66 species were Data Deficient (DD) and thebalance 146 species were considered as Not Threatened (NT). Around 53% of the threatened fish belongs to carps, barbs and loaches (Order Cypriniformes), followed by catfish (Siluriformes) and perches (Perciformes).  Fisheries experts have blamed over exploitation and excess use of pesticides for agriculture as major causes of depleting the variation of indigenous fish resources.  \"This situation is not only in Bangladesh, but across the world,\" said Dr Mokhlesur Rahman, executive director of Centre for Natural Resources Studies (CNRS). Regarding the increase in the amount of total inland fish catches, he said: \"This is a clear result of initiatives, taken to increase culture fishes.\" Faruk, a fish wholesaler from Natore said: \"The fish I mostly trade comes from cultured fish like carps- Ruhi, Katla and others.  Local fish like Tengra that come to the market are cultured, these days.\" Dhaka Tribune's local correspondents have reported the availability of indigenous fishes in the regional marketfrom different districts. In most cases, the correspondents said the availability of indigenous or local fish species are now rare, and cultured fish have filled in their places. Local people expressed their dissatisfaction for not getting enough of indigenous fish in the market as these taste better. 76-year-old Asgar Ali from Nilphamari expressed his helplessness by saying: \"Even 30 years back, there was plenty of fish that we got from any wetland after the floods.  \"People caught fish together. That was a spectacular scenario. We dried a large part of them to be used later.\" The current generation will not believe it.\"  "

The data also confirmed that the industries sector is making the most impact on this projected growth.\nOn Tuesday, Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal highlighted the growth in the Industries sector during a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.\nAccording to the minister, the projected growth in the industries sector for this FY is 11.99%. Contribution of this particular sector to the GDP has increased by 2% compared to the previous FY, which was 10.22%.\nAccording to sources, contribution of this sector in the GDP has exceeded 32%. Bangladesh currently has around 1,000,000 small and medium industries.\nThese SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) are contributing to 23% of the GDP and providing 80% of the total employment opportunities in this sector.\nSpeaking to the correspondent, Research Director at the Center for Policy Dialogue (CPD), Khandaker Golam Moazzem said: \"The BBS data clearly highlights the industries sector's huge contribution to the GDP.\n\"Growth in all three types of industries, large, medium and small, is quite good compared to the previous FY.

Projects such as Padma Multipurpose Bridge and Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit Development have provided a boost to development activities.\"\nBangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) Research Director and also Agrani Bank Chairman Dr Zaid Bakht believes that the industries sector is making a huge positive impact on the GDP growth.\nSpeaking to the correspondent, he said: \"Government investment has increased in this FY, which also caused the private investments to go up. Import of industry machinery and raw materials has increased. These factors are contributing to the GDP growth.\"\nAccording to the data revealed by the planning minister, the projected GDP growth for the current fiscal year is 7.65%. As part of the prediction, the agriculture and the service sectors would see 3.06% and 6.33% growth respectively, while the industries sector would achieve 11.99% growth.\nSources from the BBS pointed out that in the previous FY, the agriculture sector witnessed a growth of 2.9%, industries sector of 10.22% and service sector of 6.69%.\nEmployment and labour force\nThe labour force survey report by the BBS revealed that a total of 3,700,000 people gained employment in FY 2016-2017.\nIn the industries sector, only 200,000 people gained employment during the same period.\nAccording to the bureau, the growth of new employment opportunities in the industries sector has been slow so far.\nIn 2013, this sector employed around 12,100,000 people, which stood at around 12,200,000 in the FY 2015-16, and 12,400,000 in the FY 2016-17.\nThe BBS report further stated that among the effective workforce of around 109,100,000 people, around 2,680,000 currently remain unemployed.\nA total of 1,400,000 people have achieved \"paid employment\" status and another 1,000,000 found jobs and work abroad.

Maidul and Saiful, two local residents, said a herd of elephants had crossed the border Sunday night, destroying crops and causing disturbance.  As the locals tried to drive them away, they witnessed an elephant falling down near the border. BGB Baraibari camp Company Commander Subedar Shafik confirmed the incident, telling reporters that a dead elephant had been spotted near the 1067/6S pillar area. He added that the cause of its death could not be determined, but the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) had been informed and would retrieve its body soon.  There have been a number of similar incidents in the areas near the Bangladesh-India border over the last several years, where Indian wild elephants have strayed into Bangladesh - sometimes entering human habitats. Some of these stray elephants died or were killed in conflict with humans.  Shortage of food and destruction of habitats, as well as natural disasters such as floods, forced the elephants to venture out and into human territory, according to forest officials.  The governments of Bangladesh and India have been in talks to create safe \"corridors\" for wild elephants to ensure trans-boundary conservation of the elephants.  However, the last bilateral talk between the forest and wildlife officials of thetwo countrieson wild elephant conservation took place in July 2017. "

Bangladesh Navy has been tasked with the rehabilitation efforts.\nEach of the total 1,440 houses under construction will be four feet high from the ground, in order to protect the refugees from the high tidal waves.\nThe process to construct 120 cyclone shelters in Bhashan Char is also underway.\nThe ground floor of the cyclone shelters is four feet above the ground and the first floor is 10 feet above the ground floor.\nAs a result, the refugees on the first floor of the shelters should be safe from tidal surges with a height of 14 feet.\nConstruction work of a 13km flood defence embankment is in progress on the island to shield it from tidal surges, with a height of three metres and width of 37 metres on a layer by layer basis.\nThe construction work is likely to be completed within the next rainy season. Moreover, construction work of a 2.1-km long shore protection is also in the process.\nWork for other establishments including security houses and administrative building is also on-going.\nApart from these, process is underway for purchasing and manufacturing necessary water vehicles to rescue the people inhabiting the island during any natural calamity.\n[caption id=\"attachment_228021\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Bhashan Char is located 21 nautical miles from Noakhali, 11 nautical miles from Jahajir Char, 4.2 nautical miles from Sandwip, 28 nautical miles from Patenga, and 13.2 nautical miles from Hatiya Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\n \nRohingya families at grave risk of landslide and flood\nNearly 1,33,649 Rohingyas of 31,441 families are at risk of landslide, while 69,351 Rohingyas of 16,375 families are susceptible to flood risks.\nOf them, some 50,000 Rohingyas have already been relocated to safer places.\nAbout 123 acres of land on the north-west side of Kutupalong extension camp under Ukhiya upazila have already been selected as a safe location for relocating the Rohingyas who are at risk.\nMeanwhile, 30 acres of land have been developed for constructing the shelters.\nSome more Rohingyas at greater risks of landslide and flood will be shifted to safer places by March 31.\nTens of thousands of displaced Rohingyas are now staying at the highly congested makeshift camps in Cox's Bazar.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in an interview with Voice of America last September, revealed that the displaced refugees will be rehabilitated in Bhashan Char, until they could return to their homeland in Rakhine state in Myanmar.\nAccording to Chittagong Divisional Commissioner's office, as many as 6,92,437 Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh as of March 12 of this year after a brutal Myanmar army crackdown began on August 25 last year.\n\n\n\n\n"

The monsoon, which lasts roughly from June to September, is heralded by millions of Indian farmers but the relentless rain wreaks death and destruction every year. Last year around 1,200 people perished. In the coastal state of Kerala, where more than 70 people have died so far this year, heavy rains hit overnight, setting off flash floods and landslides that destroyed scores of structures. \"Several rescue and emergency teams have been sent to the affected districts,\" Kerala relief commissioner PH Kurian told AFP.  Forecasters have predicted heavy rains in the region for another 48 hours, forcing the state authorities to declare an alert. Incessant rains have already swelled the level of water to almost full capacity at two dams, prompting authorities to discharge huge volumes of water at one of them. Last month more than 180 people were killed in less than a week in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, while states in the east and west have also suffered fatalities and damage to buildings."

He said the incidents of scam in banking sector took place one after another. But there was no bold step against the scam from the top policymaking level.\nThe CPD's analysis was mainly focused on the banking sector, Rohingya issue and impact of the floods.\nDebapriya said the overall economic situation has been under tremendous pressure following the three major happenings in the country.\nThe necessary reforms which are very essentials for overcoming the banking sector crisis are not advancing much. Rather, those are going backward and situation in banking sector came out to be the biggest example of the economic failure.\nGiving a brief account on the scams and incidents in the banking in the year 2017, he said the amount of non-performing loans and default loans are on the rise while Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) went below the required level in some banks and the influence of some quarters has increased.\nHe said the cash deficit of the state-owned banks was met by the public money from budgetary allocations and ownership of some private banks was changed through administrative measures.\nDebapriya mentioned that the private banks, which were given licenses on the political consideration, failed performing and there were incidents of money laundering through some banks.\n\"But, unfortunately instead of taking any preventive measures, the government has increased the control of the family members of bank owners through amending the banking law and regulations\", he said.\nHe blamed the weakness and lapses in the country's economic management for such a grim situation in banking sector and observed that the Finance Ministry failed to play its due role in tackling the situation.\nHe thought that the lack of courage and initiative made the situation worsened and that was the main problem for the banking sector.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-09-13 00:00:00      \nGood hiring practices can increase efficiency and increase revenue In the high noon of a summer, people of Dhaka can scurry to their destination under cool shades. Not shades of trees but rather the shades of the Dhaka skyline. A skyline littered with high-rises and their skeletons.  Workers can be seen binding rods on the higher floors of an under-construction building. Workers hanging off the ledges; hard at work earning their keep.   The growth of GDP and a small, densely populated country has given rise to the high-rise construction business in the country. The average income in the country today is more than 75% higher than in 1990, which has been done even with its vulnerability to natural calamities. The per-capita income has not fallen in a single year since 1990, even in years in which have seen severe floods. Under the Sixth Five Year Plan (2010-2015), Bangladesh government aimed to achieve 8% growth in real GDP by the end of the plan period. However, poor status of infrastructural development is acting as a serious binding constraint to realizing that growth target.  The construction business isn't just about the equipment or the company. It's about the labourers as well. A good hiring practice can increase efficiency in the construction business and increase revenue.  Currently, we are witnessing a continued GDP growth rate of 7.5% per annum. Such sustained growth is necessary to keep up the identity of a middle-income country. Refining the country's infrastructural system will thus be essential for achieving high economic growth, which is important if poverty reduction is to accelerate. The construction business can be ace in the hole for Bangladesh. With the looming emergence of automation in the production sector, regiments of skilled and unskilled labourer can be a boon for the construction business. The construction labourers can be the beacons of a new era with available jobs. In Bangladesh, the construction process is still traditional, ie, it is labour intensive. Even the labourers are traditionally skilled. They learn the work from kin-to-kin basis. A worker often brings a son, or a nephew to learn the tools of the trade and get familiarized with the peers of work. Because in future, they will have to depend on the good grace of the middlemen.   The mechanization of the construction works is still at the beginning level. Construction works utilize machines to crush bricks or the cements are premixed in the factories. But it still remains labour intensive. So, the labour skills are passed down from family members or mentorship. Thus, the workers lack proper skills.   The construction companies often give the responsibility of hiring labourers to other sub-contractors. The nature of employment in the construction sector is informal. Workers are employed daily without any recruitment letter or contract, and there is no practice of giving wage slips or maintaining record books. Safety measures are still not up to the standard expectation due to lack of knowledge, experience, and awareness. According to REHAB, 3.5 million people work in the construction sector in Bangladesh. Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies reported, in a timespan of 11 years (2005-2016), 1,196 construction workers were killed on work sites.   There are several safety measures advised by the National Building Code. But they are treated mostly as guidelines, to be glossed over. Building owners do not feel compelled to follow the rules due to a lack of government inspections. The governing body claims a lackluster manpower. But the problems have a simpler root.  Workers can be easily cheated and denied deserved payment by the contractors. Along with the risks of deprivation of wages, the absence of a safe working environment and termination of job without any notice and/or payment, while female workers are also at risk of harassment and mistreatment. There are also incidents of gender bias in hiring of labourers.  The construction industry in Bangladesh exhibits gender biases in many respects and for many reasons. Construction work requires physically strong labourers and that is why it is referred to as \"masculine work.\" Women construction workers are considered \"weak labour\" in this sector.  Women are also regarded as unskilled, cheap, available, and flexible labourers. Because of these gender stereotypes, women workers in Bangladesh's construction industry are appointed to do simple tasks requiring the least skill, and in addition, as this sector does not offer them equal career opportunities, they also receive unequal pay. These issues can easily be dealt with digitization of the labour force. A digital platform will effectively remove the middlemen from the equation. This platform can function as a labour pool for the construction companies. A bevy of workers at your fingertips, along with their credentials, work experience, and everything.  A digital platform for hiring workers can also work to alleviate the gender biases in the hiring process. The government agency tasked with overseeing the safety measures can also benefit from the platform.  They can use their already limited personnel and use the digital platform. They can have direct feedback from the workers and work accordingly. The construction companies will be able to find better workers. Companies can also invest on the skill development of the workers.  Granted, the proper use of digital hiring platform for construction workers seem like a far-off dream. There is a lot of foundational work to be done. But with proper training and implementation, the digital hiring platform can simply revolutionize the construction sector of Bangladesh.

When there is a hint of short supply in the market, comparatively wealthier farmers and traders can wait for about 15 days to one month for the price to rise a bit more.\nOn the other hand, big traders and millers, who have huge storage capacities, can store either paddy or rice for several months and create an artificial shortfall to reap the benefits.\nMd Ashraful, a small paddy trader at Boda upazila of Panchagarh, told Dhaka Tribune that sometimes he holds back one to two truckloads of paddy for a couple of weeks. \"About 200-250 sacks (75kg sack) can be loaded on a truck. I store the paddy to sell it later at a higher price.\"\nMojibur Rahman, a paddy trader at Mohabbatpur under Dinajpur Sadar upazila, mentioned that the small traders like them cannot afford to hold back huge amounts of paddy or rice for long like the millers.\nMojibur also noted that the large-scale millers were able to store a huge quantity of paddy during the Boro season. \"They have stored the lot as paddy instead of processing it. It's a ploy they're using to get around the laws. When the time will be ripe, they will process the paddy and sell the rice.\"\nMeet the rice syndicate\nSmall traders in Dinajpur, Panchagarh and Naogaon were almost equivocal to claim that dishonest wholesalers and millers have formed syndicates to hoard rice.\nWhen there is space in the warehouse of a miller, it is utilized by the miller's cohorts who have surplus stocks of paddy, according to the small traders.\nThis Dhaka Tribune correspondent visited some of the auto rice mills based on the allegations. She had to pose as a researcher because no journalist was welcome to visit the storage facilities.\nAt the warehouse of Sarwar Automatic Rice Mill in Mahmudpur area under Dinajpur Sadar, the stack of paddy sacks were found to be above the declared capacity of the mill, which is 50 metric tons.\n\nAlso Read- Who is behind the rice price hikes?\n\nAdmitting the fact, the mill's owner Sarwar Syed Sohel said he did not own any of the stock of paddy stored in the warehouse at that time.\nHe claimed another rice miller kept the paddy in his warehouse to be processed there within one month.\nDuring a conversation, the workers of Mousumi Auto Rice Mill at Mataji Road in Mohadebpur upazila, Naogoon claiming to have worked on piles of paddy round the year.\n\"We work here on daily wage basis. But we work here at a stretch, seven days a week. We can't even afford to take a day off in a month. We only get a vacation the month of Kartik (between October-November) in the year. It is just before the Aman harvest,\" said a female worker, preferring not to be named.\n\"This year, the operation at the mill was halted for eight to ten days more in the month of Ashwin (between September-October) because of the floods. The supply of paddy during the rest of the time has been normal. We don't find a respite from the work,\" she added.\nHowever, an overseer of the mill workers, who was present during the conversation, mentioned that the stock of paddy existing in their warehouse was actually imported from Panchagarh.\n\nThe correspondent later visited the rice producing areas of Panchagarh. The traders and millers there brushed aside the claim of that their paddy was being transported to Naogaon.\n\"The price of paddy doesn't vary much from Panchagarh to Naogaon. It will not be cost-effective for the millers to buy the rice from here. Besides, Panchagarh doesn't produce much rice to be exported to another district,\" said Hafizur Rahman, a wholesaler in Sakhoa Bazar of Boda upazila in Panchagarh.\nOutrageous capacity of the rice mills\nWhile some rice millers and their employees were very reluctant to give information about the rice stocks in their mill, some of them, on the other hand, expressed quite candidly that they have to store the paddy for months to keep the mills operational.\nAnisur Rahmn, owner of Tasiron Automatic Rice Mill at Rambhadrapur in Naogaon town, said the paddy production in Aman season is generally much lower compared to that of the Boro season, and the rice mills have to store paddy from the Boro harvest to keep the mills operational all the year round.\nToufiqul Islam, owner of Mofiz Uddin Auto Rice Mills in Raninagar upazila of the district, admitted that he had a stock of Boro paddy collected about six months ago.\nThis correspondent found some stock of Chinigura rice processed at Rajia Semi-Auto Rice Mill of the same area. Chinigura is fragrant non-boiled rice variety that is cultivated only in Aman season. During the visit, the paddy of that variety was yet to be harvested.\nWorkers at the mill said the rice was collected in December of 2016. During the floods of August-September, the rice stock was shifted in a godown elsewhere. But the same rice stock returned to the mill to be processed further so that the rice gives a glow and looks fresh.\nNaogaon District Controller of Food, Abdus Salam, however, argued that they had not found any undue rice stock in the mills. \"The millers can store paddy up to five times of the capacity for 30 days, and rice up to twice the capacity for 15 days.\"\nDoes regulation equal anarchy?\nOfficials of the Directorate of Food in Dinajpur also informed that they were unable to trace undue stocks of rice during their inspection. They also noted that there is a direction from the high ups of the ministry not to create panic for the millers while the directorate also lacks the manpower to carry out the inspection in all the mills of the district.\nDr Asaduzzaman, professorial fellow at state-run think tank Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), observed that the rice milling sector has expanded in Bangladesh without much regulation being put into effect.\n\"The number of large-capacity automatic rice mills established over the last decade is superfluous. About 40% of the capacity of those automatic rice mills remains unutilized. So a bulk of the rice produced throughout the year ends up in the hands of the millers. They do have the ability to influence the rice price,\" Asaduzzaman said.\nThere are about 20,000 rice mills across the country that process and market at least 60% of the paddy produced in the country.\nThere were only 200 semi-automatic and automatic rice mills in the country in 2005. But the number has now crossed 800, said AKM Khorshed Alam Khan, president of Bangladesh Auto Rice Mills Owners' Association.\nWhen contacted over phone, Agriculture Minister Matia Chowdhury said: \"They (millers) tend to hoard. There are dishonest quarters among them. Some of them cut the coarse rice and turn it into Miniket (fine rice). They stock the rice. We are monitoring it as best as we can. Would you advise me to send police to each and every mill and end up creating anarchy?\"\n \n\nAdditional reporting by Sazzadur Rahman Sazzad, Khondaker Md Abdur Rouf, and Md Faruk Hossain\n \n\n\n\n\n"

The central bank issued the directive in a circular sent to CEOs and managing directors of scheduled banks on Monday. The facility will continue until December next year.  A similar rescheduled loan policy was announced on February 23, 2015 which continuedtill December2015, according to the circular.  The circular reads: \"As a natural disaster-prone country, farmers are victims of untold sufferings due to floods, droughts, tidal bores, and extreme rainfall. Due to  that, many farmers failed to repay loans even with the former reschedulingfacility. This resulted in a large amount of loanscoming under threat of default.\"  Hence, BB has again decided to rescheduleagricultural loans for farmers, considering the importance of the agriculture sector to the national economy. According to latest data by BB, disbursements of agriculture loans by banks dropped by 13.74% in the July-October period of the current fiscal year (FY19), compared to the same period in FY18.  During the period, state-owned, private and foreign scheduled banks disbursed Tk5,352.07 crore in the first four months of FY19, against Tk6,204.76 crore in the corresponding period of FY18.  The amount of agriculture loans disbursed by banks in July-October of FY19 was 24.55% of the annual target of Tk21,800 crore for the fiscal year."

There are 3,09,468 voters in the constituency The ruling Awami League and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are both being ravaged by internal feuds in Shariatpur 2 constituency ahead of the national polls expected in December.  The constituency is constituted by Naria upazila and Shakhipur area of Bhedarganj upazila and has 309,468 registered voters.  According to AL sources, a long standing conflict among the party's leaders in the district has bubbled to the surface since 85-year-old Col (retd) Shawkat Ali announced that he has no interest in contesting the upcoming JS polls due to his age.  Shawkat was elected parliamentarian in 1979, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2008 and 2014. During his time in office, he has served on various parliamentary committees, including as chair of the Standing Committee on Ministry of Shipping and Committee on Private Members Bills and Resolutions between 1996 and 2001. He was elected unanimously the deputy speaker of the ninth parliament on January 25, 2009, following a landslide Awami League victory. With the pathway to parliament left clear by Shawkat's imminent retirement, AL aspirants are currently engaged in hectic lobbying to garner party tickets. Central Committee Organising Secretary AKM Enamul Haque Shamim, Former Chairman of Naria upazila Prof Sultan Mahmud Simon, reserved seat MP Navana Akter and Dr Khaled Shawkat Ali, the son of Col Shawkat Ali, are trying to get nominations. While the aspirants have announced their candidature by putting up posters and billboards and by attending various social and religious functions, party insiders say the dispute among them has deepened. Ruling party friction Former Jubo League Central Committee member  and people. Simon, a Freedom Fighter and now a prosecutor of International Crimes Tribunal, has also played a big role in local politics and thinks the party will nominate him \"considering his contributions for the AL and country\".  Reserved seat MP Navana says she has a \"great role\" in the 1/11 movement to free Sheikh Hasina. She hopes the party will evaluate her as she is working for the development of the  constituency as she was elected MP. Dr Khaled Shawkat says he will \"work to implement the vision of his father\" if he is nominated. BNP divided The BNP aspirants are yet to be seen holding public meetings, however, the party's candidates hope to take advantage of the AL's factional feuds in the constituency. Shariatpur district unit former BNP president Shafiqur Rahman Kiron, Central Committee Member Jamal Sharif Hiru, Former MP Dr KA Jalil,  local BNP leader Col (retd) SM Faisal and TM Gias Uddin are all trying to get nominations. According to BNP insiders, leaders and activists of BNP are divided in two groups in the constituency. Kiron leads one faction while Hiru leads another faction.  Although the opposition appears splintered, locals say the ruling Awami League is also on a slippery slope as a section of its grassroots leaders in the constituency have indulged in internal feuds, use of firearms, misconduct and other unhealthy activities over the years. Party insiders say such activities are tarnishing the image of the Awami League. Locals say they want such a representative who will work to protect them from floods, river erosion and for the development of the constituency."

Ilish is considered a delicacy and favourite fish dish among Bangali people. Since 1988, the institute has conducted four phases of research about the possibilities of farming the popular fish in ponds. \"We have not succeeded in commercial ilish farming but have managed to keep the fish alive in ponds,\" BFRI's Ilish Researcher Dr Anisur Rahman said. \"People might farm ilish in ponds as a hobby but more research is necessary for the the fish to be commercially viable.\" Currently, a team of seven researchers and four research assistants are working on ilish farming in Chandpur and have spent Tk6-7 lakh on the project. History suggests they may have their work cut out to turn that investment into a profit. Commercial failures BFRI first took the initiative to farm ilish in two Chandpur ponds in 1988 with governmental financing. The project ended in 1995 as it was unsuccessful. From 2004-2005, researchers unsuccessfully tried to conduct more research on ilish farming.  Between 2010-2011 and 2012-2013, research restarted under the project called \"Jatka Conservation, Alternate Income Generation for the Jatka Fishers and Research Project\". People might farm ilish in ponds but more research is necessary for the fish to be commercially viable Dhaka Tribune \"We researched the possibility of ilish farming in different stages,\"ilish Researcher Dr Anisur Rahman told the Dhaka Tribune. \"From 2012-2013, we collected ilish fry of 8-12cm from sea or rivers and released them into the institute's ponds.\" A year later, researchers examined the fish and found they had a low growth rate and their eggs were underdeveloped. The fish weighed only 300g, whereas ilish from other water bodies usually weigh 400-500g. Dr Anisur said: \"Learning from this experience we made natural food for ilish in the following study. The results were better but ilish still cannot be farmed for commercial purposes.  \"Observing the ilish in ponds, we discovered that they do not consume their food properly. It is very hard to maintain the quality of food and water in an enclosed body of water.  \"However, I cannot say ilish farming is impossible,\" the researcher said. The matter was discussed at the National Parliament before another failed attempt was made from 2015-2016 under the World Fish Center's ECOFISH project with USAID funding.  After that, BFRI concluded it was possible to farm ilish in ponds but not for commercial purposes."

Years have passed with politician after politician pledging improvement, with more broken down roads to show for it. The Gazipur City Corporation was established six years ago. Residents are being taxed, but have seen none of the developments promised. Streetlights have not been installed on many roads, clean water is not being distributed, and the sewerage system is in shambles. Now, voters are determined to take back the bargaining power and hold aspiring mayoral and council candidates to their word. The 1.1 million voters are determined to make the candidates work for their votes. Abdus Sobhan from ward 17 in Gazipur pays Tk2,000 in holding taxes per year. But his life sees very little of the civic facilities a city corporation is bound to provide. Garbage either lines the roads, or is strewn in ignominy on the road. The road itself floods quickly after a brief rain. Other residents of the same ward have similar complaints. Lack of access to clean water, frequent inundations, industrial spillage, and sewerage leaks are the major concerns of Gazipur City Corporation voters.  Political promises seem to have little sway, as voters remain adamant on not disclosing their preferred candidate until they vote. Afzal, a local resident, said he will dwell on his candidate up until the day of the vote. The terrible condition of the roads remains the number one concern. Palanpara resident Delwar says people in his neighbourhood have to use a makeshift trail of clay that cannot even be called a road. And since there are no streets, streetlights are a distant dream. The Gazipur City Corporation polls were scheduled for May 15. But a High Court order moved it to June 26."

The government banned catching; carrying and selling of Ilish during the breeding season, but local fishermen are still going out to catch Ilish in the Padma and Jamuna rivers, eluding local authorities.  They adopt different techniques to sell and carry these illegally caught Ilish. On Friday, Shibalaya Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Mehedi Hasan seized huge quantities of illegally caught Ilish while they were being carried using various new techniques to avoid authorities.  According to sources, local fishermen regardless the ban, were catching Ilish and selling them at the river banks and shores at a very low price. The administration, following a tip-off, conducted a secret operation in the Laxdia Char naval route of the Shibalaya upazila. Ilish buyers were pretending to be passengers on an engine boat.   Nearly 200kgs of Ilish were seized from the buyers who were carrying them in metal containers, school bags, clothes and luggage carriers. Hasan further said \"The buyers were transporting the Ilish via unconventional methods to avoid the administration. The seized fish were distributed to local orphanages and madrasas.\" \"Five fishermen were detained and were punished over different periods,\" he added.  Meanwhile Shibalaya Upazila Senior Fisheries Officer Rafiqul Alam said that during the operation they destroyed 40 boats and two hundred thousand cubic meters of Current Jal."

The $425 million \"Operation for Supporting Rural Bridges Program\" will improve connectivity and climate resilience in 19 coastal districts, affecting about a 100 million people, said a press release. Mahmuda Begum, additional secretary of Economic Relations Division, and Qimiao Fan, country director of World Bank for Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, signed the agreements on behalf of their respective organizations. Speaking about the agreement, Fan said: \"Rural bridges play a key role in Bangladesh's development, and an efficient rural road network can have a big effect in improving rural livelihoods. \"By enabling greater connectivity, these two projects will help rural communities gain safer access to schools, health facilities and markets, reduce transport costs, increase non-agriculture incomes, and expand employment for both women and men,\" Fan added.  Representing the government, Mahmuda said: \"The seventh Five-Year Plan includes a vision for development of rural infrastructure as one of its priority areas. Both projects will contribute to greater connectivity for rural communities, and boost growth.\" This agreement will support existing efforts by the government to plan, design, and manage rural bridges through the rehabilitation of at least 29,000 metres of bridges, and build another 20,000 metres of new bridges in 61 districts across Bangladesh. Furthermore, the program will create jobs by generating about 5.5 million person-days of employment. Meanwhile, the $100 million additional financing to the \"Second Rural Transport Improvement Project\", was also signed on Thursday, will help support the rehabilitation of 1,433 km of upazila and union roads that were damaged from the floods and heavy rainfall of 2017, and the maintenance of almost 6,000 km of rural roads in 26 districts. The project will also promote community road safety campaigns and road safety measures for public and private transport users, in light of increasingly heavy traffic on rural roads. "

      "text": "Date Published:2018-07-06 00:00:00      \nIn an interview with the Dhaka Tribune, World Bank Chief Economist for the South Asia region Martin Rama shares his take on the prospects and problems of Dhaka's urbanization, and the plans mentioned in a WB report regarding East Dhaka. How will moving eastwards address the existing inequalities between the wealthy and poverty-stricken in Dhaka? I think there are inequalities in every city. There are inequalities in earnings, in access to services. Perhaps the biggest inequalities we have seen in cities are in lands and land prices. The owners of land in Gulshan are very rich while those having land in Gazipur are not. If East Dhaka city continues its development at the current pace, I believe the situation will not change much. In East Dhaka, private realtors are increasingly developing entire neighbourhoods which are more like gated communities, with more social segregation. We don't see such a thing in West Dhaka. There are more than a dozen big development companies in East Dhaka that are mainly focused on the upper-middle income group. Developing East Dhaka may not help reduce inequalities, but will push up business. If East Dhaka is well-developed, it will help cut pressure on West Dhaka as people will move to the eastern part of the capital. So, we expect to see the population density of West Dhaka decline.   How does the World Bank propose to deal with freeholders holding property in East Dhaka?  Due to development, the land prices will spiral upwards in East Dhaka, and who appropriates those gains is our concern. For example, a farmer who does have a property grows crops on other's land. When land prices shoot up, the owner sells the land at higher prices and the farmer loses the piece of land. So, we see that risk which is there in every process of rural development. I think this matter has to be addressed seriously, as private developers are always looking to start their projects. We hear stories that suggest that not everything happens (regarding land acquisition) in the proper way. To address the issue, we want a smart and digitized land administration in place. This may help us get information on how many property title holders and households are under a mouja. We'll then be able to know how many people are not actually entitled to a property. A digitized land administration may also facilitate the collection of information on holding tax, exact value of a property, cadastral record, good evaluation of land and other necessary information. So a modern land administration is a pre-requisite to a modern Dhaka.      None of the authors are water experts. Without this expertise, how can this proposed paradigm be considered meaningful?  Though the authors of the report are not water experts, they are well informed on what kind of water expertise is needed in Bangladesh. All of our water modelling came from a world-class institute and we used their simulation, not ours. Their simulations can be used in terms of floods, constructing embankments and regarding canals. As such, we are very confident of the analysis in the report. Will further expansion of Dhaka draw more internal migrants? Is it desirable? Migrants will come in anyway. We conducted a survey on households in Dhaka which shows that the inhabitants of slums in the city have higher living standards than that of the rural people. As such, it is very difficult to imagine that people will stop coming to Dhaka. In fact, even if nothing is done and business continues as usual, the population in Dhaka will be 25 million by 2035. In fact, this is a good thing since productivity, service delivery and access to healthcare is higher in cities. Cities generate a lot of revenue from the apparel sector, which can be used in infrastructure. Service delivery is much cheaper in cities.  Won't greater concentration of power and population in Dhaka further extend big business and big land owners? We see possible transformations in these types of sectors. Of course, when you have urbanization, there will be changes taking place, as more manufacturing and less agriculture will be there. But if Dhaka continues business as usual, it will remain a manufacturing city. If a modernized Dhaka is built, it will be a city of great importance with high value added services. The distinctive feature of present Dhaka is the large investment groups. If the business goes on as usual, East Dhaka will be a series of small cities managed or designed by these groups. "

      "text": "Date Published:2018-11-26 00:00:00      \nHonesty and integrity, not corruption, is the way to prosperity The geographic area which is now known as Bangladesh has been underdeveloped for a long period of time. Poverty was a common phenomenon in this region. Most of the people here were generally poor, where natural calamities like floods, drought, cyclones, and famine struck the land now and then.  The great famine of 1770, the famine of 1943 and 1970, the storm of 1970, and 1991 are the notable disastrous events in the history of Bengal. Apart from the famines, it is said that people sometimes died due to starvation.  We get the picture of a miserable economy in Bengal for centuries by going through research work, novels, plays, newspapers, movies, etc. The scenario did not change even after the emergence of Bangladesh.  For a considerable period of time, even after the birth of this country, people used to suffer from similar disasters. But in course of time, the situation has changed. Bangladesh is about to be recognized as a developing country soon.  It is a glorious achievement of the ruling government. Many people are financially solvent now and many of them rose to the wealthy classes from middle or lower income strata. Though \"goodbye poverty,\" the most desired and frequently repeated slogan is still far from being materialized, this change is undoubtedly very positive. But can we say that people have become solvent in all respects? Just have a look back. The 1960s were eventful, and life for the masses was quite challenging in the then East Pakistan. People were poor compared to the present time, but always concerned and conscious about their rights.  They used to protest against any type of injustice and inequality or any wrong-doing made by any government or anybody. In course of time, the poor became solvent and rich. But at the same time, it is not unclear why they gradually became timid and selfish. People slowly but surely got isolated and did not think of protesting against any unfairness carried out by any of the social forces.  The question is: Why?   Some economists argue that economic growth brings dramatic changes to human life. The person who has prospered economically can be isolated, and may suffer from a superiority complex.  The argument is that a person is solvent not only financially, but in many ways. Economic freedom makes his life comfortable. Earlier, he was always dependent upon others during the days of his economic hardship.  He used to borrow money from the solvent near and dear ones to run his family. He thought himself quite subservient. He could not send his children to a standard school. He was unable to buy clothes for his family during festivals. Getting unwell was a curse for him.  For all these and many other reasons, his life was miserable, and for that, he had to depend on others. Now, he can take care of himself along with his family, because of financial freedom.   It is apparent, however, that in Bangladesh, many people tried to break the cycle of poverty by getting involved in corruption. Economic freedom came through corruption in many cases; and it made them selfish, self-centred, and morally bankrupt.  It seems, therefore, that economic development, economic freedom, corruption, moral bankruptcy, egocentrism, and selfishness are related terms. Aren't they?  It is difficult to answer the question, raised above, in a word; yet it is true that a person who attains solvency through corruption will be always selfish and morally weak. \"Industry is the key to success\" is an old saying, but it is as though it does not apply in Bangladesh.  The life of an honest and diligent person is usually in limbo here. People want to be rich overnight. But if you consider the developed countries around the globe, you will see a different picture. Most of the rich people in other corners of the world did not become rich overnight. According to the corruption perceptions index (CPI), Bangladesh is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. This is not just a 21st-century scenario, Bengal has been perceived as corrupt for a long time. In Riyaz-us-Salatin (1788), writer Ghulam Hussain Salim depicts the characters of Bengali people in this way: \"... but in affairs relating to bargains of giving and taking and purchases and sales and worldly matters, no race in all four quarters of the globe is equal to the Bengalis in wickedness, duplicity, knavery, and villainy. \"They do not consider loans repayable, and the promises, which they pledge to perform in one day, they do not fulfill in one year.\"  Yet, this statement is not clearly justified or corroborated by other contemporary sources. Anyway, it does not indicate that people in those days were too crazy to become wealthy overnight like today. Many people of this country are apparently undergoing class changes, sacrificing virtues to vices; they are climbing up from lower to middle and from middle to upper classes. Most of the honest and dedicated workers of this country suffer from inferiority complex where people of moneyed class exhibit superiority complex. In this backdrop, making a balanced society requires practicing \"industry plus honesty as the key to success\" in all areas of life.   My observation may make me appear as someone who does not want to see people solvent and the country a prosperous one. I should not be misread. I want a more prosperous Bangladesh full of happy people.  But I want people to overcome their hurdles through hard work and honesty, so that they can realize others' miseries and pain. We need patriotic, courageous, committed, united, honest, and hard-working people to build a prosperous nation with a balanced society.

The ban started at 2am on Sunday and will last until October 28--as this is the peak time period for mother ilish to lay their eggs, reports UNB. Any breach of the ban will result in one to two years of imprisonment and a maximum fine of Tk5,000.  The government has imposed this ban on ilish fishing every year, since 2003, to protect mother ilish. Ilish production in Bangladesh has increased by 66% over the last nine years."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-08-03 00:00:00      \nHalf of them had conducted an initial risk assessment in the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) has honoured 20 members of its staff for their outstanding contribution to humanitarian work at the Rohingya refugee camps and tackling the diarrhoeal outbreak in Dhaka. The centre recognized their efforts at a ceremony organized at its Mohakhali office on Thursday. Of the awardees, 10 were recognized for their work during the early days of the Rohingya influx in September last year, when they conducted an initial risk assessment in the refugee or Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMNs) camps in Cox's Bazar. They are- scientist Dr Ashraful Islam Khan, project coordinators Dr Md Shariful Islam and Dr Fahima Chowdhury, consultant Dr Tajul Islam Bari, project research manager Dr Shah Alam Siddique, senior research investigator Dr Md Taufiqul Islam, field research officers Md Asaduzzaman, Md Mahmudur Rahman Khan and Tapas Paul, and field research assistant Md Mizanur Rahman. The other 10 awardees were recognized for their contribution in tackling a major diarrhoeal outbreak in Dhaka. They are- medical officer Dr Shoeb Bin Islam, clinical fellow Dr Md Marzan Kabir, study physician Dr Rumana Sharmmin, senior staff nurses Jannatul Nahar and Raushan Alam, fellow nurses Mawsumi Akter and Rebeka Sultana, health workers Halima Begum and Rokeya, and attendant Md Abul Kashem.  According to the icddr,b, it has by itself treated a total of 55,222 diarrhoeal cases between March and May this year, the highest since the 2007 floods. Executive Director of icddr,b Prof John D Clemens chaired the event with Health Ministry Secretary Md Serajul Huq attending as chief guest. Serajul congratulated those who were particularly involved in the vaccination campaign in Rohingya camps and in the management of the diarrhoeal outbreak in Dhaka for their good work. Clemens said: \"It gives us immense pleasure to recognize all our extraordinary staff for having shown commitment, confidence and compassion while delivering excellent services to protect the FDMN population in Cox's Bazar and during the outbreak in Dhaka.\" Established in 1960, the icddr,b is an international public health research institution based in Bangladesh and has been at the forefront of discovering low cost solutions to key health challenges facing people living in poverty and provides robust evidence of their effectiveness on a large scale."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-04-30 00:00:00      \nIt is not unlikely that Kalboishakhi or Nor'westers with hails and lightning will occur during the pre-monsoon season (March-May) in Bangladesh. However, this week we have observed Kalboishaki almost every day, with storm winds of around 80km per hour peppered with lightning storms. Many scientists have linked such unusual extreme weather events with climate change triggered by global warming. Global warming and climate change However, extreme event attribution is the subject of considerable debates and confusion in the media. To overcome this challenge, event attribution research should be conducted in order to investigate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of specific events. Multi-model ensemble simulations of the climate model can help detect climate change signals for such extreme events. With the help of high resolution Global Circulation Models (GCM), it is possible to adequately reproduce the dynamics associated with extreme weather events with or without climate change. However, it is also true that extreme event attribution will not be able to provide evidence of any anthropogenic traces for every extreme event. Due to the lack of recorded data or greater computational powers, it is not always possible to conduct such studies which are essential for claiming loss and damage attributed from climate change. A lightning bolt carries around 30 kilo-amps of electrical current when it makes contact with the ground. Considering the rate of mortality from lightning strikes, it is the second most lethal form of natural disaster in the country El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) At this moment, we can observe two active large scale atmospheric processes: After closely monitoring the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the Nino regions in the Pacific Ocean, La Nina, the cooling phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been confirmed. It has met the criteria of all the four seasons of three months each during which the SST is below about 0.5 degrees Celsius than the long-term (30 years) average. However, it is expected that a gradual return from the La Nina conditions to neutral conditions will be observed from April to May. Under the La Nina conditions, winters tend to feature cooler-than-average conditions. In the first week of January, North America's East Coast is shivering in a record-breaking cold wave termed the \"bomb cyclone\" that dumped snow as far south as Florida. In many parts of the US and Canada, temperatures were fall below -29C, bringing with it record-low temperatures. In Oymyakon, Russia, the temperature was recorded as low as -67C -- the second lowest recorded temperature in their history.  This winter, Bangladesh experienced its lowest recorded temperature in 50 years on January 9, as the mercury dropped to 2.6C in Tetulia upazila, Panchagarh. La Nina also caused heavy rains over Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The teleconnections between La Nina and the heavy precipitation over the Indian sub-continent is yet to be established. However, we have observed severe floods in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins during the La Nina years, which include 1974, 1984, 1988, 1998, and 2017. Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) Another large-scale coupling between atmospheric circulation known as Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) affect global weather patterns as well as the Indian summer monsoon. This is a travelling pattern that propagates eastward at approximately 4 to 8 m/s through the atmosphere above the warm parts of the Indian and Pacific oceans. It is a pulse of cloud and rains, and has a cycle of about 45 to 60 days. According to Skymet weather report, in the last four days, the MJO has been in the Indian Ocean. Due to its present position, rainfall activity has increased over Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and has even extended up to South India. It will again likely revisit during June of this year when enhanced monsoon rain is expected. Thunderstorms and lightning The influence of global warming, La Nina conditions, and the entrance of MJO in the Bay of Bengal regions for the last couple days should have influence on recent occurrences of strong thunderstorms and lightning. Every year, more than 200 people die in Bangladesh in lightning strikes as per reports from various newspapers. In 2016, the government declared lightning as a disaster after the death of about 65 people within two days, from lightning strikes. Lightning strikes the Earth more than 100 times each second, totalling 8 million times every day. A lightning bolt carries around 30 kilo-amps of electrical current when it makes contact with the ground. Considering the rate of mortality from lightning strikes, it is the second-most lethal form of natural disaster in the country. However, spreading lightning safety awareness can help save a lot of lives. The most important thing to do is take shelter from lightning storms if you are outdoors. When you first hear thunder, you should immediately seek shelter. AKM Saiful Islam is a Professor of the Institute of Water and Flood Management at BUET."

It gave us a range of possible future worlds by regulating greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and climate finance to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels. The previous target of a 2 degrees Celsius rise was thought to be no longer enough. The language used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the UNFCCC is heavy with technical terms - tipping points, parts per million, regulatory science - that aim to warn of future that has deep and significant impact through cultural, social, economic and environmental consequences. So how do we, as non-experts, imagine this future? This is where culture becomes so important - it allows us to make sense of technical descriptions, and also to understand how we then must change to, adapt to, or mitigate climate impacts.\nBangladesh has a rich tradition of songs, novels, poems and paintings that portray joy, pleasure, national identity, and celebration. Amar Shonar Bangla, by Rabindranath Tagore, our national anthem, is a love song to the seasons and the bounty of \"my golden Bengal\" and is integral to our national identity. In Abar Ashibo Phire, Jibonando Das describes a longing to return to pristine nature, away from the language of uncertain and tempestuous natural calamities. On the visual side, the elaborate scroll, Nabanna (1970) by master storyteller and artist of Bangladesh, Zainul Abedin, stands out in national memory in its depiction of a narrative of rural life, with its attendant tribulations and celebrations.\n\nAsmani\nTranslated by: Hasna Jasimuddin Moudud\nIf you want to see Asmani\nGo to Rahimuddin's small house in Rasulpur.\nIt is not a house, a bird's nest made with 'venna' leaves\nThe slightest rain pours water inside.\nThe slightest wind, rocks the house\nUnder its roof Asmanis' live all year long.\nShe doesn't have a full stomach\nThe ribs in her cage are witness to her starving days.\nThe bright smile has gone from her sweet face\nwiped out by cruel poverty.\nShe wears one hundred stiches on a hundred holes in her dress\nMaking a mockery of her golden skin.\nThe bee black eyes do not have twinkle of laughter\nOnly tears pour down in deluge.\nHer flute like voice is wasted by crying out\nShe never had a chance to sing to tune of music.\nNear Asmani's home lies the lotus pond\nWhere tadpoles and moss cover the water.\nMosquitos breed poisonous seeds of malaria germs\nIn its water the Asmanis carry on cooking and drinking.\nHer stomach swells with worms, fever accompanies daily\nThey have no money to call for a doctor.\nKhosmani and Asmanis live in two lands\n Tell me my jadu who will you accept with greater love.\nThe last two lines of Asmani talk about what we now think of as climate justice. The poet wonders: Who deserves our love and compassion, other than the destitute and the dispossessed Asmanis of Bangladesh? Another of his poems, O Bajaan, Chol Jai Chol, describes destitute farmers who struggle through draught and floods to raise crops for the country but go to bed with empty stomachs. The inhumanity - and farmer suicide - brought on by old agricultural practices and natural disasters, is a form of realist visualisation that is a hallmark of climate consciousness.\nO Father Come Let Us Plough\nTranslated by: Hasna Jasimuddin Moudud\nO father come let us go\nTo the field to plough\nPlace the ploughs on oxen shoulders and\nPush, push, push.\nWe who bring out food\nFrom the depth of the earth\nWe who provide food for the whole world\nWhy can't we eat can any one tell us?\nMy wife has hanged herself\nShe could no longer bear hunger,\nNow I plough deep into soil\nIn the hope of seeing her again.\nWe plough the fields\nOur bosom is always flayed\nBut from the fields we get harvest\nNone from the scarred bosom.\nWe shall plough no more for rice\nBut to see how far it is to graves.\n[caption id=\"attachment_260526\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"667\"] The famous 'Famine' Sketch by Zainul Abedin Wikimedia[/caption]\nI must return to Zainul Abedin and the Bengal Famine of 1943. He visited Kolkata and saw for himself the kind of horror it takes to claim four million lives. The emotion of watching destitute mothers holding babies on the verge of dying is something that transcends dry famine data. His Bengal famine sketches aim to not just visualise the human aftermath of agricultural failure, land politics, the Raj's aid denial, cyclones, storm surges and flood damage, but also to bear testimony through cultural production. It was Abedin the artist, expressing himself as the activist.\nPerhaps the greatest masterpiece of Bangladeshi climate art is Zainul Abedin's Monpura (1970). Following the Bhola cyclone, Abedin painted the masterpiece of cultural testimony to climate disaster. He became known as the artist for the downtrodden. The scroll now hangs in its majesty at the National Museum in Shahbagh, stunning visitors to silence.\nSanjukta Sunderason, in Shadow Lines (2017), says about Monpura: \"When a huge coastal storm on the island of Monpura killed thousands of people in November 1970, Abedin rushed to the affected areas. The artist's wife, Jahanara Abedin's recollection of his disquiet in an interview is telling: \"Upon his return from Monpura, he just sat there with his head in his hands. Seeing such loss and desperation shook him from within. He didn't paint immediately. He sat contemplating for a long while, feeling the need to do something practical to help those people. Much later, he painted scenes of what he saw in Monpura, working tirelessly ...\"\nSo how should we think about climate change now? And where? Who will get to record it? Who will tell our story as survivors of climate damage? We need a space for thinking about our collective uncertain futures. Having this space for reflexive and reflective interaction with the \"hard sciences\" of climate change might lead to a more energetic and inclusive understanding of what climate change and climate action mean. This space must be collaborative between scientists, artists and the common people - with their contested agencies, disagreements and dissent. The hard facts of climate change have its own value and space (albeit with its own controversies and contentions), and it needs to be complimented with cultural interpretations and documentation, beyond \"soft communications\" with expert driven narratives that follow international climate conferences. It is a challenge to the imagination of the creative community and carries with it some urgency as the world is changing with every season.\nWe must think of climate art as our art - it is a product of our collective struggle. We create art, depicting our struggles, processing our memories and understandings of climate trauma through fresh experimentations. Songs of suffering, change, beauty and joy will evolve through our collective recording and retellings. We must think of climate art as a means of giving meaning and value to our past, present, and future. Art has always been an important means of processing trauma - Guernica being an icon in that sphere - be it cyclone damage, hunger or displacement. An artist's creative empathy and consciousness are the most important elements that will form cultural memory and imagination. It is our cultural conscience that we must bring to climate discourse.\n\nDr Shahpar Selim is a visiting researcher at the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) at IUB.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-12-06 00:00:00      \nWorld emissions grew by 1.6% last year and will increase even more this year due to the sustained use of coal, oil and natural gas Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rise nearly 3% this year due to continued fossil fuel use, scientists said on Wednesday, dashing hopes that an increase in 2017 was temporary after two years of slowdown. World emissions grew by 1.6% last year and will increase even more this year due to the sustained use of coal, oil and natural gas, an annual report by the Global Carbon Project showed, a group of 76 scientists in 15 countries. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were roughly flat from 2014-16, which led to hopes that emissions had peaked in 2013. The data, presented during talks among around 190 nations in Poland on implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement climate accord, are a setback for a global goal of curbing emissions to avert more floods, heat waves, and rising sea levels. The world is on track for a 3-5 degrees Celsius rise in global average temperature this century and if all known fossil fuel resources are used the rise will be even bigger, the UN World Meteorological Organization warned last week. \"The projected growth in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry is 2.7% in 2018, but uncertainties persist and growth rates between 1.8-3.7% remain possible,\" the Global Carbon Project report said. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, cement and industry, which make up the bulk of manmade greenhouse gases, are on track to rise to a record high of around 37.1 billion tons this year. CO2 emissions from all human activities, including fossil fuels, industry and land-use change, will reach around 41.5 billion tons, the report said.  Despite growth in low-carbon technologies, not enough is being done to support policies which limit emissions, said Glen Peters, one of the leaders of the study at the Center for International Climate Research in Oslo (CICERO). \"The rise in emissions in 2017 could be seen as a one-off, but the growth rate in 2018 is even higher, and it is becoming crystal clear the world is so far failing in its duty to steer onto a course consistent with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement in 2015,\" he added. Nearly all countries have contributed to the rise in global emissions: either by growth in emissions, or reductions that are slower than expected. China's emissions are set to rise around 4.7% this year, as it is still expected to be reliant on coal over the next decade even though it has been deploying renewable energy, the report said. Due to strong economic growth and continued use of coal. India's emissions are expected to grow by 6.3% this year. US emissions are seen rising around 2.5% this year, after falling 1.2% a year since 2007. However, it is expected that US emissions will decline again in 2019 as cheap gas, wind, and solar will continue to displace coal. The European Union should experience a slight decline in emissions of 0.7% this year. In the rest of the world, accounting for 42% of global emissions, a rise of 1.8% is expected. This group is mainly developing countries and the five contributing the most to emissions growth in the last decade are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Iraq and South Korea."

The actor speaks to the Dhaka Tribune Showtime's Sadia Khalid about acting alongside Shakib Khan in a new movie and a mega-budget commercial When is your film with Shakib Khan coming out? It's coming out next year hopefully, maybe March or April. It's called \"Shahenshah.\" Where is the film shooting? We have shot the songs in Thailand and in India. Now we're shooting the rest of it in Dhaka. Almost 75% of the shooting is done by now.  How was your experience co-starring with Shakib Khan? It was good,because the team is very powerful. It's my second film with Shamim Ahmed Rony, the director. We have great coordination. It's my fourth film with a script from screenwriter Anshuman Pratyush, from India. So, I've worked with the whole team, even the DOP (director of photography), before. I have that comfort zone with them. The combination is really good. When the technicalities fall into place, the production organically turns larger than life. It's my first official Bangladeshi film. So far you've worked in Indian and Indo-Bangla productions. Now you're acting in a Bangladeshi film. Do you find any difference in the professionalism of these two industries? It all depends on you. Of course, there are some differences. We're in a progressive mind-set now. People make films because they love films and they respect this profession. They really want something great out of it.  What I found really positive in this film is that everybody has an enthusiasm for doing the best and looking the best; starting from the lightman to each and every technician. They want to give it their best shot. I really appreciate this positive mentality. This film contains the hard work of a lot of people. In \"Shahenshah,\" there's a touch of positivity in every scene.  Everyone always tells me that whenever Faria comes to the screen, her presentation is \"Wow.\" They kept the glow and the glamour part intact in this film. Starting from my intro, each and every one of my scenes was choreographed. That's why it's looking very nice. I'm very hopeful.  Five or six years back, when Bangladeshi actors started going to Kolkata regularly to act, they said there's a huge difference in the professionalism between the two countries. Do you think the gap is shrinking?  It's nothing like that. I've done eight films. Five of them are officially Indo-Bangla, three are also somewhat mixtures of Bangladeshi and Indian. I think it depends on how serious you are. They are very serious. They have a different way of looking at stuff. We have a different way of looking at stuff. They're very strict; we're very emotional. But we both love our work. So, I won't say that they're professional and we are not. We're also professional. Otherwise, I couldn't survive here, because I'm too professional. It all depends on how you look at things.  Nusraat Faria and Shakib Khan at the shooting of a dance sequence for a Banglalink commercial | Courtesy  What was the first scene you shot with Shakib Khan in \"Shahenshah?\"  I'm very chilled out as a person. Whenever I'm on set, I'm only concerned about how I'm looking and if I'm doing my acting right. My \"equation\" is with my director, my DOP and my light team. As a co-artist, of course he's very good. He's very co-operative.  I'm very professional and calculative on set. I'm focused on my work. It's almost 2019, we don't have that thing (stars acting like divas) anymore. It's an extremely friendly environment. We all work together. I think it's very important to be friendly on set. That's healthy for work.  We met for the first time in Thailand,where we were shooting a song. We started with a romantic sequence and that was it. We said \"Hi. Hello,\" shot the scene, we saw the monitor, looked at each other and agreed that the shots were OK. It was a done deal. We knew the chemistry was working well, the shot was looking good. So that was our concern as artists, whether the chemistry looked good on screen. You released a song \"Pataka.\" Will you release more songs soon? Yes. I'm planning on it. \"Pataka\" wasn't so much \"me.\" Pritam and I were discussing the kind of songs we can do. And he said, let's do something that's really rough and not mellow and doesn't go with your image. I said \"OK. Let's take the risk.\" We did take the risk and in some way, I am successful I would say... Now, I am coming up with something different. So, let's see; maybe in the beginning of next year.  How did you handle the criticism of \"Pataka?\" Well, it comes with the fame. I think that's completely fine. Your actions will have a reaction. If I think it is logical, I appreciated it and learn from it. If I think it is not logical, I will not pay attention to it.  What is the next film you're working on after \"Shahenshah?\" We are reading a couple of scripts. I am very picky about my films. Because, thanks to Allah, I don't have a flop.  Tell us about the Banglalink commercial you are shooting now. You haven't appeared on TVCs in a while. It's my comeback in commercials. I shot two commercials back to back with the same production house, Run Out Films, one was Huawei and now this. I have always had a good relation with mobile phones and telcos. The last commercial I did was also with Banglalink. It was the first time they tried \"Phantom Shots.\" It was four years ago, when I was still hosting radio shows.  It (this TVC) is kind of massive. I am looking forward to it. I am hopeful. The arrangement they are providing is quite big. I have worked with this team before. They are from Bombay (Mumbai). It is very comfortable for me to work with them.  We started shooting at 11am in the morning. We started with a close-up of me. There is this superstition that if the heroine's close-up is looking nice, then the day will go swimmingly. I asked the DOP, \"Are you happy,sir?\" He was happy. Everybody was vibrant. Hopefully, it will be a good TVC."

Those are: GDP growth, inflation, interest rate, excess liquidity and money supply, clarity in deposits and non-performing loans, advance deposit ratio, etc.\nOther indicators include the exchange rate, productive investment, capital adequacy, current account and trade balance, forex reserve position, private and public sector credit, borrowing by government, etc.\nSome important factors to consider when analyzing these indicators are: Efficiency of state-owned enterprises, institutional accountability, job employment opportunities, cost of doing business, political risk, elections, etc.\nLaying the groundwork\nThe country's economy is, at present, beset with major challenges, so that before we can see the sustained results that monetary policy can produce, we have to be prepared to lay the necessary groundwork first. Doing so would entail some short-term costs but will help us immensely in the long-run, especially since not doing so would almost certainly threaten our future progress and stability.\nFor instance, a strong and healthy growth propelled by increased private and public investment along with public spending can lead to higher investment-related imports, pushing the current into a modest but manageable deficit. But the returns from those investments will bring us back to equilibrium. It's also a good idea to keep the public debt-to GDP ratio at moderate levels while working to raise the revenue-to GDP ratio.\nGiven existing challenges like an increasing savings-investment gap, unsatisfactory collection of tax revenue vis-a-vis target resulting in revenue short-fall, infrastructural under-development, institutional weakness, and slow-down in investments, to name a few - maintaining the current rate of output growth would require not only prudent macro-economic policies, but also upgrading the macro-economic policy-making practices and institutions.\nIt is essential to restore discipline and balance in the financial sector if we want to achieve our country's dream of becoming a knowledge-based, middle-income country by 2021, and eventually, eradicate poverty and ensure overall development of people's living standards.\nManaging problem areas\nA strong financial system is a must for successful implementation of monetary policy.\nNow, the running crisis in the banking and financial sectors due to a staggering increase in non-performing loans reflects institutional weakness in our financial system, which needs to be addressed.\nThe increasing gap between investment and savings is a major red flag indicating illegal capital flight.\nThe huge amount of missing funds representing an unaccounted transfer of money is a big blow to the economy as it means loss of investment and revenue income for the government.\nThese are some of the issues with our system that must be looked into for monetary policy to be effective.\nKey indicators to watch\nOur monetary policy should therefore be designed in a way that it keeps some key indicators on track.\nInflation, which took an up-turn in July 2017 and climbed to 5.59% by December 2017, is one of those indicators.\nSome economists predict far higher inflationary pressures in the near term as the country is facing some supply-chain problems with rice in addition to last year's floods that caused severe crop damage and lower productivity. Embracing a flexible inflation targeting approach is a possible solution.\nAs for interest rates, the declining trend coupled with higher inflation is creating ample liquidity and an increase in competition in the banking systems, where spreads between lending rate and deposit rate should be kept at a reasonable and minimal level.\nPrivate sector credit growth is slightly on the rise but still very low. If we want to achieve our desired rate of GDP growth, private sector credit should be accelerated somehow.\nThe current account and trade balance recorded a deficit due to higher import growth relative to export growth, and slow-down of remittance inflows during the last couple of months.\nAs a result of deterioration in the balance of current account and trade balance, unsatisfactory performance occurs that could be improved by adopting a cautionary and   consistent monetary policy.\nTo promote financial stability with sustainable development of banking and financial institutions, a sound, comprehensive, and effective monetary policy is needed to optimize all the different indicators which help the economic growth of the country.\nGreater priorities\nThe central bank needs to consider the effects of the welfare-oriented government budget and private sector investment on prices and the external sector stability.\nLikewise, it is necessary to appropriately manage the existing excess liquidity in the banking system in order to support development activities and investment promotion.\nExcess liquidity, low interest rates and interest rate differential with the neighbouring economy are some of the challenges facing the economy.\nIf this situation prevails for long, it could be disastrous for the economy, because such a scenario is ideal for informal capital flight, dominance of imports along with luxurious consumption and increasing speculative businesses, all of which eventually make the country worse-off.\nConsidering the likely impact of such a situation on financial stability, monetary policy must focus on managing liquidity, inflation rate and interest rate at an appropriate level and channeling the financial resources towards productive sectors that benefit the whole nation, not just the wealthy elite.\nUnder the current backdrop of low levels of financial inclusion, limited access to financial services, and low levels of financial literacy among the general public, especially in remote, rural, and high poverty areas, utmost priority must be given to address these concerns.\n\nAbdus Sobhan is a deputy general manager at Bangladesh Krishi Bank.

      "authors": "Thomson Reuters Foundation",
      "text": "Date Published:2018-09-22 00:00:00      \nWorldwide, over half a billion people live in delta areas Sand mining from rivers is depriving many low-lying Asian deltas of the sediment they need to maintain themselves, raising the risk of worsening land loss to sea level rise, researchers say. Combined with losses of soil-holding mangroves and accelerating groundwater extraction, which can lead to land sinking, the mining is increasing climate-related threats for those living in low-lying coastal areas, they said. \"We have created a recipe for climate disaster,\" said Marc Goichot of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Deltas dependent on the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Mekong and Yangtze rivers are now sinking and shrinking, according to research carried out by WWF - a situation worsened by climate-related warming and rising sea level. That is a problem not only because the deltas are home to millions of people but because they produce a significant share of the region's food. The Mekong delta, for instance, home to 17 million people, is a major source of rice for the region and underpins a quarter of Vietnam's GDP, Goichot said. \"It is 40,000 square kilometres - larger than many countries - and most of it is sinking,\" he said. More floods, more salt At the heart of the problem, Goichot said, is a lack of enough sediment moving down the rivers - and much of that is the result of mining of sand as a construction material and for other uses, he said. In some major rivers in Asia, such as the Mekong, Yangtze and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, as much as 90% of the sediment that once travelled down the system is now collecting in reservoirs or being mined, WWF's research showed. That means much less material is arriving in delta areas to replace soil lost to coastal erosion and other natural processes. For those living in the deltas, it can mean growing risk of floods, inundation from coastal storm surges and worsening salt contamination in drinking water. Kusum Athukorala, former chair of the Sri Lanka Water Partnership, said the loss of sand also means less water-storage capacity in rivers, and less water flowing in to restore aquifers. That is a particular problem as climate change brings longer and hotter dry season and growing water stress, he said.  Worldwide, over half a billion people live in delta areas, WWF said. According to the UN Environment Programme, though record keeping is poor, global consumption of sand and gravel likely exceeded 40 billion tonnes in 2012, up from 9 billion tonnes in the 1970s, making it one of the world's most extracted resources by volume. \"To give a sense of its use, for every bucket of cement, five to seven buckets of sand are used in concrete. For every kilometre of road built, 30,000 tonnes of sand is used as its base,\" Goichot said. But sand is just as important in the river systems it is harvested from, he said. \"Keeping sand in the rivers is the best adaptation to climate change. If a river delta receives enough sediment, it builds itself above sea level in a natural reaction,\" Goichot, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview in Stockholm. Growing demand But sand mining also feeds Asia's rapidly growing cities. New buildings and roads require it and urban land is often expanded by pouring sand into wetlands or rice paddies. The island state of Singapore has expanded its land area 20% in the last 50 years, using sand dredged from the seabed but also imported by Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, said Goichot. Sand mining remains unregulated in many areas, however, and illegal sand mining operations operate in as many as 70 countries worldwide, Goichot said. \"In India unregulated sand mining is really an (escalating) menace,\" said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP). India issues sand mining licenses, he said, which limit the quantities of sand that can be taken and the locations where mining is allowed. But with limited monitoring, \"the actual mining may be very different,\" he said. River sand is preferred for construction in many cases because desert sand is too rounded to bind concrete well, while seabed sand contains salt that can corrode metal and dredging it can be costly. But too much harvesting of river sand is now taking a toll on those living downstream, Goichot said, with the Mekong delta, for instance, losing 12 metres of land along its coast each year, the equivalent of a football field and a half of land every day. In India, insufficient effort is being put into finding alternative sources of sand, including from construction waste or de-silting of reservoirs, Thakkar said. That means \"the rivers and everyone dependent on them are sufferers.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2018-11-12 00:00:00      \nThe trailer underlines the natural and man-made difficulties that the protagonists face in their path to being together The trailer for Abhishek Kapoor's \"Kedarnath\" was released on Monday. Starring Sushant Singh Rajput and Sara Ali Khan, the film traces the love story between a Hindu tourist and a Muslim porter in the titular pilgrimage town against the backdrop of the 2013 Uttarakhand floods that killed more than 5,700 people. The trailer underlines the natural and man-made difficulties that the protagonists face in their path to being together. \"Even if there is a catastrophe, I will never allow the two of you to be together,\" says the father (Nitish Bharadwaj) to Khan's character. \"I will pray and chant for a catastrophe,\" she replies. Also starring Alka Amin and Sonali Sachdev, \"Kedarnath\" has been produced by RSVP Pictures and Guy in the Sky Productions. The film, which marks the acting debut of Sara Ali Khan, the daughter of Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh, will be released on December 7. On Saturday, Ajendra Ajay, a Bharatiya Janata Party leader, approached the Central Board of Film Certification seeking a ban on the film. He alleged that the film promotes love jihad - a term used by the Hindu Right to allege a conspiracy by Muslim men to marry women from other religions to convert them to Islam - and hurts Hindu religious sentiment.  \"By setting a romantic love story against the backdrop of a huge tragedy that occurred at Kedarnath, a centre of faith for crores of Hindus, the filmmakers have shown great disrespect to the followers of the religion\" Ajay told PTI.

      "headline": "Disaster management officials in Switzerland fight increasingly tougher battles as weather conditions intensify",
      "authors": "Saqib Sarker",
      "text": "Date Published:2018-09-06 00:00:00      \nScientists fear that continued warming of permafrost can lead to more frequent and disastrous rockfalls and mudslides, endangering communities living in the valleys in the Swiss Alps  With rainfalls and storms becoming more intense than ever, disaster management in the Swiss Alps is getting harder. It is also more challenging because there are more people living in the valleys, where villages are susceptible to rockfalls and mudslides from above. The increasing frequency in stronger rains and storms makes the work of managing natural disasters much harder for people like Raphael Mayoraz, who is in charge of the Forest, River and Landscape Services Office at Canton Valais. His office is under the Department of Mobility, Territory, and the Environment (Department de la mobilite, du territoire et de l'environnement). Mayoraz says that rockfall events increased significantly in 2018 compared to previous years, with about 400 events recorded just in January, which is more than double the amount of rockfalls in the whole of 2017.  Home to the famous Matterhorn, Canton Valais is situated on the southwestern part of the country and it is the most Alpine laden canton in Switzerland. The 5,224 square kilometre canton has a population of 339,000.  Tasked with the job of making sure casualties to life and properties are minimized, Mayoraz works with a group of engineers to manage natural hazards in the canton. \"We have the highest peaks in Switzerland. The local population is about 350,000, and we are actually 18 engineers to take care of that. This includes hydrological or river provinces and all other geological areas, including seismic provinces. But we mostly deal with rockfalls, debris flows, landslides and avalanches,\" Mayoraz said.  As part of the prevention work, Mayoraz and his team create natural hazard maps using data from the field and set up alarm systems. \"The alarm system basically tells us that 'this is moving fast' or 'that is moving but not very fast',\" he said. Raphael Mayoraz talking to EQDA reporters at his office in Sion  Photo - Saqib Sarker  This data is combined with weather forecasts to predict events and take preventative measures. \"Very often we place surveillance systems to see how the terrain moves. We set up webcams and all sorts of equipments that feed to here in our computers. This enables us to carry out the management work,\" he added.  The increase of movements up in the mountains is mainly due to increase in rainfall intensity, says Mayoraz. \"In a regular year like in 2016 or 2017, we had about 150 events. But we got about 400 events just in January this year. This is because of a lot of rain.\" He observes that the rainfalls are not necessarily more than before, rather they are more intense. \"More intense rainfall is the reason for increased risk. If you summarize the old rain during the year, it's about the same. We are maybe getting more frequent rains, but more significantly, with higher intensities. Twenty cm in this area is quite a lot. It's very difficult to contain and manage,\" he said.  There are also a lot of avalanches at the same time higher in the mountains. However, a lot of those don't end up affecting people living down in the valleys. \"About 95 percent of those avalanches don't affect people, because they are really high in the mountain and only animals are exposed to them,\" he added.  While high intensity rains and storms help things further down the mountains, one of the root causes for the increase in movement up on the mountains is attributed to the warming up of permafrost, which causes, among other things, mountains to move. Permafrost is essentially permanently frozen ground. If it thaws, there is a risk of natural hazards like rockfalls or debris flows, as the permafrost function like a glue holding together big chunks of mountains. The temperature of permafrost is permanently below 0degC. Permafrost is mainly found at elevations above 2,500 metres, and covers some five percent of Switzerland's territory. \"The permafrost basically cements big blocks of rocks together that form the mountains. Naturally, enormous pressure is being exerted on them. The rock parts of the mountain basically becomes like the sledge of a skier and glides on the permafrost when warmer temperatures (close to zero) makes it more impressionable or softer,\" said Reynald Delaloye, Professor in Physical Geography at the University of Fribourg.  The warming up of the permafrost, which is holding the highest peaks in place in the Alps, threatens natural calamities like rockfalls, flash floods and mudslides. Prof Delaloye - who works mainly on permafrost monitoring, its evolution over time and all processes related to that - says if temperatures stay below zero then there is no threat to stability.  \"If the temperature of the ice is sufficiently cold, at -5 for instance, then there is no water there. If the permafrost is really cold it is stable. But as it warms up it becomes susceptible to the extreme pressure from the mountain,\" he said.  Prof Delaloye points out that the critical juncture is not really at the permafrost cProfessor Reynald Delaloye explaining how permafrost holds a mountain together in his office at University of Fribourg Photo - Saqib Sarkerompletely disappearing - a distant possibility - but when it comes close to a zero degree. The more imminent threat is permafrost coming close to a zero degree because that will create a lot of water in the permanently frozen ground, which will essentially unstick the big rocky parts of the mountains.  \"If the permafrost is at a temperature close to zero, at -0.5 to -.20, then that is still frozen state but you will have a lot of water because of the pressure,\" said Prof Delaloye.  Team leader of the 'Snow and Permafrost' and 'Permafrost and Snow Climatology' at the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF at Fluelastrasse Davos Dorf, Dr Marcia Phillips, says that it is difficult to determine patterns in geography without having extensive data over a long period of time. It becomes even more challenging for permafrost, which is a relatively new field of study and does not have extensive records, compared to older fields in geology. However, Dr Phillips says that even though it is hard to discern patterns, there is clear evidence of warming. \"We can say that we have cooling periods, but we have mainly warming. We can see it. We are measuring warming. It's not that easy to measure. Sometimes our instruments show warming even though there isn't one, which can be an electronic problem. You have to be very careful how you interpret the data,\" she said.  But the data that has been determined as accurate shows warning up of ground temperature. \"In 10 and 20 metres depth you can see there is warming,\" said Dr Phillips. At the SLF institute, where Dr Phillips run a monitoring network for monitoring permafrost in the Swiss Alps, her team set up boreholes in different terrains to measure changes in permafrost. The SLF team under Dr Phillips set up boreholes in the rocks up at the top of the mountain, in ice-rich permafrost, and also in between in steep slopes. \"From our measurements we can see that permafrost is getting warmer,\" said Dr Phillips. \"Permafrost is cold, it ranges between -3 and -7. But it's getting warm. The rock glaciers, which have lots of ice in them, gets warmer much more slowly,\" she added.   Rock glaciers can be really fast moving and they are a problem for the villagers down below. \"When it's too steep, the front material can go down with rainfall for example. You either get a mudflow or debris flow. This is very destructive if you have a village below,\" Dr Phillips said.  Like the rest of Europe, in recent years, there have been a large number of heatwaves in summer in the Swiss Alps. There are also long dry periods and then really intense rain falls. \"This is a problem. It's definitely affecting high mountain areas,\" said Dr Phillips.  Because of snow on top, the heat from the air cannot transmit directly to permafrost. The snow acts as a buffer, Dr Phillips explained. But as the snow melts and leave the surface unprotected, the top of the mountain becomes less stable.  \"There are movements on the ground, because we are on slopes. Rock glaciers move because they have ice in them. And we have been seeing massive acceleration in the rock glaciers, except for the last two years and it slowed down again. It tells us that the cooling has an affect on the dynamics of these features. We think when it's really hot the water can penetrate the rock better. And water is what is making these things move,\" Dr Phillips said. Dr Marcia Phillips talking about her permafrost monitoring network at her workplace in SLF in Davos Photo - Anne Rey-Mermet And the effects of these changes are clearly seen by Raphael Mayoraz. \"Higher in the mountain, permafrost is melting. That is producing a lot of unstable rocks, gravels and sand that are ready to go down in debris flow in the valley when you have very bad weather and lot of rains and storms. Especially in the summer when you have local storms that sustain for as long as an hour. It produces a lot of water in the same place and that creates debris flow that can go all the way down to the valley,\" said Mayoraz. The last few years have been particularly difficult for Mayoraz and his team as very intense local storms continue to rage in the region. Weather forecasts, while helpful, cannot predict the exact path of a storm. \"On top of that, if the storms move then the path becomes very difficult to predict. Like last year, there was a very good prediction for a storm following the Southern part of the Rhone Valley. And it was moving very fast at 70km per hour. It originally headed to the North but it ended up hitting the South. And it was so fast that it was impossible to call local people and warn them, because we had about a ten minute window before it started pouring down,\" Mayoraz recalled. While the global climate change continues to cause erratic weather, and consequently instability in the Alps along with all other regions, the contingency plan for disaster management primary comes in the form of better prevention systems. This includes building dams, fences and stopping big avalanches by preemptively creating artificial avalanches by explosives. Mayoraz's team has been successfully preventing disasters through all of these means. \"There is a village in the valley to Zermatt where there has been a lot of debris flow because there is a block of rock glacier on top. And we have been able to create a dam that collects all the debris flow and we can take it out with machines later. This village is relatively well-protected now,\" he said.  Early warning system is also a key tool in preventing damages. Technologies like satellite images and radar measurements are used to observe and take actions by Mayoraz and his team of engineers. \"We can usually detect with satellite or radar measurements that a major part of a mountain is starting to move. And if there is a village bellow we might have to evacuate that,\" said Mayoraz.  \"We had such a movement in an area close to the Great Aletsch Glacier,\" he continued.  \"Millions of cubic metres of rock was moving at a very fast speed - in geological speed. One metre a day is very fast in geological terms. But in this case luckily there wasn't any village below, so we didn't have to evacuate,\" he recalled.  Aside from effective early warning systems, intervention is also important, Mayoraz points out. \"There are various things that we can do. For instance, if we see a big rock is moving, given it's not too big, we can explode it,\" he said. For avalanches, Mayoraz's organization - Geologue cantonal Service de forets, des cours d'eau et du paysage (the forest, river and landscape services office) - has been constructing thousands of kilometres of fences that are holding the snow up in the slopes. The team also regularly triggers explosions to prevent big avalanches. \"If you wait, a slab can build up to four metres of snow, which can be a disaster when an avalanche starts from that. But for every half metre of snow, you can impose an avalanche by blowing it up through controlled explosion. It creates a small avalanche which does not cause a natural disaster,\" explained Mayoraz. His team does this almost every time after a snow storm. There are designated stations where explosions are carried out, using small 2.5kg bombs. \"We also do mathematical simulations to make natural hazard maps. This helps us prevent people from building chalets in risky areas. Because of advances in technologies these simulations are getting better,\" Mayoraz said.  For managing rockfalls, the computers are helping predict major events. \"This enables us to actually regulate where people can build chalets and prepare clear instructions,\" said Mayoraz.  The organization also builds dams at the bottom of mountains. These are right at the outskirt of a village to catch debris flow. \"We spend about 30 million Swiss Franc per year for all these structures (dams and fences),\" Mayoraz informed. Mayoraz's office interacts with its counterparts in other cantons. All 26 cantons in the country have organizations for natural hazards. \"We also interact with foreign countries, with the French in Chamonix and with Aosta Valley in Italy. These are similar regions. We exchange information about satellite measurements and matters like that,\" Mayoraz said. This report is produced as part of a reporting program sponsored and organized by Swiss organization EQDA, which hosted seven teams of journalists from Switzerland, and seven from seven other countries across the world. This year's theme was \"Climate Change: Time to Act\". Dhaka Tribune's Saqib Sarker was selected from Bangladesh to take part in the program by EQDA. As part of the program, Saqib visited Switzerland and wrote this report. He was assisted in the field work in Switzerland by Swiss journalist Anne Rey-Mermet of La Liberte newspaper.  "

We lost him 11 years back. But still now his writings are shining among his followers and admirers from all walks of life for his unique style, free-thinking and impartial writings. For those who are liberal, open-minded and free-thinkers, Azad's writings are still sources of inspiration, and psychological support in gaining moral strength as well.\nAs his eldest daughter, I have seen him from a close distance at home - experienced a lot of sweet times with him, and that's what I would like to share with all his fans and admirers today, April 26, 2018.\nMy father Humayun Azad's first love was his village Rarikhal. He visited many countries in the world, but I never heard him express anything appreciating the life in Europe or America ever. Instead of that he used to talk gladly about his village home Rarikhal and his childhood in Rarikhal. He used to present those memories in his poems and other writings about the beauty of unknown muddy roads, rural flowers, foggy winters, rainfall, sunshine, green fields, rivers, memories of his school life and growing time in the village that remained blended within his heart from the very beginning his life.\nAs an urban citizen, born and brought up in Dhaka city, village life didn't attract me ever as much as my beloved father was devoted to it. But I became amazed and overwhelmed with the beauty of village-life and the rich rural culture reading his heartiest descriptions (especially after his death) in his book \"Phuler ghondhe ghum asena\". While he was alive, Rarikhal was not in my heart as it is today - today my thinking has changed a lot. Now I love Rarikhal as my father loved it, because he is back in his sweet village Rarikhal now and that was his final destination and the place of eternal rest.\nHe used to say, after retirement from university teaching he would go back to Rarikhl and stay there for the rest of his life. Surprisingly it happened years before his retirement - he reached his village Rarikhal. Death has taken the great warrior son to his long desired soil of Rarikhal again.\nRarikhal was his first love and Dhaka University occupied second place in his heart. He studied there, developed philosophically there and eventually taught hundreds of young students there. He used to admit that Dhaka University was the place where he could take a breath of fresh air. Most of his books were written while he was staying on campus.\nWhen he was alive, I couldn't understand how much effort he used to put in completing a book.  But now when I read his books in detail, I realize how much he concentrated on his studies and writings at the same time.\nHe wrote many articles and columns in the weekly \"Purbavash\" and \"Ajker kajog\" during the 1990's. I used to enjoy his newspaper columns because of his simplicity with language. But he didn't continue writing in the newspapers. When I asked him why he stopped, he replied, \"I'll be getting busy with the publication of books and I have to concentrate there\". So he didn't want to waste his time in writing newspaper columns only. Among all his writings, my favorite were his creations for juvenile literature. In the introduction of this book \"Phuler Ghondhe Ghum Ashena\" he wrote - \"Mauli Tomake Boli, Tomar Motoi Ami Chilam Choto, Chilam Grame.\" Almost all his fans became familiar with my name through this book. It was a matter of great pleasure for me. Although I loved my father's articles, columns and poems, his novels didn't attract me that time. After reading his novels later on it seemed to me that he portrayed our fragile and deteriorating social structure so carefully.\nHe gave his highest efforts in writing his famous book \"Nari.\"   He decided to write the feminist book while he was conducting his PhD research in Edinburg. When he returned home from Scotland, he brought back many books with him for helping him with the writing of NARI. I remember he took leave from the university for writing this book. In a true sense he was a real feminist - feminism was a favorite topic in all his writings.\n\nAlso Read- No end in sight for Humayun Azad's murder trial\n\nPeople used to mention the term \"unconventional\" before his name. It was his natural instinct to see anything from a different angle. My parents' marriage was also a bit unconventional in all respects. They got married over telephone in 1975. Moreover, the very significant aspect of his life is that, he changed his real name and took a penname - he became \"Humayun Azad\" from \"Humayun Kabir\". And he continued writing as \"Humayun Azad\" till the end of his life.\nAs the eldest daughter, I had freedoms in all stages of my life because of my father. I learned a lot from him and developed decision making capability in order to apply it independently, which is not possible for many educated women in our society still.\nHis philosophy and ideology were pragmatic and advanced compared to others of his time. He wrote in his poem \"Ami je Prithibike Cheyechilam, Take ami Paini. Tokhono amar Shomoy Asheni. Ami Bechechilam Onnoder Shomoye\". Sometimes I feel he really did live during the time of others.\nI never saw him express regret for any posts or rewards. He was straightforward and never talked to please anyone. Sometimes I used to become surprised to see his courage.  I asked him once \"How do you get this courage\"? He answered, \"I don't want anything from anybody. What I need I acquire myself, so I don't need to praise anyone\".\nThat's why close people around him became his enemies to a great extent. Sometimes I used to regret that his surroundings were decreasing gradually because of his bitterly truthful and straight-forward philosophy. But when he was attacked, people burst out and took to the street like floods in Dhaka city in the middle of the night. People came out and reacted together in favor of honesty and truth, and that was tremendous. They did it for a writer like Humayun Azad who was forever a broad-minded, honest and courageous.\nBangladesh was always in his heart. That's why he wrote, \"Priyotoma Bangladesher Kotha tumi Kokhono amar kache Jante Cheona, Ami ta Muhurteo Shojjo korte Parina, Tar onek Karon roeache.\"\nToday is his 72th birthday. I can see his smiling face always standing before me and asking me about my well being. So it's not possible for me or my family to celebrate this occasion, since we still cannot accept his premature demise at the peak of his powers. Therefore, only tears are rolling down my cheeks today.\nMy heartiest gratitude and love to him on his birth anniversary.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-08-19 00:00:00      \n\nWest Bengal blames Dhaka, Delhi and Kathmandu for floods\n\n\n\n\nAshis Biswas\n\n\n\n\n Published at 01:25 am August 19th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 02:34 pm August 19th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nAs Bangladesh, India and Nepal are reeling under heavy downpour and massive floods, the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-led West Bengal Government is back to what it does best: blaming others, including neighbouring countries for its own failures.\nNot content with accusing the Centre of having caused the \"man-made\" floods in West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has urged Delhi to take up with Dhaka the fresh flooding caused by the swelling Atreyi and two other rivers that flow into North Bengal from Bangladesh \"at the appropriate level.\"\nHer initial complaints were related to the havoc caused by rain and flooding in South Bengal. But, following Mamata's complaints against Delhi and Dhaka, West Bengal's Minister for Irrigation Rajib Banerjee now points out how the excess flow and discharge of water from rivers in Nepal and the Bihar state have added to North Bengal's woes, causing prolonged water-logging and bringing everyday activities of thousands of people to a halt.\nThe complaints Rajib raised sounded more like an elementary lesson on problems of regional river linkages than a serious, fact-based allegation. He did not refer to the prime cause of the ongoing floods and damage to property caused by recent long spells of rain due to repeated depressions in West Bengal and neighbouring areas including Bangladesh. Taking a cue from his chief, Rajib spoke to the media mostly about the situation the state faced because of the high discharge of excess water from Nepal and Bihar. He had visited Malda and three other districts before meeting the media.\nInterestingly, whereas the present death toll in Bangladesh on account of the recent floods has been reported in Indian media at under 20, the figures for Bihar, Nepal and West Bengal are 50, 55 and 45 respectively.\nThis naturally raises questions about the preventive measures taken by respective countries, central or state governments, and other authorities in charge to ensure that the current spell of bad weather did not cause much damage. Not surprisingly, West Bengal's record in providing relief and immediate assistance to the flood-affected people, currently estimated at 5 million, has not inspired confidence.\nAs Kolkata-based TV channels have been showing day after day, from Midnapore to Cooch Behar, there are thousands of marooned people virtually living in the open, without much official help reaching them by way of food, drinking water or medicine. Most rivers are overflowing, and accumulated water has been receding exceedingly slowly. The reasons are: lack of drainage channels, rampant human encroachment along river banks and shorelines, illegal building construction, and reckless sand lifting to carry out illegal constructions, among other factors.\nAs Mohammad Shafiq, a flood refugee in Malda, was quoted as saying: \"Quite apart from the vagaries of the weather, people also have to pay for the greed and corruption of politically backed anti-socials.\"\nWith little or no relief in sight, many people whether in North or South Bengal, have survived barely through the efforts of local NGOs and peoples' organisations. In both parts of Bengal, there have been several instances where official convoys carrying relief materials have been looted by starving, angry mobs, the more so in Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar. There have been allegations of firing by police on such crowds in some areas, but the officials concerned strongly denied this.\nQuite apart from problems of riverbank erosion and attendant issues, Bengal's pathetic failure to protect infrastructure such as bridges and culverts - constructed by Public Works Department, Irrigation Department and other agencies - also came to the fore. There are reports almost every day on how poorly maintained and old bridges collapse, leading to communication breakdowns between the north and the south.\nTwo typical examples: about 48 hours ago, an old bridge on the River Islamari collapsed in Panhati area of Moinaguri, leaving nearly 10,000 people without basic supplies.\nLocals complained that there had been no maintenance at all of the old bridge. And, at flooded Raiganj in Simulguri, an old bamboo bridge on the River Neem was swept away, affecting normal communication, even though a new pucca bridge had been built nearby a decade ago. But the new bridge has never been used in the last 10 years because land disputes prevented the construction of approach roads on both sides.\nShounak Mukherjee, a Kolkata-based economist, said: \"There are numerous examples of such mind-boggling negligence, callousness and the lack of elementary governmental efficiency or interest in ensuring even minimal public relief for taxpaying people in West Bengal.\"\nSuch failures get exposed during natural calamities and blaming others will not conceal Kolkata's own failures.\nTwo researchers point out that unlike Bangladesh or Nepal, where steps have been taken officially to ensure that problems from global warming and flash floods can be handled more effectively, no similar exercise has been carried out in West Bengal. Their study claims that between 1824 and 1930, the smaller rivers and creeks used to act as drainage channels for bigger rivers. From 1950 onwards, as human pressure began to grow exponentially, massive unregulated encroachments and illegal building construction destroyed the flow of the smaller rivers, leaving no drainage channels, even within the greater Kolkata.\nThe outcome of such reckless, politically backed destruction of the environment, caused mainly because of vote bank considerations, can be seen in the prolonged water-logging in parts of Behala in Kolkata and Amta in Howrah, according to environmentalists.\n\n\n\n\n"

In 1988, the water level had reached 20.62m.\nAt present, the water level at Bahadurabad is 64cm above the danger level, following the recent floods and heavy rainfall.\nApart from Brahmaputra, the water level in another northern river, Teesta, has also risen at an abnormal rate in the last two days.\nAccording to FFWC data, the water level in Teesta River's Dalia point was at 60cm above the danger level. In Kurigram, water is flowing at 112cm above the danger level in the Dharla River.\nSazzad Hossain, executive engineer of FFWC, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"The trend of water level rising in the Jamuna is a bit unusual. The water level has gone up by 50-65cm in one day at different points.\"\nHe further added that this trend would continue for at least next three or four days.\nHydrology expert Prof Ainun Nishat said there was a huge possibility that Bangladesh would experience another flood like the one in 1988, one of the worst ones in the country's history with a catastrophic aftermath.\nMeanwhile, the Indian Meteorological Department has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall in Assam, Meghalaya, some parts of Jharkhand, West Bengal and Bihar states in the next few days.\nIf their projection holds, the water level of the Ganges systems in Bangladesh, known as Padma will also cross the danger level by Friday or Saturday.\nThe other river systems in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river basin may also be in the same situation; the water level in several others, including the Surma and the Kushiyara rivers, is already above the danger level.\nIf water levels in the Brahmaputra and Ganges reach their highest and the Meghna is near the danger level by Friday, the situation will be worse as the spring tide is adding more water to the rivers, said Nishat.\nHe predicted that if the situation follows the track he predicted, large swathes of central Bangladesh, including Munshiganj, Faridpur, Madaripur, Shariatpur, Tangail, Kushtia and some parts of Dhaka city, will be inundated for at least 10-12 days.\nDuring the two-week flood in 1988, more than 100 people died while 13 million people were directly affected and around 25,000sq-km areas in 35 districts were under water.\nAlso, 370,000 hectares of arable land were completely damaged and 13,345 hectares were partially damaged.\nFFWC's Sazzad Hossain told the Dhaka Tribune: \"The highest water level at Brahmaputra's Bahadurabad point was recorded at 20.71m on July 29 last year.\"\nThe present trend shows that the water level of Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna might reach their highest at the same time, this weekend, like they did in 1988, leading to a catastrophic flood.\nAfter the recent floods, water is flowing above the danger level at 25 out of 90 points in different rivers in these three basins.\nAt the same time, the water level has also been rising at 77 points of other rivers across the country.\nOf them, the water level at Jamuna River's Sariakandi point was 43cm above the danger level, 68cm in Punarbhaba River at Dinajpur, 81cm at Tangon River's Thakurgaon point, 106cm at Surma River's Kanaighat point and 176cm at Kangsho River's Jariajanjail point.\nVarious parts of the country have also experienced severe rainfall in the last 24 hours.\nWithin that time, Bangladesh Meteorological Department recorded 200mm rainfall at Sunamganj's Loregarh, 198.7mm in Dinajpur, 188mm in Durgapur, 178mm in Chittagong and 132mm in Panchagarh.\n\n\n\n\n"

Therefore the country is expected to produce around 1.5 million tons less Aman paddy this season.\nIn addition, around 5,000 hectares of vegetable crops have been inundated while around 8,000 hectares of Aush paddy has also been badly hit by the floods ahead of harvesting.\nThis year the government set a target to bring around 5.4 million hectares of agricultural land under Aman production.\nThe country produces around 34.7 million tons of rice against its annual demand for 32.4 million tons.\nAmong the paddy varieties, Boro accounts for the bulk of total production - ranging around 19.5 million tons - while Aman production comes second annually.\nMeanwhile, the government has started distributing Aman paddy seedlings in different districts where floodwater is receding.\nSources said there is an acute shortage of seedlings after the flood.\nFood Loss\nJust a few months ago during the Boro season, the country lost around two million tons of Boro rice due to sudden flash floods in six districts along the Haor basin.\nThe food shortage over the last few months hiked the coarse rice price in local markets by Tk18 a kg compared to the same period a year ago.\nWith its limited stocks, the government is struggling to provide support for Safety Net Programmes including Vulnerable Group Feeding, Vulnerable Group Development and Gratuitous Relief.\nAs of on Monday, the government's food reserve stood at 446,000 tons. Of the total, there were 312,000 tons of rice and 134,000 tons of wheat grains.\nThe Floods\nAccording to Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, water levels of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Ganges-Padma rivers are in falling trend while Surma-Kushiyara is rising.\nUnder the influence of current floods, 18 river points out of 90 measured stations in different rivers in all three basins - Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna - have seen water flow above the danger level.\nAt the same time, water levels have been rising in 31 points in the rivers across the country.\nOf them, the Kushiyara River at Amalshid point has risen by 101cm, the Gur River at Singra point by 71cm and the Atrai River at Baghabari point by 19cm.\nIn addition, the level of the Lakhya River has swollen at Lakhpur point by 91cm, the Padma River at Goalanda point by 10cm, and the Surma River at Kanaighat point by 42cm.\nAll of these are above the danger level.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-08-26 00:00:00      \n\nWhy so flooded?\n\n\n\n\nAKM Saiful Islam\n\n\n\n\n Published at 06:43 pm August 26th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nI am often asked by journalists and some colleagues about our country's recent flood situation -- their line of questioning is usually whether we can do anything to prevent it.\nBefore addressing the issue of managing floods of such enormous scale, it is important to discuss the causes.\nCommon sense dictates that prevention is always better than cure, the scale of the devastation caused by these floods can be reduced at some stage if we can work on some of the major human-induced causes.\nGeographically, Bangladesh is located in a delta of the three major rivers: Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna -- commonly known as the GBM basin. Some 57 trans-boundary rivers carry flood-water from four upstream countries: China, Nepal, Bhutan, and India.\nIf heavy rainfall occurs in the upper parts of the catchment for a few days straight, direct run-off generated by excess rainfall will be carried out by these trans-boundary rivers towards our country. However, when normal monsoon floods exceed the danger level, it would cause damage to property, infrastructure, agriculture, livestock, and even risk lives.\nIn the recent past, we have observed major floods in Bangladesh during the monsoon seasons of 1987, 1988, 1998, 2004, 2007, and 2016. In 2017, the peak water level crossed the highest recorded water levels in Brahmaputra, Teesta, Dharala, and Jamuneswari rivers. We may not able to blame nature only for such high flood levels, as there are many human-induced reasons behind them.\nHuman interventions in the natural river systems, and the changes in the land-use pattern of their catchments, make the hill slope steeper, causing frequent, and destructive, floods\nHuman interventions in the natural river systems, and the changes in the land-use pattern of their catchments make the hill slope steeper, and our rivers are now carrying large amounts of sediments than ever before, causing frequent and destructive floods.\nUrbanisation generates more runoff while encroachment of wetlands and embankment confine flood water inside the river channel which raises the flood peak. Moreover, excess sediments raise the bed level and further exacerbate the flood conditions.\nBefore the monsoon season, it is important to ensure that flood control infrastructures are functioning properly. Inadequate and improper maintenance of the embankments and water control structures such as sluices, regulators, etc would also assist with breaches in the embankments and flood inundation in the protected sides.\nMany centres such as National Centres for Atmospheric Research in the US provide long-term seasonal outlooks of precipitation which can be modelled to provide long-term outlooks for our flooding.\nDredging of rivers and canals can benefit from reducing flood peaks and also act a storage reservoir of water during the dry season. It can also help in improving navigability, recharging groundwater, ensuring sustainability of the eco-system, enhancing fisheries, etc.\nDue to global warming, the monsoon has become more damaging in recent decades. But, as a result, our water-holding capacity has increased. The impact of climate change on hydrological cycles and extreme events is still an active field of research.\nMany regional climate modelling results showed us that the mean monsoon flow will be increased by more than 20% in the Brahmaputra basin by the end of this century. Moreover, the sea level rise will be expected to provide additional pressures due to the backwater effect on flood flows.\nA lot of studies show that the intensity of rainfall, and overall precipitation, in a year will only increase in South Asia going forward. If all the countries sharing the common river basin act together and eliminate these man-made causes of floods, it will be possible to reduce the severity of the floods up to a certain extent.\nOtherwise, we have to face such catastrophic disasters much more frequently in the future.\nAKM Saiful Islam is a Professor at the Institute of Water and Flood Management (IWFM) at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-10-18 00:00:00      \n\nHow habitable is Bhasan Char?\n\n\n\n\nShahed Shafiq\n\n\n\n\n Published at 01:02 am October 18th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 11:24 pm October 18th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nWe started our journey towards Bhasan Char from the Nalchira docks in Hatiya around 6:30am on October 4. Bhasan Char is an isolated island in the Bay of Bengal, located more than 20km away from Hatiya.\nThe journey itself is nothing short of an adventure, as we had to wait seven days for favourable weather conditions to make the trip. We could not find any boatmen willing to take us to the island even when the sky was only a little cloudy.\nThe Bangladesh Navy has been tasked with making Bhashan Char habitable for the Rohingya people who have fled Myanmar due to the recent spate of violence in their homeland in northern Rakhine State.\nSeveral government high-ups, including officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs, have visited the island on several occasions. Despite their assessments, confusion regarding the habitability of Bhashan Char still remains among the local administration and people.\nWe arrived at the docks named Chairman Ghat on October 3, but none of the trawlers agreed to make the journey, citing inclement weather as the reason.\nAfter some persuasion, we were able to hire a fishing boat to take us to Bhashan Char the following morning. A number of boat crew members accompanied us in the trip.\nAfter two-and-a-half hours at sea, we reached Bhashan Char. A large vessel of the Bangladesh Navy was moored near the island.\nWe inspected the island from the boat, and found that it was much wider in the northeastern area. Bhashan Char is criss-crossed by several small canals, and a forest can be seen in the distance.\nWe witnessed the construction of several small tin-shed buildings near the dock. A number of navy officials were seen resting in another tin-shed building. There is a helipad and a road nearby.\nA navy official was found on duty there, but he refused to make any comments without the approval of the concerned authorities.\nThe network signal for mobile phones is weak throughout the island.\nWe managed to get in touch with an on-duty official after several attempts. The official stated that any disclosure of information, reports or photographs concerning the project area of Bhashan Char has been restricted by the highest level of the government.\n\"Entry to the project area is also restricted, and no information can be disclosed,\" the official added.\nAfter walking around the island for some time, we noticed that parts of Bhashan Char were becoming submerged during high tide. However, we noticed some comparatively high areas where water did not reach.\nA little further, we found trees that are covered in moss for up to seven feet.\nAccording to our boatman, high tides flood the area during the full moon.\nThe question started gnawing in our minds: is the island really habitable for people?\nWe decided to venture deep into the forest at the centre of the island. We found two shepherds and their buffaloes relaxing at a clearing.\nTalking to the Bangla Tribune, the shepherds said they have been raising buffaloes on this island for the last three years, but they do not live here permanently.\nThe duo confirmed that during the normal high tide, three to four feet of water floods the island, while during the full moon and the new moon, water can rise up to four or eight feet, depending on the area.\nIn the official documents of the Forest Department and local administration, Bhashan Char is mentioned as \"Jaliyar Char\" and is separated by two areas: one is called Jaliayar Char, and the other is New Jaliayar Char.\nAnother small island called Thengar Char is located 5km from Jaliyar Char.\nThe Bangla Tribune has learned that, initially, the Rohingya refugees were to be rehabilitated in the Thengar Char. However, district administration officials on a visit to the project area mistakenly landed in Jaliyar Char instead of Thengar Char. The rehabilitation project started soon after the inspection.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina later directed that the name Thengar Char be changed into Bhashan Char, as the latter sounds better.\nBhashan Char is riddled with at least 50 small and medium canals that run through the island.\nRiaz Uddin, a fisherman from Nalchira area, was found near one of these canals.\nTalking to the Bangla Tribune, he confirmed that the island is called Jaliyar Char and not Thengar Char by the Forest Department officials.\n\"Thengar Char is located a bit south from here,\" he added.\nHowever, despite the reported misunderstanding, the rehabilitation project for the Rohingya continues here.\nAccording to the fisherman, it would take another 8-10 years to make the island habitable for people. He said the island is not high enough to escape water from the high tide and still suffers from erosion.\nHe posed an important question: \"If the island is uninhabitable for the fishermen and the shepherds, how will other people settle here?\"\nMd Nahid Hasan, the beat officer for Nalchira Range in Hatiya, recently filed a report on the current condition of Bhashan Char.\nThe report states that Bhashan Char is 35km from Boyar Char Chairman Ghat and 25km from the Nalchira Ghat.\nAn official of the Bangladesh Navy, stationed on Bhashan Char, told the Bangla Tribune on condition of anonymity that relocating the Rohingya here would be an inhuman move.\n\"The island is remote, and lacks a good transportation system,\" he said. \"During the monsoon, the communication with the mainland completely snaps. If enough food is not stored in the island, the Rohingya refugees would starve for days.\"\nDescribing the intense flooding caused by the Bhola Cyclone on November 12, 1970, the navy official said: \"There were no survivors in Nijhum Dwip. The sea took everyone who lived there. Bhashan Char is even lower than Nijhum Dwip.\"\nNoakhali Division Forest Department official Md Tohidul Islam was unresponsive when asked to comment by the Bangla Tribune.\n\"I cannot comment on the matter. The government had asked for our opinion, and we provided it,\" he said.\nSpeaking on the matter, Noakhali Deputy Commissioner Mahbub Alam Talukder said: \"We witnessed the same situation there [Bhashan Char].\n\"We will carry out the government's directives. If the government wants us to rehabilitate the Rohingya there, we will follow the order. It is their decision, not ours.\"\n \nThis article was first published on Bangla Tribune.\n \n\n\n\n\n"

The kind of program which shows that, in Bangladesh, we leave no one behind.\nIt is also important that this is not a short-term initiative; we have to help our farmers until the next harvest, so that they have the opportunity to find their footing.\nWhile the government program will save the country from the brink of agricultural devastation, it does come at a price. Since the prices of fertiliser and pesticides have increased, the price of crops will inevitably go up.\nThis does not bode well for the underprivileged.\nAs such, what we have to ensure now is that we are better prepared for flooding in the future. As a nation exceedingly susceptible to the effects of climate change and the volatile weather, it is up to the government to keep this mind in the coming years.\nFlooding has resulted in losses in the crores, and this hurts not just the farmers but our entire economy.\nBut the government has so far done a terrific job of looking after its citizens. Let us keep this going.\n\n\n\n\n"

In such circumstances, it is difficult for us to feed over a million Rohingya people who have taken shelter here,\" he said.\n\"The UN and other development organisations will not always be providing food for them.\"\nCox's Bazar Assistant Deputy Commissioner and Executive Magistrate AKM Lutfor Rahman is involved in the biometric registration of the refugees and told the Dhaka Tribune that the process is moving quite slowly due to a lack of logistical support and personnel.\n\"Additional manpower and logistical support are required to expedite the process. We hope we would be provided with the support by the next week,\" he said.\nLutfor said a large number of Rohingya people are not aware of the biometric registration process and do not even understand why the government is registering them.\n\"We are making them understand that the government registers them so that they can easily be identified and to make sure all of them are getting facilities from Bangladesh and International Organization for Migration,\" he said.\n\"At the beginning, we had written 'Myanmar national' as their identity in the registration cards (but) we are now writing 'Myanmar Rohingya' following their objections, because they said they feel more comfortable with it.\"\nOver half a million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar since August 24, after ethnic conflicts in Rakhine sparked the most rapid human exodus since the Rwandan genocide in 1994. But only around 32,284 refugees had been registered by Friday.\nThey add to the estimated 400,000 Rohingya who were already taking shelter in Bangladesh.\n\n\n\n\n"

When it rains or the more water flows down from India, the rivers swell up. Floods have always been an unfortunate staple of Bangladesh. Every single year, floods devastate and wreak havoc, a natural force at work that swallows everything in their vast maw.\nAs torrents pour down in the northern part of the country, the rivers Surma and Kushiara have swelled up and covered vast swathes of land in Moulvibazar and Sylhet since Friday.\nMoulvibazar remains unchanged\nAround 300,000 people are still stranded in Moulvibazar as the flood water has yet to recede. The water levels of Kushiara River and Hakaluki Haor, Kawadighi Haor and Hail Haor.\nBoats are now the only means of travel since most of the roads are submerged. The disruption of road communications has severed road connection to Moulvibazar sadar upazila, stranding about 15-20,000 people.\nMoulvibazar Deputy Commissioner Md Tofail Islam said the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief distributed 200 tonnes of rice on Sunday.\n[caption id=\"attachment_72441\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] The deputy commissioner of Moulvibazar distributes relief among villagers affected by the flood on July 3, 2017 Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nMoulvibazar Secondary School Education officer, Abdul Wadud, said: \"The schools near the Haors have been immensely damaged.\"\nA total of 183 schools have been shut down in Moulvibazar - of them, 142 are primary schools and 41 are secondary schools.\nWadud said 42 secondary schools have been shut down as they are all submerged in flood water. The schools will reopen once the water recedes.\n\nAlso Read- Floods wreak havoc in Moulvibazar and Sylhet\n\nFlood worsens in Sylhet\nThe flood situation in Sylhet has worsened. Due to the heavy rainfall in the upstream, the water level of the Surma-Kushiara river system has gone above danger level. Many areas are now under water in Surma upazila.\nSylhet Additional Deputy Commissioner Shahidul Islam Chowdhury said: \"The situation has yet to improve. We have distributed another 200 tonnes of rice. On Sunday, we had distributed about 127 tonnes of rice and Tk2.77lakh in cash.\"\nShahidul also added that Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury, minister of disaster management and relief, and Nurul Islam Nahid, minister of education, were in Sylhet to discuss and distribute relief.\n[caption id=\"attachment_72443\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] The rivers gradually swell, there is no malice or menace in what they do, merely a force of nature consuming everything Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nAwami League Organisational Secretary Misbah Uddin Siraj was also distributing relief along with four others representatives have started to give donations to people from affected areas.\nMisbah Uddin told the Dhaka Tribune: \"We participated in the relief programme organised by Osmani Nagar Disaster Management Committee. Later, we also distributed relief in Balaganj and other areas.\"\nDue to severe flooding, about 195 schools have been forced to shut down temporarily. They will reopen once the water recedes.\nWhere will they go?\nThe rising waters have inundated entire villages, forcing people to move out. Many villagers are taking refuge in the homes of their neighbours and relatives. Although three flood shelters have been opened in Barlekha upazila in Moulvibazar, they are as difficult to get to, hence a small turnout of refugees.\nBarlekha UNO SM Abdullah Al Mamun said: \"At least the water level did not rise, it is still steady. The biggest problem right now is the disruption in communications.

The vegetable was selling at between Tk50 and Tk55 per kilogram at different city markets on Monday, up from Tk30-35 in late July.\nPrices of garlic, ginger including different spices and vegetables including eggplants, pointed gourd, brinjal also increased while the Eid-ul-Azha, one of the biggest Muslim festivals, is only a few days away.\nThe retails said they were facing supply shortage due to floods, resulting in the price hikes.\n\"Farmlands have been damaged by the floods in different parts, which has contributed to the surge in vegetable prices,\" Tofazzal Hossain, a vegetable vendor at Karwan Bazar, told the Dhaka Tribune.\nTrading Corporation of Bangladesh said the supply crunch of vegetables due to the deluge heat up the kitchen markets in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country and increased the prices of essentials up to 102% in August from July.\nOnion prices shot up by 90-102%, 15 kinds of vegetables by 50-100%, chili by 110%, garlic by 20%, riverine fish except Hilsa by 20-30%, local chicken by 10%, cardamom by 8% and cinnamon by 5% on Friday than the previous weeks, according to the data of TCB and Department of Agricultural Marketing (DAM).\nThe prices of some vegetables have increased by Tk10-20 per kg in last couple of days. In the capital's Gopibagh kitchen market on Monday, tomato was selling at Tk140-160 per kg, brinjal at Tk60-80 per kg, bitter gourd at Tk60-80 per kg, cucumber at Tk60-80 per kg, ridge gourd at Tk80 per kg and okra at Tk60 per kg.\nLuftar Khan, a vegetable trader in Shukrabad kitchen market in Dhaka, said there were fewer supplies in the market as many rail and road transportation system had collapsed in the northern region of the country.\nMohammad Harun, an onion importer, said: \"The damage of crops due to floods and price hike in India are responsible for the rise in onion prices in the local market while heavy rainfall in Bangladesh is hampering transportation, which is also responsible for the hike in local onion prices.\"\nThe market insiders also blamed \"syndicates\" for \"manipulating\" the prices of essentials as the Eid-ul-Azha approached.\n\n\n\n\n"

It will not be very wise to try to prevent them using permanent structures.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_60448\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Paddy fields in Moulvibazar are submerged after flash flood in early April DHAKA TRIBUNE[/caption]\nAlthough the role of climate change on flash floods is yet to be established, changes in weather phenomenon and increase in extreme weather events have already been observed all over the world that are connected to global warming.\nThe probability of the occurrence of flash flood before its natural time would likely be higher in the future due to climate change, the professor said.\nAsked if there were any early warning systems in the country for such flash floods, he said there are a few existing warning systems but their usability is still questionable.\n\"We are working with Bangladesh Water Development Board and Bangladesh Meteorological Department to develop a flash flood forecasting and early warning system under a project called Flash Flood Early Warning System,\" Prof Saiful said.\nThey are hoping to complete development of the tool before the flash flood season next year. This system would be able to forecast with a lead time of three days, he added.\n\nRecommendations by experts for flash flood control\n1. Construction of rubber dams depending on the topography and sediment load of the river in the area to save Boro crops\n2. Dredging of rivers and canals before pre-monsoon to improve their water carrying capacity\n3. Introducing crop insurance to reduce the flash flood related risks in Haor areas\n4. Introducing short cycle varieties of rice there\n5. Inclusion of economic importance of Haor areas in national curriculum\n6. Building eco-tourism in the Haor areas\n7. Engaging community-based organisations to push local economy around Haor\n8.Leasing water bodies to social organisations instead of individuals by revising the water body regulations\n9. Building better coordination among government agencies for safeguarding natural habitat\n10.Survey on Haor areas to assess economic valuation of Haor resources\n11. Initiating new programmes to diversify agricultural products\n\nPlanning Commission's UNDP-backed project titled Support to Sustainable and Inclusive Planning (SSIP) held the workshop on Thursday that recommended long term action plan along with better coordination among government agencies, engagement of private sector for development in Haor areas, and efforts to be taken to preserve and conserve Haor biodiversity and ecosystems better.\n[caption id=\"attachment_60451\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Flash flood in Kishoreganj. Over 300,000 hectares of paddy crop have been destroyed in the northern districts DHAKA TRIBUNE[/caption]\nSome 52 local environment activists and national stakeholders took part in the workshop.\nSpeakers said the issue needed to be included in national curriculum, particularly for the students of that region so that the new generation would understand their agro-climatic, economic and environmental significance and work for the development of the area effectively.\nBetter coordination would help avoid duplication of efforts and waste of public resources.\nThey suggested a comprehensive survey on Haor areas to assess economic valuation of Haor resources and rolling out new programmes to diversify agricultural products and improve life and livelihood of the people there.\nFakrul Ahsan, Project Manager of SSIP, said ownership of local people is vital for maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance of Haor areas.\nProfessor Shamsul Alam, Member of GED, urged the authorities concerned to conduct benchmark surveys and research on different agro-climatic and social aspects of Haors.\n\n\n\n\n"

The rest of the flood affected people have had to rely on help from NGOs and voluntary agencies.\n\"Because we were unable to provide aid to all those affected by the flash floods, a lot of the food and cash support has come from NGOs,\" said Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) of Sunamganj Kamruzzaman.\nOxfam International Bangladesh has distributed monetary support of Tk1.4crore among 3500 affected families in two districts - Sunamganj and Kishoreganj - through a consortium.\n\"We have tried to support the affected families with direct cash because, other than food, people need the money to get back their livelihoods,\" said Babul Hussain, the team leader of the consortium that consists of five local NGOs in the Haor basin.\n\"But by no means are we able to fully accommodate everyone affected by the flash floods because of shortage of food supply and road connectivity,\" he added.\nThere is also the problem of the mismanagement of resources induced by nepotism in the affected areas.\nAs most of the relief has been distributed in areas that have roads in the Haor basin, remote areas such as Dirai, Jamalganj has not received any relief yet.\nSunil Chnadra Das Ray, a resident of Kamarhati village in Itna upazilla, Kishoreganj district told the Dhaka Tribune: \"We did not receive any government aid because they are provided by the local union parishad and we do not have any delegates from this village there.\"\nAdmitting that there might have been an oversight, Tahirpur Upazilla Chairman Kamrul Hasan told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Even though we have not heard of such complaints from my area, from my understanding remote regions might have been overlooked during the aid distribution process.\"\nFlash floods are common in the Haor basin druing the pre-monsoon period, but poor management of the rivers and embankments, and the decline in the navigability of the rivers have worsened the situation over the years.\nThis year, the flash floods came earlier than usual, while Boro farmers were still waiting to harvest the crop.\n\n\n\n\n"

But the sudden flash floods have destroyed that chance,\" said Nirod Boron Saha, president of Noagaon Rice Whole Seller Association.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, Boro is the largest part of the country's rice production. In the 2015-16 fiscal, Boro made up around 19 million tonnes of the total 35 million tonnes of rice produced in Bangladesh.\nZahidul Haq, deputy director of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) office in Sunamganj district, said the recent downpours have taken their toll on the harvest.\n\"At least a 100,000 hectares of Boro has gone under water in the flash flood in the last few days,\" he said. A similar situation prevails in Netrokona.\nAlthough they have not yet estimated the damage, DAE officials in Dhaka fear that the total Boro paddy loss might have passed 200,000 hectares.\nIf Agriculture Ministry's calculation of an average of 4 tonnes of Boro produced per hectare is applied, the country may lose around 800,000 tonnes of Boro this season.\n\"This shortage will definitely create problems in current rice price hike,\" Nirod Baon Saha said.\nWhy the price hike?\nFor the first time in several years, farmers got a comparatively good price in the last Aman season, selling one maund (37.24 kgs) of paddy for Tk800 to Tk850.\nDue to the good price of paddy, most farmers sold out their harvest quickly, bringing the rice to the hands of traders and millers.\n\"As the millers now have control of the rice supply, they might be playing a role in pushing the prices up,\" Nirod Baron Saha said. Another reason is that rice import by the private sector ground to a halt in the past year after the government imposed a 25% import duty.\nRice reserve is half\nAccording to the Food Ministry, the government's grain reserve is now is almost half of what it was this time last year. As of April 3, the government's rice reserve was 496,000 tonnes; in April 2016, it was 883,000 tonnes.\nThis shortage is the result of a failure to meet procurement targets for both Boro and Aman paddy last year. The government has procured 585,000 tonnes of Boro rice against a target of 1 million tonnes and 440,000 tonnes of Aman against a target of 600,000 tonnes.\n\"The prices would have eased soon, but the sudden flash floods have made the situation worse,\" said Agriculture economist Dr Quazi Shahhabuddin, who is also the former director general of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies.\n\"The government should not have brought the food reserve to this state. If the reserve was good, it could introduce large volumes of Open Market Sale or other mechanisms to reduce the price.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

Shrimp enclosures owners said they have incurred losses worth Tk1crore as  their enclosures washed away in the flood.\nTraffic through the Cox's Bazar road came to a halt due to the situation. But, the recently opened marine drive is being used as an alternative route from the tourist city to Ukhia and Teknaf upazilas.\nThe local Met office recorded 197 millimetres of rainfall in 24 hours until 3pm on Wednesday, forecasting that the heavy shower may continue.\nChakaria Upzaila Parishad Chairman Md Zafar Alam said Matamuhuri River lost its navigability due to indiscriminate pollution, leading to the situation.\n\"As the river is not dredged for quite some time now, it overflowed after the ongoing heavy shower, causing flood. Hundreds of houses have been inundated with road communication getting damaged heavily, leaving 300,000 people of the upazila marooned,\" he said.\nBlaming Water Development Board officials and contractors for the flood, Chakaria Municipality Mayor Alamgir Chowdhury said: \"Due to their negligence in putting concrete blocks and sandbags at the embankments, the flood occurred.\"\nIn the Sadar upazila, at least 2 lakh people were marooned.\nCox's Bazar Water Development Board Executive Engineer Md Sabibur Rahman said they were yet to ascertain how much damage has been occurred in the embankments since the flood situation was worsening.\nWith the water-level of the Matamuhuri kept rising, most of the residents of Chakaria and Pekua upazilas are in great danger of being heavily affected,\" he feared.\nWhen contacted, Cox's Bazar Development Authority Chairman Lt Col MD Forkan Ahmad said the possibility of landslide is also soaring.\nMeanwhile, Cox's Bazar Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ali Hossain said they are all prepared to face the natural disaster.\n\"We have already ordered all the Union Parishad chairmen to gear up their activities in this regard,\" he said.\nInterestingly, there was no update about measures regarding relief for and rehabilitation of the affected people.\n\n\n\n\n"

But even in these difficult circumstances, there is some happiness for everyone at the safe birth of a child,\" said Anderson.\n\n\n\n\n"

Many of these families could not return to their houses which are under water.\n\"The support provided by the government is inadequate to fulfill the victims' needs. We have distributed  80-90 bundles of tin among the flood victims, but it was not enough to help them all.\"\nMany victims alleged that they have been neglected by the government in terms of relief, humanitarian aid and financial support to reduce their plight and rebuild houses.\nMd Bablu Molla, a local farmer from Kutubpur Union under Sariakandi upazila told the Dhaka Tribune: \"The river has engulfed five bighas of cropland including my home during the flood. We had to take refuge on the embankment. All we received was 10kg of rice as relief in mid-September. We heard the government would provide relief and financial support to flood victims, but we are yet to receive a single sheet of tin to build a house,\"\nAnother victim Abdul Mazid, lost 10-15 bighas of land due to river erosion and is currently living in a temporary residence on the embankment.\nHe said: \"Hundreds of farmers like me have lost everything and currently live in dire conditions. We have no option but to depend on the government's support.\"\nGovernment officials claim that the aid distribution process is still underway. However, the local public administration stated that the relief which will be provided will not match the demands.\nAccording to a Department of Disaster Management (DDM) report, at least 150 people have died in the devastating monsoon floods across the country. 79,692,860 people were severely affected and a total of 737,577 homes were completely or partially destroyed in more than 30 flood-hit districts.\nDuring the flood, a total of 104,949 hectares of croplands have been completely ravaged while another 498,660 hectares were partially damaged in northern and east-northern districts of Bangladesh.\nSources at the DDM said that the Department of Agricultural Extension has been working closely with the DDM in order to minimise the loss by providing seeds, seedlings and fertilisers among the affected cultivators.\nDDM authorities are also continuing relief distribution among the victims.\nThe government has allotted a total of 27,207 metric tonnes of rice for 32 flood-hit districts. 17,721 metric tonnes of rice has already been distributed.\nThe government has also allotted a total of Tk89,155,000 in cash for the victims. Tk56,779,227 has already been handed out.\nWhile asked about the displaced people who are currently living on embankments or under the open sky, DDM Director General Md Reaz Ahmed said they are providing financial support and tin bundles so they can rebuild or repair their homes.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-08-16 00:00:00      \nWe are currently observing severe floods in the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Meghna rivers and their tributaries for the second time in this year. The previous floods occurred in these two river basins during the middle of July. Water levels currently crossed the Danger Levels (DLs) in the Jamuna, Teesta, Dharala, Atrai, Jamunaswary, Ichhamati, Gur, Little Jamuna, Tangoan, Korotoa, Ghagot, and in their tributaries in the north central of Bangladesh. Similar floods have also been observed in Assam in India, which is the upstream of the Brahmaputra River Last week, we also observed floods in the major rivers of the Meghna basins such as Surma, Kushiyara, Jadukatha, Bhugai, Kangsha, Someswwati, Sari Gowain, and Manu. The north, north-central, and northeast districts of Bangladesh are currently suffering from major floods. Floods in Bangladesh are nothing new, and people are used to natural monsoon floods. However, what is unexpected is the frequency and intensity of flood in recent times. When water levels cross a certain level known as Danger Level (DL), it is considered a flood. Water levels above the danger level often cause damage to property, infrastructure, crops, livestock, and, in some cases, even causes human fatalities. Alarming patterns and statistics This year we have already observed floods in the two basins, and now we are passing through the second wave of the monsoon floods which normally occur between June and September. Severe floods occurred in 1988 (a return period of one in 100 years in the Brahmaputra river), 1998 (prolonged floods lasting more than two months in some places), 2004 (a return period of one in 100 years in some stations), 2007 (also affected Dhaka city) and in 2016 (affecting more than 25 districts of Bangladesh). However, this year, the rise of floodwater will be unprecedented in our recent history, considering the height of the peak flood. It has already crossed the Record High Water Level (RHWL) in various stations of many tributaries of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna river systems such as Mohadevepur in Atrai, Badarganj in Jamuneswari, Kurigram in Dharala, and Dalia in the Teesta. This week, it will cross the RHWL at Bahadurabad in Jamuna river and then Sirajganj in Jamuna river. It may touch the RHWL of the Kusiyara at Sheola in this week. Last year, at Baghdadabad in Jamuna river, peak flood also crossed the previous RHWL, and it was above 11cm above the previous RHWL in 1988 (20.6m).  Such a backwater effect will prolong the duration of the floods and also increase the water level of the peak floods It is alarming that RHWL will be crossed in many stations of this Brahmaputra-Jamuna river again during this monsoon season. This indicates that the severity of the floods have been increased in recent decades in our major rivers of Bangladesh. Blame climate change It was not completely unexpected that the severity of the floods in the major rivers of South Asia would increase due to climate change. In many studies, it was shown that floods in the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna basins would be more intense. Due to global warming, mean global temperatures have already increased by about 1 degree centigrade from the pre-industrial period. It has been predicted by IPCC that Earth will be much warmer at the end of the century due to the anthropogenic green-house gas emissions. Global warming will alter the hydrological cycles, and floods will become more severe in South Asian regions. Results from a recent collaborative study by BUET under a collaborative research project titled \"High End Climate Impact and Extremes (HELIX)\" funded by the EU under the Seventh Framework Program FP7/2007-2013 also confirmed so. This study was carried out to assess the impacts of the extreme climate change in Bangladesh and its impact of the river discharge. Although the Paris Agreement in 2015 brought hope that global emissions will be reduced to such a level that global temperature rise will not be above 2C from the pre-industrial period, UNFCC countries which signed the agreement must make good on it. Otherwise, the most climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh will suffer the most from extreme climate events like floods. The rise of the sea level due to climate change will put additional threats to the flooding of our country, as it will have a \"backwater effect\" on floods. Such a backwater effect will prolong the duration of the floods and also increase the water level of the peak floods. Perhaps the floods in 2017 will not be as prolonged as the 1998 floods, as the waters in the Ganges river is well below the danger level, and there is not much chance of synchronised three flood peaks of the three major rivers: Ganges, Brahmapura, and Meghna. Moreover, the spring tide will occur in coastal rivers after the new moon on August 21. This will provide enough time for the floodwater in the Jamuna and Meghan river systems to recede in many places. However, there is no doubt that extreme events like severe floodings have become more frequent, and more intense than before. Bangladesh, concerningly, will become more and more vulnerable in the coming days.

It often requires imports to cope with shortages caused by natural calamities like floods and droughts.\n\n\n\n\n"

Officials of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) dropped sandbags to prevent further erosion there.\nSirajganj BWDB Executive Engineer Syed Hasan Imam said the water-level of the Jamuna had increased by 32cm over the last two days.\nKurigram\nErosion caused by the strong current in the Brahmaputra river has rendered about 50 families homeless in Ramna and Ashtamirchar unions under Rajarhat upazila.\nThe erosion is still alive in that area, posing threats of displacement to around 300 more families.\nRamna Union Parishad Chairman Md Asgar Ali told Dhaka Tribune that he had informed the BWDB officials about the severity of the erosion, but the officials were yet to take any action.\nJamalpur\nSome 15,000 people have been marooned as flash flood caused by heavy rainfall and onrush of water from the upstream areas is sweeping over the district's Islampur and Dewanganj upazilas.\nThe Jamuna was flowing about 19cm over the danger-level at Bahadurabad point.\nIslampur Upazila Nirbahi Officer ABM Ehsanul said they had taken all the preparations and kept all the shelter centres ready in the flood-affected areas to tackle any serious situation.\nMoulvibazar\nThough flood water has been receding from most parts of Hakaluki Haor in Moulvibazar, about 300,000 people in Barlekha, Juri, Kulaura, Rajnagar and Sadar upazilas under the Haor region  are still marooned.\nMoulvibazar BWDB Executive Engineer Indra Bijoy Shankar Chakraborty said the water-level of the Haor was dropping down with the decrease of the water-level in the Kushiara river.\nThe flood water might recede from the human habitations of Hakaluki Haor in three to four more days if the current trend continues, he added.\n\n\n\n\n"

It will ensure irrigation to 17 northern districts during the dry season.\n\nThe Water Resources Ministry has already called for 'expression of interest' letters from interested organisations to conduct a feasibility study on the planned infrastructure. The cost of the feasibility study has been estimated to be Tk100cr.\n\"The Brahmaputra barrage is necessary to supply water to the northwest as well as north central region of the country,\" Md Aminul Haque, the project director, told the Dhaka Tribune.\n\"We are trying to have the barrage somewhere between Bangabandhu Bridge and Bahadurabad point of the river,\" he added.\nThe Brahmaputra is a major trans-boundary river and contributes to about two-third of the total dry season water flow in Bangladesh.\nThe project will involve a detailed feasibility study, socio-economic, environment, and other hydraulic and hydro-morphological surveys and studies, said Aminul Haque.\nHydrologist Prof Ainun Nishat, however, observed that the authorities should first ensure the economic, social and environmental viability of the barrage.\nAn expert, on condition of anonymity, also noted that the locations proposed for the barrage and the proposed irrigation areas go against the general rules of gravitational flow.\nMany districts where the irrigation water is to be diverted are at a higher plane than the sea-level in comparison to the proposed barrage points, the expert added.\nThe length of the trans-boundary Brahmaputra, from its source in southwestern Tibet to the mouth at the Bay of bengal is about 2,900 km. The length of the Brahmaputra inside Bangladesh is about 240km with a catchment area of about 39,100 square km, according to project documents.\nA study of the Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS) said the average width of the river had increased from 8.5km in 1973 to 12.2km in 2009 due to the erosion.\nThe location the government is considering for setting up the infrastructure is around 10km in width.\nThe water of Brahmaputra, known as Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river in China, are shared by China, India, and Bangladesh. In the 1990s and 2000s, there had been repeated speculations that China was building a dam on the river to divert the waters to its northern territory.\nFinally in 2010, China confirmed it was indeed building the Zangmu Dam on the Brahmaputra in Tibet.\n\n\n\n\n"

Rice prices are already unusually high and market insiders fear that the worst is yet to come.\nThe government is now scrambling to make a quick response and has agreed the first rice imports for six years, ordering 600,000 tonnes.\nAccording to Food Ministry data, the price of 1kg coarse rice is now Tk38, which is Tk14 higher than the same time last year.\nAccording to the Department of Agricultural Extension, around 300,000 hectares of Boro fields were submerged in the latest flash-floods in the northeastern Haor wetlands, namely the seven districts of Sunamganj, Sylhet, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Brahmanbaria, Kishoreganj and Netrakona.\n[caption id=\"attachment_63611\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Rice traders say they have very little rice in reserve this year, unlike in previous years. The government's rice reserve has come down as well. The photo was taken at a wholesale rice market in Ashuganj on November 17, 2012S yed Zakir Hossain[/caption]\nAgriculture Ministry estimates say the average per hectare Boro production in Bangladesh is about 4 tonnes.\nBy that account, the country has lost about 1.2 million tonnes of Boro rice in the flash-floods, though other unofficial estimates have put the figure almost twice as high.\nThis year Boro farmers have also suffered from blast attacks in the Boro field, which may also affect the yield in many areas.\n\"This year I was forced to harvest two acres of my Boro paddy at least two weeks early as a large portion of my field was attacked by blast. I got at least 30% less production than usual,\" said Abdul Kuddus, a farmer from Lalmonirhat.\nHowever, the DAE thinks that the extent of the parasite attack has been overstated by news reports.\nChaitanya Kumar Das, director of field services of DAE, told the Dhaka Tribune that blast will not create any negative impact on overall production.\n\"There were some blast attacks in specific areas but we managed to bring them under control quickly,\" he said.\n\"We hope that this shortage will be recovered soon enough after the Aush harvest as we have a larger coverage of Aush variety than the previous years.\"\nThis year the acreage of Aush paddy is 1.025 million hectares while the last year's coverage was 962,000 hectares.\nAgricultural economist Qazi Shahabuddin believes that this year the country will experience about two million tonnes of shortage in Boro production.\nAccording to the Food Ministry, the government's rice reserve came down to 262,000 tonnes on May 7. In May last year the reserve was about 678,000 tonnes.\nTraders are also saying they have very little rice in reserve.\nNaogaon Rice Wholesalers Association President Nirod Baran Saha, who has been in the rice business since 1978, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"This year the situation is completely different from the previous years. Like the government, the private sector's reserve is almost finished.\n[caption id=\"attachment_63612\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Locals in Farmgate, Dhaka queue up in front of a Trading Corporation of Bangladesh truck to buy their daily commodities on Monday Syed Zakir Hossain[/caption]\n\"Usually at the beginning of the Boro harvest, I always have a good amount of rice in my storage from the previous year. But this year my reserve is almost empty.\"\nIn March and Aprill every year there is usually a small increase in rice prices in Bangladesh, when the Aman harvest from late autumn slowly nears depletion and the Boro paddy is still in the fields.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, Boro provides the largest part of the country's cereal production. Out of the circa 35 million tonnes of rice produced in the 2015-16 fiscal year, 19 million tonnes came from Boro.\nBut this year there was a sharp spike in rice prices, at least Tk14 higher than the previous year.\nAccording to the Food Ministry, the average retail price of coarse rice is now Tk38 per kg, while the figure was Tk24 in this period last year.\nMarket insiders think that the rice price hike might continue or at least stay at this level throughout the year because of production shortfall and shortage of stock.\nQazi Shahabuddin, former director general of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), thinks that importing rice in both public and private sectors is the only option to tackle the situation.\n It is a view shared by Nirod Baran Saha: \"To facilitate import, the government has to withdraw the imposed supplementary duty which is 25%. Otherwise, the private sector would not be interested in doing it,\" he said.\nTo make the reserve sufficient, the government has already decided to import 100,000 tonnes of rice initially, something it has not done in the past six years. This figure will rise to 600,000.\nAccording to some estimations, the government needs at least 483,000 tonnes of rice by June 30 to meet the demand of its various social safety net programmes including Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) and Open Market Sale (OMS), especially in the Haor basins where the food shortage is threatening to become acute.\n\n\n\n\n"

Changing climates will mean more extreme weather that would see from heatwaves to hurricanes and floods to famine.\nThe subjective appraisal of the climate hotspots say delta regions, semi-arid countries, and glacier - and snowpack - dependent river basins are all in the frontline. Tropical coastal regions and some of the world's greatest forests and cities are facing the threat.\nAlthough low-lying Bangladesh contributes little to global warming, it is nevertheless one of the worst climate change victims.\nThe country faces major risks from sea level rise, worsening storms, floods, droughts and other climate change impacts.\nChanging climate has made it difficult for residents of coastal areas to grow crops, forcing many of them to try their lucks somewhere else.\nSaleemul Huq, director of International Centre for Climate Change and Development, told The Guardian that they expected five to 10 million people to move from the coastal areas.\nHe said the coast was the most vulnerable area in Bangladesh, a climate hotspot. Most people leaving their homes prefer to move to Dhaka, the capital city.\nHuq, who has advised the Bangladesh government at successive UN climate summits, told The Guardian that there was strong evidence that climate change was impacting Dhaka.\nHe said temperatures had already gone up by 1 degree Celsius that the weather patterns have changed visibly - the frequency of floods, for example. Major floods that used to hit Bangladesh once every two decades were more frequent now.\nHe said he expected to see more extremes.\nLast year, there were four cyclones - Roanu, Kyant, Nada and Vardah - in the Bay of Bengal where there is usually only one.\nAccording to Huq the rise in sea levels and increased salinity in coastal areas were \"slow onset\" that would \"get worse\". This was an unprecedented \"climate change phenomenon\", he told The Guardian.\nUN scientists have predicted that south-east Asia will see some of the worst impacts of climate change and said sea level rise will threaten over 25 million people in Bangladesh by 2050.\nBangladesh produces about 0.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person, much lower than the United States' 16.4 tonnes, Australia's 16.3 tonnes and Qatar's whopping 40.5 tonnes, World Bank figures show.\nHuq, who leads research into how Bangladesh can adapt to climate change, said they researched the most vulnerable hotspots in details.\nThe government, he said, had started investing in a major climate change action plan.\nBangladesh has made a name for itself as an international leader in climate action, particularly in terms of innovative adaptation to climate change.\nThe country spends almost $1 billion annually on adapting to climate change. Sheikh Hasina's government established a $400 million 'Climate Change Trust Fund' in 2009 from its own resources.\nA huge project to harvest rainwater and coastal protection has been undertaken to counter coastal salinity. Scientists are developing saline-tolerant rice.\nBoth the people and the government are participating in the effort, he said, noting that Bangladesh was \"always catching up with the problem\".\nHe suggested developing other towns and cities to make sure people, whose livelihood would be affected by climate change, did not move to the capital city only.\n\nOther hot spots in the list are Spain's Murcia, Malawi's Mphampha, Norway's Longyearbyen, Brazil's Manaus, New York, and Philippines' Manila.\n\n\n\n\n"

This in turn is making the northeastern region vulnerable to flash-floods.\nAccording to the Department of Agricultural Extension's Sunamganj district office, around 120 hectares of arable land has been covered by sand in Tahirpur upazila over the last decade, turning it completely barren.\n\"And this is only in that specific area. If we look across the region, located south of the Megahlaya hills near the Bangladesh-India border, the damage is massive,\" said Zahidul Haque, DAE deputy director.\nAndrew Sholomar from Rajai village in the upazila is one of the biggest victims of this sand intrusion.\n\"I have already lost around 15 acres of my 20 acres of land,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune.\nIf this cannot be stopped, his family might end up starving as it is dependent on that land, he said.\nThe flow of sand and stone chips coming down with monsoon water has been decreasing the depths of the Haor basins, increasing the risk of flash-floods.\nHydrologist Prof Ainun Nishat said although the flash-floods are a common phenomenon in the northeastern wetlands, there has been an increase in its frequency and magnitude.\n\"Water usually carries sediment downstream. This is also true of the northeastern region,\" he said.\nBut the volume of sand intrusion with the water is alarming and need to be stopped at any cost, he added.\nCalling attention to several Beels - small water bodies - in Kharchar Haor in Sunamganj, the expert said many of them have already been filled up with sand.\n\"The frequency and coverage of flash-floods have been increasing in the region as the beds of water bodies are gradually rising up,\" said 45-year-old Kamruzzaman Kamrul, chairman of Tahirpur Upazilla Parishad, who has lived in the area since his birth.\nWhat's going on upstream\nMineral resources including coal, limestone and stones are the biggest part of Meghalaya's economy.\nThe mining mostly takes place in three regions of the state - East Khasi Hills, West Khasi Hills and Garo Hills - all of which border Bangladesh.\nSources in Meghalaya say the state government has relatively little control over the mining industry in these autonomous regions. According to the sources, there are around 1,000 operational mines in those three areas, all privately run.\nAltrisha Lyndoh, owner of a coal mine in West Khasi hills, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"We have been doing this mining business in our own land. We dig the land, extract coal and sell it.\"\nAsked whether she knows about the impacts of coal mining downstream, she said: \"I have no idea.\"\nHJ Syiemlieh, a professor of geography at the North Eastern Hill University in Shillong, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"To extract coal, primarily the miners cut down forests and open pits, which ultimately makes the topsoil unstable and lets it wash downhill with monsoon water.\"\nIn 2015, the Indian National Green Tribunal, a government body, issued a ruling to stop unplanned coal mining in Meghalaya, saying it was destroying the topsoil and the local ecology.\nBut the professor said as there is no strong government control over the issue, many mines have continued to run their operations in an unplanned manner.\nA fateful day\nSand intrusion from Meghalaya has gone up sharply since 2008 when a sudden landslide in the West Khasi Hills of Meghalaya near the Bangladesh-India border sent a massive volume of sand down to Bangladesh.\nThe incident destroyed around 50 acres of land within minutes.\n\"Within a few minutes, the nearby ponds and wetlands filled up with sand and stone chips that day,\" said 46-year-old local Rokon Uddin, who witnessed the landslide.\nMore than 2,000 acres of agricultural land in three villages - Chanpur, Rojoni Line and Rajai - owned by local farmers and villagers, disappeared in that single event which changed the area's ecosystem and robbed thousands of their livelihoods.\nSince then, unplanned mining in Meghalaya - one of India's main source of mineral resources - have been pouring large amounts of sand into the water that eventually flows into Bangladesh and ruins large areas of arable land every monsoon. Mass deforestation, caused by unplanned mining, has also caused the soil in the hills to become more vulnerable to landslides.\nPonchashol Haor, which locals said used to cover a large area near Chanpur village, has now vanished because of sand intrusion from the West Khasi Hills.\nComplaints made earlier\nIn 2009, the Ministry of Environment and Forest in Bangladesh sent a formal letter to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka to inform them of the issue.\nHowever, the issue appears to have been forgotten on both sides.\nOn a recent visit to Meghalaya, this correspondent met Y Tsering, an additional chief secretary of Meghalaya government and also in charge of mining department, who admitted that he was aware of the issue.\n\"All good and bad things go to Bangladesh. Water runs from upstream to downstream,\" he said, smiling.\n\"Just like our river water goes down, the sediment goes down and makes the downstream land fertile. Now the sand goes down with water and makes the land barren,\" he said.\nProfessor Ainun Nishat expressed the need for a joint watershed management for the entire region so that the problems can be managed.\nProf HJ Syiemleih similarly said that the two sides need to work together to find the way to stop this sand intrusion.\n\"India needs the mining and Bangladesh needs to be safe from sand intrusion,\" he said.\nProf Nishat also said that Bangladesh government needed to introduce some initiatives, including dredging the water-bodies and heightening the crop protection embankments to reduce the loss of crops in the Haor basins.\n\n\n\n\n"

The floods also killed 1,180 tonnes of fish and affected more than half of the district's livestock, aside from triggering a fodder crisis.\nMaya then asked participants of the meeting, held at the district's Zilla Parishad office, about how they planned to tackle the crisis. But the officials failed to come up with any plans, angering the minister.\nMaya first asked the district agricultural officer about damage to crops but the latter failed to give him a clear idea.\n\nAlso Read: Paddy production hit by flood in the Haors\n\nLater the heads of the district's fisheries and livestock, executive engineers of public health, Water Development Board, roads and highways; the civil surgeon, LGRD executive officer, district education officer, primary education officer and cooperatives officer, too, failed to answer the minister.\nDC Mushfiqur requested then the minister to provide 75,000 Vulnerable Group Feeding or VGF cards and one open market sale (OMS) dealer for each union.\nThe government has already announced emergency monthly supplies to the affected people in various districts.\nMaya on Sunday said 335,000 families of the flood-ravaged Haor region would receive relief. Each family will get 30kg rice and Tk500 as emergency support under a 100-day scheme.\n\nAlso Read: 30kg rice, Tk500 monthly relief for affected haor families\n\nApart from rice and cash, some 171,715 families will get relief materials through the VGF programme and OMS.\nBut the destruction of more than 200,000 hectares of mature Boro paddy in the flash floods in the northeastern wetlands may further push up the rice prices, traders say.\nMore than half of the rice produced in Bangladesh is Boro. Government data shows that 19 million tonnes out of the total 35 million tonnes of rice produced in the 2015-16 fiscal was Boro.\n\n\n\n\n"

But the country grows only half of the maize it needs, importing the rest from the United States and Brazil, he said, which means rising demand could mean rising prices.\n\"Maize prices will go up if it is used for ethanol production. The price of eggs and chicken will go beyond the reach of common people,\" Rahman warned.\nHe said growing concerns about food security have led other countries - including China - to stop giving permission for new biofuel projects.\nFOOD TO FUEL\nAccording to a study by Bangladesh's energy ministry, the country could produce 18 million liters of ethanol a year, or about 75,000 liters each working day. That would require 60,000 tonnes of broken rice each year - about 3.5 percent of the country's total production.\nAlternately the county could produce the ethanol with 62,000 tonnes of maize (2.8 percent of production) or 97,000 tonnes of molasses (nearly all of the country's production).\nThe study warned that if the government scales up ethanol production beyond those levels, it will raise demand for grain to the point that it could hurt food security.\nBut junior energy minister Nasrul Hamid told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone that Bangladesh needs to go for greener and more varied fuels in the future, like other nations.\n\"So, we are exploring the possibility of using bio-ethanol with other fuels. You can't remain out from the global trend of energy use,\" he said.\nHe confirmed the ministry plans to give permission for ethanol production, and then would judge from early experience whether to scale up the experiment.\n\"Yes, we are going to give permission for bio-fuel soon. Let's see what happens first. Its impact on food security will be considered than,\" Hamid said.\nBut others warn that Bangladesh has decided to burn food grains to produce ethanol without taking into consideration the food security of its 160 million people.\n[caption id=\"attachment_60935\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Bangaldesh grows only half of the maize it needs, importing the rest, which means rising demand could mean rising prices Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nThat is a particular worry in a low-lying country that faces severe climate change threats, including loss of crops and crop land to worsening salt-water intrusion, droughts, floods, storms, sea level rise and erosion.\nAlready many people face daily hunger and can manage meals only once or twice a day, experts say. Last year, Bangladesh ranked in the top 25 percent of the world's most hungry countries, according to the Global Hunger Index of the International Food Policy Research Institute.\nBangladesh today produces about 1.8 million tonnes of broken rice, about 100,000 tonnes of molasses and less than half the 6 million tonnes of maize it needs each year, according to the country's Energy Ministry.\nBesides being used as livestock food, maize is eaten by poorer people, mixed with flour as a cereal or made into biscuits. Lower-income people also eat broken rice for breakfast and make it into cakes.\nBut prices for the grains are rising. A kilogram of coarse rice is now being sold at 42 taka (50 cents) in Dhaka, up 25 percent in price from a year ago, according to the government Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.\nRising food prices are a major concern, with a growing portion of people's earnings now being spent on food. The country's food inflation rate in February was 6.8 percent, up from a record low of 3.8 percent a year ago.\nAbout 13 percent of Bangladesh's people fall below the national poverty line of $2 per day, according to World Bank data.\nThe country produces about enough rice to meet demand but imported 4.5 million tonnes of wheat last year to meet demand for that grain, according to the country's food ministry.\nWRONG-HEADED DECISION?\nDespite rising demand for food, Khan Md Aftabuddin, managing director of Sunipun Organics Ltd. - the company that first applied for government permission for ethanol production - said turning grain into fuel would not pose any threat to food security for Bangladesh.\nHe said the byproducts of ethanol production could be used as poultry or fish food, and that more maize could be grown on delta islands if demand for it rises.\n\"If needed, we will produce maize in char lands of the country as raw material for our plant,\" Aftabuddin said. Bangladesh needs to turn to renewable energy to keep its environment clean, he said. But Mohammad Moinuddin Abdullah, secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, said creating fuel using maize - which is increasingly being imported to make up for rice and wheat shortfalls - doesn't seem to make sense.\n\"I do not see any valid reason for using maize and broken rice for ethanol production,\" he said.\nM. Asaduzzaman, a fellow of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies and a member of the country's climate change negotiations team, said he also disagreed with the move toward producing ethanol from grain.\n[caption id=\"attachment_60936\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"870\"] More demand for maize and for land to grow it will hamper staple food production since Bangladesh suffers from acute farmland scarcity Reuters[/caption]\n\"We have tremendous difficulties in livestock nutrition. If maize is now used to produce ethanol, the cost of livestock production will go further up causing further animal protein deficiency,\" said Asaduzzaman, also a former vice chairman of the International Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change.\n\"This is a wrong-headed decision,\" he said.\nBangladesh's per capita carbon emissions are tiny compared to those of more developed countries, and should not be as great a concern as protecting food security, he said.\n\"When we can't meet basic nutritional need, we don't need to go for clean energy,\" he said.\nKhondaker Golam Moazzem, a research director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue, a Dhaka-based think tank, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that he is concerned that ethanol production, once started, could be scaled up in the future, particularly if oil prices eventually rise.\nThat could lead to more demand for maize and for land to grow it. \"Then, staple food production will be hampered since Bangladesh suffers from acute farmland scarcity,\" he warned.\n \n\n\n\n"

How will it affect Bangladesh?\nWe need this treaty because we need to know how much water we are going to get from the Teesta during the dry months so we can plan our agricultural projects accordingly.\nIndia has completely dried out the river on our end during lean period by closing all the gates of the Gazaldoba barrage. That is unexpected from a friendly neighbour.\nThis treaty is a formality, but India cannot ignore our rights to the river water.\nIdeally, this treaty should have two mechanisms: ensuring water flow in the dry period and managing water for the rest of the year in the entire river basin. In addition, it should ensure prevention of flood and river erosion during monsoon.\nTeesta's dry period starts in October, and monsoon starts in April-May. I think the crucial period in the Teesta is September-October, when supplementary irrigation is needed in some areas of the river basin for agriculture.\nDuring dry season, the Teesta gets around 6,000 cusecs of water [1 cusec = 28.32 litres per second]. But Bangladesh needs 8,000 cusecs and India needs 16,000 cusecs. Without releasing more water in the river, it is impossible to meet these demands.\nMy second concern is flood. The Teesta overflows during monsoon. Its water flow typically exceeds 300,000 cusecs, but we have a record of Teesta's water flow exceeding 450,000 cusecs one year. In addition, we face massive river erosion in the Teesta during monsoon.\nTo tackle these issues, we need effective flood management, which can easily be achieved by building a reservoir in the upstream.\nWe heard the treaty had been deferred because West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee did not agree on it with the central government.\nWe heard in the news that Mamata Banerjee claimed the Indian union government did not discuss the details of Teesta treaty with her. But I think the issue is not related to West Bengal. The issue is between two central governments. That means Delhi has to talk to Dhaka and decide on equitable water sharing.\nBut it is said without the West Bengal government's consent, the central government of India cannot go into an agreement with Bangladesh.\nThat is absolutely wrong. When Bangladesh and India discuss sharing water of a trans-boundary river, the state government has nothing to say because the issue is within two central governments.\nThe Ganges Water Sharing Treaty will expire in 2026. What should be the next step regarding this treaty?\nThe Ganges treaty is supposed to be reviewed every five years, but it has never happened. The treaty is renewable without any condition. I believe Bangladesh will be able to renew it, but the discussion should begin in the next two years. Also, this time the treaty should not be time-bound.\n[caption id=\"attachment_54387\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Teesta barrage, an establishment which many in Bangladesh accuse for desertification of northern districts of the country. The picture was captured in early May, 2016 Abu Siddique/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nWe know the Ganges treaty is based on the availability of water at Farakka point. We also learnt that the amount of water in Farakka during the lean period is decreasing. If we renew the treaty, should we decide on the same amount of water as before?\nAt the moment, Bangladesh has no way of knowing what is happening in the upstream Ganges. But Bangladesh and India signed a cooperation agreement in 2011, which means the terms of river management between the two countries can be negotiated.\nIt is time for us to discuss some of the terms. According to the Ganges treaty, the upper riparian country should ensure that the volume of water increases gradually. The water flow in the Ganges was good, but after 1975, India has been withdrawing water from the river at different points. But the treaty asks both the countries to ensure water flow in the river for proper basin-wise river management.\nIf Bangladesh can continue the discussion with all stakeholders, the problems regarding water sharing in all trans-boundary rivers could be resolved.\nYou often say that basin-wise river management might bring the best results in the region. Can you elaborate on that?\nBasin-wise river management is a classic idea. It has been implemented for all international rivers, like the Rhine, the Colorado and the Mekong.\nThe demand and availability of water varies in the upstream and downstream of a river. Usually, the water flow in the upstream surpasses the demand, while it is the opposite in the downstream.\nThe optimum solution to balance the supply and demand could be creating proper modelling of the rivers based on water quantity and quality. This way, we can resolve issues like flood, navigation, irrigation, hydro-power and fisheries for the entire basin of a particular river.\nAll this is covered by basin-wise river management.\nDo you think all the countries in this region will come to a common consensus on this issue?\nThere is no need to bring all the countries to a single platform. A commission should be formed to deal with the issues regarding one particular trans-boundary river. For example, for the Brahmaputra, Bhutan, China, India and Bangladesh should form a joint commission and deal with Brahmaputra basin management.\n[caption id=\"attachment_55764\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Teesta barrage, an establishment which many in Bangladesh accuse for desertification of northern districts of the country. The picture was captured in early May, 2016 Abu Siddique/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nBangladesh is planning to set up Ganges barrage in Goalanda, Rajbari. Why? Do you think it will cause floods in the upstream of the river, like in India's Bihar?\nBangladesh has been receiving a certain volume of water through Farakka barrage during lean period. If we divert one-third of that water to the southwestern districts of the country, it will help to reduce the salinity in that region's water. That can be done only with the barrage in Goalanda. There is no alternative, to my knowledge.\nUsing my experience on this issue, I can say that there is no relation between Farakka barrage and the flood in Bihar. Bihar Chief Minister Nitesh Kumar demands for opening the barrage gates. Of its total 108 gates, four or five always remain closed due to technical problems.\nIf they open those five closed gates, there won't be much difference in the water flow. Kumar's actual demand is to keep the gates open from May to September. He also wants the removal of sediment in the upstream of Farrkka barrage, which is a technical matter.\nWhy does Nitesh Kumar want to open all the gates of Farakka barrage?\nHe is somehow under the impression that the barrage gates remain closed during monsoon, and that is what causes flood in Bihar, but it is not true.\nThe problem is, political leaders can be led to the wrong conclusion too.\nDoes the construction of Ganges barrage depend on India's permission?\nIf you are building something with money borrowed from someone, they will demand a say in the project. But that will not happen if you make it with your own money. India built Farakka barrage with its own money, so they had all control over it. However, I believe the Ganges barrage should be built jointly with India.\n\n\n\n\n"

Under ideal weather conditions, it takes about 90 minutes to reach Hatiya Island from Noakhali on the mainland, from where a speedboat takes 30 minutes more to get to the Char.\nAyesha Ferdaus, the lawmaker from Noakhali 6 (Hatiya) constituency, said local people should have no fear as the new centre will be focused on helping the Rohingya to recover from their traumatic experiences.\n\"Through arranging employment after providing them with counselling, the Rohingya will be helped to return to a normal life. There is nothing to worry about,\" he said.\nDelegations of high-ups from the government and experts from government and non-government organisations have been visiting the area every day to check on progress in the challenging project.\nMany of Bhashan Char's low-lying areas have already been filled with sand and the height of the ground raised in several spots to protect the new centre from river erosion or floods. The sand bar was previously uninhabited.\nHelipads, pontoons and roads are among the new infrastructure under construction to improve accessibility and facilitate internal communication on the island.\nChittagong's Divisional Commissioner Abdul Mannan said: \"We are doing experiments to get a clear idea about how liveable Bhashan Char is or if it would be vulnerable to climate change. Nonetheless, these are all still in the primary stage.\"\nThe recent influx of the Rohingya fleeing brutal persecution by the Myanmar army in Rakhine state prompted the Bangladesh government to assign its navy to the rehabilitation camp project.\nCaptain Aminul Islam Khan of the navy, also the in-charge of Bhashan Char Rohingya Rehabilitation Project, said the Char would be a modern refugee camp.\n\"All kind of facilities including educational institutions, hospitals, recreational centres and playgrounds will be here,\" he said.\nThe in-charge said the Rohingya refugees will be brought to the camp in phases, with as many as 120,000 rehabilitated initially. However, the navy did not clarify how long it could take to bring in the Rohingya.\nFinance Division officials have said the estimated Tk1,000 crore project will be funded entirely by the government and will include the major challenge of damming the char to protect it from regular flooding by seawater.\nThe government in February had announced its plans to rehabilitate the refugees who began arriving from Myanmar in October 2016, drawing some criticism internationally.\nA UN estimate says the latest exodus starting on August 25 had seen around 480,000 Rohingya people enter into Bangladesh until Tuesday.\n \nThe article was first published on Bangla Tribune\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-09-26 00:00:00      \n\nCardinal D'Rozario: The Pope wants the world to know about Bangladesh\n\n\n\n\nSyed Zainul Abedin\n\n\n\n\n Published at 09:42 pm September 26th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nHow does Bangladesh's Christian community view Pope Francis' visit to Dhaka? How important is this visit?\nFor us, and especially for the Catholic community, it is a great inspiration to see the Pope in person. The Christian community is very happy that the Holy Father is visiting Bangladesh.\nThe community will gather in droves to listen to him, to see him in person, to experience him closely and if possible, to touch him.\nThe Christian community is very enthusiastic about the Pope's visit. They are spiritually preparing for the experience.\nHow significant is the visit of the Holy Father's?\nThe Pope is coming to Bangladesh as the head of the church, and as a religious leader. He is also coming to Bangladesh as the head of state of the Vatican, a tiny country of 109 acres of land, which has impact all over the world.\nThe Pope will hold meetings with the president and the prime minister of Bangladesh. He will also meet different religious leaders.\nI see it as a state visit and also a visit to the people. He is scheduled to visit the National Martyrs' Memorial in Savar, and will also visit the Bangabandhu Museum to pay his respect.\nThe other thing that I would like to mention is that Pope Francis loves Bangladesh, which he has expressed with his statements.\nFor example, during the collapse of Rana Plaza in 2013, he termed the working conditions of garment workers as \"modern slavery.\" He also sympathises with the victims of the recent floods in South Asia, including Bangladesh.\nPope also supports the victims of the ongoing Rohingya crisis and let us not forget that I, a Bangladeshi national, was appointed Cardinal for the first time in the history of the country.\nIt proves that the Pope wants the world to know about Bangladesh and its people.\nI hope that he will address climate change issues. The Pope recently wrote a book on world environment titled \"On Care for Our Common Home.\" I am sure Pope Francis will appreciate all the steps that have been taken by Bangladesh to fight climate change.\nIn Bangladesh, there is a unique harmony among different cultures and religions, which the Pope will get to experience. The theme for his visit is \"Harmony and Peace.\" The harmony that exists in Bangladesh will be celebrated in the presence of the Holy Father.\nPope Francis is well aware of the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh. He is happy to know that Bangladesh has not only opened the borders but also opened their heart to receive them [the Rohingya].\nHow do you see the ongoing situation in Myanmar?\nHumanity is under attack in many places, by many people and in many ways. Humanity is under attack across the globe.\nFor us, the oppression of Rohingya is a humanitarian crisis, where we see humanity being attacked before our eyes. They have the right to have land, home and to live peacefully.\nHow do you see Bangladesh's handling of the crisis?\nThe example that Bangladesh has set by letting them [the Rohingya] enter, should be a lesson for the people in Myanmar. It should appeal to their moral compass.\nI believe that our attitude towards the refugees has been best expressed by the prime minister. The Rohingya people are her brothers and sisters, and she is with them.\nCould you please elaborate on your perspective about the religious harmony in Bangladesh?\nFirst of all, the people of Bangladesh are religious. In Bangladesh, secularism does not automatically mean absence of religious view, contrary to some other countries. In Bangladesh, secularism allows every religion to coexist. This is the kind of attitude and mentality that we have.\nHowever, once in a while, we witness conflicts over religious issues, but in reality those are mostly political problems. There are some militant groups that are trying to disrupt the communal harmony and peace in the country.\nI will try to explain this in my own way. Winds can create waves in a river, but underneath the water there is calm, peace, and harmony. These are the treasured values that we have.\nWhen the two terror attacks occurred in Sholakia and in Gulshan, I said that they [militants] do not belong to our culture. Their so-called ideology is something imported from outside.\nFollowers of all religions have the responsibility to safeguard our culture and our values. No one should destroy our core identity. Let us be religious.\nHow can religious views and values play a role in pacifying this Rohingya crisis?\nAs long as our focus is on the people, as long as our focus is on the victims, we will be able to find a solution to the ongoing crisis.\nPeople can face oppression for a multitude of reasons, be it historical, political or religious. For example, I learned that the Rohingya people are being thrown out of their homes and some of the big countries are backing this atrocity, because Myanmar has promised them industrial zones in the region.\nCan this be a valid reason for displacing people from their homes?\nPeople have the right to live on their land and we should focus on that. We must not view the crisis as a religious, ethnic, political or a geopolitical issue.\n\nAll the religions call for peace, harmony and humanity, but why is the image of these religions being tarnished by criminal acts and terrorist activities of some groups of people?\nReligion has not been understood in the proper sense. The core ideology of religion is about eliminating divisions among people. If the foundation of a religion is God, people will see that He [God] does not discriminate.\nHe [God] does not say that I will not shower rain on Hindus or I will not protect the Christians.\nReligion does not divide, nor does it support discrimination. Devout people are usually the silent majority in a religion.\nHowever, there are people who use their religion to justify bigotry and discrimination. Why?\nOne thing is very clear to us. God has given us intelligence. We have been created in the image of God. We have intelligence to know or understand what is good and what is not. We have freedom to take decision in favour of good or in favour of evil.\nWe must decide how to act according to the instructions of God.\nWhat is your call to the people in tackling this humanitarian crisis?\nI would appeal to keep politics aside when it comes to this crisis and to not view it from a religious perspective. It is humanity that is under attack.\nAs a Christian, I feel for them. With all my heart, I am ready to do everything on my part to be at their [Rohingya refugees'] side. Through Caritas, I am trying to help the Rohingya refugees.\nOne of my favourite quotes from Saint Irenaeus is: \"The glory of God is man fully alive.\"\nA man is really a human being fully alive through his freedom, his intelligence, and his humanity.\nDo you believe that Myanmar will respond to Pope's call for peace and humanity?\nHe has already called for peace in Myanmar on the Rohingya issue. The Holy Father will surely address the issue, but, he will do so with respect to the internal affairs of the country.\nThe Pope will not compromise with his values. He will talk about peace and about the rights of the people.\nEvery country has its internal problems to deal with but the core values of humanity should not be compromised.\nThe right of the people to live must not be compromised.\nThe Holy Father does not claim to be a religious leader for everyone but he does address important issues, be it economics, politics, business, climate change and other things happening in the world because he is a spiritual leader for the people, not a religious leader.\nHe is here for every one of us and not just for the Christians. That is why he is considered as the voice of the conscience of the world and people respect him. He goes beyond the boundaries of nations, cultures, groups and, or religions.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-07-27 00:00:00      \nRapid industrialisation all over the world has given people cushy lives. It is undeniable that energy is the cornerstone of development in the modern era. With the passage of every single day, the demand for energy is climbing to its peak, and countries are now busy competing with each other to meet the growing demands of energy. But unhealthy competition in the energy sector has brought environmental issues like climate change upon us. Now we frequently have to withstand the devastating impacts of climate change-induced disasters like storms, cyclones, floods, etc. Evidently, Bangladesh is the most vulnerable country in this respect in the South Asian region, which means we have to immediately rethink the energy landscape to combat the climate change-caused natural disasters. Examining the world energy profile, it appears that demand of the global energy will further grow up to 40% by 2040. At present, gas is a dominant fuel in generating energy. In the upcoming days, coal will replace gas and hold the first position in the energy sector -- producing more emissions across the globe. Bangladesh is no exception. It is predicted that reserve gas will be exhausted by 2020 and so it's looking for an alternative source of energy. It is eying to increase coal use from 2% to over 50% in electricity supply by 2030. Dozens of coal-run electricity-generating plants are in the pipeline including a controversial one like Rampal. It is expected that Rampal alone will provide alone one-fifth of the country's total production of electricity comprising 1,320 mega watts. Coal has become appealing for countries like Bangladesh and India for different reasons. Being cheap, coal is cost-effective, and so it opens doors to opportunities to produce new energy plants. Alarmingly, China and India are following the easy and economic way by introducing coal-run energy plants. Bangladesh should explore alternatives to coal for securing a better future for the next generations of Bangladeshis From 2002 to 2012, the global coal trade has doubled -- where China and India account for the majority of coal imports. Then the question may rise: Are we not counting the risks of coal energy in this region? Risks and fatalities  Bangladesh is a densely populated country, and pollution from coal energy will be catastrophic. Air pollution will be the direct result of coal-run electricity plants -- worsening the situation, further damaging the environment. Coal pollutes the air, water, and soil all together leading to negative impacts on human and other species as well.  Environmental specialists and activists are already protesting against the Rampal project, which can be detrimental to the Sundarbans. There have been many controversies over the Rampal project. Both countries should take rational decisions considering its environmental impacts in the Sundarbans region. Bangladesh should explore alternatives to coal for securing a better future for the next generations of Bangladeshis. Currently, gas ranks number one in the energy sector of Bangladesh, accounting for about 80% of total energy. It is expected that Bay of Bengal can be a good source of gas fields. Bangladesh needs to invest in exploration to take advantage of Bay of Bengal resources. Renewed hope  Moreover, the much talked-about renewable energy sources should be considered, as they are environment-friendly. Being blessed with lots of rivers, Bangladesh has good potential in producing hydro-electricity, utilising the current of the rivers. Solar is considered to be the most viable source of renewable energy. Bangladeshis striving to generate more energy from solar system by 2020 according to its seventh five year plan. Other sources like wind and biomass sources also should be explored for renewable energy. Due to several constraints and challenges, renewable energy is still not popular in Bangladesh. First of all, in many cases, renewable energy becomes costly for the producers. We have had bad experiences like the Kaptai project -- which did not bring the desired results, and ultimately emerged as a development disaster. Moreover, there is a lack of incentives from the government and non-government agencies in this sector. Right now, at a macro level, governments should provide incentives by granting loans to renewable energy-oriented enterprises. Innovation and entrepreneurship should be encouraged by the governmental and non-governmental sector in the renewable energy sector. On the other hand, at a micro level, consumers should be more conscious and wise while using electricity. Solar panels can be used as an alternative source of power in households that can afford it. It's time to turn to clean energy. Naim Ebna Rahman is a graduate student of development studies."

The situation is even worse on the routes that have ferry services - which are frequently getting disrupted due to strong currents in the rivers.\n Due to these problems, a trip is taking three or four times longer than what it would normally take, bus owners said.\nRoad Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said there was no need for the holidaymakers to worry about travelling on the roads.\n\"We have taken all necessary steps to ensure smooth travelling by repairing all the damaged roads,\" he said on Friday during a visit to Chandra intersection in Gazipur. \"All the engineers of the Roads and Highways Department are working on this problem. They have been warned not to neglect their duties using the excuse of rain; they are to take necessary precautions so the roads are protected from rain.\"\nHowever, sources in the bus services said there had hardly been any progress in the repair work and the trips were still taking painstakingly longer than normal.\nAdded to the outward rush of homeward-bound people is the trucks carrying sacrificial cattle into the capital city. There are also the makeshift roadside cattle markets that are taking up space on the roads and highways and disrupting the traffic, creating bottlenecks at important junctions and making an already bad situation worse.\n\"Amid this circumstance, if the rain continues, it will get even more difficult for people to go home,\" said a transport worker.\nHighways in dilapidated conditions\nThe recent floods have severely affected the country's road network, especially in the northern and northeastern districts.\nFour of six major highways that connect all 64 districts in the country with Dhaka - Dhaka-Khulna, Dhaka Sylhet, Dhaka Barisal and Dhaka-North Bengal - are covered with potholes and/or submerged in floodwater.\nAccording to the Roads and Highways Department, flood has cut off 17 roads from the country's road network. Dinajpur and Kurigram districts are completely disconnected, and road transport in Netrokona has collapsed as five of the district's major roads are under water.\nThe situation is similar in Jamalpur, Faridpur and Shariatpur districts.\nAround 600km of roads in the northern districts of Rangpur, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Bogra, Gaibandha, Joypurhat, Dinajpur, Thakurgaon, Panchagarh and Nilphamari have been damaged by the floods. These roads include 73 national and regional highways as well as district roads. At least 19 bridges and culverts have been damaged as well.\nRoad Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader recently visited Sirajganj recently where he instructed to make the roads usable in 10 days, our Sirajganj correspondent reported.\nFollowing the instruction, the road and transport authorities started implementing the \"herringbone system\" - laying up bricks on the damaged roads - as a temporary solution, but it is failing due to rain.\nInsiders in the Roads and Highways Department said Eid rush puts excess pressure on the roads even when the roads are in good condition. If a small part of a highway is unusable, it creates huge traffic congestion.\nFerry services in deep trouble\nThe Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) operates 19 small and large ferries between Paturia ghat in Manikganj and Daulatdia ghat in Rajbari to carry thousands of vehicles across the Padma River.\nBIWTC sources said most of these ferries were old, and they were facing immense difficulties in operating their services due to the strong current in the Padma. Each ferry is barely making 20 trips across the river every day, whereas normally the ferries can make 30 trips.\nBesides, three of the ferries are out of commission, putting extra pressure on the ferries that are in operation.\nUsually, it takes around 45 minutes for a ferry to cross the Padma, but due to the current state of water flow in the Padma, it is taking at least one and a half hours, the sources said.\nAs a result, the queues of vehicles waiting for the ferries are getting longer, making the duration of the journey two or three times longer.\nWorkers at the ferry ghats said because of this situation, there will be long tailbacks on both sides of the river with an average waiting time of three hours. Most buses will miss their schedule, they added.\nFerry service on Shimulia (Mawa)-Kathalbari route is facing the same problem; ferries are taking almost double the time to cross the Padma due to the currents.\nBus owners, passengers worried\nTraffic congestion has already gotten bad on Dhaka-Chittagong, Dhaka-Khulna, Dhaka-Mymensingh and Dhaka-Sylhet highways.\n\"Buses are already getting delayed, takes almost double the time due to the damaged highways in the northern districts such as Rajshahi and Khulna. Sylhet-bound roads are also in a sorry state,\" Bangladesh Bus-Truck Owners' Association President Faruk Talukder Sohel told the Dhaka Tribune.\nNarrow bridges, long wait at the ferry ghats have slowed down the traffic on the highways to Khulna, Jessore and Barisal, he said.\n\"At this rate, I am worried that the trips may take double or even triple the usual time as Eid approaches.\"\nHe further said if the government had taken timely actions to ensure uninterrupted ferry services ferry and properly planned passage through the bridges, the situation would not have gotten so bad.\n\"The Dhaka-Chittagong highway has been upgraded to four lanes, but the three major bridges on that highway are still two-lane,\" said Green Line Paribahan General Manager Abdus Sattar.\n\"As a result, it takes hours to pass through Meghna and Gumti bridges and creates huge traffic tailbacks. Because of that, a six-hour trip is now taking nearly double the time,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-11-29 00:00:00      \nBangladesh has been able to reach impressive heights on the economic growth scale over the past few decades. As per a World Bank report, our Gross National Income (GNI) shot up from $100 to $1,220 between 1972 to 2015. Notwithstanding this fact, Bangladesh is still under-performing relative to its goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2021 -- an aspiration that demands an approximate annual growth of 8% per year. A lot of our successes are being eaten up by natural calamities, vulnerabilities, and episodic pressure or onslaught on the economy. This is where the insurance sector comes in. The presence of a well-rounded and diligently crafted national insurance framework reflects sound risk management; which helps in mitigating uncertainty and reducing costs of financing, thus boosting both household and organisational confidence. This eases the process of investing on higher risk-return activities and ultimately powers long-run economic growth. The sad statistics In comparison to the escalating trend of per capita income ($1602 as of 2017), the insurance penetration rate in Bangladesh is alarmingly low -- a shocking 0.7% in global comparison during 2016, out of which only 0.2% consists of life insurance. To put it in further perspective, the highest insurance penetration in the world is at 18%, belonging to Taiwan. According to the World Bank, only 4 out of 1,000 people in Bangladesh have life insurance, coupled with prevailing property risks arising from frail general insurance penetration. The institutional infrastructure of Bangladesh's insurance sector, namely the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority (IDRA), is struggling, especially in terms of an impoverished regulatory capacity, as well as the lack of qualified personnel -- which itself might be critically stemming from the weak operational capacity of the Bangladesh Insurance Academy (BIA). All in all, the 0.7% is without a doubt, an awfully dire piece of data for a country of 163 million. The geographical position of Bangladesh exposes the nation to a wide range of natural disasters, like floods, earthquakes, and cyclones. Such forms of force majeure risks could pose hefty monetary tolls on an economy, with recovery and reconstruction costs reaching billions of dollars. Only 4 out of 1,000 people in Bangladesh have life insurance, coupled with prevailing property risks arising from frail general insurance penetration Cyclone Sidr of 2007 for instance, cost an estimated $1.67 billion. In cases like this, a sturdy insurance market can dramatically cushion the adverse impacts on government spending. Due to the compressed radar of insurance services in Bangladesh, majority of the population, especially the ones living in rural regions, suffer the most during ta catastrophe. By bolstering our insurance regulation, and modernising our systems to facilitate deep and organised network penetration of micro-insurance throughout Bangladesh, a strong level of economic resiliency could be gained at the face of unanticipated forces, especially in rural Bangladesh. In recent times, we have seen how the Thail government avoided large erosion in their national balance-sheet and budgetary priorities during the recent floods and asset losses, with most of its assets being insured and appropriately re-insured.  Boosting our economy The insurance regulatory reform is not just an aid for a catastrophic aftermath; it can also be a driver of exponential economic growth. By streamlining the regulatory infrastructure in terms of data warehousing, governance, systems, resources, and processes in adjustment with international insurance standards such as the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS); Bangladesh can exhibit a reliable and well-balanced insurance platform. This, in turn, can boost investor confidence, leading to an increase in both local capital investments as well as FDIs. Furthermore, high influx of capital commonly translates to a rise in infrastructure development projects. These types of projects typically seek long-term borrowings, while the insurance market pursues long-term investments. Matching these two vital requirements translates to massive economic synergies, thus bolstering the insurance market much further. From an alternate perspective, amplification and enhancement of the insurance industry can also help generate more jobs in the economy, and thus, support our employment scenario. In short, rehabilitation of insurance regulations could result in multifold positive impacts on the economy of Bangladesh. Bring about a reform Firstly, there must be clarity and integrity in the policies and sales practices. Insurances happen to be fairly more complex in nature than most other products and services, which provides a platform for information asymmetry. This means that unfair policies and malpractices could be undertaken by piggybacking on the customers' comparatively minor level of technical knowledge, hence generating inefficiency in the insurance market. Stringent monitoring and evaluation of the regulatory framework is thus required as a result to create failsafe standards that can help curb corruption and negligence from the insurers' side. Secondly, the system needs to become more customer-oriented. We must start by re-examining the traditional framework and learn to reconstruct an insolvency regulation which is in alignment with evolving and varying customer needs. Further research and development will thus be required in the technical and financial paradigms to bring about more innovative features to providing insurance solutions; an increase in insurance awareness initiatives, and much importantly, a robust program for extracting and refining a pool of innovative and sincere professionals. Bangladesh seems to be an untapped gold mine for the insurance industry. A global report by Lloyd's projected that a meagre 1% rise in penetration in Bangladesh could contribute to as much as $4.4bn in savings. Nevertheless, a bumper harvest such as this could only be reaped by taking a sincere and gigantic step to modernise our insurance framework, starting with facing and examining its deep-seated weaknesses and loopholes. Embracing technology as a solution-builder would also make our engagements more rewarding here. Mamun Rashid is an economic analyst and partner at PwC."

The administration has started making a list of the estimated 1,300 affected farmers for financial support.\nOver the week, many farmers were seen cutting down unripe paddy for fear that the flood would continue and the crop would be destroyed.\nSingra upazila Agriculture Officer Sazzad Hossein said water entering the Beel from the Atrai and Gur river through a canal had flooded about 40-50 hectares of paddy in Sardahnagar Chougram, 10 hectares in Patkol in the municipal area, Berabari and Kawa-Tickri of Dahia union, 10-15 hectares in Tajpur Beel, and 10-12 hectare in Satardighi area.\nThe administration on Tuesday called on farmers to volunteer to build a barrage at Sherkol area to block the water. In light of the recent flooding and destruction of crops in the northeastern districts, the farmers were panicked and begun cutting down their green paddy.\nThis season, Singra farmers have cultivated paddy on 37,200 hectares of land, the officer said.\nAlmost all of the paddy is now ripe, Sazzad said, but the BRRI 29 paddy might take another 15 days to ripen.\n\"Farmers cutting down this BRRI 29 paddy now will face losses as they will lose about half of their yield.\"\nCosts go up\nFarmer Nasir uddin of Patul village of Naldanga upazila said he cultivated paddy on around 20 bigha of land.\n\"I faced losses in the BRRI-29 Paddy, and I am going to face losses in the Miniket because labour costs have suddenly gone up,\" he said.\n[caption id=\"attachment_60313\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\"] A boat filled with harvested paddy in Natore's Chalan Beel.

      "text": "Date Published:2017-07-30 00:00:00      \n\nIs Hatirjheel project responsible for waterlogging?\n\n\n\n\nShahed Shafiq\n\n\n\n\n Published at 02:46 pm July 30th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 10:41 am July 31st, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThough the expensive Hatirjheel project was mainly taken up to reduce traffic congestion, conserve rainwater, prevent floods and water stagnation, improve water filtration and add to the aesthetic beauty of the capital city, the project has spectacularly failed at preventing floods. Instead, it is creating water stagnation throughout large parts of the city after each rainfall.\nAccording to sources involved with the project, nine mechanical scanners redirect Dhaka Water Supply and Sewage Authority's (Wasa) drains and water from surrounding houses into Hatirjheel after the rains. But the scanners are unable to handle the water flow if rainfall exceeds 50mm, flooding the entire region. The flooding of Hatirjheel was at fault for the stagnant water in Dhaka's Dhanmondi, Karwan Bazaar and adjacent areas on July 26.\nJamal Akhter, the director of the Haitrjheel project, said: \"We use mechanical scanners to filter and clean the water that is redirected into Hatirjheel. But when there is excessive rainfall, the scanners cannot handle the pressure. We are then forced to open the lids of the scanners, which allow dirty water from the households nearby to flow into the water body and pollute the environment.\"\n\"If we want to stop the pollution of Hatirjheel's waters, we will have to separate the storm drainage and rainwater drainage systems. But Wasa is not at all concerned with this. If we could have separated the two, we could just have let rainwater flow directly into Hatirjheel since rainwater is not dirty. It would also have reduced the time it takes to clean the sewerage line's flow of water. Now, since they both get mixed together, we have to filter both the waters together.\"\n\nAlso Read- Can Dhaka's waterlogging problem really be resolved?\n\nHe said the capital city's canals and drainage systems are extremely ineffective, causing water to stagnate each time it rains. The Hatirjheel's scanners cannot clean the combined water flow from sewage lines and rainfall at the same time. This was the chief cause of the flooding that occurred after the rains on the night of July 26.\nProf Mujibur Rahman, head of Buet's Civil Engineering Department, said: \"From the very beginning we had warned that Wasa's drainage capacity was not sufficient to supply the nine scanners at Hatirjheel. This causes water stagnation because of improper water flow. The Dhaka Wasa's drains are clogged with solid waste. They have not improved their drainage systems in the last 40 years. This forces the scanners to be opened during excessive rainfall, which pollutes the Hatirjheel's waters.\"\n\"Our advice was to create a sewage treatment plant to filter sewage flow. It was supposed to be built 5km from Rampura bridge. The plant was supposed to keep waterflow constant after filtering the sewage. But no one listened to our advices then,\" he added.\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"690\"] People have to use whatever they can to get by the waterlogged streets Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune [/caption]\nAccording to Dhaka Wasa data, almost 600,000 tonnes of sewage from the area between Dhanmondi and Rampura flow through Hatirjheel into the Balu river and eventually into the Shitalakkha river.\nAt an event on July 16 hosted by the Dhaka North City Corporation, the FDC flyover between Hatirjheel and Karwan Bazaar was said to be at fault for the waterlogging situation in Karwan Bazaar and surrounding areas. The area's water drainage systems were said to be closed because of the flyover, resulting in the whole area becoming waterlogged.\nOne of Hatirjheel's mechanical scanners, placed adjacent to the Sonargaon Hotel, intercepts sewerage and rain waterflow from Karwan Bazaar, Panthapath, Dhanmondi, Kalabagan, Kathalbagan, Bangla Motor and surrounding areas. But on Wednesday, the whole area was submerged after only 65mm of rain. Mogbazaar, Modhubaag, Ulon, Mohanagar Project, Daspara, Rampura, Merul, Badda, Gulshan, Tejgaon and other areas near Hatirjheel were also similarly flooded.\nThe DSCC's Superintendent Engineer Asaduzzaman said: \"Not enough water can pass through the Hatirjheel's sluice gates. There are three mechanical scanners at each of the gates. This causes some resistance to the usual flow of water. The gates are also not that wide. This makes it impossible for them to operate during heavy rains. So the gates are forced to be opened, causing situations like that on Wednesday.\"\nThe project was approved in October 2007. Although the project was supposed to be completed in three years by June 2010, work on it began in December 2008. The project was later redesigned and allotted another 1.5 years. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the project on January 2, 2013 and opened it to the public. The Bangladesh military's Special Works Organisation (SWO) was in charge of overseeing the project.\nThe article was first published on the Bangla Tribune\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-08-13 00:00:00      \nMonsoon floods and landslides have killed at least 66 people across Nepal and India but officials fear that figure could almost double as rescuers search for dozens believed lost under mud and in submerged villages. Authorities Sunday upgraded the death toll from flash flooding across landlocked Nepal to 49 as the water kept rising, forcing thousands to flee for higher ground. \"Another 17 are missing. Search and rescue works are underway but the water levels have not declined yet,\" said Shankar Hari Acharya, the chief of Nepal's national emergency centre. The Red Cross estimated a higher death toll of 53, with dozens more missing and injured and thousands of homes destroyed. In neighbouring India, rescuers were desperately trying to reach two packed buses swept into a gorge by a landslide so powerful it destroyed an entire stretch of highway. The coaches had stopped for a tea break around midnight Saturday in Himachal Pradesh when tonnes of rock and mud cascaded down a mountainside. Seventeen bodies have been recovered from the accident site in the Himalayan state, said Sandeep Kadam, a senior official at the scene. But dozens were still missing somewhere at the bottom of the ravine, with soldiers and rescuers clawing through the mud and rock to reach them. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his condolences and prayers for those affected by the accident. \"Pained by the loss of lives due to landslide-related accidents in HP's Mandi district,\" he posted on Twitter, using the acronym for Himachal Pradesh state.  The disaster followed days of heavy rain, which loosens the soil on steep hillsides and threatens villages at the foot of mountains every monsoon season. Hundreds have died across India in torrential rain, floods and landslides since the onset of the wet season in April. In Nepal the toll from this year's monsoon - which typically lasts from late June until the end of August - has already eclipsed last year, with more than 100 people confirmed dead. Last weekend in the central lowlands, four girls from the same family drowned when they fell into a flooded roadside ditch. Nepal's weather department warned that heavy rain was expected to continue for another day, following days of torrential downpours. Footage aired on Nepali TV showed villagers wading through waist-high water with their belongings and using boats to reach higher ground. Families perched on trees with young children overnight as flood waters swept away homes in a village in the southern district of Chitwan, local media reported. In the popular jungle safari resort of Sauraha in Chitwan, hotels were forced to shift their guests to higher floors as water rushed in. Biratnagar airport in the eastern district of Morang was closed after being submerged in a metre of water, authorities at the international terminal said. \"I have already instructed authorities concerned to rescue flood victims, move them to safer locations and immediately provide relief to them,\" Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said in a video recording Saturday."

      "text": "Date Published:2017-08-12 00:00:00      \n\nBangladesh towards 100% renewable energy\n\n\n\n\nDipal Chandra Barua\n\n,\n \nDipal Chandra Barua\n\n\n\n\n Published at 12:42 am August 12th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nRapid urbanisation, fuelled by stable economic growth, has created a huge energy demand in Bangladesh. It is well known that energy plays a vital role in poverty eradication, economic growth, sustainable infrastructure development, and ensuring security of a country.\nIn Bangladesh, electricity is the most widely used form of energy. Future economic growth significantly depends on the availability of electricity. At present, about 72% of the total population has access to electricity, and electricity supply is not adequately reliable.\nBangladesh is starving for energy for last few decades since its power generation is mainly depended on imported fossil fuel and natural gas. The present government has successfully increased electricity generation, yet grid electricity is not reachable in the remote areas of the country due to lack of infrastructure and longstanding distribution facilities.\nIn recent years, the world is moving towards green electricity generation to reduce carbon-dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional electricity production is the primary source (29%) of greenhouse gas emission.\nAt present, greenhouse gas emission affects the climate directly by raising the global temperature. Bangladesh is one of the top climate vulnerable country among 48 nations. It is facing the impact of climate change such as rising sea levels, increase of salinity, heavy rainfall, floods, and landslides.\nAs a vulnerable country, both private and public sectors of Bangladesh have taken multiple initiatives to move towards renewable electricity production to protect the environment and for better living conditions. The government has established SREDA to provide policy support and guidelines for sustainable growth of renewable energy.\nThe government of Bangladesh has set an ambitious goal of providing electricity connection to every rural household. Solar and other renewable energy can be the key component of this ambitious goal.\nIn some rural areas of Bangladesh, people live distant from the main grid connection to have reliable, affordable, and efficient electricity connections for their development.\nTo ensure energy access, energy security and pollution free clean electricity for all there is not much alternative available for Bangladesh except Renewable Energy especially solar energy.\nSolar energy has very small share in the present energy mix in Bangladesh. We host the fastest growing Solar Home System program in the world with over 50,000 SHS unit installations per month in the recent past.\nAs of 2017, Bangladesh has the world's largest SHS program with about 5 million SHS. Over 30 million people are benefitting directly from solar energy and over 100,000 new employments have already been created.\nBangladesh is blessed with year round sunshine (over 300 days per year) and has an enormous potential for solar energy. We have been utilising solar power wisely and using its experience towards diversifying renewable energy (RE) for maximum use.\nThe country has made significant progress in the rural renewable energy development by installing SHS in the off-grid areas. Back in 1996, SHS became popular among the rural people of Bangladesh for its affordable monthly installment-based financial model at the price of kerosene.\nGreen Technology Centers (GTC) were established in rural areas to train rural women, for capacity-building, and after-sales services at clients' door steps. A strong network of supply chain and branches also help SHS become popular and acceptable.\nAt present, people can easily charge their mobile phones, watch television, use fans, children can study better, and people can do their important household chores at night with the Solar Home System (SHS).\nBangladesh government has taken a systematic approach towards renewable energy development. The initiative includes development of awareness, legal and regulatory framework, institutional development, and financing mechanism to drive the RE sector.\nSome Systems (SHS) in Bangladesh has ignited the future prospects for solar energy, and will expedite to make the country the first solar nation in the world. Along with the SHS, 617 Solar Irrigation Pumps (SIP) have already been installed, along with solar street lights in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, and remote rural areas of the country, 7 solar mini-grids in remote islands, urban rooftop solar program, and solar-powered arsenic water treatment plants are complementing the effort to generate clean power.\nCommunity-based solar approach such as solar irrigation pumps, solar mini-grid, arsenic water treatment plants, and solar street lights have the potential of benefitting the community people by ensuring food security, arsenic free pure water, improved socio-economic conditions in off-grid areas of Bangladesh etc.\nIt's possible to produce additional electricity of 30,000MW from the utilisation of solar PV at schools, colleges, universities, mosques, temples madrasahs, government buildings, factories, bus stations, train stations, unused lands, community-based PV plants, and grid tie mega projects.\nAt present, more than 1.6 million irrigation pumps are there and among them 1.3 million pumps are run by diesel. To replace traditional diesel-run irrigation pumps, 617 solar irrigation pumps have already been installed. By replacing all these diesel-run pumps, about 10,000MW electricity can be produced by solar energy.\nAs we know, Bangladesh is committed to achieve 17 Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, which includes combating climate change and increasing energy access from renewable energy sources.\nAs a climate vulnerable country, and for sustainable energy development and energy security, a Bangladesh solar mission needs to be designed to achieve SDGs by 2030 and to build the foundation to reach 100% renewable energy (RE) in the future.\nBangladesh has huge potential, but it must overcome many challenges, especially the challenges of global warming and energy crisis along with poverty reduction to realise its full potential. We can dream of a future where RE technology is the major contributor to our energy mix.\nWe can dream of providing all the modern facilities to thousands of rural villages through the next decade. Moving towards renewable energy can bring a true green revolution for the rural people by developing agricultural output, offering food security, providing modern facilities, creating new businesses and jobs for both men & women.\nFrom the experiences of the last two decades, we can say that solar energy has become very familiar and accepted by the people of Bangladesh.\nProper planning and implementation of a sustainable technological, financial, and socially accepted business model articulated through Bangladesh's solar mission, strong government policy, proper investment policy for investors, ensuring affordable technologies and quality products, and strong research and development will gradually transform the nation towards 100% RE, and we can dream of Bangladesh to become the first solar nation by 2041.\n\n\n\n\n"

Last year, the price stood below the Tk500 mark.\nHigh prices at the mill gate have already led to the increase of retail prices. Now unpacked refined salt is selling at Tk25 a kg, whereas the rate was Tk18-19 just a week ago.\n\"The government will take stern action against the unscrupulous salt traders if they increase the prices abnormally ahead of the Eid,\" the commerce secretary told the Dhaka Tribune.\nThe Bangladesh Tanners Association (BTA) has also been protesting the salt price inflation.\nUsually, a total of 30,000 tonnes salt is needed to process the raw hide that is expected to be collected from across the country during Eid-ul-Azha.\nBut in a press conference in Dhaka on August 19, the BTA alleged that some unscrupulous businesspeople had increased the prices of salt creating an artificial crisis in the market ahead of the Eid-ul Azha.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-08-27 00:00:00      \n\nWill everyone have electricity by 2018 or by 2021?\n\n\n\n\nAminur Rahman Rasel\n\n\n\n\n Published at 01:14 am August 27th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nGetting electricity to everyone in the country is one of Awami League's election promises. In its 2014 manifesto, the party set a deadline of five years to accomplish this task.\nAlthough the government appears to have made significant progress in the direction of hundred percent electrification, it is unclear if the goal will be achieved by 2018.\nIn a speech made in a special book published on the occasion of National Power and Energy Week 2016, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina hoped that they would be able to provide electricity to every home by 2021.\nHowever, the State Minister for Power Nasrul Hamid maintains that it can be done by 2018. The minister reiterated this in a seminar at Biduyt Bhaban in the city on August 19.\nCritics are not convinced. Consumers Association of Bangladesh Energy Adviser Prof M Shamsul Alam said the government's statements did not match the actual progress.\n\"This is nothing but political stunt. There is no similarity between the statements and the progress made in the reality. We expect the government to meet the target to make satisfactory developments,\" he said.\nThe Rural Electrification Board (REB) is playing the key role between six distribution agencies and companies to accomplish the task. They have already implemented several projects and a number of projects are ongoing.\nOfficials and contractors related to REB project implementation said around 47% of the consumers were getting electricity when the government took charge in 2009.\nAccording to REB, around 80% of the population now avails electricity. However, 80% coverage does not mean that 80% of the country is connected to the grid in terms of area.\nThere are 491 upazilas in the country; three of them are islands that can only be connected to the grid at a massive cost. So REB's target is to get power to 488 upazilas.\nOut of 488 upazilas, only 16 upazilas have electricity connections in their entire areas. There are 10 other upazilas where this has been accomplished, which the prime minister was scheduled to inaugurate on August 20, but this was cancelled due to floods.\nREB says another 35 upazilas are now ready to launch full electrification. By December 2017, the REB is expecting to add another 50 upazilas to this list.\nPut together, all of these only covers 111 upazilas or less than one fourth of the target upazilas.\nOfficials said the 2021 target would be more appropriate considering the prevailing status of the project.\nPower contractors remarked that whereas it had taken 39 years to bring electricity to half of the country's upazilas the government is trying to connect the remaining half in 10 years, which is a difficult task.\nAfter the government took power, there was a project for 1.8 million consumers which was delayed for two years. In addition, four other projects taken for divisional areas also saw delays, which are core reasons for the current situation, officials said.\nLack of raw materials used for the task, manpower crisis and difficulties in assigning people for the projects led to this situation.\nPower Division officials who wished to remain anonymous, said much of the progress in rural electrification was attributable to the current REB Chairman Moin Uddin, who they described as a hard-working and sincere official. But the officials said his work was bogged down by many incompetent and insincere officials in REB and the Palli Bidyut Samity.\nThe government took a number of projects for supply of electricity, but the volume of transmission, distribution lines and sub-stations was insufficient to meet the target. There is also a crisis in power production, leading to uncertainty in meeting the target.\nAn official of REB seeking anonymity said there were at least 15 Upazilas that REB cannot bring under 100% electrification by 2020 due to lack of progress of work.\n\"If we can bring 90% of the villages under electrification by 2018, that would also be a major success,\" REB Chairman Maj Gen Moin Uddin told the Dhaka Tribune.\n\"We are expecting to bring rest of the upazilas by bringing 70-80% of them under electrification and that would be a major satisfaction for the consumers, also a success for us,\" he added.\nHe said that places that were difficult to connect to the grid would have mini-grids with renewable energy as source.\nTo achieve the goal, REB needs to establish over 10 million new power connections and extend distribution lines by around 100,000 km.\nMaj Gen Moin Uddin said to achieve the target by 2018, three years earlier than the previous target, is a big challenge.\nAccording to estimates, by 2021 the number of power consumers will raise from 9.7 million to 23 million, an increase of almost 230%. The peak demand will rise from 4,500MW to 9,200MW, an increase of 100%.\n\"At present, REB is running 16 consumer connection projects estimated to end by 2019. In order to implement the 2021 target we are going to take on seven new projects,\" the REB chairman said.\nEstablished in 1977 to ensure rural people's access to electricity, REB has been working in association with 80 Palli Bidyut Samitys.\nState Minister for Power Nasrul Hamid said: \"We are hopeful about doing this by 2018. But it may take more time. It is not a fault if we miss the deadline.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

Otherwise the decision will be granted.\n\"As no complaints or objections have been lodged against the certification, Ilish can now be considered a Bangladeshi GI product,\" Sanowar Hossain said.\nAccording to the act, geographical indication (GI) is a sign which defines the source and contains the goodwill of a product that originated in a particular area, like Ilish from Padma, chamcham from Tangail and kataribhog from Dinajpur.\nThe objective of introducing the act was to protect the interest of producers by allowing them to use a particular sign through registration.\nThe validity of a particular registered GI product will remain for five years. The producer will have to apply for re-registration after the validity expires.\n\nRegarding the applications under process, the registrar told the Dhaka Tribune: \"An application does not ensure that all of them will get registered. We have to ensure that the products have the specific characteristic and the unique quality.\"\nEarlier, Bangladesh formulated an ordinance named Geographical Indications of Goods (registration and protection) Ordinance 2008, which identified 66 products as the country's GI products.\nOf them, three were fish, eight were vegetables, 14 were agricultural products, 48 were food items and 18 were other products including Jamdani Saree and Nakshi Kantha.\nThe government formulated the GI Act 2013 in line with the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement signed on January 1, 1995 among the World Trade Organisation and member nations.\n\nRegarding the process of getting certified as a GI product from Bangladesh, the DPDT registrar said: \"Applying for GI certification is not an easy process. The applicant has to show the historical background of the product like ancient documents and the product's uniqueness, which is difficult.\"\nFor instance, he said that Department of Fisheries took around a year to submit the application for Ilish.\nRegistering a particular product like Jamdani with a GI sign would benefit producers by giving them more financial and business opportunities due to its goodwill.\n\nBangladesh has already lost its famous products like Nakshi Kantha and Fazli mango for failing to pass the law in due time.\nAsked about the GI products that India has already registered as its own, Registrar Sanowar said Bangladesh could also register those products because of their origin and market them with the GI sign.\nAccording to India's Geographical Indications Registry, Nakshi Kantha was registered as a GI product from the country in 2008, and Fazli Mango and Jamdani Saree in 2009.\nThe registry refers to Jamdani Saree as \"Uppada Jamdani Saree\" - a handicraft item produced in its Andhra Pradesh state, Nakshi Kantha produced in West Bengal and Fazli mango grown in the Malda district of West Bengal state.\nHowever, Bangladesh has registered Jamdanee with the name of 'Jamdanee'.\n\n\n\n\n"

Between 9am on Sunday and 9am on Monday, 165 mm of rainfall was recorded.\nLarge areas of Khatunganj, Chaktai and neighboring Korbaniganj and Rajakhali located on either side of the Chaktai canal were submerged in knee-deep to waist-deep water.\nThe water congestion damaged large quantities of perishable commodities, including onions, garlic, rice, lentils, sugar, tea and spices after water flooded into the shops and warehouses at the wholesale markets.\nThe water congestion forced traders to raise the height of the doorstill of both shops and warehouses in an effort to prevent water from coming in. However, even this was not enough as water managed to seep in through the walls.\nThe traders of the century-old business hub said the problem was worsened further because of the solid waste and filth choking up the Chaktai canal.\nEvery year, rainwater from the Karnaphuli river floods the shops and warehouses in the area through the various canals, including Chaktai Canal which also serves as the main drainage system for all the rainwater in the city alongside the usual sewage outlets.\nThe commodity hubs house about 3,000 businesses and more than 5,000 warehouses.\nAccording to the Khatunganj Trade and Industries Association, the daily turnover in the wholesale market stands at Tk1200-1500cr.\nThe traders said they had to incur huge losses due to the chronic water-logging problem.\nSyed Sagir Ahmad, general secretary of the Khatunganj Trade and Industries Association, said traders had yet to calculate their actual losses as they were too busy trying to protect what remained of their goods.\n\"Every year we have to suffer huge losses and we want to solve the chronic water logging problem. The government should put special emphasis on Chaktai- Khatunganj since it is a major commercial hub of the country. Chaktai canal should be dredged and excavated on a regular basis,\" said Sagir.\nSpeaking to the Dhaka Tribune, Solaiman Badshah from the Chaktai-Khatunganj Warehouse Owners and General Merchants Association, said the long-standing water-logging problem had now turned into a tragedy for the commodity hub of the commercial capital.\n\"Chaktai-Khatunganj is a long-neglected business hub of the country. Nobody seems to be concerned about the development of the wholesale market,\" regretted the trade body leader.\n\"Many parts of the Chaktai canal have been filled up as a result of land-grabbing and lack of regular dredging water-logging, causing the traders untold misery. We, on behalf of our organisation, had submitted memorandums to different government offices including the Chittagong City Corporation to press home our demands,\" he added.\nEarlier, the traders from the Chaktai-Khatunganj Warehouse Owners and General Merchants Association had placed a seven-point charter of demands, including evicting all illegal structures from the banks of Karnaphuli river, restoration of navigability of the Karnaphuli and its connecting canals through regular dredging, construction of permanent protection dams and a sluice gate at the mouth of the canal while keeping avenues for the movement of boats and trawlers transporting goods, and constructing a truck terminal on the river bank at Chaktai area.\n\n\n\n\n"

For those who have a knack for scientific nomenclature, the species is called Botia dario. In English, it is also known as Bengal loach.\nThe six to seven inch loaches are sweetwater bottom-dwelling fish having barbels around the mouth.\nBangladesh, India and Bhutan are the only countries to offer the delicacy of rani fish curry on one's platter, notwithstanding the beauty of the species.\nRani fish were once enlisted among the endangered fish species from Bangladesh.\nBut thanks to the demarcation of some water bodies in the haor as fish sanctuaries, local fishermen say their recent catches have turned up increasing number of rani, an evidence that the population of this species is beginning to bounce back, said Kulaura Upazila Senior Fisheries Officer Md Sultan Mahmud.\nIn 2012, the government declared 12 water bodies in the haor as permanent fish sanctuaries. There are reports that some other endangered fish species have also made a comeback in the haor since then.\nThe senior fisheries officer also noted that this year's fish catch from Hakaluki Haor is likely to break the record of the last seven years.\nKirendra Das, a fisherman from Hakaluki Haor, told the Dhaka Tribune that they used to catch only one or two rani fish during a day's haul in the recent past. \"But over the last couple of years, the fish population have multiplied. And after the floods, they are schooling around in great numbers.\n\"Though the population has revived, it takes three to four days to catch one kilogram of rani fish. If one wishes to buy rani fish, he has to contact us before we go fishing. We can put together the catches of several fishermen and provide one kg rani fish in two to three days. It costs Tk2,000 for one kg rani fish.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

This will help us,\" said KM Layek Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Auto, Major and Husking Mill Owners' Association.\nEncouraging the private traders, the commerce minister said: \"From now on, import and market rice in whatever packaging you can. I'll notify the NBR and Customs. No one will stop you. This will remain effective for next three months.\"\n\"There is no food shortage in the country. Even if there is any shortage, we'll meet the demand through government to government agreements and private sector will import the rest,\" he added.\nTofail said he also would talk to the concerned authorities in getting rid of the hurdles in rice import.\nTo meet any shortage, Food Minister Qamrul said: \"The government will soon launch open market sell (OMS) of rice at upazila level while suspending programmes like Food For Work immediately.\"\nMeanwhile, the Food Directorate's recent OMSs witnessed lacklustre response as people are not habituated with unboiled (Atap) rice, OMS representative Syed Bin Kawsar told the Dhaka Tribune.\nAfter the latest price hike, the OMSs were launched at Dhaka's different points for the lower income people, selling per kg unboiled rice at Tk30 and flour at Tk17 a kg.\nKawsar said they were suffering losses as most people were only buying flour.\nMillers and importers on Tuesday also complained that using jute sacks when importing rice raises their cost by Tk1 per kg. But plastic sacks cost just 15-16 paisa.\nThey claimed using plastic sacks will curb the import cost by at least Tk2 per kg, and gradually bring the rice prices in the local markets down.\nPrices of all types of rice at the kitchen markets in Dhaka have increased by Tk10 per kg in the past week, due to several reasons including floods and illegal storage by millers and traders.\nAccording to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, the markets have seen Tk18-20 hike in per kg rice from last month's prices and Tk29-50 from last year's prices.\nOn Tuesday, Najirshail rice was sold at Tk70-72 per kg and different coarse rice (Swarna and Paijam) at Tk55. Last week, coarse rice prices were between Tk42 and Tk44.\nFine grain Miniket's price is also up to Tk65 from Tk55 per kg, and BR-28 is at Tk58-60 from Tk48-50.\n\n\n\n\n"

To give a more vivid parallel, the sum is enough to construct four Padma bridges.\nEconomists and bank officials said the rising trend of bad debts might paralyse the banking sector and the economy. Analysts have suggested taking effective measures to rein in default loans.\nExperts say loan default is an indispensable part of the banking sector as there are ups and downs in debtors' businesses and sometimes there are other problems in the loan recovery process.\nThey expressed concerns about defaulters who intentionally refuse to make payment on loans in spite of their abilities. This type of defaulters contributed to almost 85% of the total default loans until June 30, Bangladesh Bank (BB) data show.\nBangladesh's loan default scenario\nThe defaulted amount rose to Tk74,148cr on June 30, from Tk62,172cr in December last year, BB data show. The defaulted amount is 10.14% of the Tk731,000cr credit disbursed by 57 commercial banks.\nThe default loans of eight state-run and specialised commercial banks amounted to Tk40,098cr, while it was Tk31,729cr for private banks and Tk2,321cr for foreign commercial banks.\nExperts said the figure would have been much higher if badloans had not been written off. As of June 30, banks have written off loans of around Tk45,000cr. It means, the accumulated default amount at the end of June stood around Tk119,000cr.\n\nThe defaulted loan is 12.56% of Bangladesh's GDP which is Tk947,542cr as per the constant price. The constant price of Indian GDP is $27,400cr while its defaulted loan is $15,400cr, 7.43% of the GDP.\nThe amount of unpaid loans has been increasing by leaps and bounds since 2011 when the total defaulted loan was Tk22,644cr, an amount equal to 6.12% of the total disbursed credit till that period.\nState-owned banks have always had the largest amount of defaulted loans. But in recent times, bad debts of private banks are rising alarmingly.\nIn the first six months this year, the defaulted loans of 40 private banks increased by Tk2,002cr. At the end of last year, private banks' defaulted loan was Tk29,727cr.\nMore loan default this year\nLoan defaults in the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector have been low, BB data showed. But, the amount of defaulted loans could rise this year as floods have affected the low-lying regions of the country, experts said.\nThe central bank issued a circular on August 24, relaxing loan rescheduling rules and suspending loan recovery for six months from farmers and SMEs in the flood-hit areas.\nAccording to the circular, banks will relax conditions for down payments in case of rescheduling farm loans, SME and cottage loans and micro credit. Debtors will get six months to pay instalments after rescheduling their loans.\nMoreover, affected borrowers will be allowed to get fresh loans without repaying existing dues. Banks will provide new loans to farmers and small entrepreneurs under the relaxed policy until June 30 next year.\nReasons behind the default\nEconomists and bankers said the major reason behind default loan is the distribution of credit on political consideration, which made it quite difficult to recover the credits.\nAB Mirza Azizul Islam, former finance adviser to the caretaker government, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Lack of good governance is behind the increase in default loans. For this, a large number of habituated defaulters affiliated with political parties take loans and the banks failed to recover them.\"\nBesides political affiliation, experts also blamed the culture of impunity, abuse of power in loan disbursement, weakness of existing laws and lack of technical expertise that help defaulters swindle money from banks.\n\"Default loan is on the rise since bankers did not maintain rules and regulations while disbursing and recovering loans,\" Islam said. \"Some vested quarters are manipulating existing laws to take loans and turn into defaulters.\"\nManaging Director and Chief Executive Officer of Rupali Bank Md Ataur Rahman Prodhan told the Dhaka Tribune: \"In recent times, default loans have risen but the number of defaulters has decreased as we are more cautious in disbursing loans.\"\nHe further clarified that BB had asked banks to include previously excluded defaulters in the list, making the list appear longer.\nSpeaking about the weaknesses of existing laws, he said, \"If we sue any defaulter, that person files a writ petition against us. When the court rejects the appeal, he can file the writ again. This is a hindrance towards recovering default loans.\"\nBankers also blamed the bank management. They noted that in most of the default loan-hit banks, the chairmen, MDs and directors were found abusing their power in distributing loans.\nAs the director of a private bank cannot take loan from his bank, he sets up a syndicate with directors from another bank and they grant each other big amounts of loan through their banks. Rules and regulations are flouted and they take the loans to be defaulters. They also siphon off the money, accrding to bankers.\n\"If you look at the default-hit state-owned banks' previous chairmen or MDs, you will see that they sanctioned the defaulted loans the most,\" said former BB deputy governor Khandakar Ibrahim Khaled.\nHe also blamed the government which offered rescheduling and restructuring facilities for default loans, saying these steps encouraged debtors not to repay the loans.\nAbout 10% of the total bank loans were rescheduled in 2016, according to BB's Financial Stability Report.\nFinance Minister AMA Muhith recently said bankers were responsible for loan defaults as they always tried to show their clients as defaulters to avoid being held accountable for loan defaults.\n\"When a client approaches a bank for loan, what comes first to the bankers' minds is how to show him or her as a loan defaulter. The bankers set terms and conditions in such a way that the client becomes a defaulter. Every bank does it to avoid being held responsible for loan defaults. This is a very bad culture in our banking sector,\" he said.\nChairman of the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh (ABB) Anis A Khan, also the managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, rejected the allegation. \"It's not true,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. \"We have declared war against default loans. What can we do if businesses do not pay back the debt? We cannot arrest them. Many of the businesses fled the country after taking big amount of credit from banks.\"\nBankers said the banks do not have enough technical expertise to properly analyse the loan files.\n\"Banks lack technical expertise in analysing eligibilities of individuals or companies seeking loans. Many banks do not even go through the Credit Information Bureau report to check eligibility of a client. Corruption in approving loans is another factor. The borrowers evade some of the conditions in exchange for money,\" Research Director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Khondaker Golam Moazzem said.\nBankers said the defaulters were not being punished as the bankruptcy court was out of commission and this encouraged people to become debt dodgers.\nImpact of default loans\nExperts say default loans hit the banks' profit, shrink the scope of business expansion and thwart plans for job creation.\nBanks cannot turn savings into loanable funds as they have to set aside the amount equivalent to bad loans as provision. As a result, banks' costs of funds rise while lending rates go higher and the deposit interest rates go down.\nAccording to BB data, the average lending rate at the end of June this year stood at 9.46%, while the average interest rate on bank deposit stood at 4.84%.\nMirza Azizul said, \"Default loans create trouble in money and share markets. Banks' shareholders are deprived of profit as banks have to fund provision to make up losses incurred by defaulted loans.\"\nBanks also have to face capital shortfall due to defaulted loans. The situation is awful in state-owned banks that require injection of capital from public money to remain functional.\nBB data showed that in June this year, the total capital in the banking system was Tk89,959cr, up from Tk 84,424 crore in March this year. Of the amount, eight public banks had a capital shortfall of Tk12,683cr.\nThe government injected Tk13,705cr as recapitalisation fund into the state-owned banks from FY2009-10 to FY2016-17, all of it was the taxpayers' money, according to a Centre for Policy Dialogue report.\nThe Finance Minister proposed to allocate Tk2,000cr for recapitalisation during 2017-18 fiscal.\nDue to defaulted loans, banks are now afraid to issue big and long term loans, leading to exceeding liquidity in the banking sector. Banks currently have an excess liquidity of Tk126,000cr, according BB.\nHow to get rid of the curse?\nStakeholders have long been demanding reform in the financial sector to bring accuracy, accountability and good governance as well as to rein in the loan default culture.\nBad loan keeps rising despite government steps like loan rescheduling and restructuring facilities.\nExperts observed that these measures are insufficient and stressed good governance in the banking sector, amending existing laws, improving expertise and ensuring punishment of the defaulters.\nBangladesh can follow India's example, they suggested. India is planning to make loan default a criminal offence and has set an example by getting back a defaulter from abroad through diplomatic channel.\nDirector General of Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM) Dr Toufic Ahmad Choudhury told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Good governance will not be fully established in the banking sector unless people like former BASIC Bank chairman Sheikh Abdul Hye Bacchu are punished for corruption.\"\n\"Bangladesh's Artha Rin Adalat Ain (Financial Loan Court Act) needs to be upgraded so that no one can take advantage of procrastination and escape unharmed. Bangladesh can declare defaulters bankrupt but it must have transparent and proper law in this regard,\" CPD's Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem said.\nRupali Bank MD Prodhan said: \"We need to modernise the laws related to realising default loans.\n\"Political consideration in loan disbursement has to be stopped as 85% of the defaulted loans were distributed based on political consideration.\"\nMirza Azizul told the Dhaka Tribune: \"It is very difficult to come out of the bad culture of default loans in the absence of political will from the political parties.\"\nLatest BB data showed that most of the defaulted loans are big. BB Governor Fazle Kabir said, \"Banking sector has to come out of the default loan culture for the sake of maintaining stability in the financial sector.\"\nHe directed bankers to give priority to SME loans to reduce the ratio of large loans in the total credit disbursement.\nBB Deputy Governor SK Sur Chowdhury asked banks to appoint good lawyers to take legal actions against big loan defaulters.\nIs there any hope?\nThough most of the loan defaulters are always affiliated with the party in power, it is very hard for the government to stem default loan culture, said experts.\nFormer BB governor Khaled said: \"Political will is important to end this practice. The incumbent government apparently has no intention of stopping this like its predecessors.\"\nEconomists, too, stressed the need for political decision to come out of the loan default culture. There is a very little scope to end the culture in near future as big businesses are involved in such anomalies, they added.\n\"In India, the Modi government has taken steps to stabilise the financial sector soon after coming to power. It was impossible before the election year,\" an economist from one of the country's leading independent think-tanks told the Dhaka Tribune.\n\"In Bangladesh's context, the time to bell the cat is gone. One has to understand the political economy in this regard,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-11-12 00:00:00      \nScriptures say, we should all visit graveyards because they have a sobering impact on the living. The atmosphere calms the senses, brushes out the angst, makes us realise the inevitability of death, and, most importantly, gives us precious moments to reflect. On a sun-drenched tranquil Friday afternoon, when I stepped into the Commonwealth War Graves in Dampara, Chittagong, life's all other pressures were minimised for a few hours. The day to day priorities seemed distant, and, to an extent, superfluous. Like countless other places around the world, homage was being paid to the soldiers of the two great wars that have shaped the current world. Arranged by the British High Commission in Bangladesh with the cooperation of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the Bangladesh Armed Forces, the day, as those present would have felt, was not just for remembering sacrifices made in the great wars but for all struggles aimed at ensuring freedom and human rights. A link to deaths long ago Someone once asked me the relevance of observing Remembrance Day, stating rather callously that soldiers killed in a forgotten time ruled by a defunct/defective ideology do not have any value today. Well, it's of course very easy to dismiss the past and go on with the present, but, if we do, then we actually dishonour those who laid down their lives in the belief that their deaths would ensure a brighter future. Whether the world became better or not is a matter of debate but countless men went to the frontier with the determination to fight till the end and make the sacrifice for others. Just for that, we have reason to remember and honour them. Remembrance Day is about reinstating our gratitude to fighters who fell to give us the chance to enjoy sovereignty, independence, and an honourable identity But there is also another valid cause -- many of the men killed were our own, fighting at that time for the government they served. And this means, not only the men on the side of the allies but also for the axis powers because no matter which side a soldier was on, in the end, it's his/her life that was sacrificed. At the entry of the War Cemetery in Chittagong, on the right side of the gate is a large record of merchant seamen, all from this part of the world, who died, not in action but while providing vital service to the war effort. And there is also a section where Japanese soldiers fighting for the axis powers are buried. It's not about who won and who lost, it's about showing our gratitude to young men, who left life, love, merriment to face death. About all freedom fighters The day is not marked solely to recall the soldiers of the world wars only; over the decades with the world's dominant ideology undergoing transformation with more emphasis placed on human rights and the just cause, Remembrance Day is about reinstating our gratitude to fighters who fell to give us the chance to enjoy sovereignty, independence, and an honourable identity. For me, on that serene Friday morning at the Chittagong war cemetery, thoughts were about our valiant freedom fighters who went to battle with the dream of a free country for others to live in. Prayers swirled around a certain freedom fighter, a 22-year-old vivacious student of English literature at the University of Dhaka who went to war in 1971 because he was outraged when his fellow countrymen and his favourite teacher Jyotirmoy Guhathakurta were killed.  Caught by collaborators, he was shot and, as witnesses later told his relatives, had the Bangladesh slogan on his lips till the end. His name was Naseem Mohsin, the uncle I never got to meet. There were many like him, who went to war because they felt the need to give their lives to create Bangladesh. Again, the Bangladesh they gave us faltered, fumbled, often looked hopelessly unstable, was ravaged by famines, floods, and strife but she has made it through all the tribulations and, today, is firmly placed as a nation which confidently looks forward to middle income status. We can now open our borders for the less fortunate to come and find security. So, no sacrifice goes in vain; maybe the soldiers who died in the two great wars could not give us a perfect world but since 1945, there has not been any major global conflict. Well, I call that a success. The overarching message of peace Remembrance Day recalls soldiers who died in battle while the overarching message is that of peace. As the British High Commissioner to Bangladesh, Alison Blake said at the cemetery: \"We solemnly pay respect to the young men who gallantly left youth and life so others could live on, but at the same time feel that we must always strive for peace so young lives are not cut short anymore.\" In our often clinical assessment of human history of warfare, we swiftly divide a conflict in two parts: The victors and the vanquished. While doing so, the soldiers who died in battle become a perfunctory number. Remembrance Day is all about making the soldier the focus and so, at the end of the ceremony, the poignant lines of Phillip Hendy Davies reverberated across the graveyard: \"The sunlight fades as the rainbow dims; and the day is done/  He lies cold on wet barren earth and we know him only as someone's son/  Killed by a sniper's perfected hand, his rifle resting on a firm bag of sand/  That bullet forever depriving him of seeing again his green and pleasant land.\" Towheed Feroze is a journalist working in the development sector."

      "text": "Date Published:2017-07-14 00:00:00      \nA study by the Asia Development Bank says Asia will endure extreme heat, rising sea levels, growing losses from severe weather and increasing food insecurity in coming decades as climate change raises temperatures and alters weather patterns across the globe. The survey released Friday by the Manila-based lender paints a grim outlook for many communities in Asia, home to about 4 billion people. It's based on the latest scientific research, with or without more aggressive efforts to curb carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. Even if global warming is limited to 1.5degC to 2degC above pre-industrial levels, from mountain communities in Japan to the tropics of South Asia and deserts of Australia, rising temperatures are altering ecosystems, damaging crops and causing thousands more deaths each year. The report forecasts that Asian summer temperatures could rise by 6degC by 2100 if warming trends are not curbed. India suffered heat waves in 2015 and 2016 with temperatures at times around 50degC. Sea levels rose about 19cm globally over the past century and are forecast to rise by about 2.3 meters for every degree Celsius of global warming as glaciers and ice caps melt, the report says, citing past climate observations. Losses due to coastal flooding of the world's biggest cities are expected to rise to $52 billion a year. Indonesia will be the worst affected in Asia, with 5.9 million people flooded out each year by 2100. But across South Asia, 130 million people living in low-lying areas may be displaced under worst-case scenarios.  Changes to the jet stream can bring on unprecedented rainfall and massive flooding. Floods in Pakistan in 2010, the worst ever, killed about 3,000 people and left millions homeless. While some areas are suffering extreme droughts, in Southeast Asia, the number of record-setting daily rainfall amounts doubled over the past three decades. Up to a quarter of Bangladesh is inundated in a normal year, and century-level flooding could put 60% of the country under water, the report says. Storm surges from tropical cyclones, destructive winds and landslides are other risks from weather extremes. A 3degC rise in regional temperature is likely to cause grain output to fall by up to 10%, the report says, causing tens of millions of people to go hungry. Weaker wheat yields in China and loss of rice paddy in Vietnam due to rising sea levels and extreme weather are among the changes expected in coming decades. At the same time, desertification is spreading in Central Asia, a region where about 7-8% of the population lacks secure access to food. Growing ocean acidity due to changes in the atmosphere and warming temperatures are meanwhile straining marine ecosystems, hurting fisheries that are a crucial source of food across the region.

Milk production is now at stake as we cannot afford the pricey fodders,\" he said. \"A local cow provides two to three litres of milk a day which is sold at Tk50/litre on an average, while the fodder and other costs sum up to at least Tk60.\"\nSome other cattle traders said they preferred local cross breed - Horiana, Australian Frizian, Shahiwal and Pabna breed of cattle - for fattening.\nThe prices of fodder witnessed a sharp rise following the recent floods which damaged grazing fields. The cattle farm owners also put part of the blame on the syndicates for the sudden price hike.\n\"In the rainy season it is not possible for cattle to graze as the lands go under water. And it takes time for new grass to grow,\" said Shahed Ayatullah, who is also an executive member of the Chittagong Dairy Farm Association.\nThe farmers said that the prices of all types of fodder like wheat bran, straw, soybean meal, oil cake, granular rice and pulse powder had been increased in past few months.\nNow each kg of straw is selling for Tk15-17 compared to previous price of Tk8-10.\nOne kg of wheat bran is sold at Tk33 against previous price of Tk20, granular rice Tk45 against Tk25 and pulse powder is sold at Tk37 against previous price of Tk25.\nMoreover, the prices of oil cake and green fodder like Napier and local varieties have increased in the market.\nSoybean cake or meal, a major source of protein for the cattle, is manufactured through crushing soybean seeds, price of which has also risen sharply. Now each kg of soybean meal is sold at Tk53 against a previous price of Tk30.\nMustard oil cake now sells at Tk38 per kg against a previous price of Tk25. Molasses used to be sold at Tk20 per kg, but now it is sold at Tk30.\nOne kg of pulse powder is now sold at Tk37 against a previous price of Tk25.\nAccording to Chittagong District Livestock Office, there are around 1,500 dairy farms and 4,100 cattle fattening farms in the district. Of the dairy farms, only 450 are registered.\nOn the other hand, the cattle fattening farms are not registered as seasonal cattle raisers do not feel encouraged to go for the registration.\n To be dubbed as a dairy, a farm should have at least 3 cows, while a farm should have heard of at least 10 to be termed as a cattle fattening farm.\nDr Md Reajul Huq, district livestock officer, however told the Dhaka Tribune that the price hike of animal food ahead of Eid-ul-Azha was not abnormal.\n\"To recoup the price hike, the traders usually shoot up the cattle price. However, the farmers need not worry over the hike of animal foods. We always advise the farmers to adopt the scientific method of cattle fattening which is cost-effective too,\" the livestock officer added.\n\"The scientific method of fattening cattle is to feed a mixture of urea, molasses and straw (UMS) to the cattle at right proportions. Ten kilograms of straw mixed with 6-7 litres of water, 2.5kg molasses and 300gm of urea make ideal UMS food for cattle fattening. An adult cow may take only 4-5kg a day and the animal should undergo de-worming beforehand,\" said the official.\n\"The mixture should be fed for a period of six months along with other balanced food. After keeping the mixture in a closed container for eight days it should be dried in the sun to make it ready for use as fodder,\" Dr Md Reajul added.\n\n\n\n\n"

Andharmanik is one of the five river spots declared to be Ilish sanctuary, and Golachipa is the migration route for the fish.\nThe other sanctuary - Tentulia River in Bhola - is merely 10 kilometres upstream from the power plant site.\nHaving a coal-based power plant this close to two Ilish sanctuaries - which together produce around 10,000 tonnes of Ilish every year - is detrimental for the life of the Ilish in those areas, said Dr Anisur Rahman, prinicipal research officer at Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI).\n\"Ilish is one of the most sensitive aquatic species in the world. It requires careful handling,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. \"A heavy industry like coal-fired power plant will definitely have a negative impact on the sanctuaries, especially if the authorities concerned do not put proper measures to protect the environment in place.\"\nIn addition, the coal, to be used to generate power in the plant, will be transported via the Golachipa River, the migration route for the Ilish that goes to the Andharmanik.\nAnis said coal will adversely affect the growth and sustainability of the Ilish, but to what extent the fish will be affected has yet to be determined as not enough research has been done on this issue.\nThe Environment Impact Assessment report of the project, however, says the ultra-super critical technology used to establish the power plant will protect the environment of the rivers.\nSyed Nazmul Hasan, director at the Department of Environment, the government agency that issues environmental clearance, also assured that this project was safe for the sanctuaries.\n\"We issued the environment clearance for this project after we were sure that it had proper environmental management plan,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune.\nYet, doubt remains among the experts.\n\"The power plant authorities told us that they will take water from the river, but they will not release hot water to the river,\" said Jahid Habib, project director of Ilish conservation initiatives under the Department of Fisheries. \"But I think the chances of pollution still remains as the power plant will likely release different chemical by-products in the river, which will harm the Ilish population.\"\nThe project, a joint venture between Bangladesh and China, is being implemented by Bangladesh's North-West Power Generation Company Ltd (NWPGCL) and China's National Machinery Import and Export Corporation. It is expected to start generating power by the end of 2018.\nNWPGCL Managing Director AM Khurshedul Alam also told the Dhaka Tribune that an ultra super-critical technology would be used to generate power at the plant which would both cut back the use of coal than usual and would not release hot water in the environment.\nIlish: a national treasure\nAccording to the Fisheries Statistical Report of Bangladesh 2015-16, Bangladesh annually produces 395,000 tonnes of Ilish which bring in a substancial amount of foreign currency through export.\nOf that amount, 65% comes from the marine sources and the rest from inland rivers.\nThere are three other Ilish sanctuaries in the country: the stretch of Meghna River between Satnol and Char Alexander, the Shahbazpur channel of Meghna, and a part of the estuary of Padma and Meghna rivers in Shariatpur.\nThe national fish of Bangladesh contributes to 12% of overall fish production in Bangladesh, which is equivalent to around 1% of the country's GDP.\nAround half a million fishermen are directly dependent on Ilish production for their livelihood, and another two million are dependent indirectly.\nDue to high demand in both home and abroad, excessive catching of Ilish in the past couple of decades has led to concerns regarding its endangered existence.\nIn order to conserve this species, the government has taken several initiatives, one of which is ban on Ilish catching during two breeding seasons.\nThe first ban of the year is in March-April, in all Ilish sanctuaries except for Andharmanik River.\nThe second ban is in November-January in the Andharmanik sanctuary.\n\n\n\n\n"

It is just as difficult to arrange feeds and a caretaker to look after the animals.\nMohammad Ali, a retired service-holder living in Mirpur, Dhaka, is unable to visit the cattle market due to his old-age complications and had to resort to buying a cow online for the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha.\n\"After getting to know about e-commerce, I bought a cow and have been relieved of the tension of rearing the cattle as the service provider will send it to my house before Eid day,\" said Ali.\nSome young tech-savvy entrepreneurs have made Eid easy for city dwellers like Ali.\nNow one can buy an animal sitting at home, without having to physically go to the cattle market. And the animal will be delivered to one's home from the farm.\nAt present, a number of e-commerce sites and meat processing companies are selling sacrificial cattle online and offering home delivery, in Dhaka. The cows are reared through animal husbandry and no fattening drug is used on them.\nAn expatriate Bangladeshi can now buy a sacrificial animal online for his family back home. For such purchases, he will have to pay through a recognised payment method and provide his home address.\n\"In today's busy life, people want things delivered to their doorstep. Considering these aspects, a few years back, we started an online service to sell sacrificial animals. Within a short period, the service has gained popularity,\" Ataur Rahman, CEO of www.amardeshamargram.com, said.\nHe continued: \"We have networks in different districts from where we collect products, as well as cattle for Eid-ul-Azha. This year we have collected animals from Narsingdi and Kishoreganj.\"\nHe said the supply of cow is lower than that of last year owing to the floods in the northern districts.\n[caption id=\"attachment_174364\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"690\"] Preview of an online cattle market  Collected [/caption]\nAtaur said they try to create a direct link with farmers in different districts online, which helps them get better prices for cattle.\nSome of the online shops offer unique facilities such as slaughter service and distribution to addresses mentioned by the customers.\nBengal Meat Processing Industries CEO AFM Asif said that although Bengal Meat usually provides processed meat, it has now introduced online cattle shopping, considering its popularity in the city.\nThis year Bengal Meat has put up 300 cows on its website and already over 100 of them have been sold. Last year, Bengal Meat had sold 150 cows.\nAsif said their cattle are reared under the supervision of registered veterinarians.\n\"The cattle are given natural feeds and health checks on regular basis to ensure supply of disease-free healthy cattle for Eid-ul-Azha,\" he said.\n\"For consumers, it is tough to visit farms. But by visiting our website one can choose and buy his/her cow for Qurbani,\" he said.\nBengal Meat also offers slaughter and meat processing services. The site www.upohar2me.com is another online portal which offers cows for sale and delivery.\n\"The rise in sales and involvement of new entrepreneurs in the online cattle marketplace is a positive sign for the emerging e-commerce sector,\" said Rajib Ahmed, president of E-Commerce Association of Bangladesh (ECAB).\n\"To bring more business through the e-commerce platform, the government must provide policy support,\" he said, pointing out it would also help in the progress of Digital Bangladesh.\nMeanwhile, some online shops are providing farmers with a chance to display their cows from where a consumer can choose and directly contact the farmers.\n\"We have displayed cows on bikroy.com and other online marketplaces. We are getting response from the buyers. It is a good place to sell,\" Mohammad Jalilur Rahman, a farmer in Ashulia, told the Dhaka Tribune.\nSalek Shahriyar, head of Marketing and Communication office of Crown Cement, said, as a service holder, it is difficult to manage time to go to the cattle market.\nOn other hand, involving an outsider in the buying process of animal is also troublesome, he said.\n\"But after being informed about the online marketplace, I decided to buy a cow for Eid-ul-Azha from online shops.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

In the current fiscal year, the growth rate reached 7.4 %, despite damages and losses caused by flash floods across the country.\nThe government expects that the country's economic sector will face no major disruption due to political unrest in the next FY, despite the upcoming 11th general polls due to be held by early 2019.\n\"There will be nothing new or innovative in the budget as this is the last budget of our government's tenure,\" the finance minister said. \"But as we are optimistic that we will form the government again, we want that budget to be implemented.\"\nMuhith pointed out that the next fiscal year revenue collection growth rate will be 13%, while in this fiscal year it is only 11%.\nThe size of the Annual Development Programme fund is likely to be Tk 178,296 crore in the next fiscal year, an increase of Tk24,945 crore (16.28%) on the outlay this fiscal year.\nThe government plans to source 72.08% or Tk91,845 crore of the new budget deficit by borrowing from local banks and by using savings instruments.\nThe amount of borrowing from local resources is estimated to be at Tk52,900 crore. The budget of 2017-18 fiscal year set the target at Tk60,252 crore.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "headline": "Why are rice prices rising?",
      "authors": "Forrest Cookson",
      "text": "Date Published:2017-10-23 00:00:00      \nThe rice price has increased significantly over the past year, and there is much discussion as to why this happened. A brief review of the rice market concepts: The farmer sells paddy to whoever buys it and this ends up at the rice millers. Of course a lot of rice is milled locally in small mills for consumption in rural areas. The price of paddy will vary with location and time but the paddy market is reasonably integrated. There is another price ex mill for milled rice. There will be variations of quality rices so this ex mill, wholesale price will cover a range of values. The urban wholesale markets will have prices slightly different that the ex mill price due to transportation and trade mark ups. Finally, there is a retail price, at which the consumer purchases the rice. It is this retail price for coarse rice that we will focus on as a representative price for the whole spectrum of prices for different rice types. All of these prices should move more or less together as if one gets too high demand will decline and the price will fall. The rice price in Bangladesh is closely connected to the Indian rice price. If the taka/rupee exchange rate and the import duties are stable then the Bangladesh price will track the Indian price. This will not be exact, but if the prices differ too much, rice will move across the border. There is always potential for movement of rice in the informal transport channels. This channel will move rice in either direction according to the price. There is really a single market for rice between India and Bangladesh and price variations are temporary and will be removed by this arbitrage of rice moving both in formal and informal transport channels. In July 2014, the price of coarse rice was Tk3.1 per kg, and fluctuated around Tk3 per kg during the year. The price declined slowly during the period July 2015 to June 2016 with the price fluctuating around Tk2.6 per kg. Government actions over the past year are correct: Explain that there is plenty of rice, import more rice, reduce the import duty Then the price increased rapidly from Tk2.6 per kg in July 2016 to Tk4 per kg by June 2017, an increase of 53%. An increase of that size will increase the urban CPI by 3% and the rural CPI by 12%. The official estimates however, do not indicate such increases. The typical explanation for this increase was the reduced availability of rice from the floods and the outbreak of blast disease. Other explanations were that the millers were not releasing milled rice into the market and that \"syndicates\" were withholding rice, driving the rice price higher. In Asia, the standard explanation for rising food prices is that the business men in the food chain are withholding food from the market, having formed a conspiracy to manipulate the price. The standard Asian government response is to attack the millers and the traders. To send government officials to markets to discover and discipline these monopoly \"blood suckers\" as they are usually known. This Kabuki ritual is performed every time there is a spike in the grain prices. Most of the time, no one takes this very seriously, but it gives everyone someone to blame.  Conspiracies involving many businessmen are impossible to maintain; in Bangladesh, a conspiracy with more than three persons soon becomes public knowledge. A few words about rice production and consumption   First, estimates from the BSS and the Ministry of Agriculture indicate that Bangladesh produces about 34 million mt of rice every year. The consumption is about 26 million mt. There is some retention of paddy. However about 15% of the rice crop is just lost in the process of milling or trading. The implication of this is that rice stocks at any time are typically 6-8 million mt. There is always quite a large amount of rice inside Bangladesh. There are supplies in every house, in every retail shop, on every farm as well as well as in the millers' warehouses. Bengal has had its share of crises over the rice price. Some of these have been disasters leading to famine. Some have led to widespread intervention in the rice economy. The research of Amartya Sen on Bengal famines sets out the reasons and authoritative explanation of these price crisis that have occurred from time to time. The reasoning emerged from a determination that even in the most terrible famine there was plenty of rice available. What drives the changes in rice prices is the expectation that prices are going to rise. When there is widespread belief that there is a shortage of rice and the price is going to rise, then the public reacts by buying more rice. This action results in higher prices. The expectations of the public are influenced by what is believed about the availability of rice and also by an individual's idea about what other people think. If you think that everyone believes the rice price is going up, then you buy more rice now even if you think that there is plenty of rice in the country. Sen has taught us that one should look to expectations when there are sharp price spikes. During this past year, there was widespread belief that there was a shortage of rice. This came from reporting on crop losses and low levels of rice in government stores. The amount of rice that might have been lost from floods was never more than 2-3 million mt and even this level is now probably proving too high. The government rice stores always get a lot of attention, but the level of stocks is less than 10% of production -- significant but not that important. In addition, there is always reporting about the efforts of the millers to withhold rice and drive the price up. All of this together generates expectations in the public that the price of rice is going to rise, and leads to increased stocks of rice being purchased and held everywhere. The higher demands arising from these expectations then increase the rice price. Government actions over the past year are correct: Explain that there is plenty of rice, import more rice, reduce the import duty. All of these actions may lead the public to change their expectations away from increasing prices. Ultimately, the rice prices will return to the level established by the Indian rice market price, the taka/rupee exchange rate and customs charges. Forrest Cookson is an American economist."

The ones that have vanished can easily be reclaimed following a Revision Survey. These should be restored and the dying ones should be taken care of immediately to address the waterlogging problem,\" he said.\n[caption id=\"attachment_67330\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"795\"] This April 2, 2017 file photo shows that soil has filled parts of Mirza Khal in Chandgaon, Chittagong city.

Existing tertiary drains cover only 45% of the total drainage area.\n\"The proposed master plan does not concretely mention any reclaiming of the vanished canals,\" lamented Ali Ashraf, and said that policymakers consider water congestion a transient problem, instead of a serious issue.\n\"The policymakers take up one plan after another, caring little for their implementation,\" he alleged.\nArchitect Zarina Hossain said: \"Open spaces, including the canals, used for retaining rainwater or storm water, are disappearing fast in the city. But the government agencies are failing to stop the building of illegal structures in these open spaces.\"\nCommodore Zulfiquar Aziz, member (engineering) of Chittagong Port Authority, said: \"Even a light shower floods the city due to a lack of adequate water bodies necessary to retain storm water.\n\"Thus, the existing water bodies and open spaces should be preserved somehow,\" he said.\n[caption id=\"attachment_67331\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"793\"] City planners blame unplanned urbanisation, illegal refilling, garbage accumulation, and encroachment of drains and canals, as is the case at Mirza Khal, for obstructing the free flow of water Rabin Chowdhury/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nThe city mayor as well admitted that waterlogging in the city had taken a severe turn.\nAddressing a programme on May 11, Chittagong City Corporation Mayor AJM Nasir Uddin said: \"Illegal structures have been built over the years, eating up the canals. Moreover, the indiscriminate dumping of solid waste has also worsened the situation.\"\nPinning the blame partially on unplanned urbanisation, he then bemoaned the fact that the master plan of Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) remained unimplemented even after 22 years as no mention was made of which organisation would execute it.\nThis master plan had been drafted in 1995 to develop the drainage system in five phases by 2015, but in vain.\nMeanwhile, at a civic dialogue in May this year, Shahinul Islam, CDA chief town planner, said they often have to face pressure from the politicians when removing the illegal structures.\n\"The waterlogging problem will reduce significantly if the illegal structures are pulled down from the canals,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-09-22 00:00:00      \nHurricane Maria churned toward the Turks and Caicos on Friday after lashing Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands with winds and rain that destroyed homes, flooded streets, crippled economies and left at least 32 people dead. Maria is the second major hurricane to hit the Caribbean this month and the strongest storm to hit the US territory of Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years. It knocked out the island's power and several rivers hit record flood levels. At least 15 people were killed in Puerto Rico, El Nuevo Dia newspaper reported. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello told cable TV news channel CNN he had reports of at least 13 people on the island being killed. Fourteen deaths were reported on the island nation of Dominica, which has a population of about 71,000. Two others were killed in the French territory of Guadeloupe and one on the US Virgin Islands. The death toll in the Caribbean is likely to rise when searches resume at daybreak. Rossello imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew through Saturday for the island's 3.4 million people. He said about 700 people have been rescued from floodwaters and communication was difficult with the southeastern part of the island. US President Donald Trump told reporters the island had been \"totally obliterated\" and he planned to visit.  Puerto Rico was already facing the largest municipal debt crisis in US history. Maria is a Category 3 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds of up to 205kph. It was 55km east-northeast of Grand Turk Island as of 0900 GMT, the US National Hurricane Centre said. It was forecast to bring storm surges of up to 12 feet to the southeastern Bahamas as well as the Turks and Caicos, it said, adding that a gradual weakening was forecast for the next 48 hours as it heads north in the Atlantic Ocean. Maria was expected to bring as much as 40 inches of rain to Puerto Rico and an island-wide flash flood watch was in effect. Between eight and 16 inches of rain was expected on Turks and Caicos, which could cause flash floods and mudslides, the NHC said. Utility crews from the US mainland headed to Puerto Rico to help restore the power grid and the US military sent ground forces and aircraft to assist with search and rescue. More than two months remain in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."

      "text": "Date Published:2017-11-19 00:00:00      \n\nIn DR Congo, fight for sanitation is also a fight for dignity\n\n\n\n\nAFP\n\n\n\n\n Published at 03:52 am November 19th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nFrom crouching over a small hole with a sheet for privacy to defecating in the open air, for millions of people in the Democratic Republic of Congo going to the toilet is a daily act of misery.\nThe UN has estimated more than 2.4 billion people worldwide are in a similar situation, with Sunday's World Toilet Day planned to raise awareness.\nThe vast majority of DR Congo's more than 70 million residents do not have access to \"improved\" toilets - latrines, sewerage or cesspits that hygienically separate human waste from human contact, according to the United Nations children's agency Unicef.\nThe problem has become even more pressing this year as the huge African country wrestles with a resurgence of cholera.\nKnown as a \"dirty hands disease\" for the way in which faecal germs are transmitted, there have been more than 44,000 suspected cases of cholera and nearly 900 deaths so far this year, compared with 29,000 cases in 2016, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) figures.\nIn the capital Kinshasa, the quality of toilets varies greatly depending on social status - islands of wealth thrive in the city of 10 million amid an ocean of poverty.\nRunning water and clean toilets are the norm in Gombe, a wealthy district home to the presidential palace, embassies, ministries, business headquarters, expats and the city's wealthiest citizens.\nBut it is a very different story in the other 25 districts of \"Kin-la-Belle\" (Kin the Beautiful), as Kinshasa was once known - and which some locals now derisively call \"Kin-la-Poubelle\" (Kin the Rubbish Bin).\nIn the district of Matete, Junior, 25, does not complain much about the toilet block built in the yard, away from the family house.\nThere is no running water, but it does have a tap and a bucket to clean the toilet, as well as an adjoining shower with white tile walls and an only slightly blackened ceramic floor.\nWastewater and excrement are collected under a concrete slab in a pit, which is emptied by a service every two or three years.\n\"It's not luxury, but it's a bit clean,\" said Junior.\n'We suffer here'\nConditions are very different for neighbours living on the edge of a rubbish dump just a few streets away - and several rungs down DRC's implacable social ladder.\nHere, a clean, decent flushing toilet only exists in dreams.\n\"We suffer here. If it rains, it floods the slab. The toilets overflow. The waste floods into the house,\" said an angry young father in front of his toilet block. The contents of the latrine can be seen through the concrete slab.\nAnother toilet, next to an outdoor place of worship, is a simple hole dug in the ground, protected from view by some corrugated iron and a sheet.\nAccording to residents, the sewage runs into a river that flows between Matete and a military camp. On both sides of the water is a mountain of rubbish.\n\"Sooner or later, there will be people who get cholera. For the moment we suffer from typhoid,\" says theology student Nadine Bondo.\nIn rural areas of DR Congo, where 60 percent of the population lives, the situation is even worse.\nOpen-air defecation remains a cause of disease, according to Unicef, which started a programme for sanitation in schools and villages, such as Kisthini, 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Kinshasa.\n\"Before, we were cleaning our toilets in an outdated way. We dug small holes. Now, the notions of sanitation and hygiene are ingrained in the students,\" says the deputy head of the school in Kisthini.\n\n\n\n\n"

A type of rice's price had shot up to Tk43 from Tk38. However, now it has come down.\"\nHe said: \"Prices of rice and paddy are not the same. Why cannot the government see that? We could not provide rice to the government in the last Aman season. At that time, paddies were priced at Tk23 and rice at Tk33. How do we incur this much loss? Millers agree to face a 50-paisa loss, but how can they incur a loss of Tk3 to Tk4. So, why would the mill owners be blamed for the imbalanced prices set by policymakers and the government?\"\n\"The prices of paddies are higher than rice in the market. Hence, we could not supply rice to the government warehouses. We had asked the government to give us an incentive, but to no avail. So, we could not supply rice. How can we do so while suffering losses?\" Layek said.\nHe blamed the imbalanced prices of paddies and rice set by the government for the crisis.\nGovernment should take responsibility for the rising rice prices\nBangla Tribune Planning Editor Nazrul Kabir blamed the government's dependency on import for the price hike of rice. \"Due to the emphasis on import, mill owners expressed discontent and raised the prices as well. The government should take responsibility for this.\"\nHe said: \"At a press conference, the food minister said the media has increased the rice prices but one doth the scathe, another hath the scorn. Kawsar Alam Khan also did the same by blaming the retailers for the price hike.\"\nNazrul further added: \"It is not right to hold one accountable for another's deed. Even when the government was providing rice at Tk10 per kg, the price in the market rose to Tk70. The government must take responsibility for this too.\"\nHe said: \"Importers predict the rice crisis. Every business sector has an exclusive group who creates a syndicate and therefore increases the price of goods to make more profit. It is the common people who then come under the pressure of the soaring prices.\"\nIn order to reduce the prices, Nazrul said the government and rice traders will have to work together to find solutions and take actions.\nRetailers not reducing prices\nKawsar Alam Khan, vice-president of Bangladesh Rice Merchant Association, claimed that retailers were the ones who were not curbing the prices. \"I myself had to sell rice at higher prices. I sell rice at the wholesale level. How will the retailers manage to sell rice at lower prices then? They are the ones who push up the prices.\"\nHe said: \"The retailers used to make a Tk1 profit in one kg of rice. But they currently make a profit ranging from Tk3 to Tk5 per kg. These retailers are not reducing the prices.\"\nThough no crisis, rice worth Tk38 is being sold at Tk52\nBangla Tribune Business In-Charge Shafiqul Islam told the discussion that the only rice crisis the market saw was during the flood in the haor areas in early March. \"Rice traders had taken advantage of that situation. But there is no crisis right now. Yet the rice, which is worth Tk38 is now being sold at Tk52.\"\n\"However, as a journalist, I have found out is that the rice prices have started to decline at the wholesale level, which is good news.\"\nHe said: \"After the flood affected the haor areas and the crisis begun, rice mill owners like Abdur Rashid and Layek Ali stopped supplying rice to the government warehouses. Maybe they have rice hoarded in their warehouses. Maybe they slowly supplied from that stock to the market and raised the prices gradually.\"\nShafiqul continued: \"Soaring rice prices also impacts the other daily essentials and leads to instability in both the market and society. This year's price hike is unprecedented in Bangladesh's history and has badly affected the society. The Food Ministry is also responsible for failing to control the hike when it started following the rice crisis caused by the flood in the haor areas.\"\nAddressing Commerce Secretary Shubhashish, he said: \"The government alone can figure out the reasons behind the price hike and the solutions. Deploy monitoring teams to the markets and have them only check the vouchers, you will easily find out the rates rice are being bought and sold at. Only the government can stop the price hike and it needs to step in to solve the crisis.\"\nRice prices slightly down at wholesale markets\nAccording to Commerce Secretary Shubhashish Bose, the prices at wholesale markets have somewhat dropped. \"But that is not the case in retail markets. We have had a meeting at the Food Ministry in this regard. We have also decided on several steps to reduce the prices.\"\n\nHe said: \"Even though the Food Ministry was supposed to reserve some rice, not much was stored. Since we have been producing various other crops for past few years and did not encounter any natural disasters, we were not worried about storing rice. Compared to the government's target, more rice is usually produced.\"\nRegarding the price hike of rice, Shubhashish said: \"Illegitimate hoarding of rice is responsible for this. Even though there is a policy on storing grains, nobody followed the rules.\"\nFlood in haor areas spurred rice price hike\nExplaining the cause of the rice price hike, Bangladesh Rice Mill Association Chairman Abdur Rashid said: \"The unwanted truth is the rice prices are soaring. The crisis started because of the immense loss of paddy in the floods in the haor region. As the haor region only produces coarse rice, the current crisis is basically for those types of rice, which has also made coarse rice import necessary. That's why rice prices are going up. \"\n\"The government is informed about the price hike. Though the importers were given special facilities to bring in more rice to tackle the crisis, they kept the rice shipments for a few days at the land ports in the borders and delivered late. Consequently, those special facilities did not help,\" he added.\n\"Prices of the coarse rice have only increased, as there is no crisis of fine rice. But the prices will not go beyond control. The government needs to figure out the right policies to tackle the crisis and bring down the prices. Only the government can solve this,\" Rashid further added.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-11-06 00:00:00      \n\nSaudi princes, ministers, tycoons arrested in sweeping purge\n\n\n\n\nAFP\n\n\n\n\n Published at 01:59 pm November 6th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 02:40 pm November 6th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSaudi Arabia has arrested dozens of senior figures including princes, ministers and a top business tycoon, in what authorities hailed Sunday as a \"decisive\" anti-corruption sweep as the kingdom's crown prince consolidates power.\nProminent billionaire Al-Waleed bin Talal was among the 11 princes arrested late Saturday, reports said, immediately after a new anti-corruption commission headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was established by royal decree.\nSeparately, the head of the Saudi National Guard, once a leading contender to the throne, as well as the navy chief and the economy minister were replaced in a series of high-profile sackings that sent shock waves through the kingdom.\nThe dramatic purge comes at a time of unprecedented social and economic transformation in ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia, as Prince Mohammed steps up his reform drive for a post-oil era.\nSaudi-owned Al Arabiya television reported that the princes, four current ministers and dozens of ex-ministers were arrested as the commission launched a probe into old cases such as floods that devastated the Red Sea city of Jeddah in 2009.\nThe state-run Saudi Press Agency (SPA) said the commission's goal was to \"preserve public money, punish corrupt people and those who exploit their positions\".\n\"With this (crackdown), the kingdom heralds a new era and policy of transparency, clarity and accountability,\" Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan was quoted as saying by SPA.\n\"The decisive decisions will preserve the investment environment and boost trust in the rule of law.\"\nThe kingdom's top council of clerics also lauded the anti-corruption efforts as \"important\", essentially giving religious backing to the crackdown.\n'Shock waves'\n\"The breadth and scale of the arrests appears to be unprecedented in modern Saudi history,\" said Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.\n\"The reported detention of Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, if true, would send shock waves through the domestic and international business community,\" Ulrichsen said.\nThe purge comes less than two weeks after Prince Mohammed welcomed thousands of global business leaders to Riyadh for an investment summit, showcasing his reform drive that has shaken up the kingdom.\nIt follows a wave of arrests of influential clerics and activists in September as the 32-year-old prince, often known as MBS, cements his grip on power.\nAnalysts said many of those detained were resistant to Prince Mohammed's aggressive foreign policy that includes the boycott of Gulf neighbour Qatar as well as some of his bold policy reforms, including privatising state assets and cutting subsidies.\nThe latest purge saw Prince Miteb bin Abdullah sacked as the head of the National Guard, an elite internal security force. His removal consolidates the crown prince's control of the kingdom's security institutions.\nTo analysts, Prince Mohammed's meteoric rise has seemed almost Shakespearean in its aggression and calculation. In June, he edged out a 58-year-old cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, to become heir to the throne.\nAt the time, Saudi television channels showed the bearded Prince Mohammed kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence. Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities.\nAlready viewed as the de facto ruler controlling all the major levers of government, from defence to the economy, the prince is widely seen to be stamping out traces of internal dissent before a formal transfer of power from his 81-year-old father King Salman.\nAt the same time, he has projected himself as a liberal reformer in the ultra-conservative kingdom with a series of bold moves including the decision allowing women to drive from next June.\nForeign diplomats predict that Prince Mohammed, set to be the first millennial to occupy the Saudi throne, could well be in control of Saudi Arabia for at least half a century.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2013-10-11 00:00:00      \n\nAuthorities all over the world are continuously justifying their wrongdoings in the name of the greater good. This time, the Sundarbans has become the victim of that notion. \nThe mangrove forest is about to be sacrificed in the name of the greater good but at a price that we cannot afford. It was not long ago that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina strongly accused developed countries for their contribution to global warming and urged them to compensate the sufferers, ie developing countries like Bangladesh, but now she has signed the death verdict on the Sundarbans. \nThe human race has been honoured with the highest dignity not just because of its independent thinking but for its ability to take care of wildlife, nature and the environment. \nBut the intentional destruction of the Sundarbans is not only a suicidal move, it is also a violation of natural laws. It will make Bangladesh more vulnerable than we can imagine. \nThe Sundarbans, shared by Bangladesh and India, and the largest mangrove forest in the world, is an enclosure for the coastal areas and gives the country protection from major natural calamities, such as past hurricanes like Sidr and Aila. \nIt is enriched with huge natural resources and is a safe-house of diverse wildlife. Most importantly, it is a natural holder of the ecological balance and our ecosystem. It provides livelihood to a great number of local inhabitants. \nIn spite of all this, the government is advancing to install a coal-based thermal power plant of 1,320 MW capacity which will occupy almost 768 hectares of land and is barely 9km away from the Sundarbans. \nThough, the government is considering this as a safe distance, the partner of this project, India, has passed its own law where they are not allowed to install such plants within the 25km radius of forests in their territory. Ironically, they are doing just that in our homeland and our government is acting like our resources belong to India, not to us. \nIf this plant is installed, a huge amount of coal will be transported through the Possur River. The noise pollution and other waste produced from the plant will damage the biodiversity substantially. \nThe fish in the confluence of the rivers will face extinction. The area will become uninhabitable, and the air will be so polluted that no living creature will be able to breathe there. \nThe water of the rivers will be contaminated. The climate, topography, faunal and floral diversity will be destroyed. Allegedly, the materials which will be used in the plant contain hazardous chemicals such as sulphur, carbon dioxide, cadmium, radium, arsenic, lead, mercury and nickel.  \nThese toxic chemicals could affect the health of the inhabitants, even those living in government-certified safe areas. According to rough estimations, this plant will immediately displace about 5,000 families from their land. \nA large number of forest-dependent poor people like honey-collectors and fishermen will get unemployed. The Sundarbans is a tourist attraction, a sector which will take a hit once the project starts. \nMany studies have already been done by different think-tanks, researchers and journalists but no one could credibly claim that the benefit of this plant will outweigh the costs. \nIt is true that our demand will increase day by day, but that does not mean that we should destroy all our natural treasures just to satiate our demands. There are many other viable options to produce energy. \nSolar power, windmills and biogas are options. The Sundarbans are unique and irreplaceable. As a lower riparian country and with low lands, we are vulnerable to coastal floods, cyclones and hurricanes. Without the Sundarbans our people cannot survive. \nWe Bangladeshis are very good at seeing the near future and short-term benefits which cause us to lag behind other nations. It is high time we gained some wisdom. We must act before it is too late. \nProtesters of the initiative have been labelled \"impractical\" and \"anti-development\" by ministers and government advisers. \nOther than the Hasina administration, not a single person has supported the idea of generating power at the cost of the destruction of the Sundarbans. This project will bring no benefit to our unborn generations, and the Sundarbans is not just an asset of Bangladesh, it belongs to the world. \nIt is a world heritage site and the home of the world-famous endangered Royal Bengal Tiger. I implore all Bangladeshis as well as the world community to not turn a blind eye on this issue, but to listen to their conscience. \nThis is a time of moral crisis.\n "

      "headline": "Decoding the Bangladesh Paradox",
      "authors": "Jyoti Rahman",
      "text": "Date Published:2013-12-02 00:00:00      \n\nBangladesh is getting quite the attention from the world. But unlike the seventies and eighties, not for the catastrophes - natural or man-made - alone. Though, its rather sensational political upheavals aided by frequent fatalities - some of which are sometimes caused by sheer negligence - still flash through the media almost routinely, there also emerge some extraordinary, unusual success stories from the very same country - such as its impressive progress in a number of human development indicators or its consistent GDP growth amid political turmoil. \nJust as the catastrophes, these stories not only evoke emotion but are also analysed by the media. As though, they unearth a Bangladesh Paradox. Yet, perhaps a focussed research effort can crack the paradox. \n\"The macroeconomic fact is, in the last decade, under all three governments, per capita GDP have grown by around 4.5% a year. At that rate, average real (that is, inflation-adjusted) income doubles in 16 years ... This is impressive stuff, for which every recent government deserves some credit.\" \nThat's the conclusion from the article on real GDP per capita growth under different governments. Of course, real GDP per capita is a means to the end, not the end in itself. What we really care more about is the standard of living that higher real GDP per capita entails - that is, it's the development record, and not just the growth, under different governments that we want to know. \nThis, however, raises two questions. First, how do we attribute to any particular government the growth and development record when policies under any particular government are likely to have long-term consequences? And second, how do we explain the Bangladesh Paradox: \n\"The belief that growth brings development with it - the 'Washington consensus' - is often criticised on the basis that some countries have had good growth but little poverty reduction. Bangladesh embodies the inverse of that: it has had disproportionate poverty reduction for its amount of growth.\" \nThat quote is from a November 2012 Economist article. That article, and accompanying editorial, had a go at explaining the paradox. Dhaka Tribune's Joseph Allchin had a crack more recently in the NY Times. The suspects are usual: garments, remittance, NGOs. But we economists are a parsimonious lot, or so we like to think. \nWe would like to know exactly what contribution each of these factors made, what was the channel through which the factors affected growth and development, what role, if any, did government policy play, and what all that means for future. \nI haven't seen a comprehensive analysis of the Bangladesh Paradox. And no, I am not going to provide the answer in this article. Rather, here is a research agenda on how to analyse the Paradox. \nLet's recap the Paradox with the \"Wealth and Health\" Table from the Economist. \nThe first thing to explore is whether Bangladesh is compared with an appropriate benchmark? Is it that Bangladesh has done better with its growth and income, or is it India (or Pakistan) that is the exception? \nThe Economist notes that Bangladesh has a few features that India or Pakistan lacks: \n\"Because of its poverty, it has long been a recipient of vast amounts of aid. With around 150m people crammed into a silted delta frequently swept by cyclones and devastating floods, it is the most densely populated country on Earth outside city states. Hardly any part is isolated by distance, tradition or ethnicity, making it easier for anti-poverty programmes to reach everyone. Unusually, it has a culture that is distinct from its religion: although most Bangladeshis are Muslims, their culture and language are shared with the non-Muslim Indian state of West Bengal. Religious opposition to social change has been mild.\" \nHas Bangladesh received more aid per capita than other poor countries? How does Bangladesh's growth-development trajectory compare with other densely populated monsoon deltas - say, countries along the Mekong? Or perhaps, Bangladesh should not be compared with India and Pakistan as a whole, but with the four Pakistani provinces and 32 Indian states? \nDoes a paradox remain if the comparators change? Does Bangladesh still perform better in terms of development/living standard given its growth/level of income? A proper research agenda would answer these questions first. Suppose the answer is yes, that the Paradox still remains, its resolution will rest on a two-part investigation. \nThe first part would explore the GDP story in detail. That Bangladesh does better given its GDP does not make GDP irrelevant. Quite the contrary. Bangladesh was a wretchedly poor place until the 1980s. It's not a coincidence that things started getting better as the economy started accelerating. We would want to know what is it about the GDP growth process that may have contributed to the development in a relatively favourable manner. \nWhat do we know about the growth story of the past few decades? From a strictly growth accounting perspective, we know that while favourable demographic transition and female workforce participation have helped, it is multifactor productivity that explains the GDP acceleration.  \nFrom a sectoral perspective, we know that agriculture's share of the economy has shrunk, that of manufacturing has risen, and services have become more productive. And we know the particular industry that has led the charge - readymade garments. \nSo far, this seems like a straightforward export-led, manufacturing-driven growth story a la our neighbours to the east and north. \nYet, it's not so clear-cut when we look at the expenditure side of GDP. Unlike the Asian fast industrialisers, Bangladesh has not experienced an investment boom. In fact, low private investment relative to GDP may be the single most important problem facing the country's economy. \nOf course, why investment hasn't grown is a question that needs further exploration - and the answers will have obvious policy implications. But is there something to the consumption pattern as well? Particularly, have remittance and microcredit affected consumption above and beyond what would be implied by wages growth coming from industrialisation? \nIn addition to the macro trend, do industrialisation, remittance and microcredit interact in a way that have microeconomic - that is, household and firm level - impact favouring consumption over investment even after accounting for various market and government failures that inhibit investment? \nWhat am I getting at here? Well, how about a stylised, and very speculative, story along this line -- while RMG has meant women entering the formal workforce, migrant worker boom has sent a lot of risk-taking men overseas; aided by the NGOs and microcredit, households have smoothed consumption and invested in human capital of their children; but they have not invested in physical capital, avoided entrepreneurial activities, and have not pushed for a more investment-friendly polity. \nWe would want to explore this story further. We would also want to explore the income side of GDP, and tie it into a political economy analysis. \nThe remittance boom, for example, should see the labour share of the economy rise. Of course, the question is, what happens to the money that is remitted back? It's reasonable to assume that unskilled labourers are from the poorer parts of the society. \nSo, in the first instance, any remittance back to the villages is a good thing in that it reduces the direst type of poverty -- that is it stops things like famine or malnutrition. But what happens after that? My tentative hunch is that a lot of remittance has been saved but not invested in a productive way, rather they ended up fuelling land/stock prices - this is an area that needs to be explored in detail. \nWhat about the RMG boom? Theoretically, proceeds of the manufacturing boom should accrue to both labour and capital. Has that happened? Has the process of distribution been dynamic or static? Here, by dynamic I mean whether the industries are going up the value chain - from the cheapest t-shirts to more expensive designer brands to leather and other fancier fashion items to toys to cheap electronics to expensive electronics to stuff that requires more skilled labour. If the process has been dynamic, then we should expect less tension between labour and capital, because both wages and profits rise over time. \nIn addition to the detailed exploration of the growth process, the research agenda will need to focus on the factors that explain the development above and beyond what might be expected from the growth itself. \nAs a starting point, let's take the four factors listed by the Economist: government spending and policies on social programmes that assisted family planning and empowered women; the green revolution; remittance; and NGOs. \nLet's think about these factors in a systematic way. The \"Fertility in Bangladesh\" graph from the Economist illustrates the female empowering social transformation. But how important has the government, and NGO, interventions been relative to the advent of the RMG sector. As far as girls' education is concerned, Mushfiq Mobarak of Yale finds the garments made the difference (this is a subject of a detailed post). We would like to see the relative impacts of industrialisation, direct government policies, and NGO activities analysed across various metrics. \nThe green revolution is a relatively straight-forward story, and remittance we have discussed above. In addition, we would want to know how, if at all, the impact of these factors have changed (and is likely to change) in a more rapidly urbanising Bangladesh. \nFinally, we would want to analyse the economics and political economy of the NGOs - what the Economist calls the \"magic ingredient.\" \nLarge NGOs such as BRAC are as much business conglomerates as philanthropies. In fact, the Economist compared BRAC to Korean chaebols. Is that a reasonable comparison? Do we understand the microeconomics of NGOs? Does our view of Bangladesh Paradox change at all if we viewed these NGOs as little different from Korean or Japanese business houses at comparable stages of development? And what about the impact of the NGOs on public finance, and indeed the state's capacity to build institutions in general? \nNeedless to say, this is a pretty ambitious research agenda. But it's hardly impossible. Is there anyone out there to tackle this?"

      "text": "Date Published:2013-10-24 00:00:00      \n\n\"Are you from Bangladesh?\" a very humble Indian delegate from Hyderabad, coming to attend the ongoing South Asian Conference on Sanitation in Kathmandu, during a tea break, asks me in Urdu. \n\"Yes, I am, but how did you know I was from Bangladesh?\" I ask curiously, in English. \n\"I saw you asking questions during the civil society meeting. I was sitting at the back. Those were interesting questions,\" he tells me, again in Urdu. \nI understood his first question, but I had a little difficulty to get the full meaning of his second question. \"I don't speak Urdu,\" I tell him. \n\"Why, don't Bangladeshis speak Urdu?\" he seems quite appalled, adding, this time in English: \"I thought all Bangladeshis speak Urdu.\" \nIt's now my turn to be appalled. I keep quiet, staring at him with eyebrows raised. \"Where did you learn that Bangladeshis speak Urdu!?\" I ask with a tinge of anger in my voice. \n\"I always thought Bangladeshis speak Urdu in their country,\" he says innocently. \n\"But we speak Bangla, we've always spoken Bangla, it's our mother's language. How come you missed that information?\" I ask him, this time not with anger. \nHe turns quite apologetic and says: \"I'm really sorry, I never knew about the language about Bangladesh, no one has ever told me. The information about you we get all the time are about politics, garments and cricket.\" \nI become more curious, suspicious whether he knows that Bangladesh is an independent country. \n\"But you must be knowing that we are an independent country,\" I inquire. \nHe gives a blushing smile and says: \"Yes, that I know, of course, but I didn't know about your language. It can happen; can't it?\" \n\"Of course, it can happen,\" I continue my conversation. \"Have you ever heard of International Mother Language Day?\" I keep pressing.  \n\"No, I didn't. No one actually knows about it where I live,\" he admits, with an inquisitive body language. \nI start telling him the whole story of how the process of our independence had started with the language movement in 1952. He listens to me for about ten minutes and expresses his admiration. \n\"I'm sorry brother, it's my failure that I didn't know about this great history all these years,\" he tells me. \n\"No, no, it's nothing to do with you. It's our inability that we couldn't let the world know about our magnificent history,\" I tell him submissively. \nBack in my hotel room, when all plenary sessions ended, the episode with my fellow summiteer kept on haunting me. I really had no idea that a person from South Asia, and that too from a bordering country, wouldn't know that we speak Bangla in Bangladesh. \nDid we actually fail to let the world know about the origin of our independence? The world knows about our politics, our garment industry and our cricket, but not everybody knows about our language, our birth! \nOne may ask: Why should everybody have to know about the history about your language movement? True. There are a zillion things on earth that a billion people don't know about. Well, I accept that, but when I find a man from our nearest neighbour wouldn't know that we speak Bangla in a Bangla land, it hurts. \nWith the note, the question also crossed my mind as to what actually we, as Bengalis, as many other nations do, have communicated about ourselves to the people of the world. We've only transmitted negativism with our own actions in the last forty-two years. \nExcept for floods, hunger, political violence etc, we haven't really upheld ourselves so that the world would cheer us. \nCommunication is so far the best tool that nation-states have used for spreading their message across. We have so many success stories: Our family planning programme, our sanitation reach in South Asia and our agriculture are the examples for many countries to emulate. \nOn top of everything, there's no match in the entire world with our language movement. But we haven't spread the information of what we nationally call \"our pride.\" \nThe people, like my fellow summiteer, who don't know about our glorious practices, aren't to be blamed for not knowing. It's we who couldn't make us heard in the global arena, it's we who are keeping ourselves from improving our image, it's we who are fighting against each other and it's we who don't let things happen for us."

      "text": "Date Published:2013-05-30 00:00:00      \n\nThousands of people living inside the Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra (DND) dam areas do not see an easy way out of the water-logging that makes their life unbearable in monsoon. \nThe chronic problem this year began even before, with the cyclone Mahasen that caused heavy rains in Dhaka too. \nMany roads, fields and other open spaces in the area went under ankle to waist-deep water like the past because of the downpour, causing immense sufferings to the residents of the area. \nPeople living inside the DND embankment area expressed dissatisfaction over the role of the Bangladesh Water Development Board, which is the responsible state-run organisation to maintain the DND dam. \nMoin Uddin, a freedom fighter who now runs a grocery shop at Sarulia Bazar, said it is the WDB's responsibility to drain stagnant water out of the area. \n\"But this year WDB has not taken any additional step to pump out the excess water even after days of heavy rainfall,\" he said. \nNot to mention about putting in place additional equipment in time of need, WDB does not even have all its existing pumps ready to be used. Maiz Uddin Miah, a resident of East Dogair said, \"WDB has four pumps and now they use three. One is out of order.\" \nThe WDB announced a long time back that they would set up another pump in Pagla area, but they forgot about it as usual, he recalled. \nMaiz Uddin alleged the pumps are old and poorly maintained, and they are not capable of draining huge amount of water after a heavy rainfall. Wastes and water hyacinth clog the mouth of pumps as well as canals, he added. \n\"Fish farms have mushroomed near the WDB pump stations. These enclosures also contribute to water-logging inside DND area,\" he said. \nEncroachment is also common. Unauthorised structures, built by local influential over the years, also blocked natural flow of water and led to water-logging. Local people know them, but their voice is too feeble to be heard by authorities. \nWhen local MP Habibur Rahman Mollah visited some waterlogged area earlier this week, local residents requested him to take step to remove illegal buildings that block water flow. He renewed the assurance, which was never materialised. \nLatifa Begum, a field worker of Sarulia Union Health and Family Welfare, trudges through water every day between home and work. Like all others living in the area, she accepts the suffering as no remedy is in sight. \n\"Water-logging has become a regular feature in the whole DND area in monsoon. We are facing this every year, so we are used to this situation.\" \nThere was no major rainfall in the last few days. But roads and open spaces in areas inside the DND dam, including Matuail, Konapara Pora Dogair, Mogholpara, Rasulpur, Dholesshar, Adarshapara, Sarulia, Dogair, Deillah, Munsibagh, Baghmara, Boxonagar, Sarulia Bahir Tengra, Kandapara and Mredhabari were seen under water even on Tuesday.  \nLocal people said water-logging this year began since the Mahasen that caused incessant rains in Dhaka as well.\nMost of the areas looked like stagnant ponds, making every day life of thousands of people miserable. In some places rickshaws and vans are the only mode of transports. CNG run-auto rickshaws, cars and other motorized vehicles do not ply there. \nWhile everybody points finger at the WDB, the agency has also a point to make--shortage of fund. \nRuhul Amin, Executive Engineer of WDB (Dhaka O&M Division- 1) told the Dhaka Tribune, \"Every year the government sanctions Tk 15-20 million (1.5 to 2 crore) for drainage work, but this year the amount is less than the previous year's allocation.\" \nThe water official however said the government has taken an initiative to solve water-logging and end the suffering of thousands of people living in the DND area. \nA feasibility study was done back in April 2010 and the report was submitted to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) in November 2011, he informed. \n\"But it was returned from ECNEC for lack of fund from the government fund and still it is waiting for sufficient fund,\" he said. \nLocal MP Habibur Rahaman Mollah came to WDB's defence saying the agency has been trying to clear the logged water from inside DND dam. Huge amount of logged water has already been pumped out, he informed. \n\"People too have some faults. Some residents dump waste in canals. Few people have encroached on canals and open spaces. Most of the canals are filled in. So heavy rains lead to water-logging for long,\" he said. \n\"We have been trying to free all canals to ensure smooth flow of water out of the areas,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune on Tuesday. \nThe ruling party lawmaker said he was aware of the fact that the ECNEC did not approve a development project for DND area, but did not know why. \nWDB high officials said the government had implemented a Tk130 million (13 crore) project from 2006 to 2009 to improve the drainage system. \nThe DND project was executed during 1962-68 as Flood Control Drainage and Irrigation (FCDI) project primarily to protect Dhaka and Narayanganj towns from floods, and to save croplands from overflowing rivers. It was then a part of an exclusive irrigation project aimed at achieving self-reliance in food grains production. \nBut the area continued to develop as an unplanned residential area after the country's independence, with lower middle income people buying land and building homes haphazardly. \nThe trend gained pace after the 1988 flood, inviting more people inside the dam area. As a result most of the agricultural land was transformed into residential, small business or even heavy industrial zone without any plan."

      "text": "Date Published:2013-07-28 00:00:00      \n\nTwo women including a mother and a daughter were killed in a mudslide in Chittagong early Sunday, following a heavy overnight downpour. \nThe incident occurred at the Tankir Pahar area of Lalkhan Bazar in Chittagong around 5:30am. \nFatema Begum, aged 35, and Kulsum Begum, aged 15, worked for the local Four H Garment factory and lived in a semi-pucca house at the Akbar's Colony. \nThe accident was the latest addition to the long list of deaths caused by hill-slope erosion during monsoon in the port city. \nAn eyewitness, who was a victim of the mudslide and was rescued later, gave a graphic account of the tragedy. \nShahnaj Akhter, a tea seller living next door to the victims, told the Dhaka Tribune she was inside her hut and making breakfasts around 5:15am, when she heard the sound of heavy objects falling nearby. \nShe dashed out and saw a large chunk of earth made of mud and rocks coming downhill. \n\"I came out and saw a large mass of mud falling on the roof of Fatema's residence. They were sleeping inside.\" \n\"I was literally petrified. My first reaction was to shout for help and I did. I heard them scream and writhe inside the house. Fatema was shouting 'save us, save us.' \n\"She managed to say that a couple of times before another mass of mud fell over them and silenced them. There was no more sounds afterward,\" said Shahnaj, in tears. \nSoon Shahnaj herself was also trapped under muds but was fortunate enough to have averted a fatal injury. \nLater, locals together with fire service officials recovered Shahnaj and the two dead bodies from under the debris. \nAkbar, who owns the colony, couldn't be found immediately for comments. His family members, however, claimed he had been admitted to hospital with illness.  \nJasim Uddin, a deputy assistant director of Fire Service and Civil Defence Headquarters of Chittagong, said the erosion was a result of heavy overnight rain. \nThere was another colony uphill, owned by a traffic policeman named Belayet, around 20 feet above the ground where the deceased mother and daughter resided. \n\"The large chunks of mud came down from that colony and killed the two women. The entire area is at risk now. The same incident can happen again if preventive measures, such as evacuating those in danger, are not taken,\" he said.   \nAfter the incident, Additional Deputy Commissioner (revenue) of Chittagong MAH Humayun Kabir and city mayor M Manjur Alam visited the spot. \nHumayun Kabir said the district administration had already ordered hill-slope residents to evacuate the area and settle in safer places. \n\"We will take measures in this regard, but people should be aware of the perils associated to living on the slopes,\" he said. \nIn this regard, Manjur Alam, the mayor, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"We are working to rehabilitate the people living in risky hill areas in the port city.\" \nThe district administration has announced a condolence fund of Tk40,000 to be handed over to the relatives of the deceased, sources said.  \nAccording to locals, Akbar's Colony was built 25 years ago. In 1995, four people died in mudslide in the same area where Fatema and his daughter lived and died on Sunday. \nAt least 180 people were killed in mudslide in Chittagong in the last seven years. Of them, 127 people died on June 11, 2007 - the largest death toll from mudslide in Bangladesh. \nAccording to Chittagong district administration, there are 13 risky hills in the city and about 5000 families living there. \nRecently, the administration temporarily rehabilitated about 200 hill families in different playgrounds in the city."

Aarong issued a statement of apology on its official Facebook page on Sunday. The social enterprise of BRAC also said it would remove some of the pictures from its current campaign. The new advertisement picture of Aarong shows the models posed for the ad in a room filled with water. It has drawn huge criticism on social media.  \"We can understand why it may be perceived as being insensitive to the sufferings of the flood-affected people. This was not our intention and we apologise,\" it states. In the statement, Aarong said it introduces new themes every year in its ad campaigns and promotional materials. This year's theme around monsoon and Bishorjon was conceptualised and developed before the onset of the recent floods, it said."

      "authors": "Towheed Feroze",
      "text": "Date Published:2014-12-14 00:00:00      \nIt is a well-known fact, or I can assume a lot of people are aware, that in 1971, the US government was not in favour of a liberated Bangladesh. At least, the White House was actively against the idea of a dismembered Pakistan. Declassified records, as mentioned in several books related to the 1971 War of Independence in Bangladesh, state unequivocally that the Nixon administration was unwilling to see dents in their relations with the West Pakistan junta. Pakistan was a key player at that time in improving US relations with China. Therefore, even after heart-wrenching telegrams were sent by US diplomat Archer Blood from Dhaka about the atrocities committed, the reaction in Washington was diplomatic silence. Blood later on was admonished and, reportedly, his career path made difficult for his candid appraisal of the situation on the ground. Whatever the case, within the USA, the opinion was split as further declassified papers, mentioned in BZ Khosru's book, clearly state that a large number of common Americans plus many serving lawmakers opposed the stance of the White House and also resorted to strategic filibustering to delay shipments of weapons to the invading army. Yet, even after so many years, if a political analyst is asked to comment on the role of the USA and then the USSR during the 1971 war, the former won't be painted favourably. If you are the devil, then you are vile out and out ... no chance for the little virtues to be noticed. After all, history only remembers decisions made at the top. The fact that many Germans within the German defence system wanted to depose Hitler and end a war begun on lunatic whim is usually brushed aside when WW2 is deconstructed. Anything to do with Hitler's military might is regarded with suspicion, though efforts were made right within the German military by Claus von Stauffenberg to kill the dictator in what is known as the \"20 July plot.\" Come to the Vietnam War, where the US role is still enveloped in infamy. At the height of the Cold War, poking a nose, and then directly getting in warfare, in Vietnam turned the US into the new imperial juggernaut. Within the US, millions of people, imbued by the 60s philosophy of peace and spiritual emancipation, protested, though this hardly did anything to improve the US image globally. In the then East-Pakistan, a wave of socialist ideals spurred by Fidel Castro's defiance of the US and relentless struggle of the Vietnamese people had transformed a generation. The 1971 American aloofness only cemented an anti-Western feeling. To be precise, for about a decade after liberation, young men wanting to enter politics had to embrace socialist values and reject what they termed \"Markin shamrajjobad\" (US imperialism). However, as we step into the 43rd year of independence, maybe history should be interpreted not by acts of the government only but also by humanitarian deeds of the general people.  A recent news of four US Hercules planes helping India transport floods of refugees from the then East Pakistan after the March 26 crackdown, opens up a new hitherto unknown dimension to the compassionate American involvement in the war. Of course, if we look at the overall picture, Nixon's lethargy in acknowledging genocide in Bangladesh and the subsequent sending of the seventh fleet will always overshadow all the other acts that were in favour of Bangladesh. Even then, sometimes good deeds need to be recognised. One cannot forget the role of the American missionaries based in Dhaka, Narinda, and Kaliganj who came to the help of the common people during those turbulent times of hopelessness. Nor can we forget Senator Edward Kennedy who stood at Congress supporting the cause for Bangladesh. As we approach Victory Day, the role of the USSR during the war cannot and should not be sidelined either. They indirectly hinted that if any superpower entered on the side of Pakistan, the USSR would act, thus ruling out the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh from turning into a major cause for global conflict. Later, it was the Soviets who cleared the ports of Bangladesh of thousands of planted mines and scuttled ships. Of course, to take a wide-angle perspective, the 70s was the period of high communism-capitalism tensions. Any state-to-state episode of warfare was inevitably caught in the vortex of the ideological divide. One may ask why these nuances from another era matter so much. After all, the Cold War is over and there's nothing called the Soviet Union. Well, for starters, accurate history is essential because unless the facts are known, new generations' understanding of the political evolution of the sub-continent will be distorted. Just a concluding point, leading Arab countries from where millions of Bangladeshis now send back much needed foreign currency did not recognise Bangladesh's struggle for independence on the rationale that the movement was aimed at dividing a Muslim country. Saudi Arabia gave formal recognition to Bangladesh in 1975-1976. Today, the Saudi government is a generous friend to Bangladesh. On the eve of Victory Day, let's also try to understand a little bit of global politics and how they have evolved, with Bangladesh now firmly secured in the global map as a developing country. "

      "text": "Date Published:2014-12-23 00:00:00      \nOne of the most overlooked development success stories of the past decades has been steadily unfolding in one of the poorest and most populous countries: Bangladesh. The little attention the country attracts in the international media tends to focus on floods, cyclones, allegedly deplorable labour conditions in the textiles industry and poor governance. Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index places the country near the bottom of its ranking. Bangladesh's reputation of desperate misery is decades old. Henry Kissinger, the influential US secretary of state in the 1970s, famously derided it as a \"basket case.\" The international public has barely noticed Bangladesh's achievements in terms of income levels, food security, industrialisation, health, family planning, education, disaster prevention and the empowerment of women. Perceptions only began to change slowly at the end of the past decade, when World Bank experts, for instance, noticed the \"development surprise.\" This surprise results from several factors that cannot be easily replicated: Governance was often better than its reputation. There is indeed reason to complain about corruption, overblown and manipulative partisanship. Politically motivated violence has occurred, top leaders have been assassinated, the military grabbed power several times. In spite of these downsides, however, the state apparatus did focus on specific development goals with considerable success. Bangladesh has a vibrant civil society. It spawned many path-breaking non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which supplemented government action and - where such action was lacking - often substituted for it. Many of them pay special attention to improving the lot of women and empowering them. Entrepreneurs have acted dynamically and built strong new businesses. International donor agencies played their part. Well-targeted social-development programmes always found donor support, and the donors knew they could rely on competent and committed local staff. Bangladesh is a small but densely populated country. Its culture is unusually homogenous for a developing country: 98% of its people speak Bangla as their first language, and almost 90% are Muslim. These characteristics have proven helpful. What works in one village is likely to work in the next village as well - and the next village is never far away. Moreover, development workers only need a bicycle to reach many thousands of clients. Traumatised by war Bangladesh became a sovereign nation in late 1971 after a war of independence that left millions dead and destroyed the country's infrastructure. At the time, the country's future looked bleak. A whole generation of intellectuals and professionals had been murdered by the Pakistani army, and hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi women had been systematically raped. Two years later, a devastating famine killed another estimated 1.5 million people. There was reason to doubt that the new nation of 72 million people squeezed into an area of only 144,000 square kilometres had a future. Its population was larger than West Germany's, but its territory was 40% smaller. However, the Bangladeshis were determined to rebuild and develop their country. Massive amounts of foreign aid arrived and civil-society groups and government agencies distributed the assistance to destitute people. A number of important NGOs were started as part of the relief effort. Some of them, for instance BRAC and Grameen Bank, have become internationally active organisations with world-wide recognition and millions of members. In the 1970s, government relief efforts quickly evolved into effective development policies. The massive donor-funded food distribution programmes of the post-war period were transformed into rural infrastructure development programmes, headed by the Local Government Engineering Department (initially the Rural Works Programme) and its charismatic leader Quamrul Islam Siddique. Among other things, the extensive, meticulously planned network of rural roads, bridges, markets and boat landing sites dramatically increased the volume of marketed rice and contributed to falling real prices of rice.  High-yielding rice and wheat varieties were introduced in the 1970s and 1980s, and the markets for farm-inputs were liberalised. The introduction of various kinds of tube wells and surface irrigation boosted the dry-season rice crop. Rice production steadily increased from 10 million tons in 1972/73 to 34 million tons in 2011/2012. Today, Bangladesh is basically self-sufficient in food. Budding industries The war destroyed the country's small business sector and it took several years until the private sector - including the ready-made garment industry (RMG) - began to emerge. Today, there are around 3,000 RMG factories. They export more garments than the textiles sector of any other country except China. Garment exports from Bangladesh were worth $24.5bn in fiscal year 2013/14 and accounted for 81% of export earnings. The sector provides direct employment to more than 3.5 million people - the majority poor rural women - and indirect employment and income to millions more. RMG production clearly dominates Bangladesh's manufacturing sector, but other industries - including generic pharmaceuticals, leather products and ship-building - are also gaining strength. Since 2004, two Bangladeshi ship-building companies have exported ships worth $200m. Industrial production now accounts for almost 30% of GDP. A massive flow of remittances from millions of Bangladeshis who live abroad has helped. The World Bank reckons that remittances amounted to almost $13bn in fiscal year 2011/12.After an average annual GDP growth rate of less than 4% a year in the 1980s, Bangladesh's GDP growth averaged 4.8% in the 1990s and 5.9% in the 2000s, according to official statistics. Per-capita income increased by an average of 1.7% per year in the 1980s, 2.7% in the 1990s and 4.5% per year in the 2000s. Making the most of growth Economic growth matters, but there is much more going on here. Social development has outpaced rising incomes. With a per-capita GNI of $900 in 2013, the World Bank still ranks Bangladesh as a low-income country. The UN lists Bangladesh among the least-developed countries, taking into account additional indicators for education, health and people's vulnerability to shocks. Nonetheless, Bangladesh is on track to meet key Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The share of the people below the national poverty line fell from 56.6% in 1992 to 31.5% in 2010. Bangladesh is one of the few countries that are likely to achieve the MDG of reducing infant, child and maternal mortality by two-thirds. It is also on track to immunise 100% of its one-year-old children against measles and achieve 100% net enrolment in primary school. Gender disparity has been eliminated in primary and secondary education. The country will meet or has already met most of the targets for fighting HIV/AIDs, malaria and tuberculosis. In regard to family planning, Bangladesh surprised the world long before the MDGs were even defined. The nation reduced its total fertility rate from 6.9 children per woman in 1970 to 3.3 children per woman in the mid-1990s. Experts had believed that such a decline would only be possible in the context of rapidly rising incomes, increased levels of education for women or a powerful non-familial welfare system such as in China. In Bangladesh, however, the dramatic drop in the fertility rate was the result of strong and persistent government commitment to an innovative, multi-layered programme: Family-planning information reached almost every village in the country through the media, local elites, NGOs and even religious leaders. Contraceptives were widely advertised and made available at low-cost, subsidised prices. The heart of the programme consisted of 23,500 female family welfare assistants who brought health and family planning information as well as free contraceptives to women in their homes. The assistance was backed-up by clinical services. By the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Health was employing 44,000 family planning personnel - all financed at that time by donor agencies. In 1970, East Pakistan (Bangladesh) had approximately 69 million and West Pakistan (Pakistan) 62 million people. They had the same fertility rate. Today, Bangladesh has a population of approximately 150 million, while Pakistan's has grown to more than 176 million. The fertility rate for 2012 was 2.2 children per woman in Bangladesh and 3.3 in Pakistan. The successful family-planning programme is perhaps paradigmatic for Bangladesh's social development in general. Government agencies and NGOs typically cooperate on implementing comprehensive policies in selected sectors and rely on international funding. It is noteworthy, for instance, that Grameen Bank had received $148m in grants and $85m in loans from international donors by the end of the 1990s. Today, around 2,000 development NGOs in Bangladesh are active in education and health services, micro-finance and women's empowerment. Many of them contribute to the spectacularly successful disaster-risk reduction system. Before cyclone Sidr hit the coast of Bangladesh in 2007, some 3.5 million people were evacuated. The storm killed about 3,500 people, but that number has to be put in perspective. A cyclone of similar strength had claimed 138,000 lives in 1991 and the region's most devastating storm of all times left half a million dead in 1970. In view of a growing population and a rising sea level, this kind of progress is very important. Today, NGOs are crucial to the path-breaking rural solar-energy programme that has brought solar home systems to over 7 million Bangladeshis since 2002. The programme, once again, was initiated by a government-owned company, is promoted by local NGOs and relies on international funding. "

The Farakka Barrage Gates remain open during the monsoon for smooth passage of flows of Ganga River which is a routine and unavoidable activity.\"\nThe statement also noted a Bangladeshi media report of August 31 that quoted Bangladesh's Water Resources Minister as saying that: \"India did not open the gates of Farakka Barrage suddenly, and there is no possibility of fresh floods in the country. All the gates of Farakka Barrage remain open during the monsoon to release water through the Farakka Barrage -- it is nothing new.\"\nIn accordance with the standing arrangement between India and Bangladesh, flood alerts during the monsoon season are communicated for Farakka and Sahibganj sites by field offices of Central Water Commission of India to their Bangladesh counterparts.\nBeing a routine procedure no special intimation or alert regarding opening of gates is issued, it added.\nThe statement also pointed out that the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh has been quoted in the media as stating that the latest water rise was natural and not unusual or abnormal in the month of August.\n\n\n\n\n"

But last year, she cut the cake before the usual time.\nSenior Awami League leaders, including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, have for years requested the BNP chief not to observe her birthday on August 15.\nA Gulshan office source said an unofficial directive was sent to the front and associate organisations not to throng to the Gulshan office with cakes at night.\nReportedly after being elected as prime minister in 1991, Khaleda Zia started celebrating her birthday on August 15 in 1993. Till 1996, Khaleda celebrated her birthday at home but made it into an organisational event from 1996 when she became the opposition leader.\nLast year, Awami League General Secretary Syed Ashraful Islam charged Khaleda saying, \"There can be no consensus with those who celebrate fake birthdays on the National Mourning Day. We have extended our hands to her in the past, but Khaleda did not accept it. Even if it really is her birthday, she can celebrate it on August 16 to show respect for Bangabandhu. We do not object to her celebrating her birthday.\"\nIn a phone conversation in 2014, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asked Khaleda Zia not to observe her birthday on August 15.\n\"You visited our Dhanmondi Road 32 residence several times. You saw Sheikh Russel. When you observe your birthday on August 15, do you not remember Russel's face?\"\nIn reply, Zia asked, \"If someone is born on that day, can't they celebrate their birthday?\"\nPro-BNP intellectual Zafrullah Chowdhury also suggested that the party chief should not observe her birthday on that day.\nAccording to Khaleda's marriage certificate, her birthday is September 5, 1945. Her first passport reportedly says her birthday is August 19, 1946.\nAccording to a curriculum vitae distributed to the media after taking oath as prime minister of Bangladesh in 1991, Khaleda was born in Feni on September 19, 1945.\nKhaleda's biography published by the Parliament Secretariat mentions her birth year as 1945. Several biographical books and the Banglapedia also mention Aug 15, 1945 as her birthday.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2016-08-25 00:00:00      \nBangladesh is one of the most heavily river laden lands in the world. The beauty of its flowing rivers zig-zagging through the country is simply mesmerising. However, during the monsoon or rainy season, water levels rise dangerously. As a consequence, every year the country faces serious and chronic flooding. As per a report from the beginning of this month, some 3.2 million people across 16 districts of Bangladesh were affected by monsoon-induced floods and the death toll went over 42. Apart from the floods, nearer sea ponds, ditches, sewage canal and other water bodies lead to several deaths. In July this year, two children died after falling into a sewage canal in Rupnagar. There are numerous instances where people drown while swimming in beach areas or bathing in rivers. Children in Bangladesh face the gravest threat of death by drowning. Dr Jahangir Hossain, programme co-ordinator for the Centre for Injury Prevention and Research Bangladesh (CIPRB) refers to it as a hidden epidemic in the country. According to CIPRB estimation, every year deaths from drowning claim 20,685 lives and among them approximately 18,000 are children under the age of 18. This means approximately 50 children die everyday by drowning in Bangladesh. The Asia based group Alliance for Safe Children found from its survey that Bangladesh has the highest rate of child drownings in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) say drowning is among the top five causes of death for children under 15 years.    In recent years a number of NGOs and other civil society organisations have been conducting swimming teaching program aiming to bring down deaths from drowning. These seem to have made little impact on the ominous situation as newspaper pages are still filled with news of people dying by falling into ponds, ditches, rivers and other water zones almost everyday. This has prompted Mohammad Asaduzzaman, Jafrina Jabin, Ahmed Masud Chowdhury, Imran Ahmed and Ahmed Shafa Shovon to develop a portable and handy floating device that may help save a drowning person. Currently under construction, the ambitious project is designing \"FloBuddy\", a prototype floating device that will be able to help a drowning person float until help arrives. The device is designed to be worn like a bracelet. It will be attached with a cylinder, an air-bag and a press button. Thus anyone trying to stay afloat in water can press the button and engage the device which will enable the person to float for a certain amount of time until rescuers come. Any endeavours regarding matters as supremely important as saving lives should aim to seek perfection. With that in mind, the team has been tackling a lot of challenges since they invented the prototype. To make it as impeccable as possible, the designers are considering matters such as how portable the device should be. They are also striving to make the mechanism simple and trying to figure out a way to maximise the number of days the device will be able to keep people afloat. There is even the issue of making it look stylish for the young generation. \"We are very passionate about developing the device with zero flaws. So far, our test runs proved the device works all water bodies. At this point the device is able to keep a human floating for one and half days,\" said Mohammad Asaduzzaman, one of the concept developers of FloBuddy.  The team has planned to add a light and a whistle, thus enabling the victim to use it in dark and solitary conditions. Another area of their main focus is keeping the system as simple as possible so that it can be understood and used by people of all ages and educational backgrounds. Complex operation would be harder for general people to understand and even worse for illiterate people. Keeping the device accessible in terms of its affordability is the prime priority of the FloBuddy team. They are trying to produce every component of the device in Bangladesh. \"We are planning to keep it as inexpensive as possible,\" Asaduzzaman said. After three months of tireless work, the team has been spending each day combating flaws and weaknesses and gradually perfecting the device. They believe a life-saving device can only be trusted by people when it is perfect. Hoping to finish making the error-free prototype within the next four months, the team has big plans afterwards. \"We have planned to start awareness promotion in different launch terminals and other places where we will be able to make people conscious about certain issues and trivia about the device,\" Asaduzzaman said.    They are also planning to distribute FloBuddy free of cost among children and simultaneously promoting learning swimming as another vital tool for saving people from drowning. Initially the idea of floating device was being developed by participants of EMK Makerlab TechClub (a platform for youth development) as part of their idea development session. Later on, the participants of EMK Makerlab TechClub formed a team and participated in Make-A-Thon (a competition that enables makers to come under one roof and build anything) on May 28, 2016 where they have secured third place. The project recently received the Innovation Fund for Product Development from the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). EMK Makerlab will be one of the partners of this project with Better Stories as the incubation partner."

Located in the Indian state of West Bengal, roughly 16.5km  from the border with Bangladesh, the barrage was planned to enhance the flow of Bhagirathi-Hooghly branch of the Ganges to resuscitate the port at Kolkata.\nWhile the Farakka barrage has earlier been blamed for reducing water flow, causing salinity ingress and drying up of the Sundarbans delta, the problem with the management of sediments has recently taken an ugly turn with the floods in the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\n[iframe id=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d28972.31491745864!2d87.934987!3d24.811222!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x39fa5ead1fefa8b1%3A0x88d87c07a1508783!2sFarakka+Barrage%2C+Gobindarampur%2C+West+Bengal+732215!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1474366215313\"]\nThe government of Pakistan (which encompassed the present state of Bangladesh) was critical of the project. It had feared that by enhancing the flow into Bhagirathi-Hooghly, the barrage would reduce the dry season flow of the Ganges (known as the Padma in Bangladesh) downstream.\n\nAlso read: Farakka is a hindrance to peace\n\nThere were members of the Indian technocracy who also opposed the project, such as Kapil Bhattacharya, then chief engineer of West Bengal. He was singled out and marginalised. Since then, the construction of the barrage has been a crucial factor affecting Bangladesh-India relations and perceptions of transboundary environmental issues.\nShort term solution\nThe Farakka barrage stands as a classic example of engineering solutions that looked at short-term economic benefits and ignored long-term sustainability concerns. This way of thinking was promoted during the British colonial period. This was the time when such large scale endeavours were being experimented with all over the world, with civil engineering being established as a discipline in the 19th century. The establishment of Thomason Engineering College at Roorkee, now the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, which began as a class for engineers in 1845, before being named after its founder, James Thomason, in 1854, provided young Indian students with training in the European knowledge of water engineering. This form of water management spread across engineering colleges in India over time.\n[youtube id=\"58eVzSZ0GKU\"]\nThis thinking dominates the Indian water engineering scenario even today, and has led to enhanced damage, livelihoods losses and eventually conflicts at both international and inter-state levels. The Farakka barrage is a classic example.\nWhen the barrage was planned, knowledge about the complex ecology, hydrology and sediment flow of Himalayan rivers like the Ganges was either not available or ignored. So, the possible impacts of building a barrage were not perceived at the design stage.\n\nAlso read: Farakka still a fracas\n\nThe most significant knowledge gap in river engineering was and is related to the understanding and management of the sediments, which are integral parts of water flows. Without consideration of the sediments, the Bangladesh-India treaty of 1996 on the sharing of the dry season flows at Farakka turned out to be merely an arithmetical exercise on amounts of water to be shared, without looking at overall impact on the river systems.\nFloods are regular phenomena in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. From the perspective of natural science, floods are integral components of the eco-hydrological cycle. They cause damage, but also, as the floodwater recedes, it leaves behind rich silt and sediments, which have made the Gangetic plains the \"rice bowl of South Asia\". The real problems start when the floods become severe, or when they start depositing sand instead of silt.\n[youtube id=\"BUvC3Rito4o\"]\nBut what happens when the silt is blocked by a barrage? The Bihar chief minister says the sediment build-up upstream of the Farakka barrage has raised the riverbed, which is worsening the flood situation. It also diverts the water meant for the Bhagirathi-Hooghly branch of the Ganges into a narrow channel in Malda district of West Bengal, leading to bank erosion and flooding.\nWithout the barrage the river would have carried the sediment to the delta and flushed some of it out to the Bay of Bengal. The Bengal delta is built on the huge sediment load carried by the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. Now the Farakka barrage seems to have incapacitated the river's potential to perform this function. The barrage and subsequent lack of sediment separation technology seem to have punctured the \"soil formation\" service of the river further downstream. The avowed purpose of resuscitating the Kolkata port has not been satisfied either.\nCure worse than disease\nNevertheless, the removal of the barrage may create other problems, and might escalate the conflict between states and between nations. There is no doubt that one benefit of the barrage is amelioration of the water problem during lean seasons in the densely populated areas of West Bengal, due to the flows through the Bhagirathi-Hooghly channel. The drinking water and sanitation problems of the burgeoning Kolkata metropolis seem to have been reduced due to the Farakka barrage, which has not only resuscitated the surface water flow in the channel, but may have also ensured groundwater recharge. Removal of the barrage will negatively affect the populace and ecosystem services in this part of the state, leading to resistance, and possibly conflict.\n[iframe id=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=15nLXsXaox0RRCk62MhE20H8eVMA\"]\nBut at the very least, the problems created by the Farakka barrage should inform new projects. There are good examples of how to build a barrage and use the sediments at the same time.\nBut at the very least, the problems created by the Farakka barrage should inform new projects. There are good examples of how to build a barrage and use the sediments at the same time. The Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze designed by Chinese experts helps in flood control, and also uses the peak flow to flush the sediments downstream for floodplain cultivation. However even Chinese officials admit the negative impact of this controversial project due to unintended build up of sediment behind the dam, and devastating landslides are becoming more frequent around the site.\nWhile India needs to evolve better ecologically informed engineering, we also need to pay serious attention to the management of Himalayan rivers. Especially when discussing ideas of integrated river basin management, we need to consider river basin commissions with powers to mediate between states so as to avoid escalation of inter-state conflicts on river waters.\n\nNilanjan Ghosh is Senior Fellow and Head of Economy and Development, Observer Research Foundation Kolkata; and Senior Economic Advisor at World Wide Fund for Nature, New Delhi, India.

Comparatively, the number of deaths came down to 9,906 with 4.5 million people were affected between 2006 and 2015.\nMozharul Huq, general secretary of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS), said: \"The improvement of preparation taken against any disaster has assisted Bangladesh to bring down the number of deaths in recent natural disasters.\n\"Bangladesh suffered the catastrophic blow of deaths between 3,00,000 and 5,00,000 during the Cyclone Bhola in 1970.\nThrough better preparation, casualties were reduced to a little over 3,000 during Cyclone Sidr in 2007, and a mere 190 during Cyclone Aila in 2009. The number is shown to be continuously decreasing, as the number of deaths from all natural disasters totalled 290 in 2015.\"\nHuq added: \"If the progress continues, the damage and death would come under control by 2030.\"\nAfter unveiling the report as chief guest, Disaster Management Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya said: \"To achieve more advancement in this regard, the government will build 220 more cyclone centres across the country.\"\n\"At present, there are 153 centres and some 55,000 volunteers in the country,\" the minister added.\nVice Chairman of BDRCS Mohammad Habibe Millat MP said: \"In international meetings, Bangladesh is cited as the model for disaster management and the country has to keep up the pace of progress.\"\nHe urged the minister to ensure the Bangladesh government's official involvement in the IFRC 1 billion Coalition by signing with the UN for a permanent mission of the country.\nEarlier, senior advisor of IFRC Bangladesh office, Shammi Ahmed, elaborated on the 1 billion Coalition campaign saying: \"People need to be aware as 4.4m people were affected by disasters in 2015 alone. Furthermore, they were suspecting that some 18m people would be affected by climate-induced displacement next year.\"\n\"1,00,000 children are dying each year from diarrheal diseases. 63M people lack access to sanitation throughout the world and 21m lack safe water\" she added.\nThe report said, according to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), 371 disasters were triggered by natural hazards and 203 by technological hazards in 2015 worldwide.\nThe number of natural hazards (DTNH) was the fourth highest of the decade, close to its decade's annual average (375), and the number of technical hazards (DTTH) was the third lowest of the decade, 13 percent below the decade's annual average (234).\nFloods remain the most frequent DTNH, but their number was down to 154 in 2015, 10% below the decade's annual average of 172. With 114 disasters, storms were in the second position, but this number was the highest of the decade, at 18% above the decade's annual average 97. The number of 33 disasters triggered by droughts was the highest of the decade as well, being 38% above the decade's annual average of 24.\nThe number of deaths caused by DTNH is 22,724 which is the fifth highest of the decade, but still remains 67% below its annual average of 69,808, far from the peaks of 2008 (242,215 deaths) and 2010 (314,503 deaths).\nThe deadliest DTNH of 2015 was the earthquake which hit Nepal in April and killed 8,831 people. This is very far from the number of deaths - 138,375 deaths - caused by cyclone Nargis in Myanmar in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2016-11-07 00:00:00      \n\nAbu Taher Khokon: The colourful proponent of black and white photography\n\n\n\n\nSaqib Sarker\n\n,\n\nSaqib Sarker\n\n\n\n\n Published at 03:17 pm November 7th, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nIn Khokon's photography book Shada Kalo (Black and white), the international award winning photo-journalist captures the reflections from childhood. As the name implies, Khokon's work is in black and white.\nAbu Taher Khokon has worked in many different newspapers in Bangladesh since 1986. He was staff photo journalist at the Daily New Nation from 1986 to 1995. He was then chief staff photographer at the Morning Sun for about five years. He was also the chief photo journalist at New Age from 2003 to 2010.\n\"There are innumerable children in this country whose lives are colourless and engulfed in darkness. In other words, they are black and white. These poverty stricken children do not see the glistening colours of life as we see them. Their journey through life is filled with tribulations,\" Khokon described the philosophy behind the work in his book.\nThe book showcases 65 brilliantly captured images. The photos are often bleak and harrowing. Themes explored include childhood, laughter, playing, labour, heat of summer, drought, winter, flood, unnatural deaths, solidarity, drugs, uprising, education and patriotism.\nThe launching ceremony for the book was held in New York September 30 this year. The founder of Joyeeta Publication and renowned photo journalist Yasin Kabir Joy chaired the event. The programme was achored by journalist Akbar Haidar Kiron. The editor of Shada Kalo Nizam Chowdhury, the editor-in-chief of Weekly Thikana Muhammad Fazlur Rahman, editor of Weekly Ajkal Manjur Ahmed and CEO of Times TV Abu Taher spoke at the event.\nKhokon delivered the welcoming speech at the event. Senior journalist Kazi Mintu spoke on blcak and white photography. One of the main convener of the programme was popular expat photo journalist Nihar Siddiki.\nThe 65 photos in the book are categorized under 14 categories. The first photo from the \"childhood\" series embodies the picture of underprivileged, repressed, and poverty stricken children. They too have the aspirations. But they live with uncertainty.\nKhokon's vision is optimistic despite the grim overtone in his work. He likes to capture laughter a lot. The photo of poor children playing cricket on a big garbage dumping ground is jubilant from the universal mirthful excitement of children. But at the same time there is a surrealistic aura in it, particularly because of the hoards of kites in the background. Khokon does not shy away from capturing that too.\nBut sometimes it's not possible to be optimistic. The photos of landslide victims are hard to look at. They are as agonizing as they are real. Hope is also difficult to find in the life and death struggle during floods and bone shuddering winter under the open sky.\nKhokon has a special eye for finding union between people and animals. His photos capturing dogs finding shelter with humans and monkeys taking refuge on the shoulder of a man during flood is mesmerizing.\nThe \"narcotics\" category shows the devastating pictures of street children sniffing drugs en masse. Khokon also captured how children are used and abused by state and political powers.\nThe last photo of the book again snaps a little girl smiling, apparently oblivious to her hapless state and lack of material possessions. Despite its focus on children, the book is an anthology of Bangladesh and the realities of the country. The tonality of the photography imprints a melancholic impression on the viewers.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "headline": "How many migrants are there in the world?",
      "authors": "Tribune International Desk",
      "text": "Date Published:2016-12-18 00:00:00      \nWar and poverty in the Middle East and Africa have forced record numbers to flee their homes, fuelling Europe's largest refugee and migrant crisis since World War II. Some 1.4 million people have headed to Europe in the last two years, triggering disputes between countries over how to handle the influx and boosting support for anti-immigration populists. In the United States, President-elect Donald Trump, who made immigration a key campaign issue, has promised to build a wall along the Mexican border, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and ban immigration from countries that have been \"compromised by terrorism\". Here are some facts on migrants and refugees: The number of international migrants has increased over the past 50 years to nearly 250m in 2015, from about 79m in 1960. International migrants - those living in a country that is different from their country or territory of birth - make up 3.3% of the world's population. Migrants and refugees often travel in the same way. But economic migrants leave their country to improve the future economic prospects of themselves and their families, whereas refugees are fleeing conflict or persecution. At the end of 2015 there were 65.3m forcibly displaced people. They included 21.3m refugees, 40.8m internally displaced and 3.2m asylum seekers. One in every 113 people globally is either an asylum-seeker, internally displaced or a refugee.  More than 4,700 migrants have died attempting treacherous sea journeys to Europe this year, the deadliest on record. Italy has become the top destination for those heading to Europe by boat, with more than 179,000 arrivals. The US has more international migrants than any other country, ahead of Germany (12m), Russia (11.6m), Saudi Arabia (10.2m) and Britain (8.5m). The US-Mexico migration corridor is one of the most travelled routes in the world. During fiscal year 2016, which ended in September, the number of people detained along the border surpassed 408,000, a 23% jump from last year, although it was less than in 2014. In 2015, migrants around the world sent nearly $600bn dollars back to relatives in their home countries. Nine in 10 refugees are hosted in developing regions. Turkey has the largest number with more than 3m refugees. As weather extremes strengthen and sea levels rise, migration experts have warned that forced migration linked to climate pressures is poised to become a problem that could dwarf refugee flows. The average number of people displaced by natural disasters, including floods, storms and droughts, has averaged 22.5 million a year since 2008 and is growing. Source: Thomson Reuters Foundation"

      "headline": "Things to know about likely-dead Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau",
      "authors": "Tribune International Desk",
      "text": "Date Published:2016-08-24 00:00:00      \nNigeria claimed on Tuesday that its air force had killed a number of senior Boko Haram militants, possibly including the group's elusive and notorious former leader, Abubakar Shekau. Government planes attacked the fighters in the village of Taye inside the Sambisa forest in Borno State during a raid on the Islamists' northeast heartland on Friday night, Reuters reports. Army spokesman Colonel Sani Kukasheka Usman said, in a statement, that \"Their leader, so called 'Abubakar Shekau', is believed to be fatally wounded on his shoulders.\" However, this is at least the fourth time Shekau's death has been reported. Despite the military declaring him killed in 2009, a man purporting to be Shekau reappeared in videos posted on the internet less than a year later, when he ridiculed suggestions of his death. The Boko Haram militant, named among TIME's 100 Most Influential People in 2015 as the \"scourge of Africa,\" was reportedly ousted from his leadership position by IS chiefs earlier this month. Here's what we know about him: Ruthless ideologue Abubakar Muhammad Shekau is believed to have been born between 1965 and 1975 in Shekau village in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe, according to the BBC. He was a theology student and is fluent in his native Kanuri language, as well as Hausa and Arabic, and appears to understand English too. Shekau has been described as having an \"intense ideological commitment and ruthlessness.\" He has demonstrated a blood-thirsty nature, saying in one video: \"I enjoy killing anyone that God commands me to kill - the same way that I enjoy killing chickens and rams.\" Journey to becoming a warlord The jihadist group Boko Haram, whose name translates roughly to \"Western education is forbidden,\" was founded in 2002 by Mohammed Yusuf. Shekau took over as leader in 2009 after Yusuf was paraded and then executed in front of a crowd by Nigerian security forces, retaliating after 70 Boko Haram fighters attacked a mosque and police station in the town of Bauchi. Shekau is said to have married one of Yusuf's four wives and adopted their children, following the former leader's death. Shekau then began to stage increasingly daring kidnapping and killing raids on schools, police stations, federal institutions, churches and mosques thought by Boko Haram to be violating their interpretation of Islam. Under Shekau's leadership, Boko Haram has killed some 20,000 people and displaced more than two million, according to the International Business Times. In 2013, the US government's bounty for Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau stood at $7m - $2m more than what was offered for the Afghan Taliban's top man, Mullah Omar. He formally pledged allegiance to IS's self-styled caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in March 2015, and gave IS its first franchise in sub-Saharan Africa. International pariah  The abduction of over 270 schoolgirls in April 2014 brought Boko Haram into the international spotlight, with many using the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag to raise awareness of the campaign to find the abductees. In a series of videos posted online at the time, Shekau admitted to kidnapping the girls and said he would sell them. \"I abducted your girls. There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell,\" he said, grinning. \"He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women,\" he added, occasionally laughing throughout the segment. Some of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls have been killed by Nigerian military air strikes, according to a new video appearing to come from Boko Haram, which shows one kidnap victim pleading for authorities to bow to the extremists' demands that they release detained militants in return for the girls. It's not clear how many have died among the 218 who remain missing. Ousted by IS leaders At the time of his reported death Shekau had been in a leadership battle with Abu Musab al-Barnawi, who was named by the Islamic State group as the new leader of what it calls its West Africa Province on August 3. An audio speech released the following day, purporting to be from Shekau, criticized his rival and said al-Baghdadi did not respond to letters in which he claimed al-Barnawi is \"an infidel\" preaching \"false creeds.\" According to the Associated Press, Shekau's speech highlighted ideological differences with al-Barnawi, who has promised to end the attacks on mosques and Muslim markets that had become a hallmark of Boko Haram. One of many deaths In 2009, rumors of Shekau's death by security forces did the rounds in Nigeria - however many believed that the announcement was \"merely a ruse, designed to provoke Shekau into making a public appearance or statement, in the hope of flushing him out\", The New York Times reports. He then appeared in a videotaped interview with a local Nigerian journalist in July 2010, as Boko Haram's new leader, a position he had held since taking over from Yusuf the year before. In 2013, an army spokesman announced that Shekau \"may have died\" between July 25 and August 3 during a shoot-out with security forces. And one year later, the Cameroonian military released photos believed to be of Shekau, suggesting he was killed during a cross border raid inside Nigeria. At the time, Ryan Cummings, a security analyst, said \"Is this his fourth or fifth death? He dies more often than an iPhone battery,\" according to the UK's Times newspaper. After Shekau's third death in 2014, theories circulated that the body was that of an impostor. The Washington Post reported that the Nigerian military issued a statement saying a corpse photographed by Cameroon military's photograph was that of \"a doppelganger, masquerading as the leader.\" Tuesday's statement made no mention of a doppelganger. Only time will tell if this fourth reported death proves to be terminal. [This is an excerpt from a Time Article, Which can be found at http://ti.me/2biHK0l]"

      "text": "Date Published:2013-05-22 00:00:00      \n\nAround 100 illegal police boxes clamp Dhaka's pavements, traffic islands and circles,obstructing pedestrian and traffic movement in the capital. \nThe ill planned structures arereportedly built upon an understanding between sections of unscrupulous police personnel and different advertising agencies. \n\"Advertising agencies find police boxes highly focal to present their messages to commuters moving in the city and pedestrians using the pavements,\" a senior city corporation official said, requesting anonymity. \nAccording to the DCC official, Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) started constructing these illegal infrastructures back in 2007 and 2008, in violation of then united DCC's rule. \nThe police department is required to take DCC'spermission to build any structure on the pavement, he said. \nHe added that the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) authorities (both South and North) are virtually helpless removing these boxes, which are being built illegally on the pavements and roadsides. \nPolice however claims that the boxes work as shelter for traffic polices from rain and heat.  \nThe DCC official claimed that both DCCshave sent letters to the home ministry,asking it to take actions removing these structures to improve traffic management, minimise road congestion and ensure safe movement for the pedestrians. \nTazul Islam Pradhan, chief estate officer of Dhaka South Corporation (DSCC) told the Dhaka Tribune recently, \"We demolished a number of police boxes in the past, but after just a few days, most of them were rebuilt. \n\"Most police boxes that rent out space for commercial advertisements are illegally using electricity and water as well. \n\"Every day, one or two more of these boxes are sprawling up on the city streets but due to police'snon-cooperation, DCCs' eviction drive stalled.\" \nA senior secretary at the home ministry declined to discuss the issue when contacted. \nMainuddin Khandokar, additional secretary of the home ministry told the Dhaka Tribune that, he was unaware of any letters from DCCs regarding removal of illegal police boxes in the city. \n\"The boxes are useful for those policemen who are working in the city to control traffic and ensure security of its citizens. Most of these were built with the help of different sponsors. City corporation authorities are opposing these boxes as they do not get advertisement fees,\" he claimed."

The final approval for those six schemes remain pending. \nA large number of other such schemes of land developers have failed to obtain Rajuk approval while the government mulls over reviewing the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) for giving a further controversial approval to those unapproved schemes.  \nOn condition of anonymity, a Rajuk official alleged that the Capital Development Authority and the Ministry of Housing and Public Works had been mulling over a plan to give such approval to the mushrooming housing projects in wetlands under DAP without taking into consideration the environmental protection. \nThe official also said a review committee on DAP at the ministerial meetings recently focused on relaxation of using wetlands and few water bodies for the housing projects. \nThe State Minister for Housing and Public Works advocate Abdul Mannan Khan told the Dhaka Tribune the final decision was yet to be made on whether to review the DAP. \nHe said the DAP review issue will be tabled in the upcoming interministerial meeting to reach the final decision. \nAsked whether the review was for the interest of land developers and going to be conflicted with the 2004 private land development act, he said he was unable to say anything in advance because the decision would solely be made at the next meeting.  \nIt was also learnt that more 400 appeals from housing developers had been lodged with Rajuk for changing their land use plans within DAP area only to advance their housing schemes. \nFrom 1984 to date, only 25 schemes of 13 housing companies got Rajuk approval. \nThe 25 are 30.44-acre Pallabi Residential Project (Phase-1), 32.9-acre Arambagh Cooperative Housing Society (Mirpur Land Project), 3.54-acre Kallyanpur Land Project, 1310-acre Bonosree Residential Project, 197.21-acre Metropolitan Project, 232.27-acre Pallabi Residential Project (Phase-2), 3.74-acre Baghbari Shishmahal Land Project, 1.33-acre KM Das Lane Residential Project, 3.32-acre Rayerbazar Project, 2.22-acre Postogola Residential Project, 9.59-acre Postogola Riverview Land Project, 3.03-acre Basabo Residential Project and 58.64-acre Niketon Residential Project. \nAll the housing schemes belonged to the Eastern Housing Ltd.  \nMoreover, the 12-acre Baitul Aman Cooperative Housing Project, 45.81-acre Mohammadpur Housing Pisciculture and Farming Cooperative Society Housing, 1.49-acre Adarsha Sayaneer Housing Cooperative Ltd's Sayaneer Project, 40.95-acre Sikder Real Estate Project, 10.15-acre Abdur Rafique Housing  Ltd's Mohammadpur Project, 18.71-acre Sunibir Greho Nirman Coopetative Housing Project, five-acre Metropolitan Christian Cooperative Housing Project, 6.13-acre Cap Hason Housing Project, 305-acre East West Property Development Pvt Ltd Bashundhara Project (Phase-1) 4.63-acre Janata Housing Cooperative Society Project, 4.53-acre Mukti Housing Project, 4.53-acre Mollika Residential Project under Sheltech Pvt Ltd and 2.8-acre Probal Housing Project have also got Rajuk approval. \nIn 2012, as per the directives of the housing ministry, Rajuk gave final approval to a number of six schemes of six companies including Bashundhara-Baridhara Project (Phase-2) of East West Property Pvt Ltd, Ashiyan City, 137.2145-acre United City Residential Project (Phase-1) of Neptune Land Development Ltd, 172.63-acre Notundhara Residential Project of BDDL, 148.73-acre Green Model Town Residential Project (Phase-1) under Amin Mohammad Lands Development and 75.17-acre Swarnali Abashan Project (Phase- 1) of Swadesh Properties. \nThe six had been illegally developed destroying wetlands, flood plains, cropland and rural homesteads in violation of the Private Housing Development Act 2004 and the conditions of DAP. \nThe six housing schemes are among the 77 housing development projects declared illegal by the High Court in June, 2011. \nThe HC also had directed the government to take action against the project authorities who grabbed those land over the past decades by filling up low-lying wetland, water bodies and rural homesteads. \nMoreover, the six housing projects failed to meet conditions of standard housing facilities. \nThe optimum utility services and basic amenities including market, hospital, drugstores, educational institutions, playground, graveyard etc. within the vicinities - major conditions of the housing act - lacked those schemes. \nMoreover, these schemes do not conform to their layouts and Geographic Information System (GIS) database, which are also violation of the private housing act. \nRajuk authorities said they gave temporary approval to the six companies which were being evaluated and letters were issued to the companies to revise their housing plans. \nSheikh Abdul Mannan, Rajuk member, planning, told the Dhaka Tribune \"We have just given temporary approval to the six housing projects. The projects' authorities are trying to fulfill the private housing conditions of 2004.\" \n\"When they are able to meet the conditions, they will get Rajuk final approval,\" he added. \nIn reply to a query, Abdul Mannan said not only those six housing schemes, but also other such schemes would get Rajuk approval provided they fulfilled the Private Housing Land Development Act."

The society's President Firoz M Hassan inaugurated the recycling management system at a programme - Value for Waste Project - held at Baridhara Lakeside Rajuk Park, in presence of other leaders of the society, locals, media and cultural personalities. \"Applying the recycling system that is a barrel composting method, it would be possible that 40 to 48 percent of kitchen wastes will turn into high quality compost of organic fertilzer. Thus, a huge amount of wastes would not be required to be dumped at the landfills,\" said Firoz M Hassan at the inauguration. At the same time, the society also inaugurated a tree plantation programme which expects to plant some 500 saplings on the lakeside park. \"The system is affordable, environment-friendly and would be able to create a financial source which is important for the country,\" he added. Earlier in January, the new waste recycling project was introduced in the community based waste recycling system this year, funded by Swisscontact and Pran-RFL. Firoz also claimed though the recycling system has been inaugurated recently, it had started in January of this year and the initiatives had been introduced in September-October, 2013. The inauguration ceremony was also addressed by Badiur Rahman, former president of Baridhara Society, English daily the News Today Editor Riaz Uddin Ahmed, Ekattor Television Director Syed Ishtiaque Reza, Singer Samina Chowdhury, among others. The new recycling system asks kitchen wastes to be separated in four categories using containers of four different colours - green, yellow, red and blue - to recycle them properly."

      "text": "Date Published:2014-05-17 00:00:00      \nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said military dictator General Ziaur Rahman wanted to erase the name of Awami League after the brutal assassination of Bangabandhu as he (Zia) considered the party his main enemy. She said General Zia was appointed army chief by Khandakar Moshtaque and he was made the president and army chief simultaneously as he forced the then president Justice ASM Sayem to step down at gunpoint. \"After becoming president, General Zia wanted to destroy the signs and spirit of the War of Liberation side by side with erasing the name of Awami League,\" she said, adding the anti-liberation forces emerged during his misrule. Sheikh Hasina, also the Awami League president, told leaders of Awami League and its associate bodies who came to her Ganobhaban residence here this morning on the occasion of her 33rd Homecoming Day. Senior Awami League leaders including Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Begum Matia Chowdhury, Obaidul Quader, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Advocate Sahara Khatun, Syed Ashraful Islam and PM's Advisor HT Imam were present, among others. On this day in 1981, Sheikh Hasina returned home after six years in exile following the brutal assassination of the architect of independent Bangladesh Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members on August 15 in 1975. Sheikh Hasina and her younger sister Sheikh Rehana escaped the carnage as they were in Germany at that time. The Prime Minister said General Zia grabbed the state power by violating the constitution. \"The country witnessed frequent coups during his rule and he killed sector commanders of the War of Liberation one after another,\" she said. Earlier, the leaders of Bangladesh Awami League and its associate bodies greeted the Prime Minister by presenting bouquets and chanting slogans on the occasion of the Homecoming Day.  In an emotion-charged voice, the Prime Minister said after the assassination of Bangabandhu, four national leaders were brutally killed and numerous leaders and workers of the party were thrown into jail to eliminate Awami League. Recalling her Homecoming Day on May 17 in 1981, Sheikh Hasina said she returned home on a rainy and stormy day when thousands of people braving the inclement weather assembled at the airport to welcome her. \"When I returned home I didn't have any asset except the courage and inspiration of the Awami League leaders and workers,\" she said. \"When I returned home, there was a flood of millions of people and there was love for me. But my most beloved persons whose love I expected most were not there,\" she said referring to the killing of Bangabandhu and others who were assassinated on the fateful night of August 15. While recalling her tragic and terrible days, the Prime Minister became emotional and tears rolled down her cheek. Sheikh Hasina said General Zia ran the country by imposing curfew at night. \"Rehana and I were not allowed to enter our historic Dhanmondi 32 residence. We were even barred to hold milad at our house,\" she said. The Prime Minister said they used to spend time on the bank of Dhanmondi Lake. \"The sufferers could only say what frightful days we passed at that time,\" she said. After my coming back home, my number one thought was to put the country back on the path of democracy along with materializing the dream of Bangabandhu and strengthening the party. \"I could not think where we would stay and what we would eat,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said when she returned home she saw that the country went against the War of Liberation and the anti-liberation forces were running Bangladesh under the patronization of General Zia. "

The company started to repair the route with the sand of four sand quarries of Kashiani upazila after taking lease from deputy commissioner office. The sources said the company people did not follow the government rule while they were lifting sand from the river. They had crossed the limit and lifted sand from another place of the river beyond their lease, added the sources. Locals alleged that the Water Development Board (WDB) has built town protection embankment which is now at risk due to random sand lifting.  Executive Engineer of WDB Mohiuddin submitted a memorandum on August 18, to the deputy commissioner protesting illegal sand lifting by the company men. Max Group Surveyor Monwar Hossain was told to lift sand following the government rule. But the company did not follow the advice, said Mohiuddin. Locals also submitted memorandum to the DC protesting the illegal sand lifting.  Dabiruddin of Charkalna area said the company people were lifting sand in their area which was not taken as lease by DC office. Osman Ali of Charfukra area said flood protection dam in Shankarpasha and Fukra areas got damaged due to unplanned sand lifting from the river bed. Houses, schools, colleges, madrasas and many other establishments in the area were on the verge of extinction due to sand lifting, said locals.  Locals and the company people got locked into clashes several times over the issue, said sources. Seeking anonymity, some people in the area said ruling party men were involved with the company men. When the local people protested the illegal sand lifting the ruling party musclemen including police personnel harassed them.  Selim Khan, a resident of Fukra area, of the upzila, said: \"I have lost my cropland near the river due to illegal sand lifting. When I started protesting, police picked up me and tortured brutally.\" Later, I got released in-exchange of money, he added. Firoz Khan, another resident of the area, said: \"I am going to loss six acres of land for illegal sand lifting.\" Kamrul Hasan, assistant commissioner of Kashiani upazila, said : \"We have alerted Max Company project manager several times, but they did not pay heed to our appeal.\" Abdul Ohab, manager of the company, said they would take steps if there was their fault.  DC Moklessur Rahman said he could not say anything in this regard as he had taken charge only few days before. "

      "text": "Date Published:2016-12-23 00:00:00      \nI readily recall my first visit to Wari Bateshwar. Accompanied by the excellent Professor Sufi Rahman and his friend, a geologist, we walked from our vehicle across rice fields that were obviously part of the very wide and evident moat to the gap in the mud rampart. It was impossible to tell the period of moat and rampart through which we passed, onto open farm land, although they bore a remarkable resemblance to Iron Age encampments in the UK. We were greeted by kids bearing their latest surface finds, a bead or two, amongst them; finds encouraged by the professor in his work of community engagement, such as I had rarely experienced in the UK. I wondered if, introduced to such tangible evidence of heritage from such an early age, their obvious engagement and interest could endure. Such involvement, and the finds were perhaps unsurprising on an already widely acknowledged archaeological site, carefully managed under the \"community archaeology\" philosophy I came to admire at various archaeological sites I subsequently visited in Bangladesh. But it was, I suppose, the bracelet proudly shown me, later in the visit, by the wife of a local farmer, comprising of beads, readily identified to me as dating probably from the late centuries BCE, that truly stirred my imagination. They comprised, for the most part, agates, but also an identifiable amethyst and jade. What jeweller, I wondered, crafted these beads of semi-precious stones? Who were the women, perhaps even the men, for whom the wearing of the beads represented such a show of status and wealth? At that point, I could not imagine. But, above all, who were the craftsmen, and women, perhaps, who cut them so finely? Subsequent travels in Bangladesh revealed to me such a huge array of  buildings from late centuries BCE onward, and evidence of other craft skills such as sculpture, that I became entirely enraptured by the evidence of history, heritage, and culture; it would be fair to say I fell completely in love. Since then, taking advantage of the massive library of the world wide web, I have never ceased to research, and write, of that history and heritage, and the culture that evolved from it. Jahangirnagar University, I was told, had \"tens of thousands\" of such beads from the site, and other sites around Bangladesh. Nothing could have convinced me, more surely, not only of the very rich history of Bangladesh that already intrigued me, but also seeing the beads proudly worn by a local woman, of the flesh and blood of that history. In the years since, I have researched and written hundreds of thousands of words about the amazing peoples of these lands, and, certainly weekly, developed ever newer insights into the nation's history as yet mostly untold. Academic writers, of course, are usually tasked with evidence and with references for \"peer group\" revue. Sadly, Bangladesh, as a nation, seems lacking in much speculative history, the foundations of such study, as western nations enjoyed for centuries. Who has never unwrapped a seasonal gift, and found within the wrapping the key to something that can bring excitement and pleasure for a lifetime? For some, these days it is the laptop, the tablet, the smart phone, that first opens to a youth a world of information, communication, and entertainment. Such a pity, perhaps, that it often appears to be the minutiae of the life, loves, and passions of those who strive for fortunes through fame that seems to engross so many of those young people today, rather than seeking to explore their own, incredible, world leading, past, which can offer such potential for a richer present. An unparalleled heritage to bequeath their own descendants. \"Too much information,\" is a phrase, too, that describes the limitation of the use of intelligence and insight, to follow clues, to speculate, discover, and confirm realities. Often, however, it requires only the self to wrap and gift that incredible past to the present. My own lifelong fascination with history, and the doors it opens to understanding both heritage and a true cultural appreciation, commenced, unforgettably, at a tender age, long pre-teen, in a remote, rural corner of Berkshire, the original Berkshire, in Britain, called Silchester. Was that, I wonder, my first \"moment of Zen?\" Certainly it has produced, since, in my life, multitudinous such episodes of reflection, far from confined to, although certainly highlighted by, such as the famous \"Rock Garden\" in Kyoto, Japan, that opened whole new thought, many of which found expression in Bangladesh, as such as Paharpur, Mainamati, and Jahagadal.  How often, over the years, I have held in the palm of my hand an enormous diversity of small objects, and sought for the what, why, when, where, who, how; it has led me, almost like the fabled time machine, through many periods, places, and peoples. At the time of my childhood, the BBC -- in those days more a part of real life than now -- carried a children's program, How things began, dramatising history and prehistory in short, apparent eye witness accounts. Such a challenge to the young imagination. Perhaps I never grew up because, of course, I no longer need the BBC to inspire me to take advantage of the extraordinary online opportunities to research around such objects. And, of course, not only objects ... whole towns, cities, nations, even peoples. On the day of which I write, as a family we walked past a small, ancient church. Revelling, on the way, in the name, Julius Caesar, on one grave stone, through a gap in what seemed a massive stone-built wall, comprising, in large part, chunks of flint stones, which were common enough in the geology of the area. Such treasures as the string of beads in the possession of a farmer's wife at Wari Bateshwar; coins of the Sultanate -- not the gold, but the heritage -- the entirety of the tangible history and heritage of Bangladesh, are but pieces of evidence in an exciting story of who we are, where we come from, and how that past continues to influence our today A stony track led across fields of stubble from recent harvest and, to my delight, almost buried in the soil, I found a piece of glazed pot. It was red in colour, with dry mud clinging to it. A piece of flower pot, I thought, familiar from the family greenhouse, one that adjoined the end of our family home. A greenhouse which, I already understood, had been the coach house of the fine, late Victorian mansion that housed the new \"Secondary Modern\" school, as legislated for in our 1944 Education Act, of which my father had become the founding father. As any child might, I rushed to show my mother this treasure of domesticity. She took it, and told me that the last person to handle this fragment of pot -- which she identified as Samian ware, explaining it as a piece of a very valuable family treasure of domestic pottery in Roman times -- was almost certainly someone who lived nearly two thousand years before. Comparing it to her Coalport tea service inherited from her parents, she assured me that the bowl of which this was a fragment had, certainly, been treasured then, as much as her mother's Coalport was by us. Years later, travelling through North Bengal, my interest, bordering on obsession, in the heritage and culture of Bangladesh, was similarly piqued. We were driving on a road across those very flat flood plains, and noticed a hill beside the road. We stopped, to climb the hill, and found the soil rich in terracotta fragments, and shards of pottery. I picked a piece of the nearly complete base of a pot. It was already clear that the hill covered an unrecorded site of yet another Buddhist Vihara. The piece of pottery was subsequently identified as 7th century in origin. Such pieces can be the beginning of the myriad threads that lead any of us, not merely, as in Bangladesh, to ancestors, and the stories that eventuate in the present day, but even as I have found threads that weave into my own, and my nation's history. A history that, even today, is memorialised in mansions and palaces, often financed by the peoples of Bangladesh. Such treasures as the string of beads in the possession of a farmer's wife at Wari Bateshwar; coins of the Sultanate -- not the gold, but the heritage -- the entirety of the tangible history and heritage of Bangladesh, are but pieces of evidence in an exciting story of who we are, where we come from, and how that past continues to influence our today, as it will our futures, all of us. Today, my own garden, beneath a 19th century \"lazy bed,\" a method of cultivation lies an unexplained bed of flat stones; nearby, a large piece of flint stone, not native to the area, and what is probably part of a stone axe three thousand years old, offers clues to those who lived on this piece of land, long ago. The people who once were in a line of human society that will, hopefully, survive long after I am gone. I wonder what my activities have contributed to my children's and my grandchildren's generations, and beyond? A heritage that continues, at least in Britain, to literally enrich the present and almost certainly, future generations. The world of the wealthier, better educated peoples, continue to beat a path to Britain to share in the exploration of a past. A past, in fact, a little richer, and certainly less lengthy, than that which Bangladesh has to offer to its people, today, and potentially, to millions of those who, like me, continue to search the past to enrich the present, and revel in it.

      "text": "Date Published:2016-09-24 00:00:00      \nLying on the fringes of the famous Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove swamp forest, but also close to the shores of the delta of three of Asia's most famous rivers, Brahmaputra, Meghna, and, above all, the Ganges, it is difficult to know how to balance the advantages and disadvantages that led to the growth of what is now known as \"one of the 15 lost cities of the world,\" according to Forbes Magazine. Archaeological and some documentary and circumstantial evidence suggest that the city that we know today for its rich Islamic heritage, created in the 15th century, had far more ancient foundations. It would be rather strange if it had not. The mangrove swamp was well-known to ancient travellers and merchants from across the world since very early times, located, as it is, on the edge of the entry to the great international trading centre for which we have evidence from, at latest, the middle of the last millennium BCE. And we have many reasons to suppose that such habitable lands on the fringes, in proximity to the Bay of Bengal, would probably have been occupied long before our recorded history. Indeed, the evidence of an early Buddhist settlement in the locale is compelling, though we may well doubt if it survived by the time of the early 15th century arrival, thereabouts of the warrior Turk, Khan Jahan Ali. Clearly a well organised, charismatic soldier and devout Muslim, it is unclear what motivated his arrival in these lands that are now Bangladesh. However, as a soldier of the declining, brutal, Tuqhlaq regime in Delhi, it might be unsurprising that he should have sought pastures new; especially pastures that were both wealthy, and troubled. Not that he would have found much to comfort him in the times of the Ilyas Shahi Dynasty, then the short lived Raja Ganesha family, and the restoration of the Ilyas Shahi that ruled in Bengal independently throughout his lifetime. It is believed, however, that he left the service of the Delhi regime, following the sacking of that city by the infamous Mongol, Tamerlane, in the last years of the 14th century. After serving the succession of Nawabs of Bengal, he received the grant of these remote lands beside the waters of the Ganges delta, on the fringe of the mangrove swamp, and removed himself with an apparently large number of probably, similarly displaced, and evidently loyal followers, to build the new city that we now know as Bagerhat. And, as a forerunner of many other such cities around the rapidly changing world, it became, it seems, in very few decades of work, a very modern urban centre. For a few centuries subsequently, it may have been abandoned, but once the clearing of vegetation that had engulfed it was cleared, it emerged as one of the most startling, small Islamic cities in the world. One might almost say, a \"time capsule\" of such traditional, medieval Islamic civilisation. It was the brick road -- shown to me by graduates of Jahangirnagar University, who I was glad to have working with me at the time -- that first struck me as the very epitome of modern urban development. Clearly brick-making skills, probably made by slave labour, though supervised and trained by Khan Jahan's entourage, were one of the earliest innovations, which, combined with very evident architectural skills, bear testimony to a group also rich in engineering and non-military skills. No new community is built, today, without first laying out the road system. And, in a sense, it shares with such notable sites as Fatepur Sikri, a former, short-lived capital city of the Mughal Dynasty in today's India, amongst others around the world, a short, but substantial life. A life that has in the past half century been slowly uncovered by human endeavour from the forces of nature. The durability of both many places of worship, and well-built \"barrack blocks,\" suggest that although it seems that most accommodation was probably built of wood, this was a settlement built to endure. It is, however, clearly the array of mosques which are the most lasting mark of this \"lost\" city. Why, we might well ask, were so many needed? Especially if we accept a premise that other faith groups probably lived within the settlement?  Some sense of the original community can still be found in the area of the tomb of Khan Jahan, on the banks of the large tank known as Thakur Dighi, which, in the traces of animist cultural traditions commonly seen at such sites across Bangladesh, retains crocodiles in the waters, carefully conserved. It is not only the simplicity of the fine buildings of the tomb, with the close proximity of that of his best friend, Ali Taheerer, which appeal; it is also the row of shops and teashops that line the approach road. In one of those shops, things such as Chakra stones, and East India Company coinage are on sale amongst more usual tourist trinkets, revealing a cultural diversity, perhaps, of which Khan Jahan, like most of his contemporaries, it seems, would probably have approved ... unlike some of the more vociferous in today's calling? It is, of course, however, the \"Sixty Dome\" mosque, which draws most eyes; misnamed, of course, since the 60 pillars produce some 77 domes! Curiously, whilst the external prospect is not especially lovely, the magnificence and similarity of the pillared interior to that of many Gothic contemporary edifices in Europe is particularly striking. But the totality, built from brick in the slightly earlier Tughlaq tradition of that somewhat brutal regime elsewhere in India, may not be the loveliest of mosques, it is the most famous, becoming listed a UNESCO world heritage site. Single dome mosques characterise most of those built in the original development of the \"new city,\" and, as originating in a pre-Mughal period can easily be compared, if not exactly in beauty, certainly in dignity, with those of the Mughal era with which Bangladesh abounds. Both the nine dome mosque, that stands on the western side of Thakur Dighi, and the splendid 10 dome mosque in nearby Krishnanagar, are masterful reflections of  simplicity of design, and excellence of build of the sparsely decorated modesty of all these original masterpieces. The district today is said to contain over 300 mosques, which, apparently somewhat superfluous to the relatively sparsely inhabited area, may also raise questions about the number of original mosques for what would seem to have been a not especially numerous, original Muslim population. Not that evidence of other buildings of great age is not plentiful, although today, most are represented more by mounds that are actual remnants. The site of Khan Jahan's residence and private mosque has been identified, and some barracks and barrack mosques have been largely uncovered. It is arguable that more extensive excavation and clearance will eventually reveal a great deal more about the ancient history of the area within and around today's town. And it will almost certainly prove to have been, like the rest of Bangladesh, a rich, as well as ancient history. It is just, perhaps, that so remote from  Dhaka, today's demands on the area continue to be more aqua and agricultural than commercial or industrial... at least for now! And this fairly recently rediscovered, fascinating, urban development probably represents more of a potential tourist attraction than simply economic. What preceded the urban development may, yet, throw more light on the heritage of this corner of the country. The tantalising evidence of both Hindu and Buddhist earlier times, and its obvious proximity to those ancient routes of sea trade could prove, as in so many sites in Bangladesh, slowly emerging from the rich alluvial deposits of millennia of seasonal flood waters, to suggest a prospect of even further enrichment of the historic heritage of, not just the beauty of Bangladesh, but also the fascination of that heritage. From the soils of Bangladesh are slowly emerging a number of, hitherto lost, great, and potentially very significant cities: Wari Bateshwar, Bhitagarh, and Egarosindur amongst the least obvious. None can offer, yet, quite the level of tangible evidence of a rich past as Bagerhat; but then the Bagerhat we see today has a visible history of only about six centuries, whilst the others have had a thousand years and more in which to become hidden, and are certainly never likely to enjoy quite the visible and tangible appeal of this fine, ancient, and modern City of Mosques.

      "authors": "Thomson Reuters Foundation",
      "text": "Date Published:2016-11-20 00:00:00      \nThe Fulani graze their cows on the greenery that springs up after the river recedes from its flood plains. As it gets munched the farmers plant their crops, now fertilised by cow dung, so long as they do not block access to the nomads' routes. But as climate change shrinks the river, population growth swells its users and more land gets cultivated, the Fulani are being pushed deeper into poverty. Conflicts with their sedentary neighbours are growing. Throw in radical Islam, abusive security forces, a feeling of political exclusion and a flood of guns from lawless deserts to the north, and conditions are ripe for a rebellion that could destabilise not just Mali but much of West Africa. \"The Fulani feel marginalised everywhere. In Mali, in Guinea, in Central Africa,\" said Abdoul Aziz Diallo, who runs Tabital Pulaaku, a Fulani association spanning 15 countries. \"In Mali, they're being infiltrated by the jihadists from the north and there is a very real danger from new Fulani militias that have emerged and are stoking inter-ethnic strife.\" The road west out of Mopti, a city of muddy streets and a grand clay mosque on the Niger's banks in central Mali, crosses flooded rice fields and land where cows graze on wild grass. Fulani herdsmen in robes and straw hats negotiate livestock sales with Bambara farmers. In May, however, armed Bambara and Fulani groups clashed in Tenenkou, west Mopti, and about 20 people were killed. Such clashes are frequent and might be brushed off as local incidents. But Islamist militants are exploiting Fulani anger to spread jihad from the thinly populated north to its centre. \"The Fulani complained that farmers took all the land,\" said Lala Walet, a Mopti NGO worker promoting livestock commerce. \"So the jihadists came and said 'OK, join our group and we will help you fight to get it back'.\" Jihadists have beheaded or slit the throat of scores of local officials in central and south Mali in the past year. In August 2015, 13 people were killed in a siege of the Byblos Hotel in Sevare, a town separated from Mopti by a tangle of creeks. In July, gunmen killed 17 Malian soldiers in an attack on an army base in the town of Nampala, claimed both by northern jihadists Ansar Dine and a new Fulani militia, the National Alliance to Safeguard the Peuhl Identity and Restore Justice. The latter said on Saturday it would lay down arms and rejoin a government peace process - one that has so far failed to quell the violence in the much more unstable north. Bringing the Fulani into the peace process will be essential to prevent further such attacks, and if efforts to woo youths away from jihad are to have any hope of succeeding. A 2012 Tuareg revolt in northern Mali was hijacked by Islamists, prompting former colonial master France to intervene to push them back. The French action prevented the possible takeover of the capital Bamako by Islamists, a prospect that alarmed Western governments trying to push back the global spread of radical militancy. The subsequent peace deal focused on soothing Tuareg grievances even though many Islamists were Fulanis. That was a mistake, said Mohamed Attayoub, head of the political wing of Ganda-Iso, a Fulani vigilante group. \"We participated in the talks, but when it came to the deal, we were excluded from every organ of the state,\" he said. Security Minister Colonel Salif Traore denied this, telling Reuters that everyone was able to participate. Ali Nouhoum Diallo, an ex-head of both Mali's parliament and the regional bloc ECOWAS, in September created a nationwide vigilante group to help Fulani defend themselves. He said security forces were harassing herders and arresting youths for simply reading the Koran outside. Sitting in his Bamako house, Nouhoum Diallo dismissed the suggestion the Fulanis would rebel for an ethnic homeland, as the Tuaregs did. \"It is impossible for the Fulani to claim independence, because we are spread out everywhere,\" he said. It was the failure of the state to protect them that was banding them together, he said. Security Minister Traore denied organised repression of the Fulani but he admitted profiling may happen. \"We cannot stigmatise people of certain ethnic groups for something they haven't done,\" he said. Still, the crackdown has deepened mistrust and a sense of persecution. Millennia of wandering has left 20 million Fulani scattered across 20 nations, from Senegal's west coast to as far east as Eritrea. Many feel sidelined in Africa's modern states. The sense of exclusion and the shift in the Islamist battlefield southwards to Mali's more populated, richer areas is a headache for President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita. That was highlighted in November 2015, when gunmen killed dozens at the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako. Several Islamist groups claimed the raid but the government gave most credence to the Mopti-based Macina Liberation Front (MLF), a Fulani jihadist group allied to Ansar Dine. The MLF's figurehead, Amadou Koufa, is a fiery cleric whose sermons call on Fulanis to rebuild historic empires like Massina, which once stretched over the Mopti region. Hamma Cisse, an imam who was at the same Koranic school as Koufa, remembers a quarrelsome boy who wrote love songs and became bitter and disillusioned. \"The Fulani felt frustrated,\" he said. \"The pupils in the French schools were considered superior, they always got the jobs. Amadou felt it as a real injustice.\" Koufa moved to Mauritania and came back preaching radical Islam. \"He preached everywhere, village by village,\" Cisse said. \"He was standing up for the Fulani, against poverty, against abuses by the water and forest authorities. One thing I'm sure of - people aren't following him out of religious conviction.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2016-09-07 00:00:00      \nShaharul Islam Md Abu Hena, relief and rehabilitation officer of Bogra district, said: \"Local representatives of the district had disbursed VGF cards among the solvent people instead of helpless and these people used to sell the delivered rice to traders with low prices.\" Ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the government has been distributing rice among VGF card holders. The government has already distributed nearly 1,123 tonnes and 620kg of rices among 212,364 card holders in 12 upzilas and 12 municipalities of the district, said the district relief and rehabilitation officer. \"Instead of this, government had distributed around 509 tonnes of rice among the flood-affected people of the district,\" said Abu Hena. The district relief and rehabilitation officer said to give illegal advantages to relatives and to get supports from the voters, local representatives usually distributed cards among the solvent people, who are not eager to eat the relief rice as the quality of this rice is not good enough, so they sell it to local traders by Tk12 to 14 per kg. He requested to the local representatives to distribute cards among the helpless who really need the card to run their daily lives though local representatives ignored the allegation. During his recent visit to different upazilas of the district this reporter has found that traders of the district were waiting around the rice distribution camps to buy the rice at lower price. After taking the rice, card holders went to the traders and had sold it immediately. To stop this tendency of selling the relief rice, Upazila Nirbahi Officer of Dhunat upazila has conducted several drives in the upazila and sized a huge amount of rice.  Though the upazila officer has warned the traders to stop buying rice from the card holders, people are still selling rice to traders. Some card holders who used to sale the rice to the local traders with very low prices told the Dhaka Tribune wishing anonymity: \"The quality of government rice is very bad and it is quite impossible to eat it.\" \"So we have compelled to sell the rice to buy the good one, they added.\" "

The newly appointed lecturer Abu Saif Mohammed Touhidul Alam, a non-thesis candidate who attained CGPA 3.54 in honours and 3.81 in masters programme while thesis group candidates along with better CGPA were disregarded by the authorities as Md Saidur Rahman, the chairman of the department reportedly favored him, source said.  Meanwhile, several newspapers and online portals have published news regarding the affiliation of Touhidul Alam with Islami Chhatra Shibir during his student life. Touhidul, however, rejected the allegation.  He said: \"The allegation is absolutely false rather somebody is conspiring against me imposing such tag.\"  However, JU Pro VC Prof Abul Hossain said they did not find any involvement of Touhidul with Chhatra Shibir activities.  The selection board of the recruitment presided by JU Vice-Chancellor Prof Farzana Islam recommended Touhidul Alam among a total of 14 candidates to be appointed as a temporary lecturer, source said.  Chairman of the department Md Saidur Rahman said the authorities had appointed him following the recommendation of the selection board.  He said: \"If there is any rule that one has to score highest to be appointed then there would no necessity of the selection board in the recruitment process.\" Several candidates of this recruitment asking anonymity said they had been discriminated, as their merits and results were not valued properly while the selection board ignored a son of a freedom fighter who scored CGPA 3.81 in honours and 3.87 in masters programme.  JU VC Prof Farzana Islam was not available for her comment regarding the matter despite several attempts."

Once expired, the cylinders must be replaced and disposed of to avoid leakage or other hazards - especially at the consumer end.\nHowever, the Dhaka Tribune found out that at least 200,000 of the 450,000 LPG cylinders imported by LP Gas Ltd are more than 20 years old.\nThese cylinders are supposed to be scrapped; instead they are available for use around the country, posing great safety risks for users.\nDue to the lack of proper LPG policy and guideline by the government, there is no practice of periodically replacing expired cylinders in Bangladesh, experts said.\nMoreover, the cylinders that enter Bangladesh are not properly checked for safety by the authorities concerned, which makes it easier for suppliers to flood the market with substandard cylinders.\nLack of awareness among the consumers make the matter worse, they added.\nFazlur Rahman, general manager of LP Gas Ltd, told the Dhaka Tribune that there is no mention of 15-year lifespan of a LPG cylinder in the amended LPG Rule 2004.\nAlthough concern over this issue has been voiced several times, it came to light again after around 200 LPG cylinders exploded and caused a massive fire in an LPG depot in Bogra, owned by Padma oil distribution company, on Saturday.\nInvestigating the explosion, officials of LP Gas Ltd found that the gas pressure inside the cylinders were way beyond their capacity, which caused a leak and led to an explosion, an official of the company told the Dhaka Tribune.\nPetrobangla has been notified about the high gas pressure in the cylinders several times, but no steps have been taken to resolve the issue, he said, requesting not to be named.\nHowever, Rajshahi Divisional LP Gas Distributors' Association blames the distribution authorities for the accident.\nAhsanul Rashid Dablu, general secretary of the organisation, said the cylinders distributed by Padma as well as Meghna and Jamuna - all state-owned distribution companies that operate under the BPC - are very old and extremely unsafe to use.\n\"The authorities concerned have been asked to replace these cylinders repeatedly, but they have yet to take any action,\" he told our Bogra correspondent on Saturday.\nEarlier, the association staged a protest against the widespread availability of expired cylinders on August 1 demanding immediate steps to stop the distribution of \"date-expired and risky\" LPG cylinders in 16 northern districts.\nAhsan requested the chief inspector of the Department of Explosives to look into the matter.\nWhen contacted, Chief Inspector of Explosives Md Shamsul Alam said there were roughly around five million LPG cylinders - both privately and government issued - currently in use in Bangladesh.\n\"Including the headquarters, the department has five offices in Dhaka, Khulna, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Sylhet and has a total of 107 employees. It is not possible to inspect such a huge number of cylinders with this workforce.\"\nAsked about the Bogra incident, he said Assistant Chief Inspector of Explosives in Rajshahi Md Asadul Islam is due to submit a probe report in this regard, which will be forwarded to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division.\n\n\n\n\n"

How ironic, in the age of information.\nI wonder, in those ancient times, how often writers were asked, \"Where is Gangaridai?\" compared with how often I am asked today, \"Where is Bangladesh?\"\nThere can, indeed, be little doubt that the educated, and especially, the traders and merchants, were familiar with not only Gangaridai, but also its location, and that of lands beyond. Deep into the Ganges basin, and north towards an inland city, called Thina, and the great difficulties in reaching it.\n\nHowever, the great Roman geographer late in the last century BCE, Strabo, writing in his famous work Geographia, comments: \"Concerning those who sail from Egypt, even to the Ganges, they are but private citizens with no knowledge of the history of places they visit.\" The earliest known example of academic snobbery.\nIt was a much valued destination, of that there can be little doubt.\nPoets, historians, and businessmen of the half millennium, known as the \"classical period\" of European history, wrote about its location and both its trade and, it seems, especially the military prowess of its people.\nProwess that always, inevitably throughout human history, has involved wealth.\nEven with all the aids, technology, and progress of modern archaeology, and advances that have facilitated a better appreciation of such significant places and events in pre-history, we continue to be unable to take any definitive view on periods and locations of the emerging -- we might say -- embryonic, modern, commercially-based civilisation, that certainly emerged in these lands of Bangladesh over two millennia ago.\nEven the duration of the Kingdom of Gangaridai, if kingdom it was, is hazy. Was it a kingdom?\nArchaeological development of appreciation of the very early Harappan civilisation further west suggests an absence of mansions and palaces in urban sites, which to some archaeologists suggests that some form of true democracy was an early form of governance.\nAround histories of Vanga, Magadha, and Mauryan periods swirl such questions; perhaps only Megasthenes' commentary of the Aleaxandrian invasion goes some way towards offering a definite period within the history of Gangaridai.\nModern politics also thickens the swirling mists of time that have left us with dateable sites and artefacts, but no certainties.\nGangaridai, we are told, were a people dwelling on the east side of the Ganges. Knowing as we do, the mobility of river courses in the Gangetic plains, even that fails to locate with certainty.\nNaturally, India, recognising the inevitability of archaeological and historical definition of the existence and significance, of Gangaridai internationally, have laid claim to a capital city close to Calcutta. Since that is a fringe of the delta, it seems an improbable claim.\nWithin the lands of the delta, one modern claim is made for a location of the capital at Gopalganj; others suggest the site, with its 5km rampart on the banks of the Old Brahmaputra at Wari Bateshwar; or even Egarosindur, a largely unexplored site at Kishoreganj.\nOf Gangaridai however, we have early writers to thank for our certainty that it not only existed, but was, in its time, internationally significant, as a major crossroads of international trade and commerce.\nMegathenes was a traveller, born in modern Turkey, who arrived in the city of Pataliputra (modern Patna), capital of both Magadha and later, Mauryan Empires.\nThose who believe that Chandragupta, the first of the Mauryan Emperors, built the east/west Grand Trunk Road may well be as confused as historians seem to be about times and places, since Megasthenes is said to have arrived at Pataliputra along the \"great\" highway.\nSurely the Grand Trunk Road is said to have been constructed by Chandragupta? Or, perhaps, simply following the footprints of Alexander?\nHowever, it appears that he arrived there shortly after the failure of Alexander and his army to cross the Ganges, a crossing that -- it may be reasonable to suppose, across a wide river, perhaps in flood -- beyond which it was intended to seize the wealth of the flourishing trading centre with the lands of Gangaridai.\nEvery army sought financial rewards for their endeavours, and Alexander's was, certainly, no exception.\nWhilst most of the great writers of Alexander's endeavour, over the subsequent seven or eight hundred years, write of his eventual failure, his military achievements before his death at the age of 32 still resonate down the centuries.\n\nFocusing on military issues, there are also mercantile and geographical commentaries that confirm the importance for perhaps as much as nearly a millennium, of Gangaridai, to a wider world.\nThe world map, produced in the late 3rd century BCE by Eratosthenes, is remarkable for the evidently detailed knowledge of the Ganges and its major tributaries, such as Jamuna.\nSuch maps reveal very evident sources of information, and familiarity with such destinations.\nSimilarly, Strabo also shows great familiarity with the delta and its components in both his commentaries and cartography.\nThe publication of mid 1st century CE, Periplus of the Erythaean Sea, a merchants guide to trade, not only provides detailed instructions for approaching the delta, but also prime items for trade.\nAnd, of course, Ptolemy, the great mid 2nd century CE cartographer, whose detailed sources for his remarkably accurate maps of the known world made his own map of the deltaic lands, with remarkable accuracy; including the mark of a settlement called Ramcu, exactly where Ramu stands, today.\nBut it is the military historians that throw the most revealing light onto to sheer strength, in population numbers, military resources, and evidently, wealth that we may reasonably suppose derived from manufacturing and trade of the deltaic lands.\nThe earliest writer, describing the military strength of Gangaridai, was of course Megasthenes, writing with the benefit of his experience of the geography; and, certainly familiarity around Patna, of those who could recall the circumstances of Alexander's advance.\nHe describes a River Ganges, that faced Alexander's army, at least eight miles wide and 20 at its maximum, and an estimated 100 feet deep.\nThe forces assembled to resist any attempt by Alexander to make a crossing, comprised, he wrote of 1,000 horses (interesting, considering horses were not native, and over subsequent centuries, until recent times, originated in Bhutan), 700 elephants, and 60,000 infantry (\"in apparatus of war\").\nDiodorus Siculus, a Roman historian, writing in the second half of the last century BCE, may well have derived some of his information from Megasthenes.\nHowever, his estimate of assembled forces were far greater. \"An army of 20,000 horses, 200,000 infantry, 2,000 chariots, and 4,000 elephants trained and equipped for war.\"\nAll subsequent historians agree that the forces of Gangaridai had by far the largest number of war elephants in India.\nA very clear comment on the wealth and prowess of the military might of the \"kingdom.\"\nMore of them also increase the estimate of numbers; Quintus Curtius Rufus, Plutarch, and Pliny the Elder, as, like most Romans, great admirers of Alexander, may well have considered that only unbelievable geographic and military hurdles could possibly have daunted Alexander and his army.\nThey, and others, such as the 3rd century Dionysius Periegetes, add geographic descriptions to their writing of what was for centuries regarded as the edge of the known world.\nEven Ptolemy's usually accurate mapping fails at mapping territories beyond east and south-east of the lands of Bangladesh.\nFor them, it seems, Alexander did in fact march to the ends of the known world, only to be confronted by unsurpassable obstacles to further advance.\nIndeed might the old song go, \"Some talk of Alexander,\" it was unquestionably the ill-fated attempt by Alexander to conquer the peoples and lands that are now Bangladesh to add to his, hitherto, unparalleled adventure in international conquest, that opened the ancient, early worldwide awareness of these lands of Bangladesh.\nTo the successful rebuff by nature, and the power and courage of the peoples themselves, we owe such knowledge that has put early times in the lands of Bangladesh into the ancient history of world civilisation, and well as on some of the earliest maps of the world.\n\n\n\n\n"

August 20th, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nAncient records of early Buddhism, recovered from Tibet, identify five great centres of learning in the Buddhist firmament of the period of the Pala Empire, which might have been at the time, amongst the greatest centres of learning in the world, up to a thousand years after the birth of Prince Gautama, the Buddha, \"The Enlightened One.\"\nOf the five, two are amongst the over four hundred lesser Buddhist sites, in the lands that are now Bangladesh; Somapura Mahavihara and Jaggadala.\nAnd, of those two, Somapura, or Paharpur as we know the site today, is certainly still the best explored and most famous, as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\nThere seems to be little room to doubt that, as early as the last centuries before the Common Era, the concentration of early Buddhist sites in Bangladesh represent a major source of early learning.\nThere are even scholars of Christian teaching who, detecting Buddhist influences in the teachings of Christ in the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, suggest that the precocious child found debating with elders in the Temple, who only emerges as a great teacher himself some 20 years later, may in fact, under the influence of Joseph of Arimathea -- a merchant associated with Christ in biblical tradition -- have organised for the young Christ to travel to what were, in their time, the greatest centres of learning of their age, the great Vihara of the Ganges basin.\nAnd Paharpur would have been of course the most accessible from the great centre of trade in the Ganges Delta, had Christ made the journey, as at the time many did, by sea.\nWhatever the truth of that speculation, what is more incontrovertible is that, from the earliest times of the rise of Buddhist belief, Paharpur was \"in the thick of it.\"\nExcavation has revealed that, unsurprisingly, beneath the undoubted construction of remains of the period of the great Pala Empire (which had its roots in proximity to Paharpur, and, who knows, may have derived in part from its presence?), lie traces of buildings of the Mauryan period in the early years of Buddhism.\nWe also know from onsite evidence that it continued to flourish during the \"Golden Age of India\" under the second century liberal Hindu, Gupta Dynasty (also with their own roots in close proximity to Paharpur!).\nNo doubt the expertise of Buddhists contributed to the astonishing transformation of social, economic, and technical strengths of Indian society that flowered in that period.\nThat Paharpur was one of the most significant centres of learning in the various Buddhist schools there can be little doubt; the sheer scale of its estate and constructions bear testimony to its significance.\nWe may, perhaps, attribute that fact to its greater proximity to the great international routes of communication by sea, and by the famous first of the great Silk Roads, the Southern Silk Road, Brahmaputra, Teesta, and Lohit River routes into the Himalayan states and beyond, into China.\nIt is already clear that, in its time, Paharpur was culturally important, not simply to the Buddhist tradition, but to the range of Dharmic beliefs\nWhat is also certain is that the ruins today of this great centre of meditation, teaching, and learning are the largest in the Indian sub-continent, and that the design has been closely replicated in Burma, Java, and Cambodia, with two temples in central Java bearing closest resemblance to Paharpur's distinctive design, rather than any others in the sub-continent.\nSuch imitation seems to speak volumes for the influence of Paharpur over the propagation of the faith groups beyond its origins in the Ganges basin.\nThe decline, in about the 12th century -- either under the Brahmanic regime of the last Hindu dynasty, the short lived Sena, or perhaps as likely, in the face of the advent of the Afghan Sultanate forces that, having raided into India for a century or two, finally shifted their base as far into north India as they could reach --  seems to have been fairly abrupt.\nBut that the schools, the Vihara, lasted in their influence for about a millennium and a half, enduring across the eastern world even today, not only speaks volumes for their power and influence, but also of the wealth in the lands in which they grew.\nThey developed, it is probably fair to say, out of centuries, even millennia of social, cultural, and economic evolution in these lands along the edges of the great Ganges river.\nArchaeology, both in India and in Bangladesh, is only slowly making sense of the evidence of both on and in ground work, alongside the circumstantial and documentary, even empirical evidence for which, in today's Islamic and Christian world there may not be a great deal of incentive.\nAnd the rise in India of the return of more aggressive Hinduism probably doesn't help, either!\nHowever, despite its continuing strength in important nations like Japan, and its re-emergence in China, the study and appreciation of the significance in world cultural and economic history, has probably not yet reached its time.\nIt is, however, already clear that, in its time, Paharpur was culturally important, not simply to the Buddhist tradition, but to the range of Dharmic beliefs.\nPaharpur stands in by far the largest compound, and is easily the largest Buddhist site in Indian subcontinent\nThese are those that evolved around the lands that, as the deltaic lands of the Ganges are now largely the lands of Bangladesh.\nThe Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist belief groups of that Dharmic tradition, which were probably both influenced by each other, and by the more primitive beliefs of traders from across the world, and also propagated through the linkages of communication, grew in all likelyhood from the more primitive Animist and Shamanic traditions of earliest traceable beliefs.\n\nThat the Sanskrit language developed hereabouts was also, in all probability, due to this as a very ancient centre of trade, requiring more than a verbal tradition of communication to support trade.\nBut the ability of such common and written form of communication certainly also facilitated the wider communication of beliefs, as well as facilitating travel, social, and cultural interchange.\nIt remains somewhat difficult to make complete sense of the human developments of these lands with such a demonstrably rich heritage of culture and philosophy.\nNot the least of these difficulties, of course, in the case of the lands in and around those of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.\nAnd the rest of the 700 or so rivers, tributaries, and distributaries of the Ganges, especially is the simple depth of the annual deposits of flood borne alluvium.\nAnd today, politics also plays its own part in revelation, and even suppression.\nIronic, indeed, that the lands that so clearly gave birth to beliefs to which over 5% of the world's population today still adhere, should be ruled by adherents of different beliefs!\nAll of which would probably have seemed absurd to the denizens of Paharpur, throughout much of its life.\nIt may well not be without significance that Paharpur stands in by far the largest compound, and is easily the largest Buddhist site in the Indian sub-continent.\nClose to the origins of Buddhism, just across today's border and the ancient capital of the Mauryan Empire, it was even closer to the roots of both Gupta and Pala Empires, in which it conspicuously flourished.\nDespite the somewhat half-hearted endeavours of today's Indians to \"talk up\" Vihara on their own lands for the sake of tourist income, there may well be every reason to suppose that, in fact, Paharpur, Somapara Mahavihara, was in fact, from early times, the most influential and powerful in the complexities of the Buddhist faith, of the great five.\nPaharpur, a historic root for Bangladesh to cherish, and to take pride in.\n \n

      "text": "Date Published:2016-10-08 00:00:00      \nJuly 2016 was the hottest month the planet has been since we started keeping records in 1880. The month was not only 0.84degC hotter than the 20th century monthly average (when we combine both sea surface and land surface temperature), but also 0.11degC  hotter than July last year. This should be a warning for world leaders to do more to reduce greenhouse gases emissions, and do it fast. In fact, based on data collected by NASA, global average temperatures in the last nine months have consistently broken temperature records for that specific month (ie this January was the hottest January ever recorded, this February the hottest February, March the hottest March, etc.). This means we may be on our way to experiencing the warmest year on record. Already, the first half of the year 2016 was an average 1.3degC warmer than the pre-industrial levels. The one caveat is that because of La Nina -- the recurring oceanic and atmospheric pattern across the Pacific Ocean which lowers sea surface temperatures -- the last few months of this will likely be cooler. While these differences in temperature may seem only slight, at a planetary level they are actually quite significant. Scientists are already observing the impacts of this \"slight\" warming in the form of glaciers melting in  nearby Nepal, sea-levels rising on the southern coast of the United States, and seasons generally becoming more unpredictable worldwide, which is partly why many Bengalis no longer say there are six seasons in the year as they traditionally used to. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report further predicts that global warming will also bring forth more frequent cyclones, foster the spread of diseases such as malaria, and lead to more extreme weather events such as droughts and heavy rainfall. As the Dhaka Tribune reported earlier this week, we have already crossed the symbolic milestone of 400 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere, which many saw as the point of no return for human-induced climate change.   At this stage, if countries do nothing to reduce the rate of emissions, scientists predict the concentration of CO2 would increase threefold by the end of the century, causing the planet to warm about 4degC above pre-industrial levels. For Bangladesh -- based on research findings of the \"High End Climate Impact and Extremes\" project conducted at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology -- the regional temperature increase under these same conditions could be between 3.7degC and 5.7degC. And even if we moderately reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there could still be a global temperature rise above 2degC. This is at odds with the goal of recent UN climate change treaty, the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep planetary temperatures well below 2degC with an ambitious goal of 1.5degC. However, a recent crescendo of devastating impacts -- heatwaves, deadly flooding, storm surges fuelled by rising seas -- has pushed world leaders, particularly in the Global South, and leading scientists to make the ambitious goal of 1.5degC the only goal. This will only be possible if countries commit to drastically reducing their emissions immediately. The challenge with the Paris Agreement is that -- although it recently legally came into force -- it is not legally binding  like the earlier UN climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol. Unless we are able to keep these temperatures to these goals, countries like Bangladesh will need a lot of support helping their populations adapt to new climate conditions. While the UN climate body has created the Green Climate Fund, which intends to provide at least USD 100 billion per year by 2020 for climate action, accessing the fund is both challenging and lengthy process. Yet, given how fast temperatures are increasing, the sooner countries at high risk get access to adaptation funding, the better.

      "text": "Date Published:2017-09-28 00:00:00      \nNaval boats battled rebels on Lake Tanganyika in the east of Democratic Republic of Congo on Thursday as heavy fighting spread close to the lakeside city of Uvira, sources in the area said. Fighting between the Mai-Mai Yakutumba militia and Congo government forces broke out at the weekend on the outskirts of Uvira, close to the Burundi border. Unrest has mounted since President Joseph Kabila refused to step down when his mandate expired last December. \"Since 0300 GMT there has been an exchange of gunfire between the army and the Mai-Mai in Uvira,\" said Lubungula Dem's M'Sato, a member of a peacebuilding advocacy group in Uvira, the second largest city in South Kivu province. Congo's navy also repelled an attack by Mai-Mai rebels in boats on the lake, military spokesman Louis-Claude Tshimwanga said, adding that government ships had sunk one of the rebel's boats and that government forces remained in control of Uvira. Lake Tanganyika is hundreds of kilometres long and also borders Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia. \"The rebels tried to attack (the city) from the lake. They have motorised pirogues,\" said a witness in Uvira, who asked not to be named, adding that he saw six rebel boats. \"The (navy) caught one but the others escaped.\" The Mai-Mai Yakutumba, formed in 2007 by local militiamen opposed to integration in Congo's national army, has well-established gold smuggling networks on the lake. In an audio statement this week that was shared on social media, its leader William Yakutumba said his forces were rebelling against Kabila's mismanagement of the country's natural resources and failure to quit power when his constitutional mandate expired. Congo's mineral-rich eastern borderlands are a tinderbox of ethnic tensions and for more than two decades have been racked by violence, often spilling across the country's borders. The region is the world's biggest source of coltan, used in mobile phones and other electronic products. Congo's UN peacekeeping mission, MONUSCO, said it had deployed troops around Uvira on Wednesday to protect civilians and that the deputy commander of its forces was on the ground to supervise the situation. \"I urge the armed groups to immediately cease this hostility including all forms of violence against constituted authority and innocent civilians,\" mission head Maman Sidikou said in a statement."

      "text": "Date Published:2017-08-18 00:00:00      \nThe Earth is getting warmer; the Antarctic ice is melting. Scientists expect that by the end of this century, many low-lying districts of Bangladesh will be permanently inundated; the agricultural lands in these districts will be lost. In \"The Unfolding Tragedy of Climate Change in Bangladesh\" (published on the Scientific American website) Robert Glennon writes: \"A three-foot rise in sea level would submerge almost 20% of the entire country and displace more than 30 million people. Some scientists project a five-to-six foot rise by 2100, which would displace perhaps 50 million people ... Already, the intruding sea has contaminated groundwater, which supplies drinking water for coastal regions, and degraded farmland, rendering it less fertile and eventually barren.\" When millions of people lose their homes and their farms, they will move to cities in search of work. As cities expand to accommodate millions of migrants, they will swallow up even more agricultural land. At some point, Bangladesh will become permanently dependent on imported food; self-sufficiency in rice production is no longer a realistic long-term goal. A more realistic long-term goal would be to create enough industrial jobs to ensure that the poor are employed, and can afford to buy imported rice. This is possible, but will require careful planning. The crux of the problem is that Dhaka and Chittagong, the traditional destinations for migrants from the countryside, cannot accommodate millions of more migrants. The slums which house the working class in Dhaka are unliveable; many of them occupy low-lying areas of the cities which periodically flood with rainwater and raw sewage. Chittagong has already expanded to risky hillsides, whose residents live with the danger of fatal landslides. We simply cannot allow the unplanned growth of these two cities to continue. We need to create at least 20 industrial cities which will eventually house and employ a total population of 50 million SEZs show the way Fortunately, the government has already taken the first step, which will create alternative destinations for migrants: Several Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have been created in different districts. As factories and mills are set up in these SEZs, they will tend to grow into industrial cities; the government should encourage this growth by investing in the towns and villages near each SEZ. The employees of each SEZ will need government schools, universities, hospitals, magistrate courts, and of course infrastructure like roads, sewage, railways, and power distribution. If the government makes all these investments, a well-planned industrial city can grow around each SEZ. As climate change and population growth will probably create 50 million migrants, we need to create at least 20 industrial cities which will eventually house and employ a total population of 50 million people. The infrastructure required for 20 industrial towns will probably require the government to invest about $20 billion. Fortunately, the government can finance this by taxing fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal). Burning fossil fuels is what caused the crisis of rising sea levels, so it makes sense that fossil fuels should be taxed to raise money for adaptation to rising sea levels. Creating industrial cities is not just a matter of building infrastructure; private capital will be required to set up factories in the new cities. The private sector will probably require about $20bn to set up 10,000 factories (at an average investment of $2m per factory). Let the taka float The best way to ensure that these investments are made is to allow private banks in Bangladesh to borrow money from abroad (where interest rates are very low), so they can lend to industrial companies at low interest rates. In the past, the private sector in Bangladesh has been forced to borrow money at high interest rates; other countries which have convertible, floating currencies are easily able to attract large amounts of capital from abroad. It is time to make the taka a freely floating currency, and to make it convertible for capital account transactions (transfers of assets). Foreign financial institutions will then have the confidence to lend large amounts of money to Bangladeshi banks. Only private banks should be allowed to borrow money from abroad; massive fraud and loan default have illustrated that the state-owned banks are thoroughly corrupt, and should not be allowed to expand their lending business. State-owned banks should only be allowed to lend their deposits to private banks. Once industrial cities have been created, and foreign capital has been attracted to Bangladesh to finance new factories, Bangladeshis who lose their land to rising sea levels will naturally move to the new industrial cities to find employment. Bangladesh will have successfully transformed into an industrial economy; preventing hunger will then be a simple matter of adjusting the minimum wage to ensure that the average working family can afford imported rice.

RAB caught them red-handed while loading the sacks on a truck. \"They were planning to smuggle the rice from Barisal Local Supply Depot (LSD) to Fulbaria, Khulna,\" said RAB Deputy Assistant Director Amjad Hossain. He said the drive was conducted based on a tip-off. The detained are Deputy Assistant Food Inspector Abdur Rahim, LSD security guards Md Shamsuddin and Md Arif, and the helper of the seized vehicle Md Kabir Khan. The RAB DAD said the Barisal LSD go-down in-charge Abdullah Al Mamun had fled during the raid. Kabir said rice trader Abdus Sattar had rented the truck to carry the rice to Khulna. However, during an interrogation, other detainees claimed the rice was being loaded for supplying it to the Barisal Range Reserve Force (RRF) of police. The district's Regional Controller of Food Amzad Hossain acknowledged that 20 tonnes (400 sacks) of rice were scheduled to be shipped to Barisal RRF that morning, but the seized rice was being loaded with no legal documents. However, when the RRF ration in-charge Monir Hossain went to Barisal LSD on Monday morning, he was informed by Abdullah that the supplies would be sent in the afternoon. Disciplinary measures will be taken by senior authorities after the interrogation and investigation."

      "text": "Date Published:2017-09-23 00:00:00      \n\nCNN: Bangladeshi 'floating schools' reinvent education\n\n\n\n\nTribune Desk\n\n\n\n\n Published at 06:35 pm September 23rd, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 01:51 am September 24th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSolar-powered floating schools in northern part of Bangladesh have been recognised among the most innovative education arrangements in the world, according to a CNN report.\nDuring monsoon season in Bangladesh, one-third of the country is flooded, making school attendance next to impossible. This leaves children dropping-out of school and deprived of knowledge.\nIn order to tackle such discrepancy, non-profit organisation Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha, came up with a way to bring education to the children most affected: by creating solar-panelled floating schools. The schools contain a laptop, hundreds of books and electronic resources powered by energy generated from the solar panels.\n\nEach morning, the elementary schools travel to different communities, picking up children along the way. The boats then docks and teach up to 30 children at a time.\nThe boat schools also train adult villagers on children's and women's rights, nutrition, hygiene and other practical issues. Farmers are also trained to adapt to the impact of climate change. Since the boat is solar powered, the floating school continues to operate under solar lamps, even after dark.\n\nAlso Read- How one architect transformed education in flood-ravaged Bangladesh\n\nAn architect, Mohammed Rezwan founded Shidhulai in 1998, with about $500. In 2003, the NGO received a $50,000 grant from the Global Fund for Children in the United States, and then $100,000 from the Levi's Foundation, part of the clothing company that has factories in Bangladesh.\nLater in 2005, a $1 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation allowed Shidhulai to build more boats, buy computers, install solar power and create a central library. In 2014, the organisation won the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE), created by the Qatar Foundation, receiving $20,000 prize.\nWhile some first world countries have brought virtual reality into classrooms to study subjects like science, art and history, other schools are taking their classrooms into the forests or other natural settings. Taking up to their challenge, Bangladesh is under the limelight for its sustainable innovation for reinventing education to third world countries.\nSince its recognition, Shidhulai's floating schools model has been replicated in other flood-prone countries, including Nigeria, Cambodia, Philippines, Vietnam and Zambia, therefore, redefining education for all.\n\n\n\n\n"

However, such a ban seems far from possible, at least for now, since there are strong lobbyists behind the industry.\n\"What is unexpected is that the minister wants to shut down only bidi factories and not those producing cigarettes. If the industry is suddenly shut down, about two million bidi workers will become unemployed and will stage tough protests,\" Bangladesh Bidi Shilpa Malik Samity President Bijoy Krishan Dey told the Dhaka Tribune.\nIn the 2016-2017 proposed national budget, prices of the lowest segment of cigarettes were increased by 28% to Tk23. Taxes on medium and high-segment cigarettes remained unchanged, but the supplementary duty was hiked from 61% and 63% to 62% to 64%, respectively.\nMany argue that the decision is tantamount to favouring the import industry over a local industry.\nWhen questioned about this, former NBR chairman Abdul Majid said: \"If the government decides to shut down bidi for health then all smoking products including foreign cigarettes should be banned.\n\"If the finance minister takes this decision, he also has to propose an alternative source of income for the people involved in this industry.\"\nThe Bangladesh Bidi Shilpa Malik Samity President Bijoy said: \"We pay a 16% VAT. This will affect our revenue generation immensely. He needs to consider what a huge financial support the industry is for our economic sector.\"\nExecutive Director of Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh (PRI) Dr Ahsan H Mansur, however, disagreed.\n\"It is a good decision on the part of the government to ban bidi products. There will be no impact on revenues if the ban is put in place,\" said Ahsan, adding: \"We get only Tk4 or Tk5 crore as revenue from bidi products. But the government ends up losing more money in health sector expenditure than the revenue being earned through this industry.\"\nDr Md Mafizur Rahman, associate professor of National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital (NICR&H), weighed in, saying: \"Bidi and cigarettes are both harmful. Our research shows that all tobacco related products are detrimental to health.\n\"According to previous data, some 62%-70% patients who have been afflicted by cancer in their mouths and lungs have been smokers,\" he added.\nMafizur further explained: \"We cannot tell whether bidi is more harmful than cigarettes, but we can say that both are noxious.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

It was hard on the people, particularly those living in northern districts that are heavily dependent on agriculture.\nBasanti Bala, now 75, was the woman in the image that jolted the world.\nThe powerful image of the deaf-mute woman became the centre of attention after daily Ittefaq, then the most influential newspaper in Bangladesh, printed it on their front page.\nBasanti's family survived on one meal every two to three days like many others in Kurigram, one of the worst flood and famine-hit districts.\nHer family of poor anglers could not afford clothes for her. When the Ittefaq photographer found her, she was wearing a fishing net as her only sari had worn out.\nThat photograph became the face of the 1974 famine, attributed to a combination of failed food supply mechanism, which was yet to recover from the havoc wreaked by the Pakistan army, flooding and hoarding by profit-monger rice traders.\nBangladesh has since risen to the status of a lower-middle income country from being an ultra-poor country. The living standard has improved and the nation's per capita income has increased nearly 11 times to $1,600 from $150.\nBut these changes have hardly touched Basanti's life - the only improvement for her is that she does not have to wear fishing nets anymore. At 75, the childless widow is still fully dependent on her relatives for survival.\nHer husband, who also had hearing and speech impairment, died several years ago, leaving her with nothing. Now she lives with in a tiny hut on a small piece of land alongside the homestead of a relative, a poor day labourer.\n\"I live from hand to mouth. But still, I try to help her [Basanti] as much as I can,\" said Niruu Bala. \"If I stop helping her, the poor old woman will surely die.\"\nAsked if she got assistance from the government's safety net programmes and the NGOs, the relative said: \"Yes. But those are inadequate. She does not have any skill or training. So, she cannot even take small loans.\"\nMutakabbirul, who works at the local office of iNGO Practical Action, said very few people are aware of the jolt Basanti's picture had created in 1974.\n\"I knew very little about the 1974 famine, until I learned about Basanti after coming here for work,\" said Mutakabbirul, who introduced this reporter to Basanti.\n\n\nA local NGO has recently started working with Basanti, training her on growing sweet pumpkins | Abu Siddique\nIn March 1974, agro-based ultra-poor communities were already suffering due to a sharp rise in rice prices, triggered by widespread hoarding. When a severe flood hit some of the northern districts, things got totally out of the government's hand which was still struggling to rebuild the country.\nThe situation started to ease after international aid and food relief arrived in October. By December 1974, the famine was officially over. And with that, things went back to square one for women like Basanti and she was lost in oblivion.\nA local NGO has recently started working with Basanti, training her on growing sweet pumpkins.\nKhalid Hossain, who works for an international donor agency, said there were many organisations that worked with people with disabilities but they never got in touch with women like Basanti who live in remote villages.\n\"Even the government has not done much for them.\n\"So, whatever money they get from NGOs or government's social safety nets, they spend it on food. If they had some kind of training, they could have the money or taken micro loans to turn their lives around,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n"

Numerous pros have been pointed out along with the cons.\nThe West is realising its \"not so favourable\" impacts and are stitching the path to mitigate the concerns, especially in the younger generation.\nHere in our culture, its spectacular rise in popularity suggests that it fulfils the needs of our budding society.\nHowever, much to the dismay of many, the truth is not far from the reality that social media's intrusion is crafting a \"perception error\" in the way we look at our daily lives.\nBelow, I have tried to outline a few of the rising concerns derived from published journals, conducted research, and from my own experiences over the years.\nThe need for social media may be great but it should be borne with a subsequent precaution in the way it is exercised.\nPrivate or public?\nSocial media is a powerful tool used to manoeuvre the thought process of the users -- it speaks before even we have spoken.\nFacebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, and so forth, make us capable of throwing away our privacy along with social morality from its users.\nIt's one thing when we use them for personal matters, and completely another when mass information comes into the fore.\nDeconstructing the private\nWhen social media is used to create awareness on humanitarian issues such as the ethnic cleansing of the Royingya, flood victims in Kurigram, or even traffic alerts in the labyrinthine streets of Dhaka city, it shows some of its potential in doing good for people.\nBut when most of its users harness the power of such platforms to show off gross levels of excess -- be it a needlessly expensive Louis Vuitton bag or a needlessly expensive meal -- the impact of social media on the human psyche starts to show its uglier side.\nNot only do these fuel envy among peers -- who are probably moping about having an empty life for not owning a Chihuahua -- but cultural commentators argue that such posts on Facebook are signs of vanity, loneliness, and engagement to escape the boredom of one's own mundane life.\nBut I would be fooling myself if I said I never experienced similar feelings, since I am an active user of digital media. But I often ponder whether we are actually growing with the advancement of the technology.\nThe need to deconstruct our private lives just to get digital appreciation in the public gaze is the saddest part of our lives brought about by this technology. What used to be \"sharing\" turned out to be a desperate attempt to present a perfect, idealised version of ourselves to the world.\nNot to mention the addiction generated in young people to seek validation. It is almost more satisfying to get \"likes\" on one of your selfies taken under a banyan tree with a cousin's friend from Alaska, than having someone actually appreciate you.\nNone the wiser\nNot that long ago, we believed in communicating through words but that has changed since the advent of emoticons. This new language of communication make scholars wonder whether young people are losing the necessary interpersonal and social skills required to compete in the real world.\nFacebook has created a world of fantasy in the minds of young people, where they can be whatever they want, whoever they want, and everyone is none the wiser.\nWhat used to be 'sharing' turned out to be a desperate attempt to present a perfect, idealised version of ourselves to the world\nMany speculate that young people use Facebook as a source of information to avoid using more challenging sources, such as newspapers, articles, or journal reports.\nThe flip-side of the coin is that social media transcends all physical boundaries. It is indeed the easiest platform for, well, social networking. For businesses, it's the most essential and crucial tool for studying and reaching customers.\nWhatever the depth of information may be, it thus provides the quickest information for its users. Not to mention, it can be used to create awareness in the shortest possible time.\nBut concerns arise when such platforms are misused without proper knowledge, thus creating problems for society instead.\nA torrent of overwhelming data from research exists on the challenges of digital media, and they can be interepreted in different ways but one thing remains certain: The eventual outcome depends on the user's ability to comprehend the many facades of social media's reality.\nMahzabeen Faruque is a freelance contributor.\n\n\n\n\n"

He dealt with independence-minded residents by creating six republics - Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. Kosovo was given autonomous status, but kept firmly under control. This was evident when the Yugoslav army was sent into the province to quell a riot staged by Albanian students over poor living conditions in 1981. Subsequently, in 1989, Kosovo was stripped of its autonomy by the Yugoslav government of Slobodan Milosevic. This did not stop the country's ethnic Albanian leaders from declaring independence the following year. The Milosevic government dissolved the provincial government and fired more than 100,000 ethnic Albanian workers. Soon after, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia declared independence from Yugoslavia, and in 1992, war broke out in the Balkans. Nato launched air strikes against Serbia in 1999, and Albanian refugees poured out of Kosovo relating stories of Serbian atrocities.  After years of strained relations between its majority Albanian population and Serb inhabitants, the country unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008. It has been recognised by the United States and major European Union countries, but Serbia, backed by its powerful ally Russia, refused to do so, as did most of the ethnic Serbs in the country. Until 2008, the province had been administered by the UN. Reconciliation between the Albanian majority, most of whom support independence, and the Serb minority seemed unattainable. Finally, in 2013, Kosovo and Serbia reached a landmark agreement which granted a high degree of autonomy to Serb-majority areas in the north and both sides agreed not to bar one another from seeking EU membership."

There have been at least two large scale Rohingya migrations since that year. The largest number, counting up to three hundred thousand refugees, was reached in the year 1992. However, small scale migration or infiltration of Rohingyas never ceased. Now the flood gates of refugees are open once again, it seems like the Rohingya exodus from Rakhine State will continue in the foreseeable future, at least till the Myanmar authorities relent.\nHowever, the question is will Myanmar relent and stop this exodus?\nRohingya migration into Bangladesh and other neighboring countries including India and Thailand has been going on for the last five decades, for reasons that are well documented. The Rohingya were denied citizenship because they do not fall within the defined ethnicities of Myanmar, nor are they descendants of ancestors who settled in the country before 1823, at the beginning of British occupation of Arakan State. The Rohingya claim that they are descendants of people who had settled in the country since ninth century. But Their claim falls on deaf ears as the Rohingya are not one of the thirteen recognized national races.\nThe festering citizenship issue is further complicated by their religion (Muslim) and their language (a dialect derived from Bengali). This has prevented the Rohingyas from blending with the Arakanese, who are mainly Buddhists by religion. This difference also made the Rohingyas somewhat politically ambitious since the independence of Myanmar (then Burma) from the British. The Rohingyas formed clandestine political groups, hoping to establish a state of their own, when Myanmar was fighting guerrilla groups along the Chinese and the Thai border, including in the Arakan State.\nThe frequent clashes between the Burmese army and the guerrilla groups had led to the first eviction of the Rohingyas by the government in 1978, although technically on grounds of them being non-citizens.\nThe first repatriation of the Rohingya refugees in 1979 was possible for three reasons. First, Bangladesh chose not to escalate the crisis to the international level, but dealt with the issue on a bilateral level. Second, the Myanmar government responded positively to resolve the problem by not only agreeing to accept all refugees, but also by ensuring security for them. Third, the clandestine political organization of the Rohingyas did not obstruct to the repatriation.\nUnfortunately the Rohingya issue has grown much larger in scale and complexity in recent times. While at one level, the issue can be viewed as a humanitarian crisis, the reason why the international community is anxiously watching the events unfold. At another level, the issue is intermixed with terrorism. Ironically, what was originally a state sponsored terror against a helpless minority, has now gone full circle to a terror group attacking the state. Myanmar authorities now cite the recent attack by the secretive Rohingya political group as the main cause of Rohingya sufferings.\nAs the situation stands now, the Myanmar authorities are not likely to relent. The attack by the so called Rohingya guerrillas has added more fuel to the fire, that was ignited by the Buddhist monks during violence against Arakan Muslims in 2012. It is ironic that a state that was shared by two communities for hundreds of years (Buddhists account for 52%, and Muslims for 42%), would suddenly be split primarily on religious grounds.\nThis tragic turn of events cannot stop until Myanmar itself brings the situation under control. As the history of Burma tells us, the country cannot be forced by outside powers to heed to their demands. Muslim countries of the world can express solidarity with the Rohingyas and offer financial help, but they cannot offer them security in their homeland. Only Myanmar can do that.\nTo do that, Bangladesh will have to deal its hands deftly, and with caution. First and foremost, it is necessary to continue our dialogue with Myanmar at all levels, including at the borders and the central. Second, Bangladesh should seek support from India in this dialogue, as a third party which is equally concerned at the Rohingya exodus.\nThere are more than a million Rohingyas living in Arakan. If all of them leaves, will India be spared?\nThe best thing going on for Bangladesh now, is that the international community is viewing our plight with understanding and compassion. The crisis needs to be portrayed as a humanitarian support, that Bangladesh is extending to the nationals of a foreign country who have fled their homes for civil unrest. But we will also need to categorically point out to Myanmar and the outside world, that we cannot offer a permanent home to the Rohingyas.\nThey belong to their country. Myanmar will need to change their citizenship laws, to facilitate the return of the Rohingyas to their true home.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-08-01 00:00:00      \nWe use the term \"globalisation\" in different contexts, referring to the worldwide movement of goods, capital, information, technology, services, cultures, and ideas. Technological advances such as the recent development and spread of mobile phones and internet generate greater interdependence of economic, social, and cultural activities. Globalisation is not an unmixed blessing. It has to be faced with adequate expertise and resources, but it is here and will remain.        It has been good for Bangladesh: Surplus labour sends remittances from richer countries; foreign capital and technology feed a thriving RMG industry exporting to distant markets and help diversification into pharmaceuticals, leather industries, and in other areas. Access to global science and innovative technology has helped to raise agricultural productivity and fight disease. The Bangladeshi diaspora assists in widening contacts, markets, and ideas. Similarly, many other developed and developing economies have benefitted from globalisation, leading to huge expansions in trade, higher productivity, reduced levels of poverty, and in some cases, to spectacular increases in wealth. China has been the most striking example, its exports financing recovery from decades of exploitation and war to regain its ancient \"middle kingdom\" prosperity and power. Yet in much of the \"developed world,\" especially in the US and Europe, globalisation, in its many aspects and in the wake of the 2007-8 financial crisis, the country has been increasingly attacked. Some see it as unfair foreign low wage competition and as challenging jobs and cultural norms through increased immigration. Financial experts point to dangers from the enormous expansion of money supply by central banks and the nearly instantaneous transfers of trillions of capital around the globe. Not only might this bring another even worse financial crisis, it can hinder social stability by combining an elite plutocracy with stagnation or decline in majority living standards. The rise of the populists Populist resentments have led to the Brexit referendum in the UK and to Donald Trump, becoming theUS president. Competitive nationalism and protectionism, particularly as promoted by Trump, pose new threats to free trade. Institutions for international cooperation, such as the UN, World Bank, IMF, and WTO have lost US leadership. Are negative aspects of globalisation taking over from its positive aspects? Nor has globalisation been universally welcomed in the developing economies. Whether from freer trade, faster diffusion of information and technology, or from capital flows, globalisation promotes rapid economic and social change. In all countries, whether rich or poor, this is disturbing; especially for conservative societies. It threatens all governments and economies slow to adapt to changes or ill-equipped to exercise a measure of control over it. For example, for countries possessing commodities in demand, such as oil or minerals, globalisation in transport and trade initially brought a massive financial boost. We must essentially meet these challenges from our own resources. But we must also continue to utilise the benefits of globalisation Yet, the new flood of wealth often led to massive corruption by ruling elites, with the mass of the population kept quiescent by heavy subsidies for energy, imported foodstuffs, and consumer items. When world demand and prices collapsed, their over-dependence on a single revenue source meant catastrophe; either immediate, as in Venezuela, or threatened by fast depleting reserves, as in Algeria. Even the poorest developing economies, held back by exploitation, by subsistence agriculture, by minimal health and education services, or even by civil war, have still experienced aspects of globalisation, particularly the information revolution. The spread of mobile phones, followed by internet access, has been almost universal, opening a new world of information access, and new potential and opportunities for economic growth. Yet, in the short term, it can dangerously raise aspirations and demands before new jobs can match population growth. Such new demands, especially in conditions of weak governance or poor quality leadership, lead to desperate and often tragic attempts to migrate or even to civil conflict which makes conditions worse. Yet, whether welcoming or blaming globalisation, it must be remembered that this is a very general term needing astute handling. Policy analysis and action must focus on specific elements to be effective. Besides capital flows or the information and transport revolutions, there are many other factors with global impact. These include still rapid population growth, as in Sub-Saharan Africa, or aging and declining populations, as in Europe or Japan, technological and scientific development is dissolving traditional jobs but creating others, making constant training and re-skilling imperative. Then there is climate change, or problems such as diseases spread by mass travel. A connected world We live in a world pulled together and interconnected in so many different ways. Yet we are still marked and divided by history and by rival power combinations. We still treasure national, religious, linguistic, and cultural differences which give us identity. We also live in a world of information, transportation, and migration revolutions which can cause a fear of change, or break down barriers and stereotyped prejudices. These are challenges, but are also opportunities, which we can face as individuals, families, communities, and countries, as world citizens. International organisations and collaborative work in all areas, such as regulation of capital flows, trade, science, and medicine will be more vital than ever. Travel and social media contacts can help us reach across traditional barriers to help us appreciate our common humanity. This article opened with the assertion that globalisation had, in different ways, been good to Bangladesh. Much progress has been made. There are hopes and plans to achieve middle income status. Yet, we are aware of the daunting scale of the challenges we still face daily. Even in Dhaka and Chittagong, our main centres of wealth creation, rising vehicle ownership paralyses traffic, population increases still swamp housing provision, basic utilities are still inadequate, and every heavy monsoon can become a nightmare liable to spread disease. We must essentially meet these challenges from our own resources. But we must also continue to utilise the benefits of globalisation: Accessing foreign investment, technology and markets, cooperating in regional development. We need to combat corruption and inefficiency, maintain and strengthen a democratic system under the rule of law. Most of all, we desperately need to improve our education, and training systems at all levels. It can be done. Selina Mohsin is a former ambassador."

      "text": "Date Published:2017-02-23 00:00:00      \nThe head of Myanmar's most powerful ethnic rebel group has warned that fighting in the country's restive borderlands has reached a critical point, threatening to derail the government's wobbling push for peace. Bao Youxiang, chairman of the Wa, told dozens of armed ethnic leaders they must forge a \"new path to peace\" as the government's efforts to expand a ceasefire signed with some groups in 2015 have faltered, according to a leaked version of a speech seen by a news agency. Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been pushing to expand the deal, known as the NCA, since her party took power a year ago in a bid to end the decades-long conflicts rumbling across the country's borderlands. But clashes between the army and ethnic minority fighters along the China border have intensified, displacing an estimated 20,000 people and threatening the second round of peace talks slated for next month. \"The ethnic fighting happening today is heavier than ever,\" Bao told ethnic leaders gathered in Pangkham, the de facto capital of the UWSA's territories, on Wednesday, according to the transcript. \"War in northern Kachin state and northern Shan state along the Myanmar-China border is getting worse day by day. The NCA being discussed between some ethnic organisations and Myanmar's government has brought no solution. \"The many conflicts along Myanmar's road to peace... mean the dawn can't be seen.\" Also read: Myanmar's Kachin armed groups want 'terrorist' label removed The United Wa State Army, also known as the Wa, is the most powerful of the country's ethnic rebel factions with an estimated 25,000 heavily armed troops and strong ties to China. Its delegates stormed out of the first round of Suu Kyi's peace talks last August over a spat about their accreditation. The group is also accused of producing and trafficking huge amounts of methamphetamine and heroin from their own mini-state on the Chinese border, and buying weapons with the proceeds. Around 40 delegates from eight ethnic rebel armies gathered in Pangkham this week ahead of Suu Kyi's next round of peace talks, which were delayed until next month after one group threatened to boycott. Among the attendees of the USWA-led meeting were members of the Northern Alliance, a collection of four ethnic armed groups that has been locked in bitter conflict with the army since November. The UN's rights envoy Yanghee Lee warned last month that the humanitarian situation in Kachin state, a focal point of recent fighting, was now worse than at any point in the past few years.

      "text": "Date Published:2017-10-20 00:00:00      \n\nBhasan Char: As unpredictable as the sea\n\n\n\n\nShahed Shafiq\n\n\n\n\n Published at 12:57 am October 20th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 01:42 am October 21st, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nBhashan Char rose up in the Bay of Bengal around 25 years ago. Over years, the island emerged and submerged in the estuary of the Meghna River and the Bay of Bengal. Erosion is a regular phenomenon in the island.\nBoatmen and sailors who have used this waterway for years say several square kilometres of the landmass have been eroded away by the river and the sea.\nAccording to data collected by the Forest Department, at least 5,000-7,000 acres of forest on Bhashan Char have disappeared into the river estuary since the formation of the island. The erosion continues to this day.\n\nAlso Read Part 2: The island that rises and falls with tide\n\nReports show that the island's landmass increases by up to 50,000 acres during the low tide. At high tide, only 13,000 acres are visible, of which barely 5,000 acres are habitable.\nThe Forest Department believes that further research is needed to determine whether more of the island will emerge from the sea in the future, or if the current landmass will gradually erode away.\nThe department also stated that 16,000 acres of mangrove trees have been planted on Bhashan Char between 2000 and last year.\nAsked about how 16,000 acres of the island could be forested when it has only 13,000 acres of land, Forest Officer Md Tohidul Islam said: \"Many areas have disappeared into the sea due to erosion, and it still continues.\"\nDuring our visit to Bhashan Char, we found that the southern and southeastern regions of the island were suffering from frequent erosion.\nThe Forest Department data confirmed that as much as half a kilometre of the island was disappearing into the sea every year due to erosion.\nIn search of more information, we spoke with Alam, 58, a fisherman by trade and a resident of Panchayat village in Hatiya.\nAlam used to go fishing in a canal between Jaliyar Char and Dubar Char 10 years ago.\n\"We could cross the canal on foot during the low tide, and by swimming during the high tide,\" he told the Bangla Tribune. \"But rampant erosion broke the canal apart in the last 10 years. There is no fish there anymore, and the forest area is also disappearing into the sea.\"\nDuring our inspection, we found that the oldest parts of the island were gradually eroding, but new landmass was emerging on the northern and western sides.\nEven the local administration are concerned over the stability of this island.\nNalchira Range Beat Officer Md Nahid Hasan recently compiled a report on Bhashan Char following the directive of the higher authorities.\nThe report states that the island, primarily formed of sand and clay soil, initially emerged as a river island of Meghna. Its high point is at the centre.\nDue to the topography of the island, it gets inundated during the high tide, and more landmass emerges during the low tide. Farming and agriculture would be quite difficult in Bhashan Char due to regular contamination of soil by the sea water, as well as the soft, muddy nature of the soil, the report said.\n\"We are aware that erosion is a continuous phenomenon in Bhashan Char. It will take more time for the island to become more stable,\" Hatiya Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Khandaker Md Rezaul Karim said.\n\"If the government moves ahead with the plan to rehabilitate the Rohingya in Bhashan Char, it will first implement necessary measures to control erosion. Currently, around 5,000 acres of the landmass is habitable.\"\nForest Officer Md Tohidul Islam said: \"During my visit to Bhashan Char, I saw that the southeastern side of the island is suffering erosion, but new landmass is also emerging on the western side. It takes around 40-50 years for an island to reach stability.\n\"When a new island emerges, we conduct an inspection there. We plant trees as soon as grasses start growing there. Trees help the ground accumulate alluvium, and forestation gradually strengthens the soil. That is how an island becomes habitable.\"\nThe Bangla Tribune has learned that Bangladesh Navy officials had showed Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal a presentation on Bhashan Char during his visit to the island on September 28.\nThe presentation showcased several technological solutions for preventing erosion there.\nAccording to the local administration, Bhashan Char is 8km long and 4km wide. Around 500 acres of land has been proposed for use in the Rohingya rehabilitation programme.\nSpeaking on the matter, Noakhali Deputy Commissioner Md Mahbub Alam Talukder said: \"The erosion can be prevented using modern technology. A land survey is currently underway there. I cannot provide more details on the matter, because I lack the technical expertise.\"\nThe deputy commissioner added that no island was habitable for the people without implementing a few development measures.\nTo make Bhashan Char habitable, several essential infrastructure such as embankments, roads, cyclone shelters, educational institutions, fresh water sources and police camps must be built there.\n\"There are plans to begin construction of a 13km embankment around Bhasan Char next month. The whole island will be brought under the protection of the embankment after the Rohingya are relocated there,\" Mahbub Alam Talukder said.\nThe article was first published on Bangla Tribune.\n\n\n\n\n"

Even they were building their tents in two to three kilometre deep of the forest from the Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Road and fetch their firewood from the deep and fresh forest.\"\n\"This huge number of Rohingya is almost burning 50,000kg of firewood for cooking every day. They are mainly relying on the forest around the area of their camps. As a result, the forests are being destroyed every day,\" forest department officials told UNB.\nDeputy Director of Environment Department of Cox's Bazar Saiful Arshad said \"There is no shortage of relief to Ukhiya-Teknaf and Naikhangchhari Rohingya camps but there is a severe crisis of firewood which is going on as the number of the Rohingya people stands at 110,000 [new and old entrants] and is increasing every day.\"\nJane Alam, a Rohingya living in the Balukhali camp, said: \"We cannot collect firewood due to rain earlier. Now we are collecting and burning firewood to the stove in the morning and evening which is being collected from the forest. There is no alternative to this cutting forest to collect firewood for cooking.\"\nUNB also found that the trees and horticultural trees of the forest are burning in these stoves. Even they are regularly picking up the root of the trees which can cause mudslides.\nSome children were busy with the cutting of the root of the trees for their firewood, and many of them were collecting dry firewood from the deep forest.\n'No Man's Land' of Tambru (Ghumdhum Border area), Boro Chhakhola Para of Naikhangchhari, Phultoli and Ashartoli all presented the same the same picture.\nCox's Bazar Divisional Forest Officer (South) Mohammad Ali Kabir said, \"We have to think about the availability of firewood for the Rohingya people as nature will take its revenge.\"\nMentioning the tragic incident of three Rohingya deaths in an attack by wild elephants in the hills of Ukhiya, DFO Kabir said, \"Everyone will have to think about it. Efforts should be taken to restore the damage to the hills and forests. Some individuals and organisations have distributed some kerosene stoves as the relief. But it is a little less than the requirement,\" he added.\nPresident of Cox's Bazar Forest and Environment Conservation Council Dipak Sharma Dipu said \"It is not an easy matter to provide the firewood for the huge number of Rohingya entrants as there is a lot of demand of firewood which is increasing day by day. They are regularly meeting their needs of the firewood by cutting forests and social forestry trees.'\nHe also said \"The government and the administration should plan to provide firewood for Rohingyas including the relief. Otherwise, the way they start damaging forests, there will be an environmental disaster very soon.\"\nIgnoring the environmental disaster, Environment and Forest Minister Anwar Hossain Manju on October 25 said that 1000 acre more land will be allocated if it needed after his visit to the Kutupalong Rohingya camp in Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya Upazila. \"Some partial damage to the environment needed to be accepted and compromised for the sake of the Rohingya refugees.\"\nEarlier, the relief and disaster management minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya also said on Thursday (5 October) had announced the allocation of 1,000 acres forest as the Kutupalong refugee camp in Ukhiya of Cox's Bazar will be expanded increased from 3,000 acres to build 1, 50,000 sheds by the government in total to accommodate the Rohingya people there.\nHowever, the highest rate of death for environmental pollution ion happens in Bangladesh, according to a new report published on 20 October in the Lancet, a journal produced by The Lancet Commission on Pollution and Health.\nAccording to the report of the Refugee Relief and Rehabilitation Commission of Cox's Bazar, some 604,000 Myanmar citizens were listed as of October 24 and the influx of the Myanmar nationals into Bangladesh from Rakhine State continues.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-02-01 00:00:00      \nThe history of civilisation is the history of rivers. The remarkable and most influential civilisations in human history like Sindh, Iraqi, Chinese, European, and Egyptian were built on the banks of the Sindh, Euphrates, Yangtze, Danube, and Nile rivers. The culture, traditions, and values of the denizens of any civilisation and society fundamentally used to depend on the direct effects of the respective rivers. Along with this process, social practice, belief, livelihoods, the agricultural system, urbanisation, and industrialisation of the countries have been developed, based on the rivers, all over the world. Being located in the Indian sub-continent, Bangladesh is branded as a riverine country. Most of the rivers of Bangladesh originate from the Himalayan valleys traversing India, Nepal, and Bhutan and have merged into the Bay of Bengal, flowing through the country. The thousands of years of culture of the country's area owe it to the surrounding rivers. Bangladesh is also recognised as the \"sap of Asia\" to some extent, as it has many trans-boundary rivers flowing through the country. Livelihoods have always benefitted from the curving rivers and the urbanisation of Bangladesh has also been river-centric. Major cities like Dhaka, Rajshahi, Barisal, Sylhet, Khulna, and Narayanganj have been built taking advantage of the rivers around them. Though many numbers of rivers had existed before, now we have only about a hundred rivers still running. The rivers are degrading due to many reasons. Many rivers in the northern and south-western part of Bangladesh have already died, and some have seen their water flow reduced considerably. There have been many reasons as to why our rivers are so threatened. Rivers from other parts of the country have lost the navigability, which is responsible for flood and river erosion, as well as becoming threat to livelihoods. If this situation continues, then in the near future, it will be difficult for the country people to get the advantages of the rivers. To protect the existing rivers and to ensure the sustainability of the water from the rivers, some measurements need to be taken as soon as possible. People should be made aware of the negative consequences of destroying rivers and the kinds of activities which are harmful to them. Finally, Bangladesh needs to be prepared to win \"river diplomacy.\" There are many trans-boundary rivers in Bangladesh, and most of the rivers enter through India. India utilises its geographical advantages and the Indian River Commission is building dams by the side of almost every river. If the country wins in 'river diplomacy,' it will be possible to protect the rivers and water bodies. We must do everything to protect the rivers, which are vital to our life, nature, livelihood, and culture This is having adverse effects on the water management system of Bangladesh. The water flow, supply, and management of any country depends on the trans-boundary rivers management system. In this case, Bangladesh has not been able to bring fruitful results in the last few decades. The water flow, supply, and management system depends on four river systems: The Ganges, Jamuna, Borak-Meghna, and Karnaphuli. Water is being withdrawn from the very beginning, starting from the Himalayan valleys, resulting in Bangladesh always receiving a small amount of water from the trans-boundary rivers. The water flow is not only needed, but also keeps the rivers alive. But the amount of water in the rivers is reducing day by day. As such, it is great that the National River Conservation Commission (NRCC) has been formed in our country. This commission has a big role to play in protecting our rivers and in conducting negotiations with other countries. Many of the rivers have been badly encroached, and the government is planning and implementing many laws against this encroachment of rivers. They are working with the environmental activists in this regard, which is commendable. These hands should be dealt strongly and assertively. Finally, if the country wins in \"river diplomacy,\" then it will be possible to protect the rivers and water bodies. We must do everything to protect the rivers, which are vital to our life, nature, livelihood, and culture. Md Ashik Sarder is a development practitioner and researcher.

They will also lead their countries in the JWG.\nRepresentatives from relevant ministries, including Home and Disaster Management, also attended the meeting.\nAfterwards, Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali expressed his satisfaction over the progress of the talks and said the next step of the repatriation process will start soon.\n\nAlso Read- Myanmar plans to take back 300 Rohingyas per day\n\nUnder the instrument signed on November 23, only the Rohingyas who have fled to Bangladesh after October 2016, will be sent back.\nRohingyas who have been living since before the October 2016 Rohingya crisis will be sent back later.\nAccording to the terms, the repatriation will require proof of residency in Myanmar.\nThey will have to produce copies of documents issued in Myanmar which indicate they are residents of Myanmar. This extends to, but is not limited to, citizenship identity cards, national registration cards, temporary registration cards, business ownership documents, school attendance, etc.\nAny refugee documentation issued by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) will also be subject to similar verification. The government of Myanmar gets the last say in any dispute.\nMyanmar has also agreed to not prosecute or penalize any of the repatriated for illegal exodus and return, unless they are found to be specifically involved in terrorist or criminal activities.\nAnd after the repatriation, both governments will not provide residency or citizenship to any illegal immigrants.\nAH Mahmodd Ali on Tuesday noted the agreement is legally binding, but greatly depends on the sincerity of both governments to implement it successfully.\nIn preparation for Tuesday's agreement, an inter-ministerial meeting was held at the foreign ministry on Sunday, where the formation of the joint working group and its structure were discussed.\nAn estimated 655,000 Rohingyas have entered Bangladesh fleeing the violence in Myanmar's Rakhine State since August 25, raising the total Rohingya population in Cox's Bazar to 867,000, said the UN migration agency on Sunday.\nIt said the new arrivals are living in spontaneous settlements increasing the need for humanitarian assistance, including shelter, food, clean water, and sanitation.\nThe article was first published on Bangla Tribune \n\n\n\n\n"

Even her uterus is missing, making it difficult to say if she was raped.\"\nHowever, Ehsan Shah, Shariatpur additional superintendent of police (ASP), says the body parts may have simply decomposed.\n\"The dead body is seven days old and it was submerged in muddy water. Most of the body parts except for the bones had decomposed. That's why the vital organs are missing,\" he told the Bangla Tribune.\nOC Monjurul said police were looking into the matter.\nOn July 15, Liza went out of her house riding a bicycle and did not return.\n\n\n\n\n"

In these upazilas, implementing partners intend to improve hygiene behaviour among the people by promoting sustainable WASH services.\nThe project also aims to strengthen the existing formal and informal structures to establish clear channels of accountability. It will promote better resource management in the local government, communities and health facilities, alongside service delivery to highly marginalised and poverty-stricken people living in hard-to-reach areas.\n\"Climate change poses many challenges towards accessing water, sanitation and hygiene services in the coastal belt of our country,\" said WaterAid Bangladesh Country Director Dr Md Khairul Islam, who delivered the concluding remarks at the ceremony.\n\"The water and sanitation infrastructures in marginal and hard-to-reach areas are fragile, and there is a huge gap between need and actual availability of these services.\"\nKhairul added that the programme aims to create opportunities to deal with the challenges as well as to bring about a positive and sustainable impact on the lives of many across the most vulnerable areas of Bangladesh.\nMd Mahbub-ur Rahman, deputy chief executive officer and country head of commercial banking of HSBC, was present at the event as the special guest, while WaterAid's Fundraising and Learning Director Dr Imrul Kayes Muniruzzaman gave the introductory speech.\n\n\n\n\n"

Any marriage involving one or both parties below the legal age will be considered 'child marriage', reports UNB.\nHowever, marriages involving underage brides or grooms will not be considered an offence if they take place with the consent of the court and the guardians in \"special contexts\" serving the \"best interest\" of the underage female, the law says.\nBangladesh has one of the highest child marriage rates in the world - the highest in Asia. Over half (52%) of Bangladeshi girls get married before 18 and almost one-fifth (18%) are married off before 15.\nParliament passed the bill by a voice vote on Monday after State Minister for Women and Children's Affairs Meher Afroze Chumki tabled it.\nOn December 8 last year, Chumki placed the bill in Parliament with a provision for underage marriages in 'special cases'. With the passage of the bill in the House, the existing Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 will be abolished.\n\nAlso Read- 'Child Marriage Restraint Act contradicts itself'\n\nThe Cabinet on November 24 approved the bill that drew criticism from various quarters, especially rights groups. Critics say the law will only \"encourage\" child marriages rather than curb the practice. The Human Rights Watch in December criticised Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for going back on her promise to end child marriages.\nHasina had hit back at the critics, saying the law was framed \"considering the reality of our society\".\nShe criticised those who questioned the 'special provision'. \"They are far away from reality,\" she had said. \"A law can never be rigid, there must have an alternative in special cases particularly in case of unexpected pregnancy of any girl under 18. Otherwise, it may be disastrous for the society.\"\nHer son and ICT Affairs Adviser Sajeeb Wazed Joy, too, defended the government's decision, noting that several US states permit marriages of girls as young as 12.\nPunishment for child marriages \nAccording to the bill placed by State Minister Chumki, the Mobile Court Act 2009 can be exercised in case of child marriage as defined in the law.\nLocal government representatives, including upazila nirbahi officer, executive magistrate, upazila women affairs official, upazila social service officer, upazila primary or secondary education officer, officer-in-charge of the police station concerned can take necessary measures and legal actions to stop child marriage upon receiving written or verbal complaint.\nThe court can stop child marriage. The punishment for breaching the law is maximum six months' imprisonment or not more than Tk10,000 fine or both.\nApart from special cases, if a man or a woman marries any child, they can face maximum two years imprisonment or not more than Tk100,000 fine or both.\nSection 7 (2) of the law says, any underage boy and girl will have to undergo a detention of 30 days or pay Tk50,000 as fine or both for child marriage.\n\nAlso Read- Child marriage: When lawmaker breaks the law\n\nGuardians concerned or others associated with child marriage can get six months to two years' jail terms or Tk50,000 fine or both. Punishment for officiating such marriage is six months to two years' jail or Tk50,000 fine or both.\nBesides, the licence of a marriage registrar can be revoked for registering child marriage. He may also be sentenced to maximum two years imprisonment or fined Tk50,000 or both.\nBirth certificates, national identity cards, passports and academic examination certificates will be considered as legal documents for verifying the age of the bride and the groom.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-04-05 00:00:00      \nIain Mcleod was not the most memorable of British conservatives being credited with the rapid collapse of Britain's African empire while serving as secretary of state for the colonies (a now-defunct ministry). This didn't really matter to Iain. He understood that imperialism was over, and any attempt to hold on to it would only damage Great Britain. History proved him right. But my point is neither about the politician-journalist nor about decolonisation. It's about something he wrote in late 1965 while serving as the editor of The Spectator (a British conservative magazine) about a government that intrudes into the privacy of ordinary citizens through invasive means and enacts draconian solutions to run-of-the-mill problems. More specifically, Iain was talking about the plans to restrict the speed limit to 112km/h. While we Bangladeshis have seen enough deaths on roads to desire such measures, Iain, being the citizen of a more systematic country, found them \"illogical, patronising, and paternalistic.\" To him, it seemed a path only the \"nanny state\" (a state which views its citizens \"inherently incapable\" of driving at 130km/h) would take. What other things would the nanny state do? Flood the cell phones of its citizens with messages one after another about how all boilers should be run by expert and legal (read: \"licensed\") boiler operators, or that sustainable development is only possible if we are always prepared for (natural) disasters, undertake various awareness campaigns over issues that the public ought to understand quite well by now (if the masses still don't realise why killing infant hilsha fish is a bad thing, I fear they never will). On a side note, the police helpline initiative sounds quite good actually; and so do the messages about how child marriage must be prevented at any cost. The rest of it is still irremediable. It's been about time -- if the public hasn't learned yet, let it go. Wait, don't let it go, just enact the existing laws. Is that too much to ask? Banning Facebook and policing book fairs are the most luminous examples. Once you get to the Digital Security Act 2016, it stops getting even remotely funny Seems like, in Bangladesh, it is. Someone somewhere up the ladder thinks it's a brilliant idea to send messages. That a privileged Dhaka city teenager has nothing whatsoever to do with infant hilsha fish and that a pharmacy store-owner in a distant Rangpur haat bazaar doesn't really care about jute seems to be lost in transition. Some of the people who do catch infant hilsha fish and drive recklessly don't even know how to read cell phone messages. A few of them don't even own mobile phones. But who cares about results. People are indeed becoming aware, not all of them but some, over and over again, and again, and again, and again. Then there's the question of nationalised culture and religion. State-regulated khutbas and mongol shovajatras (good thing the former was cancelled). It seems as though past failures of command economy and command politics have been forgotten and now we have its replacements with command culture and command religion. This point requires deep analysis on its own right. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. You dig a bit deeper and a newer set of draconian measures come into our view. Banning Facebook and policing book fairs are the most luminous examples, and then there was the rumour going on that list of visitors of porn sites will be publicly disclosed. Once you get to the Digital Security Act 2016, it stops getting even remotely funny. Phrases like \"subject to any reasonable restrictions\" raise many questions, namely as to whose reason it would be and what would be the extent of such restrictions. The government has intentionally left it all very ambiguous. Except the clause which allows the Directorate General of the Digital Security Agency (agencies that China and North Korea have too) to bypass court orders. That part is crystal clear. Now, this sort of legislation is derived both out of a morbid and often violent desire to control and direct the population, and an innate but equally destructive belief that the public does not possess the necessary wisdom to survive out in the tough world. And it also needs controlled democracy, which allows them freedom over a certain spectrum. Anyone and everyone who disagrees is an enemy of the state, and must be crushed at any cost. A wide variety of leaders across the spectrum ascribed to this ideology. Some of them were revolutionaries (Fidel Castro), others were nationalists (Mahathir Mohammad or Lee Kuan Yew), and a considerable bunch represented the military junta (General Ziaul Haq or Augusto Pinochet). A few countries did achieve considerable development this way. At the cost of a suppressed democracy, that is. Yes, Malaysia has developed at an amazing rate, but we should keep in mind that Anwar Ibrahim, the Malaysian politician and leader of the opposition party, is still in jail. The case of Singapore is even better, except for the people who opposed Lee Kuan Yew and were sued into oblivion using taxpayer money. The two countries are still examples of progress. But they are also examples of suppressed democracy. There are states in the world which have taken a lot more time to achieve the same things, but have done so without sending the opposition to jail on absurd charges. Bottom line: Economic development shouldn't come at the expense of civil rights. There's a reason they call it sustainable development. Josip Tito's Yugoslavia seemed to have it all going well, but it all collapsed within a few years of his death. But the case of Bangladesh is even more complex, it's not just economic development that the government is promising, but also security against the real threat of terrorism. While we keep hearing about how bad the threat is, we are seldom told the cost of this protection. We are not told because we wouldn't understand, because somebody somewhere prioritises our safety over our choices, without understanding either. One only needs to remember the Rampal issue and subtle comments from government officials implying that the public was misunderstanding the environmental question -- to understand that the public will forever be considered as naive, ignorant, and uninformed, and the government will forever be the parent, the leader, the decider. Struck between its inability to be politically aroused and an inability of the political opposition to provide the least amount of stimulus, the Bangladeshi masses will, for the unforeseeable future, play obedient children to unreasonably stern parents. That is to say, they will suffer. Fardin Hasin is a freelance contributor."

      "text": "Date Published:2017-09-10 00:00:00      \n\nEid plays reviewed\n\n\n\n\nArafat Shanto\n\n\n\n\n Published at 10:23 pm September 10th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 12:09 pm September 11th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nSheola\nCast: Mostofa Monwar, Sporshia, Sohel Mondol\nDirector: Jaheen Faruque Amin\n\nIn a time of intense tensions heating up, such stories to calm the air are really needed. Yet, not talking about Jaheen Amin's new fiction might create new tensions. This short might not claim a spot to the list of dramas where the soul purpose of the short is to entertain the masses, regardless, watching this can simply be eye-candy. The producer focused on promoting simplicity. The story was inspired and taken from real life, which adds an ever-lasting feel to your platter as the audience. The attire, the struggles of the poverty-stricken and current incidents are elements that construct a good drama and rectifies a producer's ambition. The investigating officer acted well enough to compliment the whole short and the act added a good zing.\nBoro Chele\nCast:  Apurbo, Mehazabien Chowdhury\nDirector: Mizanur Rahman Aryan\n\nAfter Adnan Al Rajeev came up with Bikal Belar Pakhi last Eid, the tendency to portray the struggle of the middle class is in the spotlight. Even though the portrayal is nothing new, this phenomenon is something that has been happening quite often, yet the task is being done with care now. The narrative of his works might seem more likely to promote patriarchy, yet it should be noted that producer Ariyan Rahman is trying his hardest to come up with the best. The drama is celebrated with the presence of Apurbo and Mehazabien. It deals with the existence of a middle class individual who struggles to have his ends met. Surely, it had loopholes where questions were raised. One thing to be acknowledged was the fantasy where the father dies leaving nothing behind, and Apurbo plays the role of a jobless youngster who, to go with flow of the story, had to pull the family expenses on his own. Regardless of the little 'negatives' per se, audiences could relate to this, hence it was celebrated in many platforms of social media.\nThe Gentleman\nCast: Mosharraf Karim, Aparna Ghose\nDirector:  Hasan Morshed\n\nBangla dramas titled in English vocab can be a subject to be debated on. Say, a serial of Calcutta gets the label from the pure Bangla dictionary, like \"Posto,\" \"Maccher Jhol,\" \"Prakton\" and so on. Regardless of the name, Mosharraf Karim did a fine job without trying to overcast the act of comedy. Mosharraf Karim and Aparna Ghosh being the centre of the drama, many complained about how they tried to exasperate the whole act. Yet it might seem like Mosharraf Karim tried hard to pull the entire scene by himself. Audiences can relate to the realism. If you are big on him, it is definitely a must-watch.\nPunchclip\nCast:  Iresh Zaker, Mithila, Urmila\nDirector:  Redoan Rony\n\nRedoan Roni stays busy nowadays. He has been trying to come up with the best of stories. Given that it is not impossible to construct a good short with artists like Iresh Zaker, Mithila, Urmila Shrabonti Kar. The drama deals with the love-triangles of a wedded couple. The short is quiet on a white board but the presentation is spot on. The drama strolls on a slow tempo. But the presentation won't dampen to your excitement. Eid is all about trying to come up with good sitcoms and the producer did succeed in that sense.\nDas Cabin\nCast: Azad Abul Kalam, Iresh Zaker, Sharlin Farzana\nDirector: Masud Hasan Ujjal\n\nDas Cabin was hugely celebrated this Eid. The vibe of nostalgia was cast to an extent where Anjun Dutta's song \"Das Cabin\" failed. Masud Hasan Ujjal can rightfully claim his spot on the list of great directors after this. You can definitely relate to the fiction if you are passionate about the political catastrophe. The drama centres on a trio of individuals who are rebellious, socialists and the ones who belong to the middle class, struggling for their existence. Rolling the dice on the Das Cabin, the director beautifully painted the picture of people who do not belong to a structured class. The fight to follow was simplified amazingly throughout the 40 minutes of the duration. Sharlin and Azad Abul Kalam's performance are to be remembered for decades for this.\n \nTranslated by Syeda Ashfah Toaha Duti\n\n\n\n\n"

The central bank will announce its next agricultural and rural credit policy and programme for the ongoing fiscal year on July 27.\nDefault loans from eight state-owned banks stood at Tk5,101 crore in FY'17 while it was Tk4,013 crore a year ago\nPublic banks outperformed\nThe central bank data showed that private and foreign commercial banks outperformed public banks in terms of agricultural and non-agricultural credit disbursements in the last fiscal year.\nThe private and foreign commercial banks laid out agricultural credit of Tk11,300 crore, which was 37% over the target of Tk8,260 crore for FY'17.\nIn contrast, the eight state-owned and specialised banks disbursed Tk9,698-crore in agricultural credit, only 5% above the target of Tk9,290 crore. Of these banks, Agrani Bank disbursed Tk631 crore against a target of Tk660 crore, while BDBL lent Tk5.4 crore against Tk50 crore.\nAmong the private commercial banks, Farmers Bank, Modhumoti Bank, Union Bank, South Bangla Agriculture and Commerce Bank fell behind the target during the last fiscal year in disbursing farm and non-farm credit.\nAmong the foreign banks, National Bank of Pakistan did not disburse a single loan.\nDefault loan rises by 27%\nDefault loans in the agriculture sector kept pace with the credit disbursement in FY'17.\nThe defaulted loans in the last fiscal year stood at Tk5,241 crore, up by 27% compared to the Tk4,124.37 crore seen in FY'16.\nAccording to the BB data, default loans from eight state-owned banks stood at Tk5,101 crore in FY'17 while it was Tk4,013 crore a year ago. In the meantime, such loans from both private and foreign commercial banks rose to Tk140 crore.\nExperts said loans defaulted in FY'17 mainly rose as a large number of farmers in the flood-hit areas of the country failed to pay their instalments against their bank loans due to crop losses.\nThe central bank authorities, however, have asked the banks to take effective measures to realise default loans and especially those which are classified, according to a BB official.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2017-11-26 00:00:00      \nThe government is planning to allocate additional funds in the revised budget to support more than 620,000 Rohingya refugees that could stay in Bangladesh for an indefinite period of time. An official from the Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance confirmed the matter to the Dhaka Tribune. \"We will prepare funds for several projects aimed at supporting the Rohingya refugee population, despite the recent repatriation agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar, the official said. The official added that different ministries and divisions have already spent Tk60 crore as of last week of November. The insider said most of the funds were spent on providing refugees with sanitation, shelter, healthcare facilities and on special ID cards distributed to Rohingya living in the camps, amid concerns that the asylum seekers will spread throughout the country. \"We have already started building a fund from government exchequers and from foreign and domestic NGOs, to add it to the revised outlay of the current fiscal year budget,\" said the official. A recent letter issued by Cox's Bazar Deputy Commissioner Ali Hossain revealed that a total of 42 NGOs have announced to pledge Tk200 crore for food, shelter, healthcare and sanitation as part of several programmes, under four cluster projects in Ukhiya and Teknaf. According to sources from the Finance Division, it has also disbursed Tk10 Crore for developing roads and another helipad at the Bhasan Char island, as part of the government's plan to relocate the displaced Rohingya there. On the other hand, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently contacted ten government agencies and divisions, including the Prime Minister's Office, Cabinet Division, Bangladesh Armed Forces, and the Finance Division, asking them to disclose the funds spent on supporting the Rohingya so far. \"A large portion of the fund might be allotted from the revised budget for future infrastructure development to support the displaced Rohingya. However, the total figure is yet to be finalised, as negotiations between the governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar are still underway,\" acting finance secretary Mohammad Muslim Chowdhury told the Dhaka Tribune. Commenting on the issue last month, Finance Minister AMA Muhith stated: \"The Rohingya refugee crisis will not put a significant pressure on the current fiscal year budget. I hope that the development partners will lend their support to Bangladesh in resolving the crisis.\" The minister also added that some ministries and divisions have asked for funds up to Tk10 crore ($1.2 million) for supporting the Rohingya people, but the national budget has not been affected much due to donations from other countries and humanitarian agencies. According to the United Nations, more than 620,000 Rohingya arrived in Bangladesh since August 25, following a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar military. The Ministry of Home Affairs had sent the proposal for Bhasan Char's development to the Planning Ministry in the wake of the ongoing refugee crisis, despite Finance Minister AMA Muhith's unfavorable attitude towards the project. According to the Finance Division, the development of Bhasan Char will cost Bangladesh around Tk2,300 crore."

After all, he was a BSc graduate from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology,\" she said.\nShe found his educational qualifications to be falsified. She said one of her aunts went to AUST and inquired about Halim. She found he was not a graduate. He never went to Ahsanulalh. He only had a diploma to his name.\n\"Whenever I tried to talk to him, he would respond in the most foul and abusive language imaginable. My skin crawled at his loathsome words.\"\nHalim's uncle Moazzem Hossain said: \"We do not know what he got the diploma in, or where he got it from. But he never went to AUST.\"\nThe girl's family convinced her to divorce Nayeem after two years. In 2011, the divorce was finalised.\nBy that time, Halim lost his job at Ekushey Television.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will formally inaugurate it when she returns home\nObaidul also noted that so far 47.5% of the project has been completed. That, however, is about 7% behind the original schedule.\n\nSpeaking at the briefing, Padma Multipurpose Bridge Project (PMBP) Director Shafiqul Islam said: \"The span has been placed upon a temporary bearing. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will formally inaugurate it when she returns home.\"\nAccording to PMBP sources, the first span of the superstructure reached the construction yard from China on August 8 last year. It was set to be installed at the Mawa point of Munshiganj by December.\nBut strong current at that part of the river delayed the process, forcing the authorities to revise the plan and begin installation of the spans from Janjira point instead.\nIt was also reported that the original design would be changed for proper construction of the bridge because of disputed soil level of the riverbed and strong current.\nSecretary Anwarul Islam, however, refuted that claim during on Saturday's briefing, saying: \"The reports about changes being made in the design are incorrect. The bridge is being built following the original plan.\"\n\nAlso Read- Padma Bridge at a glance\n\nOnce completed, the Padma Bridge will stand over the 42 pillars, including two transition pillars on the two landward ends. These pillars will bear the load of 41 spans, each 150m in length, to connect the 6.15-kilometre-long bridge.\nIt will be a two-level steel truss bridge, with a single-track railway on the lower deck level and a four-lane highway for motor vehicles on the upper deck.\nProject officials said the piling works to mount seven more pillars at Janjira point has already finished. They are currently working on the installation of 16 other pillars.\nThe construction work for the main structure of the bridge had kicked-off in December 2015.\nThe estimated total project cost, revised thrice since the approval of the project in 2007, now stands at Tk28,793 crores. More than Tk13,000 crores of that have already been spent.\nAround 3,000 people, including 800 foreign nationals, are currently involved in Padma Bridge's construction work.\nApart from connecting Bangladesh's south-west to the northern and eastern regions, the bridge will also function as part of the proposed Asian Highway route.\nThe government says that the country's GDP growth will see a 1.2 percent increase after the bridge becomes operational.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-09-04 00:00:00      \nA total of 26 studies were carried out by local experts and at least 80 projects have been selected for implementation The National Economic Council (NEC) approved the much-anticipated Delta Plan 2100 yesterday as part of the government's efforts to secure the future of water resources and mitigate against the likely effects of climate change including natural disasters.  The approval came in a meeting held at the NEC conference room in the Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area of Dhaka with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair, reports BSS. \"We firmly believe that our most important resources are the water resources,\" Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal told reporters after the meeting. \"If we could properly utilize these resources, then we will certainly not lag behind in agriculture and Bangladesh will grow economically. Through the implementation of the plan, the country could boost the GDP growth by another 1.5% by 2030.\" The planning minister said that after studying the example of the Netherlands, PM Sheikh Hasina had directed the authorities concerned to frame such a plan to tap the maximum potential of Bangladesh as a deltaic region. \"The Netherlands has benefitted greatly by adopting such a plan as the country was able to reclaim around 6,000 square kilometres of land in addition to their mainland,\" he said. The Dutch government and the World Bank have both helped the General Economics Division (GED) to prepare the plan over the past 3.5 years.  A total of 26 studies were carried out by local experts and at least 80 projects have been selected for implementation. Of them, 65 would be infrastructure projects while 15 others would aim to enhance institutional capacity, efficiency and research. Three-phase plan  The planning minister said the government will need to raise $37 billion by 2030 to implement the plan over three phases: a short-term plan by 2030, a mid-term plan by 2050, and a long-term plan by 2100. At present, however, the government spends only 0.8% of GDP on delta management projects and programs. This figure will need to be more than tripled - to 2.5% of GDP - if the 80 projects of the plan are to be implemented. To reach this total, Bangladesh is likely to get $2 billion assistance from Green Climate Fund every year. The remaining costs will be met by other development partners, foreign direct investment, and the private sector - which is expected to contribute 20%. The State Minister for Finance and Planning MA Mannan, Planning Commission GED Member Prof Shamsul Alam, and other secretaries concerned were also present at Tuesday's briefing. Prof Shamsul Alam said the plan highlighted six hotspots: coastal areas; Barind Tract and drought-prone region; haor (backswamp) and flash flood prone areas; Chittagong Hill Tracts region; river region and estuaries; and the urban region. To execute the Delta Plan 2100, a high-level Delta Governance Council will be formed to make decisions and issue directives. This will be led by the prime minister, with the planning minister serving as vice-president.  Additionally, a project or operations selection committee led by GED member will be constituted. The secretaries of the ministries related to the Delta Plan will be committee members, who will select and monitor the projects and programs.  Also, on Tuesday, Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal informed that work is underway to frame another plan for the year 2021-2041 to transform Bangladesh from a developing into a developed nation."

The Prime minister was speaking at a program on Saturday after inaugurating the Badda U-loop (North U-loop) under Hatirjheel Integrated Development Project, reports UNB. She said: \"We've already started a feasibility study to construct the rail lines and there is a plan to construct elevated ring roads around the capital city to ease communication.\" Sheikh Hasina said the government will go for dredging the four rivers, surrounding the capital so that city dwellers could get a better commuting service through waterways. \"We'll dredge the rivers to restore their navigability,\" she added. She further said; \"Small bridges over these rivers that are hindering the plying of water vessels will be removed through constructing new bridges which will not create obstacles. We're taking plans for that too.\" While speaking about the Hatirjheel project, the prime minister said the government will create a link canal with the project for linking it with rivers. \"If we excavate the canal, the water of the Hatijheel project will remain better. Another plan to that end is also underway,\" she said. The Badda U-loop Focus Bangla The prime minister also mentioned the previous government's constructed box culverts over the canal and that the decision was just a blunder. She said: \"As a result, the water logging in Dhaka is increasing day by day... constructing box culverts is not a solution.\" She said if the Awami League is elected in next election, it will demolish the box culverts to open the canals, not in only in Dhaka city, but also across the country. \"We'll construct elevated roads over the canals, if needed. The canals will remain open...it'll be helpful to remove the rainwater quickly,\" she said. The Prime Minister said: \"The government will renovate all the canals, swamps, rivers, drains and ponds across the country. We've already taken projects in hand for these.\" She also said: \"The aim of these projects is to make the country more environment-friendly, so the people of the country could get an atmosphere to live healthier lives. The prime minister mentioned that traffic jam is not a unique matter in big cities, and the government has taken numerous steps to reduce traffic congestions in capital Dhaka. She reiterated that the government will introduce high speed bullet trains from Dhaka to Chittagong, Sylhet, Rajshahi, Dinajpur, Barisal-Paira and Kolkata. The Prime Minister said: The government has been able to carry out marked development across the country, as people have voted in favour of Awami League for two consecutive times. \"As we have been in power for two consecutive terms, we've been able to complete our development projects,\" she said. Housing and Public Works Minister Engineer Mosharraf Hossain, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan, Local MP AKM Rahmat Ullah, Army Chief General Aziz Ahmed and Hatirjheel Integrated Development Project Director Maj Gen Abu Sayeed Mohammad Masud also spoke at the program."

Some have gone as far as winning an Oscar nomination for their documentaries, as Leonardo DiCaprio did for 'Virunga' (2014) while some have helmed the works they produced, as Beyonce did in her critically acclaimed self-starrer 'Life Is But a Dream' (2013). Dhaka Tribune Showtime explores some of the notable documentaries by celebrities who went the extra mile. Brad Pitt Produced two critically acclaimed documentaries: \"God Grew Tired of Us,\" a 2006 film about three of the Lost Boys of Sudan, and 2016's \"Voyage of Time,\" a documentary about the birth and death of the known universe.  Angelina Jolie Produced, directed, and starred in \"A Place in Time.\" Celebrities visit orphanages and refugee camps in the 2007 film that documents the daily lives of people in more than two dozen countries around the world during the course of a week.  Madonna Produced, starred in and narrated \"Madonna: Truth or Dare,\" a 1991 film that chronicled her 1990 \"Blond Ambition\" world tour.

According to the Water Development Board control room, within between 6pm Saturday and 6am Sunday, Dharla River's flow rose by 18 centimetres at the Setu Point, and Teesta's flow increased by 14cm at Kaunia Point. Both rivers are still below the danger point, but Water Development Board Executive Engineer Md Shafiqul Islam said the water will continue to rise for the next two days in these two as well as the Dudhkumar River. Meanwhile, the water flow has dropped in the Brahmaputra River. This correspondent spoke to several public representatives in the Dharla and Teesta delta, who said water had not reached any habitation in the region. However, heavy rain since Sunday morning was causing alarm among people. Engineer Shafiqul Islam said heavy rain on the Indian side was sending water down the Teesta, the Dharla and the Dudhkumar and this was likely to continue for the next 48 hours. Shafiqul said the waters had not yet reached the danger level, and they were likely to drop again after 48 hours unless there is more heavy rain. He said in response to a question that the dams and embankments damaged by last year's flood had been repaired and were risk-free now."

His family said: \"Abu Taher and a few others went to India, crossing the Padma River, to get cows at 10pm on Thursday. They were chased by the BSF of Nimtita camp after crossing the river.  \"The others escaped, but BSF hacked  Abu's legs and wounded him; he then  jumped into the river and swam across to Bangladesh. The patrol team of BGB 53 rescued him and took him to home when they learned what had happened.\" Abu was then taken to the Shibganj Upazila Health Complex and later to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, for better treatment, after his health deteriorated.

      "text": "Date Published:2018-04-16 00:00:00      \nConditions in crowded camps in Cox's Bazar have deteriorated for nearly 700,000 Rohingya as aid workers race to strengthen shelters ahead of monsoon season, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said. Steve McAndrew, head of its emergency operations in the coastal area, said its clinics were scaling up to combat possible outbreaks of cholera and other water-borne diseases feared with the rains that could arrive this month. Desperation has grown among the Muslim Rohingya, who fled a military crackdown last August in Myanmar's Rakhine state and many see scant chance of returning, he said in an interview on Monday. \"It's hot, it's hard to find water and food, and the conditions are getting worse. And they are going to continue to get worse as the rainy season comes and then we have a monsoon season and cyclone season,\" McAndrew told Reuters at IFRC headquarters in Geneva. \"The situation is getting worse, and it's open-ended and there is no end in sight,\" he said. The UN refugee agency UNHCR said last week conditions in Myanmar were not ready for a safe return of the Rohingya. Rohingya are fleeing a \"horrendous\" situation, McAndrew said, while declining to apportion blame. \"People are losing their families, their villages are being destroyed. A lot of the people are saying they don't even want to know what's going on back home anymore. They seem to have just decided they will not go home.\" His agency is reinforcing the flimsy bamboo and plastic structures in which the Rohingya live in Cox's Bazar so they can withstand the rains, and a new site is being prepared for those most at risk, McAndrew said. \"We believe we can move around 25,000 families about the first of May...We have satellite maps of the potential flood zones and the gullies where we know they are going to get flooded out. \"We're drilling wells, we're putting in latrines, we're working with the UN and other agencies preparing this site around the clock,\" he said. McAndrew, who headed the IFRC's operation in Haiti when cholera erupted there in late 2010, said of Cox's Bazar: \"We're highly concerned about outbreaks in the upcoming rainy season, especially cholera and other water-borne diseases.\" The agency was pre-positioning medical supplies and preparing its clinics to treat cholera, which thrives in unsanitary conditions. IFRC's appeal of $34.92 million is only 55% funded, McAndrew said. \"It's just not enough in front of the scale of the needs.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2018-08-27 00:00:00      \nAbout 3.8 million deaths from illness every year are attributable to use of solid fuels and kerosene for cooking, according to the World Health Organisation Fatema lives in the Unchiprang refugee camp at Teknaf. To cook her meals, she uses an oven made of mud and fire wood collected from the forestland or bought from the market. To cook each meal, she has to burn 10-12 pieces of fire wood that are about 1.5-2 feet in length. \"It is common for us to have breathing problem because using solid fuels and kerosene for cooking create a lot of smoke inside the house,\" Fatema says. \"I have no other option but to continue using them.\" Fatema is one of the estimated three billion people who use solid fuels and kerosene for cooking that produce high levels of household air pollution. About 3.8 million deaths from illness every year are attributable to it, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Of these 3.8 million deaths, 27% are due to pneumonia, 18% from stroke, 27% from ischaemic heart disease, 20% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 8% from lung cancer. The cramped Rohingya shelters are also susceptible to fire. Until August 14 this year, an estimated 80 refugees have been affected by 12 incidents of fire, according to Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ISCG). Lack of options The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) say four out of five Rohingyas rely on firewood for cooking and heating - a major cause of deforestation in surrounding areas. About a year ago, both side of Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Highway was full of greenery. After the Rohingya influx, 4,318 acres of forestland have been used to construct makeshift settlements for refugees, the Forest Department's Cox's Bazar (South) Division said. The relief material being distributed among the Rohingyas do not include firewood, forcing the refugees to cut down trees from government forests. An ISCG report estimated that the refugees need about 700 tons of firewood every day and that they have no alternative fuel. \"When cooking with solid fuels, inefficient stoves create a huge amount of black smoke which produces small carbon particles that penetrate deep into the lungs,\" Environment Department Director Ziaul Haque said. Indoor smoke can be higher than acceptable levels for small particles, especially in the Rohingya refugee camp where every household cooks inside the house, he said. Everyone living inside the shelter is vulnerable. \"Long-term exposure of these carbon particles increases the risk of lung cancer,\" he added. Women, children most vulnerable The WHO described household air pollution as \"the world's single greatest environmental health risk,\" saying that it accounts for 7.7% of global mortality. It said household air pollution causes non-communicable diseases including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. Exposure to household air pollution almost doubles the risk for childhood pneumonia and is responsible for 45% of all pneumonia deaths in children less than 5 years, the WHO said. Over half of the Rohingyas who fled to Bangladesh in the last one year are children. Sixty percent of women and children living in the refugee camps and host communities are vulnerable to respiratory diseases. Cox's Bazar Surgeon Abdus Salam said: \"Indoor air pollution can affect health and here in the camps, people are highly dependent on inefficient stoves. The smoke from firewood is increasing health risks. Respiratory infections, breathing problems are common among the camp's residents.\" Md Kamal Hossain, the district's deputy commissioner, said steps are being taken to address the issue. He told the Dhaka Tribune that they have supplied 11,000 LPG gas cylinders in the camps. \"An estimated 200,000 households need to replace their cooking facilities,\" he said. \"It will take time.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2018-10-12 00:00:00      \nAccording to the report, the water quality of Bangladesh is poor even though 98% of people have access to water from technologically advanced water sources Bangladesh can reduce poverty and boost growth by taking immediate measures to upgrade the quality of water and sanitation, a World Bank report said on Thursday. The report found that despite demonstrating remarkable progress in improving access to water and sanitation, a total of 41% of all improved water sources in Bangladesh have been contaminated with E. coli bacteria.  The findings in the report also suggested a high prevalence of fecal contamination. in drinking water, which, it said, affects the rich and the poor, and the rural and the urban population equally.  \"Poor water quality and sanitation can hold back a country's potential because unsafe water and poor sanitation are linked to nutritional disadvantages in early-childhood,\" said Sereen Juma, the World Bank's acting country director for Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal.  \"Bangladesh has made great strides in expanding access to water and can build on that progress by focusing on improving the quality of water and sanitation.\" Titled \"Promising Progress: A Diagnostic of Water Supply, Sanitation, Hygiene (WASH), and Poverty in Bangladesh\", the report was launched at a Dhaka hotel on Thursday. The study, which is part of the World Bank's WASH Poverty Diagnostics initiative in 18 countries including Bangladesh, said the poorest quintile of the population suffers three times more from water and sanitation related gastrointestinal diseases. Bacteria AKM Ibrahim, chief engineer of the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE), attributed the bacteria contamination of water mainly to household management of water reservoirs. \"They mostly remain filthy, even for months,\" he said. \"The use of quality materials for piped-water supply and expanding an improved workforce can help fight the problem.\" The presence of E. Coli bacteria have been found in 80% of private piped-water taps sampled across the country, a similar rate to water retrieved from ponds, according to the report.  Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a bacteria that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. Most E.coli strains are harmless, but some can cause serious food poisoning.  Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) is a bacterium that can cause severe food-borne disease. In most cases, the illness is self-limiting, but it may lead to a life-threatening disease including haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), especially in young children and the elderly. Arsenic Furthermore, the report found 13% of Bangladesh's water sources contain arsenic levels above a safe threshold. Chittagong and Sylhet divisions suffer most from arsenic contamination, which occurs naturally, the report stated.  The World Bank further observed that during a natural disaster, about a third of households in the country's high-risk areas switch to contaminated and unimproved water sources. The report findings claimed the coastal areas are increasingly suffering from salinity-intrusion, leaving the poor more affected.   In addition, about 50 million people in Bangladesh still use shared and rudimentary toilets, with just 28% toilets equipped with soap and water.  According to the report, the water quality of Bangladesh is poor even though 98% of people have access to water from technologically advanced water sources. Urban slums have poor access to clean water and safe sanitation, whereas large-city slums have five times less access to improved sanitation and have the highest rates of childhood undernutrition in the country. However, there was no specific mention of women's sanitation in the report.  Toilets deficit \"There is scope for Bangladesh to improve access to sanitation beyond the household level to public places, schools, health facilities, and workplaces,\" the report's co-author, George Joseph, said.  \"Only about half of manufacturing enterprises in Bangladesh have toilets. Only half of the primary schools have separate toilets for girls, and one in four adolescent girls miss school during menstruation. A safe water and sanitation environment will encourage more women to participate in the workforce.\" WaterAid Bangladesh's Country Director Dr Khairul Islam said a large number of toilets, especially in public places or facilities, are either in a dilapidated condition or dysfunctional.  \"The awareness of using sanitary pads for schoolgirls is so weak and the scenario is even worse in the rural areas,\" Khairul said. Muhammad Nazrul Islam, the state minister for water resources and the chief guest of the report launching program, said the government is mainly focused on resolving the problems relating to drainage system, irrigation and flood control. \"The government, nevertheless, is optimistic that the proposed Delta Plan-2100 will greatly help sort out the water-related issues in the country,\" he said. Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman, executive chairman of Power and Participation Research Centre (PPRC), said despite Bangladesh transforming from a rural to an urbanised country, sanitation system in the cities did not develop much in line with the changes. \"The overall urban drainage system, sanitation and water treatment are still in a poor state,\" he observed. \"The poor people living in the cities are the most affected group since a big chunk of them resides in low-lying areas and in places lacking proper access to sanitation.\" Zillur called for a coordinated and long-term plan to be designed to address this issue.  \"The government has to consider the WASH-cycle a value chain,\" he said. \"Terminals across the country need special attention when it comes to quality sanitation since hundreds of thousands of people throng there every day.\"  Thursday's event was moderated by Mark John Ellery, the World Bank's senior water and sanitation expert, and featured speeches from Prof Dr Md Abul Hashem Khan, the line director at Directorate General of Health Services; and Takuya Kamata, the World Bank's practice manager.

      "text": "Date Published:2018-03-14 00:00:00      \n\nDollar price accelerates: Import pressure or manipulation?\n\n\n\n\nGolam Mowla\n\n\n\n\n Published at 10:57 pm March 14th, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nDespite the rise in remittance inflow and export earnings, the US dollar keeps rising in cost.\nIn February, remittances rose by 22.14% compared to the same period last year. Export earnings in the first eight months of the current 2017-18 fiscal (July-February) also increased by 7.38%. Currently the foreign currency reserve in Bangladesh Bank (BB) stands at over $31 billion. Despite these positive factors the price of the dollar against taka (Bangladeshi currency) keeps increasing.\nBangladesh Bank cannot make the currency exchange market normal even after releasing dollars every day. Many question whether the dollar price is being manipulated. Experts think the price is shooting up due to the increase in import expenses.\nAccording to BB data, in less than a year taka's value against the dollar was reduced to Tk4. In July last year, a dollar sold at Tk 80.66, while in March 12, it was selling at Tk85. In some banks the rate was Tk85.\nThe central bank has directed all concerned not to charge more than Tk83. Despite that scores of private banks gave Bangladesh Bank wrong information regarding dollar rate.\nBangladesh has been experiencing a volatile situation in the dollar market since June last year. Authorities have failed to contain the price even after releasing dollars due to syndicates, which is why taka's value is dropping regularly.\nAllegations are that a number of banks are behind the destabilization of the currency market. A probe conducted by Bangladesh Bank also found that several banks were selling dollars to clients at a higher price than what they were reporting to the central bank.\nThe banks charge Tk2 more for selling dollar from business persons than the rate they declare for the settlement of letter of credit, according to Bangladesh Bank. As a result, the import cost has risen and the foreign currency market has also become unstable. The price of the dollar against taka keeps increasing. This factor is beneficial for remittance and export earnings, but import costs are also increasing.\nMeanwhile, Bangladesh Bank has issued show cause against 26 banks in two phases on charges of manipulation in the foreign currency exchange market.\nThe central bank is releasing record number of dollars in the market. So far it has sold $2 billion during the current fiscal. Despite that the dollar is becoming costlier.\nEarlier in November, Bangladesh Bank decided to take stern action against the banks over manipulation and destabilizing the market, at a high level meeting chaired by its Governor Fazle Kabir. Following the decision, show cause was issued against 17 banks in the first phase and later 9 more banks faced a similar blow.\nDebasish Chakraborty, spokesperson and executive director at Bangladesh Bank, said: \"We have taken necessary moves to keep the foreign currency market normal. We have either purchased dollar from the market or sold it out. This is a part of our regular activities.\"\nHe further said: \"Bangladesh Bank keeps the market stable through purchase and selling of dollars from the market as a strategy to keep back the value of taka.\" Bangladesh Bank always keeps an eye on the market, the BB official added.\nLeaders of the Bangladesh Foreign Exchange Dealers' Association (BAFEDA) held an emergency meeting on November 29 to contain the market. The meeting urged the banks to keep the dollar price lower than Tk83 at import level in order to bring stability in the foreign currency exchange market. The association held another meeting recently since the banks did not keep its request.\nDuring a recent meeting with senior officials of authorized dealer banks, Bangladesh Bank expressed concern over the high rate of the dollar.\nAccording to the central bank, interbank dollar rate was Tk80.66 at the end of July last year. In February, the rate rose to Tk82.90. Currently the rate per dollar is Tk85.25 in the market. Over the last eight months (July-February) of the current fiscal, the value of taka against dollar dropped by 3.77%.\nMany suspect that people are transferring money abroad by purchasing dollars anticipating unstable situation in the country centering on the upcoming national elections.\nZaid Bakht, research director of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) and chairman of Agrani Bank, said: \"Though many tend to remove money abroad ahead of the national elections, dollar price is increasing due to a rise in import expenses.\"\nHe said cost is increasing for the import of equipment being used in a number of ongoing major projects such as Padma Bridge and metro rail. Import of food grain has accelerated due to last year's flood that hampered production. \"But since export earnings have not risen, demand for dollar has increased. That's why dollar price against taka is increasing gradually.\"\nAccording to Bangladesh Bank data, in the first six months of the current fiscal, import expenses have increased by 25.78% compared to the same period of the last fiscal. Between July and December, import of food (rice and wheat) rose by 212%, equipment for setting up industries increased by 35%, fuel by 28% and raw materials for industries rose by over 15%.\nIn the first six months of the current fiscal, the amount of letter of credit (LC) has exceeded $40 billion and it might cross $60 billion at the end of the fiscal.\nAs of March 8, Bangladesh Bank's foreign currency reserves stood at over $31.93 billion. To meet the demand, the central bank has sold more than $2 billion to the banks to date of the current fiscal.\nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

NESCO collective bargaining agent Kamal Chandra Singh said the officials were given the order from the Sirajganj NESCO office on Sunday. NESCO officer Jahangir Hossen Jewel, also a local Awami Leader, said he joined his new office on Monday on receiving the order, along with many other officials. According to sources, a probe body formed concerning the electrocution incident on August 2 found that the deaths were caused by the negligence of certain clients and officials of Northern Electricity Supply Company. The NESCO probe body submitted its report to its Rajshahi zone chief engineer Rezaul Karim on August 27, said the committee chief and NESCO's Pabna regional superintendent engineer Abul Hossain. The probe body found that company executive engineer, Abu Hena Mustafa Kamal, assistant engineer Shahnewaj, deputy assistant engineer Banee Amin, and meter reader Nurul Huda, did not disconnect the power supply despite the connections being illegal and unsafe. The report recommended those responsible be punished. On September 3 and 4, Zakiul Islam, managing director of the NESCO, ordered Rezaul Karim to suspend the 14 officials. Eight people, including three schoolchildren, were electrocuted after they came in contact with power lines in the village of Kadai in the Sirajganj Sadar upazila, on July 31. The incident occurred when a shop made of corrugated iron sheets was being relocated from an area of low-lying land to a relatively higher place, and the area was covered in flood waters following a downpour.

      "text": "Date Published:2018-10-26 00:00:00      \nOver 1,200 arrested in last 18 days Fishermen in Shariatpur have defied the government's ban and caught mother ilish. Even law enforcement - including the coast guard, police, fisheries officials and executive magistrates - has been attacked, while conducting drives against the fishermen. The seasonal fishermen involved are protected by influential local people. In the last 18 days, around 1,200 fishermen have been arrested with 14 metric tons of mother ilish; and six million meters of \"current jal,\" a banned nylon fibre net, has been seized. Of the fishermen, 850  have been sentenced to prison. However, locals are saying that due to a lack of skilled and trained personnel, the government has failed to prevent the catching of mother ilish this year. The government has imposed a 22-day ban on catching, selling, and transporting ilish. A 7,000km breeding ground is off-limits to guarantee the safe spawning of this popular fish during its peak breeding period. The ban started on October 7 and will last until October 28--as this is the peak time period for mother ilish to lay their eggs. Any breach of the ban will result in one to two years of imprisonment and a maximum fine of Tk5,000. The government has imposed this ban on Ilish fishing every year, since 2003, to protect mother ilish.  Ilish production in Bangladesh has increased by 66% over the last nine years. The Shariatpur District Fisheries Department has said around 70km of water bodies have been identified as breeding grounds or sanctuaries for mother ilish. They said this vast area has been difficult for them to monitor, due to a lack of experienced staff. The department mentioned that since the start of the drives against illegal ilish catching, some influential people from Zajira upazila have been hiring fishermen from other areas to illegally catch   it.  Every day, more than a hundred speed boats, and over a thousand boats, full of fishermen are catching ilish. The catching area extends from Zajira Palerchar to Nariar Naoapara, and from Wapda area to Gosairhat upazila's Shaatpara area along the Padma River. The fish are sold in neighbouring areas in local fish markets and in retail at around 50 locations in neighbouring villages--at very low rates. The local administration is helpless in controlling the situation. The detained fishermen say they know it is illegal to catch mother ilish but they are still doing it to earn their living. They also complain that most of the fishermen do not receive government-provided rice afforded to those qualifying for four-month vulnerable group feeding (VGF) assistance. They also claim that they have to repay loans taken from NGOs and money lenders, for which they are risking everything--even knowing the consequences. Shariatpur District Fisheries Official Bishwajit Boiragi said: \"The total numbers of listed fishermen in the area are 32,324 and out of them, 16,355 get the VGF assistance at the moment. The ones who catch ilish during the ban, are not from this number--rather, they are outsiders.\" He also said: \"During the last few days while the drives were conducted against these illegal fishermen: the UNO, executive magistrates, police, and coast guard members were attacked. This is  because the fishermen working illegally  have the backing of some dishonest and influential people. Bishwajit further said they are trying to get modern boats and experienced men to tackle the problem to prevent it from happening in the future. "

      "text": "Date Published:2018-09-19 00:00:00      \nLocal sources said erosion by major rivers has intensified in many areas, causing immense sufferings to the people The overall flood situation remained unchanged but river erosion has taken a serious turn in different parts of the country on Wednesday. Local sources said erosion by major rivers has intensified in many areas, causing immense sufferings to the people. A large number of houses, structures, trees and crops on vast tracts of land were washed away by floodwaters and strong current of rivers in different flood-hit areas. Erosion by the rivers Padma, Jamuna and Brahmaputra continued in different places of Shariatpur, Gaibandha, Bogra, Jamalpur and Rajbari districts. The erosion took a serious turn in the places along the riverside areas in the last couple of weeks. Shariatpur Our correspondent Kazi Nazrul Islam reported that the Padma River is in a rising trend and speedy current is engulfing houses and establishments rapidly in the Naria upazila. A private hospital named Life Care was engulfed by the river on Wednesday morning. The erosion swallowed houses, schools, dams, roads, business establishments, mosques, in the last few days while positive initiatives by the authorities concerned were not visible to prevent the erosion, locals alleged. The residents of river bank are going through days of fear of further erosion while several more houses are still at greater risk.  Victims have to live under the open sky as their dwellings were washed away by floodwaters. They face huge losses as their croplands have also been washed away. Now, they are seeking assistance to erect their houses. The government has distributed relief among the flood victims in the affected areas, but these are not adequate, said the victims, adding that they are seeking financial assistance to build their dwellings. Kabir Bin Anwar, Secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources, visited the flood-hit area on September 15 and declared that immediate steps will be taken over the issue. But there is no visible scene of his announcement, alleged locals. Meanwhile, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved a proposal to award a contract to Bangladesh Navy-run Khulna Shipyard to protect the Zajira and Naria upazilas in Shariatpur from river erosion at a cost of Tk1077.58 crore. The committee at a meeting, with Finance Minister AMA Muhith in the chair, gave the go-ahead to the proposal placed by Water Resources Ministry, reports UNB. Briefing newsmen the Cabinet Division additional secretary Nasima Begum said under the proposal, the Khulna Shipyard will implement the project of the Water Development Board to protect 8.90km of riverbank of the Padma at the Zajira and Naria upazilas of the Shariatpur district. The contract work includes 9.75km dredging, 0.089km end-termination and construction of 8 RCC concrete ferry terminals. The approval of the cabinet body came at a time when thousands have been rendered homeless in scourge of the Padma erosion in Shariatpur's two upazilas over the past three months. Jamalpur  A portion of the flood-control dam in the Uliapara area collapsed under the pressure of gushing waters of the Jamuna River, submerging hundreds of villages in the Islampur upazila of Jamalpur, reported Bishwajit Deb, our correspondent. The onrush of hill water from across the border for last few days deteriorated the flood situation in the upazila further, leaving thousands of people virtually marooned.  Seasonal crops on vast tracts of land were inundated by the floodwaters, said Upazila Agriculture Officer Shakhawat Hossain. Geo bags have been dumped into the area to protect the dam, said Water Board Sources. Gaibandha According to reports of our Gaibanda correspondent Md Tajul Islam, river bank erosion has taken a serious turn at different points along the Brahmaputra River bank in the Sundarganj upazila in the district creating immense sufferings to the victims of the erosion. Local sources said at least 500 families of the upazila became homeless in last few days and the erosion also devoured many academic and religious institutions including arable land. Besides, the inhabitants, who are living on the bank of the river, are terrified and anxious as the river might devour their homesteads and agriculture land any time. The river-eroded landless people who have taken shelter on the flood control embankment and other safer places are living in hardship; their sufferings knew no bounds. The Water Development Board Executive Engineer Mahbubur Rahman said emergency based measures have been taken to protect the dam and the victims.  Bogra  Nazmul Huda Nasim, our Bogra correspondent, said erosion of Jamuna and Bangali rivers has taken serious turn Bahuldanga, Manikdair, Dangorgacha, Gonokpara, Bheramara, Godagari, Malopara, Nizberubari, Paikpara, Machirpara and Bashhata villages in Sariakandi upazila. Water Development Board Executive Engineer Hasan Masud said the rivers crossed the 17cm danger level in the evening. Steps will be taken soon to stop the erosion, he added. Rajbari Erosion in the Padma River has taken an alarming turn in Rajbari, as it has already forced thousands of families, under the Sadar upazila, to leave their houses, while, with the fall in water level, villages within the district are becoming more vulnerable, said Kazi Tanvir, our correspondent. According to Water Development Board sources, the water level had started receding and the strong current started to erode the river bank, croplands, houses and other infrastructures. Some families, who had been living in makeshift houses on the embankment for the last few days, said they had been going through the days miserably and claimed that they were yet to receive any relief or assistance from the government.

      "text": "Date Published:2018-12-01 00:00:00      \nCongressman Jim Banks of Indiana State introduced the resolution in the House of Representatives on November 20 A resolution has been placed in the US Congress, calling on the Bangladesh government to stop radical organizations including Jamaat-e-Islami, Islami Chhatra Shibir, and Hefazat-e-Islam, who pose an on-going threat to the country's stability and secular democracy. Congressman Jim Banks of Indiana State introduced the resolution, titled \"Expressing concern about the threat posed to democracy and the democratic process by theocratic groups operating in Bangladesh,\" in the House of Representatives on November 20, according to the US Congress official website, reports BSS. The House Resolution 1156 has been referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the website says. The resolution called on the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the State Department to halt all partnerships and funding arrangements with groups affiliated with radical organizations, including Jamaat, Shibir, and Hefazat, reports UNB. The resolution said religious minorities were targeted by the BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami, and Islami Chhatra Shibir, during previous elections, as a result of which 495 Hindu homes were damaged, 585 shops were attacked or looted, and 169 temples were vandalized between November 2013 and January 2014. It also said Jamaat-e-Islami activists have been involved in recent attacks on religious minorities in Bangladesh. Mentioning that national elections are expected to take place in Bangladesh on December 30, 2018, the resolution called on the Bangladesh government to heed the Bangladesh Election Commission's request to ensure security for minorities and maintain communal harmony for a peaceful election. The resolution acknowledged the victims of the 1971 War of Independence and the spirit of secular democracy on which Bangladesh was founded. The nation of Bangladesh achieved independence in 1971 and established a secular democratic state, the resolution mentioned, noting that \"this freedom was won at the cost of approximately 3,000,000 deaths, more than 10,000,000 displaced, and 200,000 women raped, many at the hands of Islamist militants led by Jamaat-e-Islami.\" The resolution said repeated attacks on religious minorities, expanding religious intolerance, and growing destabilization caused by radical groups, including Jamaat, Shibir, and Hefazat; undermine economic and strategic interests of the US in Bangladesh. Meanwhile in a statement, Philadelphia-based think tank Middle East Forum (MEF) has welcomed the resolution, saying \"Jamaat-e-Islami is an influential and dangerous Islamist group with a long history of violence.\" In October, the Bangladesh Election Commission revoked the registration of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, a major ally of the BNP-led 20-party alliance, in compliance with a High Court order. In August, 2013, the High Court declared Jamaat's registration illegal following a writ petition filed in 2009 by Bangladesh Tariqat Federation's Secretary General Rezaul Haque Chandpuri and 24 others. In the petition, they said Jamaat was a religion-based political party and it did not believe in the independence and sovereignty of Bangladesh."

The death toll in Kerala state rose above 400 on Monday. With nearly three quarters of a million people packed into relief camps in the southern state, known for its tourist beaches and hill resorts, authorities also fear outbreaks of disease. After a week of fierce downpours, rainfall eased on Monday and flood levels have fallen in many districts. Army helicopters and boats kept up missions to find trapped survivors and drop food and water in isolated villages. Officials said 22,000 people were rescued on Sunday. At least 30 bodies were also found taking the death toll above 200 since the torrential rain started falling on August 8 and more than 400 since the monsoon started in June. Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the priority now was to provide clean drinking water and restore power supplies to the state of 33 million people. \"The total number of people taking refuge at the 5,645 relief camps has risen to 724,649,\" Pinarayi told reporters on Sunday. He said health officers would be deployed in each village to check the spread of communicable diseases. Thousands of army, navy and air force personnel have fanned out to help those stranded in remote and hilly areas. Dozens of helicopters have been dropping tons of food, medicine and water over areas cut off due to damaged roads and bridges. In worst hit areas such as Thrissur and Chengannur, rescuers are searching inundated houses where they have found the bodies of those trapped by the fast rising floodwaters. \"They didn't think that it would rise this high -- 10 to 15 feet at some places -- when the initial warnings were issued,\" said Ashraf Ali K.M, who is leading the search in the small town of Mala in Thrissur. Fishermen have sailed inland from Kerala's coast to join the search, as volunteers set up soup kitchens and an international appeal was made for financial help. Minister Pinarayi praised the fishermen for joining the rescue mission. The state government said each boat would get 3,000 rupees ($43) for each day of their work and that authorities would pay for any damage to them. The floods have caused an estimated $3 billion in damage but the bill is likely to rise as the scale of devastation becomes clearer. "

The embankment, with its various species of trees as well as gardens, an eco-park and houses, is on the verge of extinction as the monsoon rains speed up erosion. \"Just two weeks ago, part of a coconut garden of the beach was washed away by a tidal surge,\" said Patuakhali Deputy Commissioner Dr Md Mansur Ahmed, also president of the Kuakata Sea Beach Management Committee. Some green parks and farms are now under threat from erosion and natural disaster, he said, adding that \"necessary measures to save the beach should be taken as soon as possible.\" Locals have expressed their worry over the worsening situation. Development work has stalled despite various plans and projects to save the beach having been taken up by politicians since 2004, they said.  Md Abul Khayer, executive engineer of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) in Kolapara, said a project proposal involving Tk212 crore was sent to the Planning Commission in January this year for final approval, but the commission has only recently sent it back. \"As a result, the development works have stopped. But, the repair and development works of the dam have started,\" he added. Motaleb Sharif, general secretary of Kuakata Hotel-Motel Owners Association, said they were worried over the uncertain future of the much-sought \"Kuakata save and development\" project, as it would have led to the overall development of the tourist spot.  Local MP Alhaj Mahbubur Rahman said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has instructed the authorities concerned to take necessary measures for the development of Kuakata. \"There is nothing to worry about,\" he added."

He was arrested around 11am on Wednesday, Joint Commissioner of DB Mahbub Alam told the Dhaka Tribune. \"We had a warrant to arrest Dulu in a case lodged with Sher-e-Bangla Nagar police station,\" Mahbub said.  However, he did not disclose details regarding the case. On Tuesday, the Election Commission filed a petition with the Appellate Division against a High Court order that cleared the way for Dulu to contest the 11th parliamentary election.  The High Court order came after Dulu filed a writ petition against the returning officer's disqualification of his candidacy on Monday. Dulu, who filed his nomination papers for Natore 2 constituency, had his candidacy rejected for his conviction in a criminal case. The 11th general election is slated to be held on December 30. "

The program, dubbed \"Modicare,\" promises health cover worth $6,900 to every poor family to treat serious ailments. The scheme is expected to cost the central and 29 state governments $1.6 billion per year in total. Funding will be increased gradually according to demand. Modi handed medical cards out at the launch in Ranchi, capital of the eastern state of Jharkhand, calling it a historic day for India. He called the scheme \"a big step towards providing good quality and accessible healthcare to the poor of India. Over 100 million families will benefit.\" India's overburdened public health system is plagued by a shortage of hospitals and doctors and most people use private clinics and hospitals if they can afford to.  But a private consultation can cost $15, a huge sum for millions living on less than $2 a day. More than 60% of the average family's spending goes on medicines and healthcare, the government estimates. Experts have praised the latest programme but say it should have included primary day-to-day healthcare instead of just secondary and tertiary care for more serious and long term treatment. \"Modicare does not extend to primary healthcare, which, we believe, is the weakest link in the provision of public health in India,\" Rajiv Lall and Vivek Dehejia of the IDFC Institute think-tank said in a column for the Mint newspaper. \"The crucial point is that poorly delivered primary care inevitably increases the burden on health and finance at the secondary and tertiary levels down the line,\" they said."

Under this initiative, 300 crab farmers have already been trained in modern techniques. Speaking with the Dhaka Tribune,Sushilon Deputy Director Md Rafikul Haque said: \"The project to modernize crab farming was launched in August of 2016, and concluded on June 30 this year. \"The project, which had a funding of Tk1 crore, helped 350 farmers become self-dependent in Batiaghata upazila and Khulna sadar, Mongla and Rampal upazila of Bagerhat, and Shyamnagar upazila of Satkhira.\" Those who were trained have established themselves as entrepreneurs in the region, he added. Rafikul also said: \"Among the 350 entrepreneurs, 300 are crab farmers, 20 are in the furniture business, and 30 are involved in the ecotourism sector. Their average income has increased two to three times since training.\" Meanwhile, Senior Assistant Director of District Fisheries, Amal Kanti Roy said: \"In this region prawn and crab were being farmed in the same enclosures. This farming method negatively impacts the biological environment of enclosures, which in turn could affect the prawns. \"Under the circumstances, we had to change the farming method for both prawn and crab. Crab farming season usually begins in September and ends in February. Crab export is an emerging sector in Bangladesh, and there is a lot of opportunity in this field.\" Discussing the matter, a crab farmer in Batiaghata upazila, Ratan Sarkar said: \"We used to farm both prawn and crab in the same enclosures. As a result, prawn harvests were being affected by virus infections and crab harvests were impacted too. \"After the training, we modernized and separated the farming method, and the profits have become significantly larger. We can sell crabs 15-20 days after the spawns are released in the enclosures.\"  Echoing the same opinion, Upazila Fisheries Officer Ripon Kanti Ghosh told this correspondent: \"The salinity level in the water cannot be made adequate for both prawn and crab inside enclosures. We are putting an emphasis on farming locally sourced crabs in separate enclosures.\" Owner of crab export firm Sumaiya Sea Food, Md Musa Sheikh said: \"Crabs sourced from the Sundarbans have a huge demand in the international market, as they are much tastier. Farmers, who were trained under this project, are already making hefty profits. The government is planning to establish hatcheries to further develop crab farming in the region.\" On May 22 this year, Khulna University Fisheries and Marine Resources Technology Discipline (FMRT)  signed a deal on Wednesday with the Keya Group, a business conglomerate, to perform joint research aimed at developing the promising industry of crab farming in Bangladesh. Head of FMRT, Professor Dr Ghausiatur Reza Banu, signed the agreement with Keya Group's Senior Project Team Leader, Gias Uddin Talukder, at an event held in the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Academic Building around 3:30pm. Prof Dr Golam Sarwar and Prof Md Yusuf Ali of FMRT will conduct the research and the project will be funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. Findings from the research may be used to explore opportunities in crab farming and marketing. The research will also benefit people engaged in the industry. Data collected from the research could also be used as a scientific foundation and reference for setting high level government policies on the preservation of crabs and management of this industry. The researchers will also make an effort to reduce the dependency of crab farmers on nature. They will also focus on a sustainable method for farming crabs in hatcheries and the effective marketing of the product."

Arriving in Brussels, the leaders of Spain, Greece, Finland and Luxembourg all expressed support for Merkel's push to curtail \"secondary migration\" of refugees who arrive at the EU's southern border before heading north to Germany. Europe's longest serving leader has come under acute political pressure from her hardline allies in Bavaria, who are threatening to close their border to migrants if she can't work out a deal with Germany's European partners. That could trigger the collapse of Merkel's three-month-old government and cause the EU's control-free Schengen travel zone to unravel. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters that European solidarity on migration was vital, \"especially with Germany which is now suffering a political crisis.\" Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel added: \"There are so many people who arrived in different countries and then made their way to Germany. I understand when Germany says 'Why do we have to deal with everything?'\" Greece's Alexis Tsipras and Finland's Juha Sipila also promised to work with Germany on the issue. Earlier, speaking in the German parliament, Merkel called on European leaders to forge a common approach to migration, calling it a \"make or break\" issue for Europe, where right-wing, anti-immigrant parties are gaining strength. \"Europe faces many challenges, but that of migration could become the make-or-break one for the EU,\" said Merkel, whose 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees divided Europe and continues to haunt her at home. \"Now as then, I think that was the right thing to do,\" she told the Bundestag. Deeply divided According to draft conclusions circulated before the two-day summit, the leaders will agree measures to strengthen Europe's external borders, spend more on fighting illegal immigration and step up cooperation to prevent refugees and migrants from moving within the bloc. But leaders remain deeply divided over how to handle asylum seekers, with eastern European countries such as Poland and Hungary refusing to accept quotas of refugees while Italy and Greece struggle to cope with arrivals by sea. A deal among all 28 EU states is unrealistic, so Merkel is pushing for a \"coalition of the willing\" on migration. She hopes that will appease the Christian Social Union (CSU), which has hardened its line before of an autumn election in its home region of Bavaria, the main German entry point for migrants.  "

      "text": "Date Published:2018-08-15 00:00:00      \nOn August 7, a large part of Sadhur Bazar, located near the Padma River, suddenly collapsed around 2pm The body of a man has been found seven days after he was reported missing in the Padma river on August 7. The body of Al Amin, 27, was found in Meghnarchar, near the Haimchar area of Chandpur district on Monday. Nine others remain missing in Zajira and Naria upazilas of Shariatpur. On August 7, a large part of Sadhur Bazar, located near the Padma River, suddenly collapsed around 2pm. The sudden erosion initially washed away 29 people around a week ago, but 19 among them were rescued later, confirmed by Naria Upazila Nirbahi Officer Sanjida Yasmin and Naria police station OC Aslamuddin. The missing people are Shahjahan Bepari, 70, Mujibur Rahman Chhoiyal, 45, Gopi Bachhar, 55, Nasir Boyati, 18, Mosharrof Chokdar, 46, Nasir Hawladar, 35, Kamal Uddin Chhoiyal, 62, Antu Mogdom, 15, Abdur Rashid Hawladar, 36. The wife of a missing person named Mujibur Chhoiyal, Rabeya Begum said: \"My husband was a businessman. He was in the area during the sudden erosion. He has been missing since then.\" At least 1,000 people have lost their homes and belongings in the erosion. Many educational institutes along with Upazila Parishad and Upazila Health Complex are at the risk of being washed away by the erosion. Naria's municipality Mayor Md Shahidul Islam Babu Rari claimed that about 80% of the houses, in ward 2 and 4 of his municipality have been consumed by the erosion. He also said that it happened because of the negligence of the Water Development Board. Police and fire service personnel are still searching for the missing people. Commenting in the matter, DWDB Shariatpur Executive Engineer Md Shafiqul Islam said: \"Bangladesh Navy Institute Khulna ship yard has submitted tender for the construction of a stable defense dam surrounding an area of 8.9 km.\" He also said that the construction work will commence after the cabinet has assessed and approved the tender. The government had allocated Tk1,097 crore to build an embankment from Zajira's Kundarchar to Naria's Sureshwar on January 2 this year. However, Water Development Board sources told the Dhaka Tribune that construction of the proposed embankment will not start until the next dry season. Last year on September 11 at 5am in the morning, three launches anchored in the same area fell victim to the erosion and 16 people went missing. After a few days, two of the dead bodies were found."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-06-24 00:00:00      \nDissolved oxygen falls sharply, ammonia exceedingly higher Hundreds of dead fish of different species, and other aquatic animals have been found floating in the river Halda for the last couple of days. The dead fish are posing a serious threat to the aquatic biodiversity of Bangladesh's largest natural breeding ground for carp. According to the Department of Fisheries lab, the level of dissolved oxygen (DO) went below 1mg per litre on an average against the required level of at least 5mg per litre. According to the District Fisheries Office, the level of dissolved oxygen was found low in the two feeder canals of the river. In some points, the level of ammonia was found to be 0.5-1.5ppm against the tolerable limit of 0.01ppm. The high concentration of ammonia in water makes it difficult for aquatic organisms to sufficiently excrete the toxicant, leading to toxic build-up in internal tissues and blood, which leads to their death. Humans need air to breathe, and the aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to respire. It is necessary for the survival of fish, invertebrates, bacteria, and underwater plants. Dissolved oxygen is also needed for the decomposition of organic matter. Locals said the water of Halda River turned pitch-black on June 20, spreading the rotten stench of dead fish. Following the matter, the locals formed a human chain at Madunaghat area on June 23, demanding that the river be saved from industrial pollution.    Scores of dead fish surface as pollution imperils Halda River CollectedAccording to Halda River Research Laboratory of Chittagong University, as many as 20 species of fish, including Mola carplet (Amblypharyngodon mola), five species of prawn, Mozambique Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), Aer (Sperata aor), Rohu (Labeo rohita) Catla (Catla catla), Mrigel carp (Cirrhinus mrigala), Kalbaus (Labeo calbasu) Kuchiya (an eel-type fish), were found floating in the river. A Mrigal fish, weighing over 15kg, was also found floating in the river. Officials of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI), Halda River Research Laboratory of Chittagong University, Department of Fisheries (DoF) and Department of Environment (DoE) have already visited different spots of the river and its feeder canals.   The BFRI and the DoE also collected water samples for lab tests from different points of the river to find out the causes behind the death of such a large amount of fish. While talking to the Dhaka Tribune, noted Halda river researcher Prof Dr Manzoorul Kibria said the levels of dissolved oxygen fell sharply and the ammonia went up hundred times the tolerance level due to pollution.   \"Untreated effluents discharged from different industrial units from oxygen to Kulgaon areas, domestic waste and poultry bird excreta are responsible for the death of a huge number of fish species,\" Kibria said. \"Bamonshahi canal was blocked by Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) a few years ago. It should be opened without delay.\"  \"The DoE should a keep a vigil so that the industrial units keep the ETPs operative round the clock. A commission for conserving the Halda should also be formed\" Kibria, also president of Halda River Protection Committee, demanded.    Stating that Tk800 crore is earned from the fish of the river every year, he said: \"The river supplies water to around 6,500,000 people every day.  \"It is the living gene bank of pure Indian major carp. A huge number of people, including fry collectors and hatchers live on the spawns produced in the river. They will lose their livelihood if we cannot stop the rampant pollution.\"  Chittagong DoE Azadur Rahman Mollick told the Dhaka Tribune that the level of dissolved oxygen required for aquatic animals was not up to the mark.   \"We have collected water samples from different points for tests. Primarily, it seems that domestic wastes, which got mixed with other wastes after the recent flood in Chittagong, are to blame for the falling level of dissolved oxygen in the river.\" Also Read - Halda wears festive mood as brood fish spawn  \"We have collected water samples from nine points of the river and tested them in the lab in different parameters. In most cases, the level of dissolved oxygen was below 1mg per litre,\" Md Kamrul Hassan, senior chemist of DoE, Chittagong (Laboratory), said. \"Two teams of the DoE have visited different spots of the Halda. Based on the field visit, we have already compiled a report which has been sent to the higher authorities of the department,\" Sangjucta Das Gupta, DoE assistant director (Technical) of Chittagong Metro, said. The DoE official added: \"While developing a housing project located in Kulgaon area, Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) blocked Bamonshahi canal a few years ago. The household wastes used to find its way into the Karnaphuli through the canal. But both industrial and domestic waste are now being channeled to the Halda through Khandakia canal due to the diversion.\" \"The production at the industrial units adjoining the river remained suspended during the Eid-ul-Fitr vacation. So, there is no chance of industrial pollution behind the recent deaths of fish in the river,\" the DoE official said. Chittagong District Fisheries Officer Mominul Haque said they had inspected different points of the river for three consecutive days and witnessed different species of fish like major carps, prawns, eels, Tilapia, Rohu, and Aer floating in the river. \"To avoid such death of fish, the industrial units adjoining the river must install Effluent Treatment Plants and keep them operative round the clock,\" suggested the fisheries officer.      Originating in Khagrachari's Ramgarh upazila, the 107km-long river passes through Hathazari and Raozan upazilas before merging into the Karnaphuli River.   During April and May every year, different species of carp fish start migrating to the spawning ground of the Halda from rivers like Karnaphuli, Matamuhuri, and Sangu. "

According to Sirajganj Water Development Board and Tangail Water Development Board, a 7-km flood protection embankment was constructed in 2017 to protect the Simhanti area of Chowhali Sadar upazila and Tangail from the erosion of the Jamuna River. On Thursday night, however, the western part of the flood protection embankment in Chowhali upazila collapsed, dumping around 50 people into the water who then had to swim to the riverbank to save their lives. On Friday morning, Anisur Rahman sent a report regarding the intensity and impacts of breakdown of flood protection embankment in the area in the past one year  Tangail Water Development Board Executive Engineer Masudur Rahman said that after hearing about the matter, sandbags have been dumped to protect the embankment. Locals were also being moved from their houses."

New committees will be formed in areas where allegations of irregularities have been raised.\nAn official of the ministry said that the government took initiative to prepare the list to provide facilities to the freedom fighters that were dropped from the previous lists and those who were never included in them.\n\"We received about 170,000 applications online and later forwarded them to local committees for scrutiny. These committees recommended including more than 25,000 applicants in the list,\" the official said.\nBut later, the ministry started receiving complaints against many of these applications. Intelligence reports also found irregularities in the recommendations of the local committees. The process to prepare the list was halted on March 11.\nIn the last 47 years, the list of freedom fighters has been amended six times. During the same period, changes have been brought 11 times to the process to define freedom fighters and their age.\nThe National Freedom Fighters Council said a gazette was published on January 12 last year on forming 480 committees for scrutinizing freedom fighters. These committees started work on January 21 that year. Of them, 365 committees recommended 25,000 names for inclusion in the list.\nLiberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque has said that at least 100 of these committees provided faulty reports.\n\"Most of them did not follow the guidelines we recommended for including freedom fighters in the list. Only 10% of the recommendations are correct. That's why we have suspended activities of these committees,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, a large number of freedom fighters have been thronging the Jatio Muktijoddha Council (Jamuka) with applications and appeals. One of them is Nawaz Ali, a resident of Brahmanbaria's Bijoynagar upazila.\n\"I fought in Sector 3. My father Modhu Mia was killed by the razakars. Once I received a grant of Tk20,000 from the prime minister as a freedom fighter. But the local union commander did not recommend my name due to a family feud. That is why I have come to file an appeal,\" he said.\nResumption of FF list work to take time\nJamuka officials have said that the prime minister ordered preparation of the list to ensure that freedom fighters in need receive some facilities. But the process has been obstructed because of irregularities.\nComplaints began to flood in from various parts of the country as soon as work to prepare the list started. Local freedom fighters in Kurigram held a rally protesting the irregularities on December 21. They alleged that the local committee had made recommendations in exchange for money.\nThe work of the scrutiny committees was suspended on March 11 mainly because of these allegations. Ministry sources say the government is not rushing to prepare a list because of the upcoming national polls and the central freedom fighters command election.\nThe committees that have been accused of irregularities will be scrapped and work will resume with new committees in their places. The work will take time and the government is unwilling to take risks by hastily drawing up a list.\nJamuka Director General Mizanur Rahman said they have stopped the work on the list based on specific allegations.\n\"The committees ignored our request to provide information about freedom fighters in the categories we suggested. More clarity is needed. A decision will be taken later following a meeting,\" he said.\nMizanur said that an increase in facilities provided to the freedom fighters have enticed many people to be included the list. \"Numerous people were included in the freedom fighter list during the previous [BNP-led] alliance government even though they did not take part in the Liberation War,\" he said.\nLiberation War Affairs Minister Mozammel declined to comment when asked about the resumption of preparing the list.\n\"The committee will decide on it after holding a meeting. We wanted to include the freedom fighters who were left out. We assumed that 10,000 to 15,000 freedom fighters would be included in the list. But the work could not be done with clarity,\" he added.\nThe minister further said: \"We have information on the accused people. We will drop them when we form new local committees who will do the scrutiny.\"\nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-12-10 00:00:00      \nCongress is tipped to win in the western state of Rajasthan, scrape through in the central state of Chhattisgarh and is locked in a photo finish with the BJP in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are among India's biggest states Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is staring at election losses in big heartland states, polls show, suggesting that farm distress and a lack of jobs for growing numbers of young people could prove stumbling blocks for his re-election bid in May. India counts votes on Tuesday from five states that chose new assemblies over the past month, but exit polls show Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could lose the three most important races, while it has little presence in two smaller states dominated by regional parties. The loss would be the biggest for Modi's Hindu nationalists since they swept to power in 2014 general elections, followed by wins over the past four years in 22 of India's 29 states, on promises of thousands of jobs and a doubling in farm income. Politicians view state polls, though they are usually decided by regional issues, as a pointer to the mood of the BJP's traditional voting base, ahead of a general election that must be held by May. \"The results will set the tone for the 2019 election,\" said Sachin Pilot, a leader of the main opposition Congress party. Congress is tipped to win in the western state of Rajasthan, scrape through in the central state of Chhattisgarh and is locked in a photo finish with the BJP in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are among India's biggest states. \"The BJP has made a lot of tall claims about income, jobs etc,\" Pilot added. \"They came out with 28 slogans, 'Swachh Bharat' ('Clean India'), 'Make in India' and such, but how many were implemented?\" Modi remains the frontrunner for the general election, however, trailed in personal ratings by his main challenger, Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Modi promised to clean up India and turn it into a top tourist destination as well as lift the share of manufacturing in its economy to a quarter of gross domestic product, following the example of China. But it has grown only slightly, to 17%, with nearly all the ambitious clean-up programmes for cities and the river Ganges, as well as the Make-in-India campaign to build a domestic industrial base, largely unfulfilled. Anger over weak farm prices, slow growth in rural wages and small businesses hit by a new nationwide goods and service tax has also boiled over, provoking protests by tens of thousands of farmers in Delhi and Mumbai. Although the BJP might drop a few seats because of anti-incumbency sentiment, it was not losing everything, as some surveys forecast, said party spokesman GVL Narasimha Rao. \"They have underassessed the BJP,\" he added. \"They have done it previously too.\" Surveys often prove wrong, partly because it is tough to forecast the outcome of elections involving India's millions of voters. Hindu first Still, a poor performance could prompt the BJP to push its brand of Hindu nationalism harder, politicians and analysts say. \"The BJP campaign will focus on nationalism, Hindutva and corruption,\" said Shekhar Gupta, a political analyst, using a term that refers to the party's Hindu-first plank. Hindus make up about 80 percent of India's population of 1.3 billion, while Muslims are about 14%. Already hardline groups associated with the party have reignited their campaign for a temple to the god-king Rama at a site where Hindu zealots razed a 16th-century mosque in 1992. Thousands of Hindu monks and activists linked to the BJP gathered in New Delhi on Sunday in a show of force to back the temple. Hindu fringe groups have stepped up a campaign against the slaughter of cows, which many in India consider sacred, as vigilante groups target Muslims in the livestock trade. Modi is expected to try to recover political ground with giveaways in the next few months for small businesses and farmers, who make up a big chunk of voters. \"The state elections will be seen as a litmus test of Modi's popularity,\" said Simon Finch, fund manager at London-based Ashburton Investments. \"However, we would expect any blemishes to be met with a continuation of the populist measures increasingly evident during the past four years.\" If the BJP did well, that would be a further catalyst for the market, said Mike Sell, head of Asian investments at asset management firm Alquity, who sees Modi's economic measures, such as a unified goods and services tax, eventually paying off. \"Even if they did badly, they wouldn't make us do anything negative and we will use any weakness as a buying opportunity.\"  "

During Xi's historic visit to Dhaka in 2016, Bangladesh formally joined the \"Belt and Road Initiative,\" a drive which has already drawn the close attention of the world. Sharing her thoughts on development of Bangladesh-China relationship under the BRI, Prof Li Tao said the two countries can accelerate the feasibility study on Bangladesh-China Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and then start the negotiation accordingly. \"The FTA between Bangladesh and China can effectively reduce the trade deficit. This is very important,\" she said emphasising the importance of actively promoting the feasibility studies to that end. Bangladesh and China will complete the exchange of letters for zero-tariff treatment to 97% of tariff items exported from Bangladesh to China within a short time, to further boost the export of Bangladeshi goods to Chinese market, according to Chinese Embassy in Dhaka. Earlier, Chinese Ambassador in Dhaka Zhang Zuo said both Bangladesh and China have highly prosperous markets that attract businesspeople from all over the world. \"Faced with opportunities and challenges, we should join hands to become good partners of mutual benefits.\" Ambassador Zuo said Bangladesh and China should maintain communication and consultation, adhere to the basic principles of free trade, make necessary reforms to the World Trade Organization while fully taking into consideration the interests of all parties, and safeguard the developing interests and policy space of developing countries.  Prof Li Tao, who attended Cosmos Dialogue in Dhaka on Bangladesh China relations on Saturday, also shed light on how to deal with big powers and importance of Bangladesh's political stability and policy continuity. She also laid emphasis on overcoming administrative efficiency, social stability and investment in infrastructure and energy sector for faster growth of Bangladesh. \"We need to enhance cooperation in infrastructure sector,\" she said focusing on close cooperation in big infrastructure projects like airports in Bangladesh. Prof Li Tao also said China's investment in Bangladesh should promote the \"localization\" of projects, dock local labour and employment needs, truly benefit both sides, and earnestly increase local incomes. She also laid emphasis on strengthening exchanges in the personnel, media cooperation, cooperation in higher education and mutual recognition of academic qualifications. Appreciating Bangladesh-China longstanding friendly relations, the Chinese expert said similar development concepts of the two countries is the core of cooperation. In 2017, bilateral trade value between the two countries reached $16 billion, 5.8% higher than last year, with China remaining the number one 1 trade partner to Bangladesh, data shows. In the first 9 months of this year, the bilateral trade value stands at $13.9 billion, with a growth rate of 19.3% year on year, according to the Chinese Embassy."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-09-18 00:00:00      \nOf the total 1,502 hectares of forests area, about 793 hectares have been encroached The UN and other development partners must prioritize conservation of the environment that sustained heavy damage following the latest Rohingya influx, Bangladesh's forest minister said on Monday. Anisul Islam Mahmud told a high-level discussion  in Dhaka that although Bangladesh showed its hospitality by sheltering the Rohingyas, the influx has had a significant environmental impact on Cox's Bazar. \"The government has already extended its support and additional investment to restore the environment,\" he said while speaking as the chief guest at the launch of a UNDP report on the Environmental Impact of the Rohingya Influx. The report highlights the critical impacts of the influx of more than 700,000 Rohingya refugees on the environment of Cox's Bazar and recommends measures for mitigation, restoration and conservation.  Currently, the crisis affected population is almost 1.5 million, putting massive pressure on the already dilapidated environment of the district. \"A total of 4,300 acres of hills and forests have been cut down for temporary shelters, facilities and firewood in Ukhiya and Teknaf, threatening the biodiversity,\" the report said. \"Some of the key impacts will likely become irreversible if measures are not taken immediately.\" From 1,502 hectares of forest area, about 793 hectares have been encroached. Around 3,000 to 4,000 acres (1,200-1,600 hectares) of hilly land in the Teknaf-Ukhiya-Himchari watershed have been cleared of vegetation. The report identifies the collection of nearly 6,800 tons of fuel wood each month by the Rohingyas and use of 60 culms of bamboo on average to construct each Rohingya temporary shelter as the key causes for the encroachment.  Also, indiscriminate hill cutting for building Rohingya shelters is causing the hilly terrain to lose its natural setting, causing a potential risk of landslides. The report also identified thousands of shallow tube wells as threats to the aquifers. In addition, air pollution has risen due to increased vehicular movement and smoke from firewood while polythene bags and plastic bottles are all piling up in various parts of the area due to the lack of a recycling system. The study also addressed related gender-based issues and health risks due to the Rohingya influx. Sudipto Mukerjee, Country Director of UNDP Bangladesh, said the emergency is putting immense pressure on scarce natural resources, resulting in degraded natural forests, barren hills and an emerging water crisis. \"This situation demands immediate investments in restoring the environment and ecosystem as part of the Government of Bangladesh's response in Cox's Bazar,\" he said. \"Sensing the urgency for measures to prevent further degradation and to support early restoration, we, at UNDP, undertook this report with the aim that it would help development actors to program early and sustained response and funding. \"The UN system has stepped up with solutions like alternative fuel, solid waste management, and replantation, but the current investment is not adequate.\" The report recommends sustainable solutions and long-term effort for restoration and conservation.

The 12-year-old died around 6:45am on Wednesday, Muktamoni's father Ibrahim Hossain told the Dhaka Tribune.  Earlier on May 20, Ibrahim said the physical condition of his daughter was critical. Her namaz-e-janaza was held after the zuhr prayers. Later, she was buried beside her grandfather Azhar Ali's grave. \"She has been buried at our family graveyard,\" Ibrahim said. Muktamoni drew the nation's attention with an abnormally large right arm. On August 12, 2017 doctors at DMCH removed a 3kg tumour from her arm after a biopsy showed the growth to be in the artery of her hand. The girl later underwent three more consecutive surgeries on her right arm on August 29, September 5, and October 8, 2017. Muktamoni's mother Asma Khatun has become paralysed with grief Dhaka Tribune Muktamoni's father: There was no lacking in my daughter's treatment Muktamoni's father Ibrahim Hossain said he bears no grudges towards the doctors, or anyone, for his daughter's death.  Instead, he thanked the physicians and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for undertaking the responsibility of treating his 12-year-old daughter. \"Everyone tried their best for Muktamoni,\" Ibrahim Hossain said.  He added: \"There was no lacking in her treatment. I thank the prime minister and all those who came forward to help my daughter.\"Breaking into tears, Ibrahim also thanked the journalists of Satkhira and Dhaka for aiding Muktamoni from his home in Kamar Basha village in the south of Satkhira Sadar upazila. Her namaz-e-janaza was held after the zuhr prayers Dhaka Tribune \"Muktamoni stopped eating and talking since yesterday [Tuesday],\" said Ibrahim. \"But since she did the same thing twice before, we thought she would recover. But I did not think she would leave us.\" He talked about how Muktamoni agreed to go to the Sadar Upazila Hospital for blood tests on Tuesday, and later asked to drink water in the morning on Wednesday. When Ibrahim tried to comfort her, he realized that she had stopped breathing. Muktamoni's twin sister Hiramoni said: \"I wanted to go to school with my sister. But it will never happen now, as Allah has taken her from us.\" Muktamoni's mother Asma Khatun has become paralysed with grief. She only wants her daughter to call her \"mother\" once again. Police Superintendent Sajjadur Rahman, representative from the office of the District Commissioner Shah Abdus Sadi, representative from the office of the Civil Surgeon medical officer Dr Farhad Jamil, and Sadar upazila Chairman Asaduzzaman Babu were present with Muktamoni's family. Sajjadur Rahman said: \"Everyone, including the prime minister, tried their best to save Muktamoni. But we failed. We will continue supporting her family.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2018-12-25 00:00:00      \nGroup's demands include official recognition as an indigenous community The Dinajpur 6 constituency, comprised of Hakimpur, Birampur, Nawabganj and Ghoraghat, is home to more than 100,000 members of a small ethnic community.  Among those people, around 52,000 are voters, and the Awami League considers them their vote bank.  The community has reiterated their trust in the ruling party, but made a few demands, such as a special quota for the ethnic people, establishing education curricula in their mother tongue and increasing their quality of life. The ethnic community in this region suffers from a multitude of issues, including land disputes, unemployment and lack of official recognition as an indigenous community. Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, local leader of the ethnic community Michael Tudu said: \"There are around 50,000 voters in our community, but we suffer from many issues.  \"I am urging that effective measures be taken to meet our demands following the 11th general election.\"  Demands made by ethnic community Addressing these issues, another ethnic community leader Kerobin Hembrom said: \"The roads need improvement, but I want to thank the local lawmaker and the government for ensuring us a steady supply of electricity. \"I urge the local lawmaker to represent our demands to the government regarding the existing land disputes plaguing our community and ensure our rights as members of the ethnic community.\" 15th amendment Commenting on the 15th amendment of the constitution, Hembrom said: \"Following that amendment, we are no longer being recognized as indigenous people. This change further complicates our land ownership issues.  \"We identify ourselves as Bangladeshi, but we are not Bangali, we are members of the indigenous community. Our land is at serious risk of being seized by culprits.\" The 15th amendment was passed by the Awami League government on June 30, 2011, making some significant changes including scrapping the system of the caretaker government of Bangladesh, and incorporating article 23A regarding the restoration of culture of different ethnic sects, tribes, minor races and communities.  However, the constitution did not recognize them as \"indigenous people.\" Ethnic community members Victoria Tudu and Prodip Mardi pointed out they are ready to vote for the boat again, but they hope that their demands will be met as soon as possible. They added that the ethnic community is quite backwards in terms of education and employment, and if the government does not extend its support, the community will fall further behind.  Dinajpur 6 incumbent lawmaker and Awami League candidate contesting in the next parliamentary election Shibli Sadiq said: \"I and the government have always stood beside the ethnic community living in this region. \"We have made a serious effort to develop their quality of life. If elected again, I will launch a project to build a school for the ethnic children, where they will be educated in their mother tongue.\" He added that the unemployment issue suffered by the ethnic community will also be resolved by building a handicraft product factory in the region, and creating other employment opportunities."

How two bands finished sound check and performed their complete list of 'live' songs with a few requests thrown in the mix, is beyond me. The credit must go to the break night coordinator Archi Ananya, one of the leading organizers of IUB Ascension 2018 Cryptic Fate and Nemesis are two most popular bands of Bangladesh. It is very hard to find a person, among the current generation of Bangladeshis, who has not heard \"Cholo Bangladesh\" by Cryptic Fate or \"Kobe\" by Nemesis.  These two chart topping numbers of Bangladeshi music were played on the same amphitheatre of Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB) last Friday. The occasion was the ceremonial \"break night\" of IUB Ascension 2018, the biggest debate fest of South Asia this year. The break night is traditionally arranged to entertain the debaters for few hours, before the names of the teams going to knockout rounds are announced.  The concert was two hours long and each band performed for one hour each. How two bands finished sound check and performed their complete list of \"live\" songs with a few requests thrown in the mix, is beyond me. The credit must go to the break night coordinator Archi Ananya, one of the leading organizers of IUB Ascension 2018.  Let us attempt to grab a sense of the ambience. The amphitheatre's stage is big enough for both band and their equipments. Three wide steps lead to the central courtyard surrounding the stage. The head bangers naturally positioned themselves on the centre court. Some of the crowd sat on the steps. Behind the steps four replicas of space ships seen on \"Star Wars\" were hanging in midair.  The rest of the crowd was either standing next to the spaceships or the open balcony on the left of central courtyard.      Nemesis took the stage at exactly 7:00pm and finished sound check within 15 minutes. Their show lasted for 45 minutes in which they played some old hits like \"Obocheton,\" along with songs from their newest album \"Gonojowar.\" They finished their performance by 8pm with \"Kobe,\" that was requested off them from the very beginning by the crowd. Upon hearing the start of \"kobe\" the noise they made was deafening. Almost everyone present sang along with Nemesis and when they got off the stage, they were promptly flooded by debaters, adjudicators, volunteers and organizers, all with requests for selfies and autographs.  Nemesis began the break night of IUB Ascension 2018 However, the flood of selfie-and-autograph seekers were in a dilemma as Cryptic Fate began their sound-check soon after. The heavy metal band began the show with the heavy metal number \"Bhoboghurey.\" Then they played \"Bhore'r Opekkha\" with an assortment of old hits. There was one song that they have not played live anywhere else that I cannot remember the title off, as I was busy head-banging throughout their performance. As soon as they began the starting riffs of \"Cholo Bangladesh\" the cheers was probably heard all around Bashundhara residential area. I painfully realized the concert was about to end, but I sang along to it with as much pitch my voice can muster. So did everyone else. As soon as Cryptic Fate left the stage the audience was surprised to hear that there is one more performance in store, a mesmerizing fire-show that is fast becoming a trademark of IUB Ascension. The fire show had five spinners, and lit everyone's faces from time to time with fire breathing. Memories of fire-benders from the cartoon series \"Avatar\" were invoked. The rockstars have departed by then. The melancholy of an empty concert stage was slowly enveloping the amphitheatre. But the space ships remained hanging in midair. Shadman Faiyaz breathed fire to entertain people of IUB Ascension 2018"

They were speaking at a workshop titled \"Our Cities 2050\" at house building research institute (HBRI) auditorium on Sunday. The Urban Development Directorate, under the Ministry of Housing and Public Works arranged the day long program as part of observing World Cities Day which was on October 31. Eighteen research papers on urban planning were presented in the workshop in six separate sections at a time and 19 organizations from the government, NGOs and universities took part. Jahangirnagar University Department of Urban and Regional Planning Professor Dr Shafiq-Ur Rahman while presenting his paper said: \"We are taking and implementing various big projects like the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT), Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and so on. Along with these big projects we have to think about linkage projects also. We have to think how people will come to BRT and MRT stoppages and how will they go back to home from there without interruption.\" He proposed a rickshaw and bicycle ride sharing mechanism in this regards. Another professor from the same discipline Dr Akhter Mahmud has said: \"We are building one or two cities and allowing them to expand to an unlimited boundary. We should think about other cities and take plans in this regard, as well. Health, education and employment opportunities should be decentralized so that pressure on Dhaka decreases. \"We have many policies on decentralization which only exists in books but no real implementation is seen anywhere. We should implement decentralization policies if we want a proper urban development.\" Also at the workshop, Brac's Urban Development Program Head Hasina Mushrofa presented their achievements on urban development issues."

Many low-lying and char areas have already been inundated, worsening the district's overall flood situation, reports UNB. The internal road communication has been snapped due to flooding in many char areas, living people of many areas stranded for several days, said villagers. According to sources at Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) office in Kurigram, water level of Brahmaputra River was flowing only 1.46 cm below the danger level at Chilmari point and 2 cm below in Noonkhawa point. Dharla was flowing only 0.99 cm under the danger level at Bridge point, while in Teesta the water was flowing 1.6 cm below the danger level on Sunday morning. Water above danger level at 5 river stations Meanwhile, water is still flowing above the danger level at five out of 94 river stations monitored by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) across the country, reports BSS. Water levels marked rise at 53 river stations, fall at 38 stations and remained steady at one station, said a FFWC press release on Sunday. The water of Surma River is flowing 58 cm above the danger level at Kanaighat station while water of Kushiara River is flowing 19 cm, 27 cm and 20 cm above the danger level at Amalshid, Sheola and Sherpur-Sylhet stations, respectively. The water of Old Surma River is also flowing 36 cm above the danger level at Derai station, it said. The major rivers of the North-Eastern region - Surma and Kushiara - may continue rising in the next 24 hours and the existing flood situation in Sylhet district may slightly deteriorate. According to information of Bangladesh and Indian Meteorological Departments, there is chance of heavy to very heavy rainfall in northern and north-eastern region of Bangladesh and adjoining Indian regions in the next 24 to 48 hours. The water level of Brahmaputra, Teesta, Dharala and Ghaghot rivers in the country's northern region may also rise.  The Brahmaputra-Jamuna and the Ganges-Padma rivers are in falling trend while the Jamuna and Ganges rivers may continue falling trend. The Padma River is now only 12 meters away from the locality of Dangi village in Sadar upazila, Faridpur, threatening to inundate the entire village anytime UNB River erosion takes serious turn in Faridpur The devastating erosion by the mighty River Padma has taken a serious turn in the district's Char Bhadrasan upazila threatening the river-protection dam, reports UNB. The people of the upazila living beside the dam are passing days in fear of erosion. The river was only 12 meters away from the locality of Dangi village in Sadar upazila, locals said, adding that the river could inundate the entire village anytime. BWDB has spent around Tk4 crore for the development of the dam by building a concrete road on it. Moreover, some 26,130 sacks filled with sand were put beside the river bank in the affected areas in three phases. Wasel Uddin Sikdar, a resident of Dangi village, said river erosion worsened in the last seven days. \"It will not be possible to protect the main road of the upazila if necessary steps are not taken immediately.\" Char Bhadrasan Sadar Union Parishad Chairman Md Azad Khan said they have written to the higher authority describing the overall situation and were awaiting response. He said many establishments, including school, houses, madrasa and mosque, adjacent to the river bank will disappear in the river very soon if necessary measures to protect the dam were not taken immediately. BWDB Engineer Sultan Mahmud said a proposal under the sustainable dam protection project was sent to the concerned authority for saving around 2.5 kilometres of road. \"The repairing works will start soon after the approval of the project,\" he added."

This fruit perishes within a few days of ripening--and can no-longer be sold.  Guava is eaten raw and is rich in vitamin C and other nutrients. It is most popularly known as Bengal's apple. The fruit can be also used to make jam, jelly, and juice.  According to stakeholders, farmers and traders would be able to make a large profit if a cold storage or jam factory were established in the guava-rich district of Barisal.  Guava growers in Jhalakathi incur losses as there are no storage arrangements for the tropical fruit | Dhaka Tribune The district administration and Department of Agriculture Extension said a feasibility study is being conducted to build a cold storage facility in a village of sadar upazila. There are many guava orchards in Barisal's Banaripara, Pirojpur's Swarupkathi, and Jhalakathi sadar upazila. The fruit has been produced in the region for about 300 years.  Most of the guava orchards are located in Jhalakathi sadar upazila and the government has recognized guava as the prime commodity of the district. Guava is produced on 1,236 acres of land across 20 villages of Kirtipasha union of the district's sadar upazila.   There are 15-20 floating guava markets in orchard areas. Of these markets, Bhimruli market, under Jhalakathi sadar upazila, is the largest.  Guava growers in Jhalakathi incur losses as there are no storage arrangements for the tropical fruit | Dhaka Tribune This floating market has now become a tourist spot. Thousands of local and foreign tourists visit Bhimruli market to enjoy the scenery.  But no infrastructure has developed there for the tourists.  Jhalakathi Deputy Commissioner Md Hamidul Haque said they have already received funds from the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism and work will soon begin to construct rest houses and other facilities for tourists.  He said they have also taken initiatives to store the fruit.  \"We are also working to find private entrepreneurs to build a guava jam factory,\" the deputy commissioner added.  "

The approval was given at the 146th Ecnec meeting held at the National Economic Council (NEC) conference room in the capital with Ecnec Chairperson and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair, reports UNB. Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal after the meeting said: \"On Tuesday, we placed 20 projects at the meeting and Ecnec approved all of them.\" \"The total estimated cost of the 20 projects is Tk32,524.90 crore. Of the cost, Tk15,494.37 crore will come from government funds, while Tk11,656.27 crore from the funds of the organizations concerned and Tk5,374.26 crore as foreign assistance,\" he said. Of the 20 projects, 14 are new and the rest are revised ones. About the GDP growth, the Planning Minister expressed hope that it may reach around 8.25% in the current fiscal year. Under the Tk10,461-crore Ghorashal Urea Fertiliser Project, a new urea factory will be set up in Ghorashal with a production capacity of 9,24,000 tons per year. Currently, two factories in Ghorashal and Palash are annually producing 3,15,000 tons. About the project, the minister said the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) will, by June 2022 , implement the setting up of a granular urea factory adjacent to the existing Ghorshal  and Palash Urea Fertilizer factories in Narsingdi with a daily production capacity of 2,800 tons. Of the project cost, Tk1,844.19 crore will come from the government fund while the rest Tk8,616.72 crore from bidders. The new urea factory will be set up aiming to meet the growing demand of fertilizer and thus ensure food security in the country. According to the project factsheet, now the daily production capacity of two existing Ghorashal and Palash fertilizer factories has come down to 1,050 tons as most of the machinery of the two factories has become dilapidated.  The countrywide annual demand of urea is in between 2.6 to 3 million tons, but six fertilizer factories run under the BCIC can produce roughly 9,00,000 to 1 million tons.

      "text": "Date Published:2018-06-12 00:00:00      \nMany children in Sharankhola spend on average of three to four hours collecting shrimp fry each day. Once they collect around a thousand fry, they sell it to nearby Southkhali Bazar for around Tk1,200 for Bagda fry and 3,000 for Golda fry. Every year, when the fishing season hits it peak in the Sharankhola area of Bagerhat, people scouring the Baleshwar River for a good catch become a common sight.  At the riverbank, the Dhaka Tribune met Shimul Hossain, a young boy of eleven who was collecting shrimp fry with his mother.  Shimul usually studies at South Khuriakhali Primary School, located about one hundred metres from his fishing spot. On this occasion, however, the boy's mother, Nargis Akhter, said she had no other option but to take her child with her to collect shrimp fry. \"We are barely making ends meet without any savings,\" the 28-year-old said. \"I am struggling to cover the day-to-day expenses of my family, (so) where would I get the money for my children's education? \"Tuition is costly. The government is providing books free of charge, but children must be sent to private tutors for better education. I also have to give my children some money every day, so that they can have something to eat during recess at school.\" Nargis said many children in Sharankhola were working the river with their mothers, typically spending three to four hours collecting fry each day.  Once they collect around a thousand fry, they sell it to nearby Southkhali Bazar for around Tk1,200 for Bagda fry and Tk3,000 for Golda fry. \"I do not want my children to collect shrimp fry, but our life is not easy here,\" Nargis said. \"If I had an alternative means of income, I never would have let my son do this.\" Women and children of riverside villages illegally collect shrimp fry from the river and sell them to the fish farms during a certain season Dhaka Tribune Halimullah, 36, is a resident of Tafalbari who also makes his living as a fisherman in Sharankhola.  \"The fishing profession is getting more and more difficult,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. \"So I bring my children to the river and nearby canals to collect fry.\" Not only are the desperate families of Sharankhola taking their children out of school, the work they are being put to is not even legal. Bagerhat district Fisheries Officer Zia Haider Chowdhury told the Dhaka Tribune that the government had banned catching fry from rivers to protect certain species of fish. Sarankhola Matsha Chashi Samity (fish farmers' association) General Secretary Kamruzzaman Bulbul said that despite the ban, some shrimp farmers still buy fry from these natural sources if the quality is good, encouraging the continuation of the poaching. \"The shrimp and prawn populations have witnessed an alarming reduction in different rivers due to unchecked collection of fry,\" he said. Government records show that of the 7,330 families in Southkhali Union, around 4,600 are living in poverty. Nearby unions in the area suffer the same economic conditions. Southkhali Union Parishad Chairman Mozammel Hossain said the people of the area need more help from the state. \"The government provides 40kg rice per month to registered fishermen during the ban on Jatka (Hilsa fry) fishing,\" he said.   A common view in Sharankhola- children are busy catching shrimp fry Dhaka Tribune  \"However, the government is yet to take any steps for the benefit of those who collect fry from the rivers. All fishermen families should be brought under the social safety net programme, to curb child labour and illegal collection of shrimp.\" Executive Director of Voice of South Bangladesh, Md Shahidul Islam, pointed to the lack of alternative livelihood sources.  \"Unfortunately, there is no scheme for the betterment of the marginalized people of this area,\" he said, adding that no studies have yet been conducted to gauge the effects of unchecked shrimp fry collection. The director of Bangladesh Shishu Odhikar Forum, a network of 269 non-government organizations working for the children's rights, said that despite the economic hardships faced by the river families, forcing children to work is a punishable offence under the existing laws of Bangladesh. \"We urged the government that a fresh list of children and their family, who are collecting fry for a living, be made,\" Abdus Shahid Mahmud said. \"These families should be brought under the social safety net programme so that their children can have a brighter future.\" National Human Rights Commission Chairman Kazi Reazul Haque said any form of child labour is \"unacceptable\". \"The Sharankhola children have long been involved in child labour, and this has remained unaddressed for a long time,\" he said. \"I believe that the government has failed to fulfill its duty, and it should put more emphasis on social activities for curbing child labour.\" Around 276,000 hectares of land, 1.32 million fishermen, and 14.7 million fish farmers are currently associated with the shrimp farming industry in Bangladesh. Bangladesh Frozen Foods Exporters Association Senior Vice-President Kazi Belayet Hossain told the Dhaka Tribune that shrimp was the country's sixth highest exports earner, contributing 3.65% to the GDP of the country in 2017. \"Shrimp farming is the backbone of Bangladesh's frozen fish export industry,\" he said. \"In the 2016-17 Fiscal Year, shrimp worth Tk3,568 crore was exported.\" Despite these impressive figures, Shrimp Research Institute Chief Scientific Officer, Khan Kamal Uddin Ahmed, said only 17 of 57 state-owned hatcheries are currently in operation, leading to an acute crisis of fish fry among the owners of the enclosures.   \"These hatcheries are only able to supply 10-12 crore fry, against the demand of 600 crore Golda fry each year,\" he said.  \"This shortage forces fish farmers to depend on the natural source of fry. (Therefore) during the season, women and children of riverside villages illegally collect shrimp fry from the river and sell them to the fish farms.\""

      "authors": "Abu Naser Rayhan",
      "text": "Date Published:2018-06-21 00:00:00      \n15 minutes inside Dhaka's Venice  You might think of Venice when asked to name a town with picturesque waterways, but if it's a lovely view from the water that you want, you don't have to go much further than Dhaka. The juxtaposition of the two cities might sound rhetorical and in fact it is. However, if you dream of floating across a picturesque waterway in the chaotic Dhaka avoiding the city hubbub, you are in luck.  Hatirjheel, the lakefront in Dhaka which has been transformed into transportation medium for minimizing traffic congestion, now provides awater taxi service with a number of 14 vessels and is becoming an increasingly popular mode of transport as it is found to be cost effective, quick and quite scenic. Currently, the service runs on four routes - Gudaraghat in Gulshan 1 to FDC, Merul-Badda to FDC and FDC to Merul Badda and Gudaraghat. I decided to take the ride from the Gudaraghat point and bought a ticket to the FDC point that costs a mere Tk15. The queue was not too long as it was a holiday and I had to wait only 15 minutes for the boat to depart.  According to the Counter Master, the rush hour on a working day usually coincides with the office hours as most of the people living around the lakefront find it easier and effective to use the water taxi service. So, if you are in for a recreational ride on a working day, it's better to avoid these hours.  The vessels are of different sizes and capacities ranging from a minimum 30 people to as high as 90 on a busy day. I hopped into the waiting boat and my journey started right away. It was a hot summer day in the afternoon but the malodorous yet soporific wind on the lake made me forget the absence of a cooling system in the boat.  The short lived water ride turned out to be an amazing one as I kicked back on by seat, and travelled through the vibrant urban heart. The beauty of the colossal Hatirjheel Lake garnished with greenery and the massive architectural fixture clothed in dazzling lights looks larger than life when seen from the water. Although the stench from the polluted lake water hit hard and threatened to suffocate at the beginning, after a few minutes into the ride I got used to it, thanks partly to my adaptability but also to the distractingly beautiful express road, modern bridge and walkways of Hatirjheel. On a regular working day, it takes almost an hour to reach FDC from Gulshan using the usual road route. The waterway cuts the time in quarter.  The lake authority also has a number of 20 pedal boats (2 seater and 4 seater) for recreational rides. A thirty minutes pedaling on the scenic lake with your dearest one will cost you Tk150- Tk300 based on the capacity of the boat.  The water taxi ride in the lake is completely safe as the operating boats are made of unsinkable fiberglass. Moreover, life jackets and lifeguards are available on board in case of any emergency.         Even then, there are some major drawbacks to the service. Apart from malodorous water, the queues are long and each taxi waits 15 minutes extra for passengers to arrive before departing. Passengers also need to walk a fair bit from the landing location to the main road. Fourteen water taxis, which will soon be extended to eighteen, cruise the water body from 6:00am and 10:00pm every day. The service has brought a significant change to the transport service in the capital and is making a huge impact in the lives of commuters living around the lake travelling to Karwan Bazar, Moghbazar, Dilu Road, Eskaton, Bangla Motor and Tejgaon areas from Badda, Gulshan, Rampura, Khilgaon and other eastern parts of the city.  According to a project official, the service will gradually be expanded to Gulshan Lake through Baridhara and a new route from Gulshan Police Plaza to FDC is currently in talks.   If you want to take a water taxi ride in these summer months, be sure to avoid the rush hours, make an early start and enjoy the ambience of the quiet lake in the coolness of the morning before the temperatures rises and the crowds flood in."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-09-18 00:00:00      \nThe navy has fast-tracked construction of shelters and evacuation centres for 100,000 refugees and nearly three-quarters of the project is complete Bangladesh will next month start moving 100,000 Rohingya refugees to a remote island, disaster management officials said on Tuesday. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled on October 3 to officially open newly-constructed shelters for the refugees on Bhashan Char, a muddy islet that emerged from the Bay of Bengal in 2006. The plan is already behind schedule. Officials previously said they wanted to start moving refugees from overcrowded camps near the border with Myanmar to the island in June, before the monsoon began. The navy has fast-tracked construction of shelters and evacuation centres for 100,000 refugees and nearly three-quarters of the project is complete, a senior disaster management official said. Bhashan Char is located 21 nautical miles from Noakhali, 11 nautical miles from Jahajir Char, 4.2 nautical miles from Sandwip, 28 nautical miles from Patenga, and 13.2 nautical miles from Hatiya | Reuters  \"Initially, 50 to 60 Rohingya families will be relocated in the first phase beginning next month,\" said the official, Habibul Kabir Chowdhury. Bangladesh, a low-lying riverine country vulnerable to rising sea levels, is prone to tropical cyclones, especially in the Bay of Bengal between April and November. The island is one hour by boat from the nearest land but violent storms make the journey by sea dangerous or sometimes impossible. The plan to relocate refugees there was revived after 700,000 Rohingya Muslims, fleeing a violent crackdown in Myanmar in August last year, poured into southeast Bangladesh and overwhelmed existing refugee camps. Rights groups have warned the silty strip is uninhabitable and prone to flooding and other natural disasters, and urged Bangladesh to drop the idea. But the government pumped $280 million last November into transforming it into a habitable site.   A navy official said a three-metre-high embankment had been erected around the entire island to make it flood-resistant. \"We're ready to receive refugees,\" he said, asking for anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to the press. Secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, Shah Kamal, said the refugees would be able to access humanitarian relief on the island and receive training in skills such as fishing. Officials say refugees will not be forced to leave existing camps in Cox's Bazar, among the most crowded places on earth and prone to landslides, disease and other dangers. \"If we can ensure full humanitarian assistance to them, I don't see any reason why they won't come to the island. We'll convince them,\" said Habibul Kabir, the disaster official.       "

Nabanna is the celebration of harvest season in Bangladesh, usually celebrated with food and dance and music. It is also called a festival of food, as many local delicacies, like pitha, are prepared and shared. The festival is usually celebrated on the first day of the month of Agrahayan in the Bangla calendar. To celebrate the festival successfully, a meeting was held at the conference room of the Deputy Commissioner's Office on November 8, with Additional Deputy Commissioner (general) Md Ziaur Rahman in chair, reported BSS. The Khulna district administration have chalked up different programs with the theme \"Nabanna and Grameen Bangla,\" which includea rally, a fair, pitha festival and art competition for children. A colourful procession will also be brought out from the city's Shaheed Hadis Park at 8am, and a day-long musical soiree will also take place in the same venue.  The art competition will be held at the district Shishu Academy. Additional Deputy Commissioner Ziaur Rahman told BSS that the government had decided to observe Nabanna Utsab in a befitting manner, as the festival is a significant part of the country's cultural heritage."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-10-16 00:00:00      \nParty leaders are focusing their campaign activities on helping victims of land erosion The people of Ramgoti and Kamalnagar upazilas of Lakshmipur 4 constituency, near the banks of the Meghna River, have been struggling through natural disasters like flood and land erosion for the last few years. Thousands from this region batle with nature for their daily livelihoods. With the election ahead, to gain the support of the voters, candidates have focused their electoral campaigns on development work that will reduce the suffering of those affected by land erosion.  Candidates from the two major parties, the Awami League and BNP, and other heavyweight political individuals, have increased their contact with senior central leaders in the hopes of securing a nomination. At the same time, they are going door-to-door, asking for the public's votes. The main election battle in the Lakshmipur 4 constituency will ensue between the candidates of the Awami League-led 14-party alliance and BNP-led 20-party alliance.  Candidates from Awami League, BNP, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Jasa and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have started campaigning by attending different meetings and seminars. They have also started promoting themselves on banners and posters. Jasad, AL The first person to hoist the flag of independent Bangladesh, President of central Jasad ASM Abdur Rob was once elected as an opposition leader during the Ershad-led government. He became a minister under the Awami League government after winning the seat in the seventh election in 1996. Rob will participate in the coming election as well. However, in the 10th election held in 2014, Md Abdullah Al Mamun - the current MP from this constituency - won representing the Awami League.  Since then, Abdullah has been working towards the development of Ramgoti and Kamalnagar upazilas. The first phase of a 5.5km embankment project - approved by Ecnec and worth Tk1,349 crore - was eventually completed at a total cost of Tk2,000 crore.  Recently, during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to Lakshmipur, Abdullah got the approval for the allocation of the budget required to complete the second phase of the project.   Talking to the Dhaka Tribune, Md Abdullah Al Mamun said: \"The people from this region mainly demand steps be taken to prevent land erosion. To this end, the Awami League government has already finished the first phase of a project by spending Tk2,000 crore--and has promised to start the work on the second phase.\" Abdullah stated that the development that the Lakshmipur 4 constituency has achieved during the Awami League regime had not been achieved in the last 40 years prior. \"I had stayed, and will stay beside the people from this region,\" he said. Abdullah has been working with leaders and activists from each union and ward, of the Ramgoti and Kamalnagar upazilas, to ensure victory for Awami League, he told this correspondent. \"If I am nominated, I am certain of my victory,\" he said.  Another hopeful candidate, Managing Secretary for Relief and Disaster Management of central Awami League Faridunnahar Laili, is from Noakhali Sadar upazila. A freedom fighter, Laili is the former MP for the constituency's seat reserved for women.  \"I have been engaged in politics since I was a student,\" Laili told the Dhaka Tribune. \"I was twice elected as the vice-president of Shamsunnahar Hall in Chittagong University, and formerly represented this constituency, from the reserved seat for women, in Ramgoti upazila.\" Laili said the people of Ramgoti upazila want her to clinch a nomination, and if the prime minister thinks she is worthy of one, she will run for election this time around as well. The other Awami League candidates hoping to get a nomination are: Azad Uddin Chowdhury, locally known as the \"landless leader\"; Vice-President of Lakshmipur district Awami League Advocate Mahbubur Rahman; Joint General Secretary of Dhaka city Jubo League (North) Md Tabirul Haque Onu; and Deputy Secretary of Awami League Sports Committee Abu Zaher Saju. BNP This year, twice-elected MP and central BNP leader Ashraf Uddin Nizam is hoping to secure a BNP nomination. \"The people of Lakshmipur know about my honesty and capability,\" he said while speaking to the Dhaka Tribune. \"I have broken all previous records in developing the roads and infrastructure of Lakshmipur. Even now, I am thinking about helping the victims of land erosion.\" Nizam is prioritizing his efforts in fighting the cases lodged against 5,390 BNP leaders and activists.  \"If BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia or acting chairman Tarique Rahman thinks I am worthy, they will nominate me, so I can continue working for the betterment of both party and the people,\" he said.  Another BNP nomination-seeker, central President of Sechchasebak Dal Shafiul Bari Babu said he is working to recover the democracy envisioned by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia. \"I was involved with Chhatra Dal politics in my student life,\" he told this correspondent. \"After acting as the president of Dhaka University Chhatra Dal and the organizational secretary of the central committee, I am now serving as its general secretary.\"   He hoped that his desire to recover democracy by participating in the next election will secure him a nomination for the Lakshmipur 4 constituency. Meanwhile, Vice-President of Tati Dal Abdul Matin Chowdhury, another hopeful candidate of BNP, has established mosques and madrasas, and helped distribute aid among those who have lost everything due to land erosion. \"There have been 30 cases falsely lodged against me in Dhaka, but I am still continuing my political career,\" he said. \"I am hopeful my efforts will be recognized by the party, and I will be given a nomination.\"  "

      "text": "Date Published:2018-12-21 00:00:00      \nGroups like Hefazat and Jamaat are slowly starting to lose significance in politics Earlier this month, as the coalitions for the upcoming battle on December 30 took more solid shapes, a curious feature became apparent. There are about 70 Islamist political parties in Bangladesh, 63 of them are now with the Awami League-led coalition, while only five are part of BNP-led alliance. The massive irony of religious parties flocking under the wings of the \"protector\" of secularism in Bangladesh, could not escape even the most obtuse. However, as the popular saying goes, it's not how many Islamist parties you have got, it's about which Islamists you have. Once again there is the gnashing of teeth, rending of garments from the usual suspects about the fact that BNP has given nominations to leaders of Jamaat. Once again, BNP acted as the last shelter of evils that stand between Bangladesh and all that is good. However, the massive gathering of Islamic parties under the ruling regime generated furious alarms in the sincerer quarters also. They are regarding this as a definite sign of the inexorable Islamization of politics and society. The mullahs are not just coming, they're here. I think that political developments in recent years in Bangladesh, and also in the Muslim world, are showing that political Islam is not a rising tide but may be an ebbing flood past its peak. Shafi Huzur and Hefazat accepting the patronship of the ruling party and joining the coalition show that ambition of madrassa-based organizations has remained at the bread and butter level. They do not aspire to take charge of the large and complex polity, of whose gears and levers they have little understanding. Jamaat, the Islamic organization that has ambition of achieving reigning power one day near or distant, is now a shell of its former self. The braggadocious Jamaat of the 90s and early 00s, when it claimed that the dedication and professionalism of its members made Jamaat sui generis of political organizations in Bangladesh, is no more. Its pantheon of top leadership has been annihilated, the vaunted member-base couldn't do anything to stop it despite suffering grievously in all-out efforts. Jamaat rank and file are confused, shell-shocked still. Obtaining state power, always a long-term ambition, has been postponed indefinitely into the future.  Nothing could display the inherent disarray of Islamic forces within Bangladesh more starkly than the chaotic-but-deadly clash of Tablig factions that occurred on the first of December. Tablig, which was mostly known for its detachment in this world in preparation for the next, showed that it can be as scrappy as any other organization when fighting over worldly possessions. All these recent incidents only underscore the fact that nobody in Bangladesh regards political Islam ready for taking up governance any time soon.   In this age, one cannot separate the domestic from the international, especially for movements with global pretentions like political Islam. Internationally, we are also witnessing an ebbing of Islam's march on political power. In Egypt, brutal state repression has broken and scattered the Muslim Brotherhood (MB), the global organization with which Jamaat have a long-standing affinity.  It's not that MB is going away in Egypt or in other Arab countries, it is still the main non-government political organization in most of these countries. It is that MB supporters throughout the middle east and the world are introspecting why the suppression of the organization was so successful. Why they couldn't raise a groundswell of popular support for them and against the traditional rulers. In Tunisia, the main Islamist party, Ennahda, has compromised so much on secular governance that it is hardly distinguishable from a mainstream conservative party, rather than a political Islam project. In Turkey, the Erdogan regime is increasingly transforming into strongman populism rather than embarking on political Islam.  A common theme behind the evolution and current state of MB and all affiliated organizations in various countries is that, while they invested decades in developing organizational and theological support, they did not invest in developing any form of \"governance thinking.\" More honesty, more justice, more welfare, these platitudes do not make coherent political and economic thoughts capable of dealing with the modern world. Unlike capitalism, liberalism, East-Asian authoritarianism, or even populist nationalism, political Islam has not yet been able to present successful governance systems. No rational leader or thinker in the Muslim world try to inspire fellow countrymen. There is no denying that religion is becoming more important and influential in Muslim societies all over the world. However, political organizations are discovering that support for religious principles and identities do not automatically translate in to support for religious politics, policies, and organizations. Most Muslims, in the modern world, also generally render unto Caesar things that are Caesar's, and unto Church the things that are Church's. This article has so far been full of gross generalizations. After Fukuyama's debacle, no one should be unaware of how tenuous it is to extrapolate current trends into long-term projections.  However, it is not shaky to argue that institutionalizing Islamic organizations into regular politics, particularly when they are weak and small, is a better way for the development of Muslim polity than excluding them or confining them into unconventional politics. Political organizations don't just dabble in politics -- politics also make them. The crucial thing is the way of doing politics.  Shafiqur Rahman is a political scientist."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-01-19 00:00:00      \n\nWe do not have a choice but to fight: The story of a Bangladeshi-American dreamer\n\n\n\n\nBrajesh Upadhyay, Washington\n\n\n\n\n Published at 01:01 pm January 19th, 2018\n\n\n Last updated at 06:57 pm January 19th, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nNayim Islam vividly remembers that morning when he woke up to the sound of his wailing mother. She was on the phone and had just learned that her father, who she had not seen for 18 years, was no more.\nHe remembers how heartbroken she was, not able to see him one last time. For Nayim, then a college sophomore studying Biology and hoping to pursue a career in medicine, the morning was \"a turning point in life.\"\nNayim's family had made a tough choice when it moved to the US from Bangladesh on a visitors visa stayed on as undocumented immigrants. It was a one-way ticket with the hope for a better future.\n\"I remember feeling very guilty after realizing that all her sacrifice may not amount to anything. Without documents, I still won't be able to achieve that American Dream my parents had for us,\" he says.\nHe says that moment of feeling \"helpless and powerless\" propelled him to speak out without being afraid and become a community organizer.\nHe earned a degree in Biology and now works full-time as a community organizer with Desis Rising Up and Moving (DRUM), an organization focusing on immigrant rights of the South Asian community in New York City.\nThis was possible because of an Obama-era programme -- Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA -- that allowed nearly 700,000 immigrants, who came to the US illegally as children, to stay and work legally.\nPresident Trump has rescinded that programme and asked the Congress to find a legislative solution by March 5, failing which people like Nayim may have to return to the countries they came from or go back to living in the shadows.\nWhile the majority of the DACA recipients, also known as \"dreamers\", are from Latin American countries, at least 2,640 are from India and 490 are from Bangladesh. Nayim says the actual numbers of South Asians is much higher but because of the stigma and shame attached to being undocumented, a lot of people did not come forward.\nAlso, he says, a large number of South Asian community members did not apply for DACA because they were concerned about sharing information about the whole family with the government.\nDespite the risks, DACA changed lives for the better.\nNayim says the first time he got on a plane after coming to the US was after DACA. Many people were able to fly back to their home countries to see their families. It was only after DACA that people like him with college degrees could get \"on-the-book\" jobs.\nTrump's order has put not only that freedom at risk but also left the families worried because once DACA is cancelled, they do not know what the administration will do with the information they have about undocumented families.\n\"We do not have a choice but to fight,'' Nayim says, adding, \"even DACA was not given to us by President Obama without a fight.\"\nNow, along with several other Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Indians, he spends his time organizing rallies, putting pressure on lawmakers and mobilizing the South Asian community to come out.\nA recent poll found that 83% of Americans and 67% Republicans support allowing immigrant young people to remain in the US under the DACA programme.\nBut there are also many who say the government should abolish it once and for all so that in future nobody takes immigration laws lightly.\nResponding to the concerns, Nayim says: \"Leaving home and family for 20-30 years is not a choice someone makes easily or for fun. Most of the time, they do it for survival.\"\nDemocrats are threatening a government shutdown from this Friday, the deadline to pass the federal spending budget if no agreement is reached before that.\nThe Trump administration has been pushing for funding for a wall along the Mexican border in return for DACA. And so despite the looming shutdown, no deal seems to be in sight for now.\nThis article was first published in banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-10-07 00:00:00      \nThe four semi-finalists - Palestine, Tajikistan, Philippines and host Bangladesh - arrived in the city Sunday afternoon after concluding the group-round fixtures in Sylhet Cox's Bazar is almost ready to host international football after eight years as the two semi-finals of the Bangabandhu Gold Cup are all set to be held on consecutive days at the oldest stadium of the district named after Bir Sreshtha Ruhul Amin. The four semi-finalists - Palestine, Tajikistan, Philippines and host Bangladesh - arrived in the city Sunday afternoon after concluding the group-round fixtures in Sylhet. It was learnt from a quick visit to the venue that the stadium has the capacity of making arrangement for not more than 10,000 spectators. The number is too small compared to Sylhet District Stadium that hosted more than their capacity of 30,000 during Bangladesh's final group stage match against Philippines Friday. The people of Cox's Bazar are eagerly waiting to watch Bangladesh's semi-final against favourite Palestine Wednesday.  Host Bangladesh put up a brave and dominating display but yet conceded a narrow 1-0 defeat against a much higher-ranked Philippines side in their final Group B match of the Bangabandhu Gold Cup at the jam-packed Sylhet District Stadium Friday evening.https://t.co/46EHiUAGag#BFF Sylhet District Sports Association vice-president Bijon Barua, also a BFF executive member, informed that giant screens will be set outside the stadium to meet the demand of deprived crowds. The stadium, situated at the heart of the city and less than two kilometers east of the world's largest sea beach, was built in 1956 through initiatives taken by renowned scholar and archaeologist Abul Kalam Mohammed Zakaria.  The revered scholar was posted as SDO in Cox's Bazar during that period, but instead of receiving funds from erstwhile Pakistan government, the local people spontaneously contributed in raising the funds. The locality had been popularly known as Stadium Para since then.   Popularly known as Cox's Bazar Stadium, the venue was renovated three years ago with the former two-storey main building converted to four-storey and new single row gallery was also built on the eastern side but it is still not enough.  The Sylhet District Stadium the venue for group games of Bangabandhu Gold Cup, would be remembered for an unreal scene four years ago when spectators broke the gate to get inside the venue during a friendly between the U23 teams of Bangladesh & Nepal.https://t.co/Z2qzLrkM9p#BFF The local organisers have been asking for expanding the gallery, installing flood-lights and building a gym for a long time but those pleas fell into deaf ears. Last time an international match or tournament was held in the venue was back in 2010 during the inaugural Saff Women's Championship.  After that the home matches of Chittagong Abahani Limited in the Bangladesh Premier League were held for only a season.  The venue usually hosts cricket and volleyball events as well, along with its outer field on the south-western corner used for indoor events like karate, taekwondo and wushu among others. Cox's Bazar DSA football secretary Rashed Hossain Nannu also informed that the procedure of preparing the venue for hosting the two vital fixtures of Bangabandhu Gold Cup began on September 22, a day after the end of the district round matches of Bangabandhu Gold Cup U-17 Football Tournament.  Through a rally, a motorcycle showdown and a band party, a group of around 500 fans of home boy Biplo Ahmed continued to fill the south-western gallery of the Sylhet District Stadium during Bangladesh's second Gold Cup group match against Philippines.https://t.co/HBVDdIb1Ha#BFF The preparation continued till Sunday. Bijon talked about their final touch of the preparation.  \"The preparation is 80% done with two days left, mostly the ground works. The main problem for us now is preparing the two practice venues. The recent rain harmed the grounds. We got only 15 days, we tried our best but I'm happy with the preparation so far,\" said Bijon. He added, \"Hope it will catch the attention during the two international matches that Cox's Bazar football deserves more. The stadium badly needs an upgrade. To start with, we need a gallery, flood-lights and a gym at least.\" Meanwhile, Philippines and Tajikistan face each other in the first semi-final Tuesday before Bangladesh take on top-ranked Palestine the following day. It will be the first time that men's international football matches will be held in Cox's Bazar."

The Awami League Publicity and Publication Sub-Committee, on behalf of the party, formally inaugurated the election campaign for the 11th parliamentary election. Hasan Imam, Shomi Kaiser, Zahid Hassan, Aruna Biswas, Simon, Mahfuz Khan, Shakil Khan, Rokeya Prachi, Ajmeri Haque Bandhan, Tarin Jahan, Sweetie, Raisul Islam, Tareq Sujat, and singer SD Rubel were present. Sports personalities Abdul Gaffer, Satyajit Das Rupu, and Badal Ray also joined the campaign. Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader, speaking as the chief guest, said: \"The response for Boat from the general public seems like 1971. The participation of the cultural personalities added a new dimension to the campaign for the polls. The defeated forces of '71 will be the losers in the upcoming election, because of the participation of the masses.\"Prominent actors Mahfuz Ahmed and Zahid Hasan endorse the Awami League during an election campaign at Dhaka's Central Shaheed Minar on December 13, 2018 | Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune Referring to the campaign as a matter of spirit and passion, he said: \"This consciousness has come here because of emotional values. Awami League will be the winner in the next election.\"  He called for the people to avoid the defeated power of 1971 as they can't win the elections in 2018. Distinguished playwright Hasan Imam, speaking on behalf of the artists present, said: \"We are always on the side of Awami League, because Awami League favours the freedom fighters. In addition, the struggles of artists began with the political struggles in 1971. The artists played a vital role in the Liberation War.\" Awami League Publication Secretary Dr Hasan Mahmud was also present at the program. The day's program at the Shahid Minar began with the national anthem. Later, a documentary on the various development activities of the government in the last 10 years was screened.  A video on the violent activities of BNP-Jamaat to foil the trial of war criminals was also screened."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-11-23 00:00:00      \nThe constituency is considered an Awami League stronghold Madaripur 1 constituency consists of 19 unions and one municipality.  It is known as Awami League's vote bank and comprises a total of 238,523 voters.  Despite the ruling party possessing a large vote bank, and a stronghold, in the area, they will face tough resistance from BNP. Local BNP supporters believe that they are prepared to infiltrate Awami League's vote bank. According to them, if the election is free and fair, BNP's candidate will surely win. MP Nur-E-Alam Chowdhury Liton is Awami League's sole candidate for this seat. In contrast, six people have bought nomination forms from BNP; to contest in the upcoming general polls for Madaripur 1 constituency. Meanwhile, with sole nomination-aspirants, for both Jatiya Party and Islami Andolon Bangladesh, are campaigning in the area. Awami League going solo Incumbent lawmaker and Awami League Parliamentary Committee General Secretary Nur-e-Alam Chowdhury Liton, is the likeliest candidate to receive Awami League's nomination. He is the eldest son of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's paternal brother--the late Ilias Ahmed Chowdhury. He has been elected as a Member of Parliament five times from 1996-2014-- and has extensively developed the Shibchar area. Nur-e-Alam Chowdhury said: \"I belong to a political family. I grew up being the politics of Awami League. I have worked in every union and ward-level committee of Awami League in my constituency. Development has touched every corner of Shibchar. I would like to finish the remaining list of development for Shibchar using the boat symbol in the upcoming general polls.\" Several BNP candidates  Shibchar's BNP is divided into two factions.  One group is led by Acting President Yazem Hossain Roman. Acting President Zaman Kamal Nuruddin Mollah leads the other faction. They both conduct party activities separately in the constituency. However, Zaman has bought BNP's nomination form to contest in Dhaka 17 constituency. Shibchar Upazila BNP acting president Yajjam Hossain Roman and the remaining 5 nominees are fighting to secure the party's nomination to contest in the upcoming general election. They are: Shibchar upazila BNP acting President Yajjam Hossain Roman, present Central Chatra Dal Vice-President Md Abdul Hannan Mia, late BNP leader Nazmul Huda Chowdhury's wife Nadira Mithu Chowdhury Dhuri, district BNP member Sajjad Hossain Siddiqui Lavlu, former Shibchar thana BNP President Abu Zafar Chowdhury, and Dhaka Demra BNP leader Rob Hawlader. Nomination-aspirant Yajjam said: \"I have been involved with BNP's politics since my student days. I am conducting rallies and have started my election campaign in every ward with regard to almost all the local BNP leaders and activists. If the party decides to nominate me, I will make sure that BNP wins this seat in the upcoming general election.\" Another BNP nomination-aspirant, Sajjad, said: \"I have been working quietly with grassroots-level local BNP activists and supporters. I am quite confident that I will be nominated. If the election is fair and free then BNP will win for sure.\" Abdul said: \"I bought BNP's nomination form to contest for Madaripur 1 constituency. Hopefully, the party will nominate me so that I can gift our party a win from this constituency.\" Meanwhile, Nadira is also working hard to secure BNP's nomination. She said: \"I have been campaigning in Shibchar for the general polls. I have distributed relief among the flood-affected people in the area--from my private funds. I am quite confident of winning if I am nominated by the party. I will work for the development of the area unlike anyone ever has.\" Other parties Jatiya Party's young leader, Madaripur district Jatiya Party Vice-President Jahirul Islam Mintu, is also campaigning for the upcoming 11th parliament election.  He has participated in multiple party activities--including meetings with senior party leaders and activists in the upazila.  Despite him being very young, he is on the party's list of prospective candidates as he has been working relentlessly for the local people of Madaripur. Concurrently, Madaripur District Islami Andolon Bangladesh Committee has declared Hafiz Zafar Ahmed as their candidate for the upcoming general polls. He is the president of the party's Shibchar upazila committee."

A 60-70 foot section of the embankment failed on Sunday afternoon, causing the flooding. Locals have expressed fears that the next tidal surge could cause the flood to worsen. Local UP chairman Abu Hena Shakil said the embankment was already at risk, and despite the BWDB being notified, they took no action. \"As a result of the recent new moon, the current of the Kholpetua river increased greatly. This has already caused a number of problems, such as trapping 50 families and causing hundreds of fish enclosures to be inundated. If the embankment is not repaired quickly, the flood will get more severe over time,\" he added.  \"Seeing the state of the dam and the nonchalance of the authorities, locals tried to repair the dam itself. However, despite a monumental effort, the embankment failed after a great surge in the afternoon,\" Shakil said. The UP chairman also said: \"No one from BWDB has inspected the area yet, but a contractor has been hired and repairs are supposed to begin after the new moon.\" Assasuni Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Maffara Tasnin said: \"We have asked the district administration to assist in the repair of the dam, and it will be done soon.\""

The funds will be disbursed through the Korea International Cooperation Agency (Koica), the government's organization for delivering assistance to developing countries, read a joint press release by WFP and Koica. The Building Resilience to Achieve Zero Hunger (BRAZH) initiative aims to reach over 4,000 families living in flood-prone areas, in the Kurigram Sadar and Chilmari sub-districts of Kurigram district, in the northwest of the country from 2018 to 2021. WFP, with the help of Koica, will be able to pilot a series of innovative approaches to resilience-building, including micro-insurance products to protect smallholder farmers and day labourers; forecast-based financing models to disburse aid before a predicted weather disasters; and seasonal livelihood planning to develop climate-resilience options. These activities will be conducted in close partnership with the Bangladeshi Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, the Department of Disaster Management, local government, as well as national and international technical institutes. This partnership with Koica follows the successful implementation of the three-year Saemaul Zero Hunger Community Project from 2014 to 2017 with a contribution of US$3 million. For this project, communities engaged in disaster risk-reduction work received cash grants and allowances to build their economic resilience. \"These activities were designed based on the Saemaul Undong principle of self-help, diligence, and cooperation--with participation and contribution based on Korea's community development experience,\" said Koica Country Director for Bangladesh Joe Hyungue. Koica was established as a government-funded agency dedicated to grant aid programs in April 1991. The organization strives to combat poverty and support the sustainable socio-economic growth of developing countries--based on core values of promoting peace, people, and prosperity."

It was part of a session, titled \"Health and Migration,\" of the inaugural day of the 4th Annual Gobeshona Conference for Research on Climate Change in Bangladesh (Gobeshona 4), organised by the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD).\nThe four-day conference is being held at Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB).\n\nAlso Read- Experts: Haor regions need short-duration rice varieties to avoid crop damage in flash flood\n\nAnother presentation by Mohammad Mahbubur Rahman, a fellow of Gobeshona Young Researchers Program-2017, noted that growth in the urban population caused by internal migration can cause further issues such as increased contamination of water.\nEarlier, during the inaugural session, Executive Director of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS) Dr Atiq Rahman emphasized taking up quality research on climate science for higher adaptability to the threats of global warming.\n\"Ten years ago, nobody believed solar energy would be possible, but the solar industry in Bangladesh has since gone to become one of the biggest in the world. It's necessary to connect climate science researchers to the policymakers and recognise that the private sector also plays an important role. But their focus is split between people, planet and profit,\" Atiq observed.\nVice-chancellor of IUB, Dr M Omar Rahman said that research required for innovative solutions to complex problems.\n\"Developing countries face a problem of not having a culture of research and lacking the infrastructure of research. Often thought the way we teach young researchers is quite archaic,\" said Dr M Omar Rahman.\nThe inaugural session's keynote speaker, Institute for Research into Superdiversity (IRIS)Research Fellow Dr Alice Baillat Elsa Helene, said that Bangladesh, on the one hand, is depicted as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and, on the other hand, as one of the champions of adaptations.\nTerming Bangladesh as \"Weak Power Climate Leader,\" Dr Alice Baillat Elsa Helene said, \"The concept of weak power pushes us to change our perception of vulnerable countries that are far from being only victims, but also active players of the fight against climate change.\"\n\"Bangladesh has been the first least developed country to frame a comprehensive climate change strategy and action plan, national climate fund in 2009,\" she said, adding that vulnerability has been a fertile ground for innovation and experimentation where Bangladesh has acquired a \"first mover advantage\" in being the first to develop adaptation and disaster risk reduction policies.\nIn the opening speech of the inauguration programme, Director of ICCCAD, Dr Saleemul Huq, introduced Gobeshona as a knowledge-based platform, and explained how it brings together scientists, researchers and policymakers.\n\n\n\n\n"

Police said they expected the bomb at George V Dock in east London would be removed by early Tuesday, having set up a 200-metre exclusion zone after the ordnance was found during work at the airport on Sunday. The Metropolitan Police said properties within the exclusion zone had been evacuated and a number of roads were cordoned off. \"The timing of removal is dependent on the tides, however, at this stage we estimate that the removal of the device from location will be completed by tomorrow morning,\" police said in a statement, adding the shell was lying in a bed of dense silt. London City Airport is the city's fifth biggest and is popular with business travellers. It is London's most central international airport and is close to major financial districts in the City of London and Canary Wharf.  The docklands area of London's East End was a trading hub in the 1940s and was heavily bombed by German planes in World War Two. The airport was opened in 1987 as part of the broader regeneration of the area. The airport told passengers not to travel there on Monday. Regional airline CityJet said its flights from the airport had been rescheduled to land and take off from London Southend airport, while Italy's Alitalia said it would operate flights from London Stansted airport. British Airways said it was trying to minimise disruption for passengers and said in a statement: \"We are rebooking customers due to travel today onto alternative flights or offering refunds for those who no longer wish to travel.\" "

All of the big parties have multiple prospective candidates for Sherpur 2, which consists of two upazilas: Nokla and Nalitabari. Nokla upazila has 151,386 registered voters across 10 unions, and 67 voting centers with 302 voting booths. Nalitabari upazila has 197,458 registers voters across 10 unions and one municipality. It has 72 voting centers with 408 voting booths. The ruling party has three prospective candidates in this constituency.  They are Awami League Presidium Member and present MP Matia Chowdhury, former Krishok League leader and upazila Vice-Chairman Badiuzzaman Badsha, and upazila Awami League General Secretary Moksedur Rahman Lebu. According to locals, Matia Chowdhury, because of her honesty and transparency, is the most popular candidate of the three and they expect her to win in the upcoming general polls. Matia Chowdhury was first elected in 1991 for this constituency. She was re-elected MP in the 1996 national elections, though lost by a very close margin to her BNP counterpart late Jahed Ali Chowdhury in the 2001 general polls.  Between 2008 and 2014, she again served as the constituency's lawmaker. Badiuzzaman Badsha, who was a rebel candidate of the ruling party during the 10th general polls, said he would be guided by the people this time.  \"My decision to participate as a rebel candidate in the 11th general polls depends on my supporters,\" he said. Meanwhile, from Jatiya Party, zila Jatiya Party leader Md Shawkat Saeed and Jatiya Cultural Party Central Committee Member Kazi Roji Siddique are seeking the party's nomination. For BNP, the party's upazila Joint General Convener and Central Committee Member Fahim Chowdhury, BNP Chairperson's Advisor Barrister M Haider Ali, former student leader of Chatra Dal Rashid Shemol, and zila BNP Joint General Convener and Nalitabari upazila Chairman AKM Mokhlesur Rahman Ripon are in the running for the nomination. AKM Mokhlesur Rahman Ripon is quite confident about being nominated as he won the previous upazila parishad elections against a heavyweight ruling party candidate, despite being a rebel candidate of  BNP. The locals of Sherpur 2 constituency are expecting a close fight between the top two parties, Awami League and BNP."

It plans to plant vetiver grass that helps reduce soil erosion on steep slopes of hills.\nAs part of the pilot project of vetiver grass plantation, the authorities are now planning to cover the four major hills of the port city with vetiver grass, locally known as \"Binna\" grass, to control slope erosion.\nVetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides), a clumping grass without stolons or rhizomes, is known for its ability to reduce siltation and stabilize soil. Its non-fertile seeds ensure that the plants will not spread beyond where they are planted. Engineers liken the vetiver root to a \"living soil nail\" with an average tensile strength (used to describe the extent to which something can stretch without breaking) of 1/6 mild steel. The deep root system makes vetiver extremely drought tolerant and difficult to dislodge.\n\nCCC Chief Engineer Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed told the Dhaka Tribune that initially four hills - Burma Haji Pahar, Khulshi Pahar, and hills on both sides of Tigerpass intersection - have been earmarked for vetiver grass plantations.\n\"The port city's water congestion is inseparably connected with soil erosion from the hills. Indiscriminate deforestation, hill cutting and unplanned human settlements result in massive soil erosion. Following torrential rainfall, the soil eroded from the hills clog up the drains and nearby water bodies and trigger water stagnation in the city,\" he said.\nIf the pilot project yields positive results the corporation will send a project proposal to the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives, he added.\nAccording to experts, when a raindrop falls, it is usually absorbed into the pore spaces of the soil. But when the pore spaces become saturated (full), the raindrops will either remain on the surface as puddle or flow downhill. As the water flows downhill, it carries with it soil particles and other materials, which is called erosion.\nMd Rashidul Hasan, assistant professor at the department of urban and regional planning of Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET), told the Dhaka Tribune that unlike other parts of the country, the hills of Chittagong region constitute of crumbling soil and become vulnerable after a heavy rainfall if the surface is not covered with vegetation.\n\"The soil becomes heavy after absorbing rainwater and the steep slopes cannot bear the mass weight of the wet soil or mud, resulting in landslides.\"\nThe less vegetative (plant) cover and leaf material on the ground, the more open the soil will be to the runoff water. Slope erosion can therefore be prevented by protecting the soil surface with some form of cover and controlling runoff before it develops into an erosive force.\nProf Dr Md Shariful Islam of Department of Civil Engineering, BUET, who is providing technical assistance to the CCC in this regard, said that vetiver is a miracle grass. It is being used as an efficient bio-technology for slope protection in many countries for its special attributes like longer life, strong and finely structured root system, and high tolerance of extreme climatic conditions.\n\"It has been used in many tropical countries for being a simple and economical method to conserve soil by slowing the velocity of water and stabilizing steep slopes. The grass can survive extreme weather conditions ranging from -14 degree Celcius to 55 degree Celsius,\" said Prof Islam who has been conducting a research on vetiver for over a decade.\n\"The extremely deep and massively thick root system of vetiver binds the soil and at the same time makes it very difficult for it to be dislodged under high velocity water flows. This deep and fast growing root system also makes vetiver drought tolerant and highly suitable for steep slope stabilization,\" he further said.\n\"Vetiver grass is available in Bangladesh. The grass can grow in both silt and clay types of soil. Apart from saline soil, the grass can even grow in heavy metal contaminated soil. It is not a weed. This grass is non-competitive with adjacent crops and cost-effective. So, vetiver grass plantation could be a sustainable, green, and cheaper bio-engineering solution to slope protection,\" said Prof Islam.\nAminul Hoque Chowdhury, deputy director of Department of Agricultural Extension, Chittagong said that vetiver grass is used as a cover crop (crop grown for the protection and enrichment of the soil) all over the world.\n\n\"The concept is quite new in our country. If the rate of nutrient and water uptake is higher by vetiver grass, then it might affect other plants. So we have to be careful in this regard,\" said the agriculturist.\nProf Dr Md Al Amin said that any type of vegetation slows down the runoff velocity.\n\"Vetiver grass is one of the tried and tested methods all over the world for slope stabilization. We should also adopt approaches like bolting system to reduce slope failures,\" said Prof Amin who teaches at the Institute of Forestry & Environmental Sciences (IFES) of Chittagong University.\nCCC Mayor AJM Nasir Uddin said that they were considering planting vetiver grass to stop erosion.\n\"Hill cutting should be stopped, othrwise vetiver grass plantataion will be of no use,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n"

Last year rice production fell due to a devastating haor flashflood and rice blast attacks.\nIn 2018-19 MY, which begins with the harvesting of Boro, the production of rice is forecast to exceed the government's target, stated the USDA report, as farmers increased cultivation areas with an expectation of good prices, and to recoup the Boro and Aman production losses from the previous year.\n\"Farmers have switched to Boro rice from wheat and potato cultivation as they attempt to avoid loss from wheat blast and the lower price of potato. The government's procurement price of Boro and Aman paddy [unhusked] and rice [milled] of last year offers an opportunity to get good prices for this season's Boro rice,\" said USDA.\nHowever, USDA noted, farmers' expectation of a higher price may be dampened if production is higher as expected and imports continue to follow the pace of the last few months. \"As highly fluctuating husked rice price is mostly controlled by millers, past experience indicates that millers manage to keep the paddy purchase price lower through imports of more rice [husked] before the harvest season.\"\nUSDA estimated that rice imports will fall to 0.8 million MT in 2018-19 MY, comparing it to an estimated 3.6 million MT in 2017-18 MY, due to higher domestic production backed by favourable weather conditions.\nThe rice import estimate is revised upward to 3.6 million MT in 2017-18 MY due to increased imports to fill the supply shortfall caused by the previous year's devastating flood and the application of a 2% import tariff.\nAccording to the Ministry of Food, from July, 2017 to March, 2018, total rice imports were a little over 3.5 million MT. Of these, over 0.95 million MT has been imported by the government while the rest by private traders. This is the highest ever rice import in Bangladesh while the previous highest record stood at 3 million MT during the 1998-99 financial year.\nAround 67% of Bangladesh's cultivated land area is used for rice production. A study by the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) reported that in the period 1990-91 to 2016-17, adoption of modern varieties (MV) increased area by 11% in Boro, 246% in Aus and 135% in Aman season rice.\nAlthough government has a long term plan to reduce Boro rice area and increase Aus and Aman rice production, the yield of Boro rice is still dominant in producing 54% higher yield than Aus and 40% higher than Aman.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-11-01 00:00:00      \nTk1.79cr distributed among erosion victims The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved a proposal to protect Zajira and Naria upazilas of Shariatpur district from river erosion at a cost of Tk1,077.58 crore. The committee at a meeting, with Finance Minister AMA Muhith in the chair, gave the go-ahead to the proposal placed by Water Resources Ministry, official sources said, reports BSS. Under the proposal, the contract will be handed over to Bangladesh Navy-run Khulna Shipyard for implementation of the project to protect 8.90km of riverbank in the upazilas, that includes dredging and construction of ferry terminals. The approval came at a time when thousands have been rendered homeless by the scourge of the Padma in the two upazilas over the past three months. The government has so far distributed nearly Tk1.79 crore in cash and 5,952 bundles of corrugated Iron (CI) sheets among 5,081 families affected by the Padma erosion in the district this year. Earlier, the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry allocated Taka 1,81,50,000 for the district as house building grants along with 6,050 bundles of CI sheet. Under the scheme each erosion affected family will get cash Tk3000 along with a bundle of CI sheet. Additionally, the government has distributed 675 tons of rice and Tk52 lakh in cash as gratuitous relief (GR) among the river erosion victims of Noria, Zajira, and Bhedorganj upazilas of the district in the current year, said officials.  Disaster Management and Relief (DM&R) Minister, Mofazzal Hossen Chowdhury Maya, while visiting Naria upazila on September 18, said, \"The government under Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) program will distribute rice among 5,081 erosion affected families till December 31.\"  Project Implementation Officer (PIO) of the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry of Zajira upazila, Shawpan Matubbar, said that in Naria, the government has distributed 5,000 bundles of CI sheet and Tk1.50 crore as house building assistance among 5,000 erosion victim families. Apart from this, the government has distributed 609.72 tons of VGF rice among the erosion affected families,where each family will get 30 kg of rice in a month till December, along with 14,000 packets of dry food, said the official. Meanwhile, the government has allocated a total of 18,000 packets of dry food for erosion affected poor families,each packet containing five kg of rice, one kg pulses, one kg sugar, one kg flattened rice, 500 grams of puffed rice, 1-kg edible oil, and a box of matches. A vast area with about 200 buildings, including hospitals, clinics, mosques, temples, and business houses in Naria, has been eroded as the mighty Padma continues to devour its right bank in the district, leaving hundreds of people homeless. River erosion in Naria and Zajira upazilas of the district has been occurring in the rainy season for the last several years. But this time, erosion by the Padma has taken a serious turn. The locals said over 20 square kilometres of land in Naria have been eroded in the last three years. This year the erosion began some two and a half months ago, but the severe erosion began on September 3 and it is still continuing, they added."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-10-13 00:00:00      \nFour parties, including BNP, come together, demanding an impartial government for the national polls Amid many speculations, a new political alliance called Jatiya Oikya Front, led by eminent jurist Dr Kamal Hossain, was formed on Saturday with major opposition BNP as one of its members. As its members, Dr Kamal's Gono Forum, BNP, ASM Abdur Rab-led Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) and Mahmudur Rahman Manna-led Nagorik Oikya have announced to work towards shared political goals aimed at ensuring free and fair voting in the 11th general election. The alliance, however, does not include Bikalpadhara Bangladesh or its President AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury-led Juktofront, which had initially brought together the aforementioned four parties, showing growing signs of rifts among the political groups. Dr Kamal announced the new coalition at a press conference held at the National Press Club in Dhaka on Saturday evening. He said: \"We are forging the unity in the interest of the 160 million people of the country, not to protect the interest of any party.\" \"The call for national unity has been made on behalf of millions of citizens. The new alliance has two partners of Juktofront as well. I expect the others to join the unity process.\" He emphasized taking the unity process to district and upazila levels to achieve success. \"This unity will form a peaceful government through the elections by suppressing the autocrats.\" Dr Kamal said the alliance would continue its movement till its demands and visions were met and agreed upon by the government. He hoped that Bikalpadhara would also join the new alliance. BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, JSD President ASM Abdur Rab, Nagorik Oikya Convener Mahmudur Rahman Manna, Gonoshasthaya Kendra Founder Zafrullah Chowdhury, and Gono Forum Executive President Subrata Chowdhury, among others, were beside Kamal at the time. BNP Standing Committee members Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and Moudud Ahmed, former caretaker adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein, former vice-president of Dhaka University Central Students' Union (Ducsu), Sultan Mohammad Mansur Ahmed, were also present. Manna, who was the member secretary of Juktofront, also briefed the media on the new coalition's seven demands, which include the release of BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia, and 11 common goals. The seven demands of Jatiya Oikya Front include formation of a non-partisan government through discussion with all political parties, after the resignation of the incumbent government and dissolution of parliament to hold a fair election; release of all political prisoners, and withdrawal of false cases filed against opposition leaders and activists. Their demands also include Election Commission reform with qualified personnel, no use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the next election, withdrawal of false cases filed against students and journalists, and deployment of army personnel with magistracy powers 10 days before the national polls Seven demands: 1.    To ensure a fair election, a non-partisan government must be formed through discussion with all political parties, after the resignation of the incumbent government and dissolution of the parliament. Release of political prisoners, including of Khaleda Zia must be ensured, and false cases filed against opposition activists must be withdrawn 2.    Election Commission must be formed with qualified personnel, and electronic voting machines (EVMs) must not be used in the next election 3.    Level playing field during election time must be ensured 4.    False cases field against students and journalists must be withdrawn, and laws such as Digital Security Act must be scrapped 5.    Army Personnel, with magistracy powers must be deployed ten days before the next general election 6.    Foreign and domestic observers must be present during election time, and media professionals must be allowed to perform their duties without any restrictions 7.     Trial of all ongoing cases filed against political personalities must be postponed from the announcement of the polls schedule, till the declaration of the election results. New cases must not be filed against those political personalities during this time 11 goals: 1.    Establishing good governance by bringing balance of power in parliament, government, president and prime minister with an aim to build a Bangladesh with the spirit of Liberation War to end the authoritarian regime, and decentralizing the administration 2.    Amending the constitution, including Article 70, and forming a constitutional commission to appoint impartial and honest officials to the important positions in constitutional bodies 3.    Ensuring freedom and power of the judiciary 4.    Ensuring necessary initiative for modernizing the Anti-Corruption Commission and bringing the corrupts to book 5.    Ensuring an investment-friendly environment, creating jobs and establishing merit as the only baseline for recruitment in government jobs 6.    Ensuring security of the people, their property and fundamental rights and women empowerment 7.     Implement infrastructural reform for freeing the public administration, police and local government from corruption and grouping 8.    Establishing discipline in the financial institutions, including Bangladesh Bank, and ensuring financial growth focused on proper use of national resources, fair distribution and public welfare 9.    Building a national consensus against militancy, terrorism and communalism, and establishing positive, creative and balanced political environment by ending politics of vengeance and negativity 10.    Adopting a \"friendship with all, enmity with none\" foreign policy 11.    Ensuring advance training, modern technology and equipment for the armed forces to strengthen and modernize them 'Change starts now' At the press briefing, Mahmudur Rahman Manna said the people wanted change and the beginning of that change started with the formation of the new unity. He also announced a three-point program of Jatiya Oikya Front - campaigns across Bangladesh to spread out the movement, views-exchange meetings with foreign diplomats and envoys, and with journalists. BNP Secretary General Fakhrul Islam Alamgir said: \"Jatiya Oikya Front has kicked off the movement for the masses to free the nation from the prevailing situation.\" The party's Standing Committee member Moudud Ahmed also said the new alliance would be a turning point to bring back the people's right to vote. \"Dr Kamal has made a very bold move because he wants democracy. This unity now has only one aim - compel the government to accept our demands and hold a fair election,\" he added. Zafrullah Chowdhury said: \"Dr Kamal Hossain is not leading the unity formation process by taking anyone's side. He is doing what needs to be done to deal with the existing crisis prevailing in the country.\" Senior BNP leader Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain added that Jatiya Oikya Front was a light of hope ahead of the next election. On October 7, the leaders of BNP, Jatiya Oikya Prokriya, and Juktofront, held a meeting at Mosharraf's house in the city and reached a consensus to wage a united movement to force the government to hold a credible election. Over the last month, BNP and the previous coalition comprised of Oikya Prokriya and Juktoront have voiced similar demands concerning the upcoming polls. Jatiya Oikya Prokriya was initiated by Juktofront and Gono Forum on September 15. Later, on September 22, BNP extended its support to the platform at a rally. Since then, leaders from the three political platforms have held several meetings to finalize the next course of action. With this, almost all the parties who oppose the ruling Awami League will have joined a single platform. On Friday night, the leaders of BNP, Juktofront, and Jatiya Oikya Prokriya, finalized a draft framework of the new coalition with the demands and goals to force the government to step down before the polls and organize fair balloting."

The High Court canceled Relief and Disaster Management Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya's graft conviction, on Monday.  Maya had been sentenced to 13 years imprisonment by a lower court in the graft case, reports UNB. A bench of Justices Md Nazrul Islam Talukder and Justice KM Hafizul Alam delivered the judgment. Maya's lawyer barrister Syed Ahmed Raja said that the HC relieved Maya from the jail sentence accepting an appeal he filed. After re-hearing the appeal filed by Maya on Sunday, against the lower court's conviction, the HC set Monday to deliver its verdict. On August 14, the High Court had set October 7 to deliver its judgment in the case.  Assistant Director of Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), Nurul Alam filed the case with Sutrapur police station for illegally amassing wealth, worth Tk29 lakh, on June 13, 2007. A Special Judge's Court sentenced Maya to 13 years' jail and also fined him Tk5 crore for the wealth accumulated on February 14, 2008. On February 14, 2008, a Dhaka court sentenced him to 13 years in jail and fined him Tk50 million over wealth accumulation. Maya filed an appeal with the High Court on May 25, 2009. Following the appeal, the High Court acquitted him from the corruption charges on October 27, 2010.  On June 14, 2015, a three-member bench of Appellate Division led by former Chief Justice SK Sinha scrapped the High Court verdict and ordered a re-hearing his appeal."

One needs to be at least 18 years of age to hold office in New York and Tahseen will turn 18 just in time.\nTahseen, going door-to-door to rally support, says he is hopeful even though he is young. He says people are gradually getting tired of conventional politics.\n \n[caption id=\"attachment_244339\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Tahseen campaigning for kosher and halal food Courtesy[/caption]\nIf he wins, he will become the first Muslim and Bangladeshi-American to achieve the feat.\nMost members of his campaign team are his school friends. They are pounding the pavement and also helping him with his campaign website which lays out his position on various issues.\nMost of his campaign funds came from donations from city residents. The fund is small compared to his opponents' resources. Tahseen described his campaign as unique. \"I will prioritize social networking and the power of the internet,\" he says.\n[caption id=\"attachment_244340\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Tahseen discusses with a member of the law enforcement Courtesy[/caption]\nHe has been working as inter-market coordinator since eighth grade when he was in Khan's Tutorial.

In Kansas, two 16-year-olds and a 17-year-old announced plans to seek Democratic and Republican nominations.\nTahseen comes from a working-class immigrant family. His father works in a deli and his mother delivers newspapers. He says he believes his background has helped him identify the problems of his area's residents.\n[caption id=\"attachment_244343\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Tahseen comes from a working-class immigrant family Courtesy[/caption]\nHe fears that the recent incidents of terror attacks in New York may turn out to be problematic for him.

The diplomat made the statement while speaking to reporters after inspecting the newly-established Rohingya camp in the Balukhali area of Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya upazila.  Miller also said: \"We must create a conducive, safe environment in order for the Rohingyas to return to their homeland. We must give them back their rights, and ensure that repatriation is voluntary. The US government is continuing to work with the international community in order to create such a suitable environment.\"  He also said: \"The amount of harm wrought upon Cox's Bazar by the influx of so many refugees is immeasurable, but the US will work on mitigating the situation.\" Earlier, Miller reached Cox's Bazar by plane around 9:30am Tuesdayon a three-day trip. He subsequently visited multiple Rohingya camps in Bandarban and Cox's Bazar, where he met with refugee leaders, and donor agencies, NGO, and international NGO officials.  Since August 2017, over 700,000 Rohingyas have entered Bangladesh fleeing the persecution of Myanmar security forces. They have taken shelter various refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, taking the total number of refugees living there to over 1.1 million."

After the initial damage of 1 kilometer area during the monsoon season, the city's flood embankment once again is facing the wrath of the mighty Padma. From Wednesday evening till Thursday morning, about 150 meters of the city flood embankment have dissolved in the river bed. Frightened residents are taking shelter on higher ground away from the river bank.  According to locals last year's sand dredging is the main reason of the current river erosion. They said on Wednesday evening despite low water levels in Padma, sudden erosion began near the Godar Bazar area of Rajbari. As a result the entire area, including Rajbari city is under threat. Mohammad Mazibur, a resident of Gopalbari village under Rajbari Sadar upazila said: \"Dredging in the Rajbari section of Padma River is responsible for the flood. Many of the anxious residents are moving away from the affected area.\" Sadar upazila Water Development Board Deputy Assistant Engineer Md Hafizur Rahman said: \"Daulatdia of Rajbari zila to Sialdangi of Pangsha upazila share 85 kilometers of river channel in-between. On Wednesday about 100 meter area of the city flood embankment got damaged. We have sent the new embankment design to the ministry. We are hopeful to start the repair work very soon.\""

According to sources, more than: 2,000 houses, 500 business centres, several schools, mosques and other establishments have been washed away by the consequences of aggressive river erosion. The river is threatening increasingly more areas. On Sunday morning, a big portion of Naria Upazila Health Complex and a mosque adjacent to the hospital also washed away. At least 12 hospital buildings are at risk of being washed away at any time, said locals. In the last month, the river has devoured several multi-storey buildings, a mosque, 2,000 business centres, 300 shops, and others establishments located on the riverbank. A1.50km area, from Naria Banshtola to Purba Naria, was washed away by the river in the last couple of days-- but the authorities concerned paid no head on it, locals said. Although the erosion is ongoing for the last couple of years, no initiative to build a dam or embankment was taken by the local administration, claimed the locals. They also claimed the government should declare the area a disaster zone. Shahidul Islam Babu, mayor of Naria Municipality , said they started to send relief materials to the victims. UNO Sanjida Yeasmin said she told the higher authorities to declare the area a disaster zone. On a recent visit, she also assured the locals that the construction work on the 9km dam will start on the first week of October."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-10-29 00:00:00      \nThe move comes in line with a High Court order issued in August 2013 The Election Commission has cancelled the registration of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islamias a political party, which had opposed Bangladesh's independence during the Liberation War of 1971. The commission issued a gazette notification,signed by the commission's Secretary HelalUddin Ahmed,to this regard on Sunday. According to the gazette, Jamaat's registration was cancelled in line with the Sub Clause 4 of Article 90H of the Representation of the People Order (RPO) 1972,following a 2013 High Court order that declared the party's registration illegal and cancelled. The cancellation of the registration means Jamaat would not be able to take part in the upcoming 11th general election, which the commission plans to hold in the last week of December. Commission Secretary Helal Uddin Ahmed on Monday also told reporters: \"We have issued the gazette announcing the cancellation [of Jamaat's registration] after receiving the full verdict from the High Court.\" He also said that there was also no stay order from the Supreme Court's Appellate Division in this regard. \"We have received the affidavit from the concerned advocate through an information slip of the Appellate Division. There is no stay order.\"The Election Commission gazette notification, cancelling Jamaat-e-Islami's registration as a political party, which was issued on Sunday | Collected In the August 1,2013 verdict, the High Court had declared Jamaat's registration with the Election Commission\"illegal and void,\" while observing that the registration was unlawfully done and the party's charter contained elements contrary to the constitution and election rules of Bangladesh. It also said that Jamaat had no moral right to be in Bangladesh's political arena for the atrocities it committed during the Liberation War. Jamaat, a long-time key ally of BNP, the same day had moved the Supreme Court, challenging the verdict. The commission withheld the party's registration after the High Court order, while waiting for the copy of the full verdict. On November 4, 2008, Jamaat had registered with the Election Commission during the military-backed caretaker government's term, after the commission made it mandatory for political parties to register for contesting in the polls, and had the 'scale'allotted as its election symbol. However, apart from losing the registration, many top leaders of Jamaat were tried and sentenced to either the death penalty or life imprisonment over the last five years by two special war crimes tribunals for crimes committed against humanity during the 1971 war. Some of them were also executed following their convictions."

The people of all faiths will practise their own religious rituals properly. This is the principle of Islam,\" she said.\nShe made the remarks while inaugurating construction works on nine model mosques and Islamic cultural centres in different places of the country through a videoconference from her official residence, Ganabhaban, in Dhaka.\nThe nine mosques and centres are being constructed under a project titled \"Establishment of a total of 560 Model Mosques and Islamic Cultural Centres in each District and Upazila.\"\nSheikh Hasina said her government has taken this initiative so that people can get the real teaching of Islam and exercise Islamic culture properly.\n\"We want the image of our holy religion to be upheld. Islam is a religion of peace. We want the peace to prevail,\" she said adding that the dignity of Islam is being defamed by killing innocent people and carrying out militant and terrorist acts in the name of the holy religion.\nShe reiterated that there will be no place for militancy, terrorism and drug on Bangladesh soil. \"We want everyone here to live in peace and have socio-economic progress.\"\nRecalling that Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman established the Islamic Foundation in March, 1975, Hasina said it was his dream that the people from all religions would perform their own religious rituals freely in this country.\nLater, the prime minister heard the speeches of imams (religious leaders) and public representatives of Tungipara upazila of Gopalganj, Chittagong, Mymensingh, Noakhali, Dakkhina Surma of Sylhet, Khulna, Rajapur of Jhalakati and Sherpur of Bogra through the videoconference from Ganabhaban.\nShe also talked to Opposition Leader Raushan Ershad through the videoconference while inaugurating the model mosque in Mymensingh.\nReligious Affairs Minister Matior Rahman also spoke on the occasion, while Principal Secretary Md Nojibur Rahman conducted the videoconference.\nReligious Affairs Secretary Md Anisur Rahman made a brief description of the project through a power-point presentation, informing that construction works of over 100 mosques will start by the end of 2018.\nA video documentary on the project was screened. The district-level model mosques will be four-storey ones, while that of the upazila-level model the three-storey ones.\nThe model mosques to be constructed in coastal areas will be four-storey ones with the ground floor remaining vacant for use as shelter centres during any natural disaster.\nA total of Tk8,722 crore will be spent on constructing the mosques and centres.\nRoad Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader and the prime minister's Political Affairs Adviser HT Imam were also present.\n\n\n\n\n"

The people have the right to know.\n\"If it is spying, then the people would never know about what goes on. Actually, it is an anti-transparency law for governing the state.\"\nOnline activist Arif Jebtik said online journalism had served to raise awareness among people of many things that take place around them.\n\"Illegal activities of government officials involved in corruption have been exposed (so) I think this section has been formulated to protect the corrupt officials,\" he said. \"This law has ensured that people who are harassed at government offices do not get the chance to collect evidence.\"\nPosts, Telecommunication and Information Technology Minister Jabbar said journalists had \"conditional freedom\" in Bangladesh.\n\"Why should you do something secretly? It is unacceptable?\" he asked. \"One can never violate state secrecy. Will you be able to force yourself into someone else's house? Can anyone take pictures in someone else's house without permission?\"\nWhen presented with the scenario of a journalist being denied permission to take a picture of a person, Jabbar said: \"It depends on the situation. Since you are asking for permission, it is not confidential anymore.\"\n \nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

The 16,000-acre island was once used as a shelter by pirates.\nIt usually takes around two and a half hours to reach Bhasan Char by boat from the Nolchira terminal of Hatiya upazila.\nThe journey started with a hired engine-run boat from Nolchira boat terminal of Hatiya around 9am and ended at Bhasan Char around 12:30pm. Before the start of the journey, this correspondent had contacted officials of a construction firm and convinced them to take him to Bhasan Char.\n[caption id=\"attachment_250598\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Workers move construction material from the water vessels into the island Fazlur Rahman Raju/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nWhen the boat reached the island, hundreds of water vessels carrying construction materials were seen in the area. Workers were busy unloading these materials.  After entering Bhasan Char, this correspondent also found trucks and lorries carrying bricks and stones. Excavators were seen piling up mud for the construction of the embankment. Roads have been built across the char area and several officer cadets of the Bangladesh Navy were seen roaming the construction site on bikes.\nThe navy has built a cluster pilot building on the char as a demo project. Construction firms are using the demo as a model.\nA shopkeeper, requesting anonymity, said: \"We have heard a Rohingya family was sheltered around the pilot project area and received all facilities including access to navy doctors.\"\n\nDuring the visit, this correspondent also found an aged person collecting medicine from a shop with a prescription signed by a navy doctor.\nAccording to sources, a total of 1,440 buildings will be built in the area to shelter Rohingya refugees. Each of the buildings will house 54 families, although Reuters reported that each building would house 16 families. Each family unit will have a 12-by-14 sq-ft room. Kitchens and toilets will be shared. There will be eight toilets in each building.\nBabul Akter, a construction worker from Gaibandha, said a labour agent hired him at Tk450 for eight hours but he tends to work for around 18 hours a day as there is tremendous pressure to finish construction on time.\nA Chinese company named Sinohydro is constructing a 13-kilometre flood defence embankment at the cost of $280 million.\n[caption id=\"attachment_250600\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] An excavator is at work to collect mud to construct a 13km embankment around the island to prevent flooding Fazlur Rahman Raju/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nDuring the visit, this correspondent found a Sinohydro engineer monitoring work on the construction site while accompanied by a navy official.\nHowever, none of the officials agreed to comment on the construction of the embankment and the Chinese company.\nA navy official said he knew nothing about the agreement between Bangladesh and the Chinese construction firm as it happened secretly.\nHe also said that the engineering corps of the Bangladesh Navy is monitoring the construction work which includes land development and construction of the embankment.\nRequesting anonymity, an engineer of a private construction firm told the Dhaka Tribune that around 6,000 workers in 30 projects are working day and night.\nHe said they hope to complete their project within two months. He hopes Rohingya people can live there within six months.\nAccording to sources, the navy has already built a helipad, jetty for naval vessels, and rest rooms for navel officials.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina at a press conference on February 19 said all Rohingyas would be relocated to Bhasan Char.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-12-14 00:00:00      \nOn December 13, BFJU gave the government a 48-hour ultimatum to unblock the news sites While some people assumed a recent ban on 54 news sites was government interference in media, the government has said the websites were shut down due to national security concerns based on an intelligence report. On December 13, the Bangladesh Federal Journalists Union (BFJU) and a section of the Dhaka Journalists Union (DJU) gave the government a 48-hour ultimatum to unblock the news sites. While staging a demonstration in front of the National Press Club, in Dhaka, they claimed the government's decision was nothing but interference in the media; and threatened to wage tougher political movements if their demands remained unfulfilled. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan said that the websites were harmful for national security since they spread propaganda and indecent content. \"The websites were blocked due to national security concerns based on an intelligence report given by Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and the National Telecommunication Monitoring Centre NTMC),\" the minister told the Dhaka Tribune. \"We have been having discussions for further action against the websites,\" he said. However, the minister did not mention a specific allegation against specific content or the news site. Also Read- Now 54 news portals, sites blocked Meanwhile, the journalists' leaders claimed the government initiative was an attempt to shut down media in the country, and demanded the ban on the sites be lifted within two days. BFJU President Ruhul Amin Gazi said: \"If the government does not lift the ban on the websites within 48 hours, a greater course of action will be declared.\" While talking to the Dhaka Tribune, he said that 54 organizations, collectively, cannot make any mistake and the government did not explain the exact reasons behind blocking them. \"If any news site does anything wrong or if any content seems to be manipulated, the government has to explain that before the nation. We do not know which content was anti-state or anti-government, and nobody knows. However, the government has widely blocked the news sites,\" journalist leader Ruhul said.  \"We are not in favour of yellow journalism, neither are we in support of shutting down  news sites. If any organization does anything illegal, action should be taken accordingly,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), on December 9, sent letters to International Internet Gateway (IIG) operators and Internet Service Providers (ISP) to restrict access to 58 news sites. Following the letter, the news sites were found unavailable from the morning of December 10. On December 11, BTRC reopened four news portals--poriborton.com, priyo.com, risingbd.com and dhakatimes24.com-- and kept the other sites blocked. Also Read- BTRC reopens 58 news sites blocked over 'national security' concern Dhaka Tribune also contacted NTMC Director Brig Gen Ziaul Ahsan and RAB Director (Legal and Media Wing) Mohammad Mufti Mahmud Khan, for comment, but was unable to reach them by phone. BTRC acting chairman Md Jahurul Haque--also the vice chairman of the commission--refused to comment, saying he had been moved away from BTRC, and was currently working for the Bangabandhu Satellite. BTRC Senior Assistant Director (Media and Communication wing) Md Zakir Hossain Khan said: \"The concerned authorities asked us to take steps against the 58 websites. We just executed the order as a technical organization.\" \"Four news sites were mistakenly included in the list, and upon receiving further instructions, we reopened them,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. When asked about the reason behind blocking the websites, he said the actions were taken as the websites appeared to be a threat to national security. \"Sometimes, some of these websites were responsible for humiliating the country's president and prime minister. Whenever, such activities against someone-- who is involved in running the country--are found, we take action according to the policy of the commission,\" Zakir told the Dhaka Tribune. Despite several attempts, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Media Advisor Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury was unavailable for his comment in this regard."

Dutch Minister for Infrastructure and Water Management Cora van Nieuwenhuizen expressed her government's readiness to help Bangladesh to this end. The minister said this during a meeting with Ambassador of Bangladesh to the Netherlands Sheikh Mohammed Belal, at the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management of the Netherlands, on Monday. She also stated that the Netherlands will support inland reclamation and river dredging in Bangladesh, said the Embassy on Tuesday, reports UNB. The Dutch Minister remarked that Bangladesh has always been an important country for a global initiative on climate change. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte had invited Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to join the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) as Co-Convener and attend the launching of the GCA in The Hague on October 16. Referring to the invitation, Nieuwenhuizen said that she hopes that Bangladesh's prime minister will join the GCA and attend the inaugural ceremony; to demonstrate to the world that Bangladesh is at the forefront of climate change adaptation and mitigating the adverse impacts of climate change.  Ambassador Belal congratulated the Netherlands for taking the initiative to steer the GCA towards obtaining global political commitments to climate change adaptation and focusing on solutions to climate change. He also thanked the Dutch government for inviting Bangladesh's prime minister to join the global initiative. At the meeting, both the Dutch Minister and Bangladesh's Ambassador expressed their satisfaction at the fast-growing bilateral relations between the two countries--following the official visit of the PM Sheikh Hasina to the Netherlands in November 2015, and the Dutch twin-ministerial visit to Bangladesh in June 2015. Referring to the approval of Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, on 4 September this year, by the Government of Bangladesh, the Ambassador expressed sincere thanks to the Dutch government for their technical assistance in formulating the plan. The Ambassador has also sought Dutch support under the broader framework of Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 to mitigate long-term flood risks and the adverse impacts of climate change. This would occur through: basin-wide water management, land reclamation, river-dredging, building the capacity of Bangladesh's River Research Institute, and developing knowledge via education and training. During the meeting, the Dutch Minister expressed her hope to visit Bangladesh at an opportune time to see, in person, Bangladesh's prowess in climate change adaptation. She would also like to further explore Dutch cooperation in implementing Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-09-16 00:00:00      \nTo achieve the upper-middle income status, the report says, Bangladesh must act now to tackle environmental degradation and pollution, especially in its cities Every year Bangladesh loses about $6.5 billion, which is about 3.4% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 2015, due to pollution and environmental degradation in urban areas, says a new World Bank report. The report titled \"Enhancing Opportunities for Clean and Resilient Growth in Urban Bangladesh: Country Environmental Analysis 2018\" was released during an event at a hotel in Dhaka on Sunday. It revealed that the cost is $1.44 billion in Dhaka alone, which is 0.72% of the national GDP. To achieve the upper-middle income status, the report says, Bangladesh must act now to tackle environmental degradation and pollution, especially in its cities. Globally, Bangladesh is one of the countries that are most affected by pollution and environmental risks. Pollution has reached an alarming level; in 2015, it caused about 80,000 deaths in cities, the report said. Across Bangladesh, 28% of all deaths are from diseases caused by pollution, compared to a 16% global average. Admitting the economic losses, Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Anisul Islam Mahmud told the function that the government was going to frame a new Environment Policy, the draft of which was ready for placing before the Cabinet. \"The draft policy has already been examined and will be sent to the Cabinet for green light soon. We will enact a new law to punish the polluters,\" he added, reports UNB. He said the government would introduce an online monitoring system to oversee the operation of the effluent treatment plants (ETP) at the industries to enforce the law effectively. The function was also addressed by World Bank's Acting Country Director Rajashree Paralkar, Environment Ministry's Additional Secretary Manjurul Hannan Khan, Department of Environment Director General Dr Sultan Ahmed and World Bank project leader Sanjoy Srivastava. World Bank's environment and natural resources global practice manager Kseniya Lvovsky had presented the highlights of the report at the program.   Growth at risk \"Bangladesh pays a high price from environment degradation and pollution in its urban areas. This puts its strong growth at risk,\" Rajashree Paralkar said at Sunday's event. \"The country must act to put in place the right policies and institutions for green growth and ensure its industries adopt clean technologies,\" she added. Pollution and environmental degradation, including wetland encroachment and unregulated disposal of hazardous wastes, especially harm women, children and the poor. Nearly one million people in Bangladesh, mostly poor, are at risk of lead contamination, says the report. This can lead to IQ loss and neurological damage, especially for children, and can increase the risk of miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women, it added. In greater Dhaka, the sites contaminated by heavy metals are mostly in poorer neighbourhoods. The report focuses on three areas: cost of environmental degradation, clean and resilient cities, and institutions for clean industrial growth. Of the total economic losses, the ambient air pollution cost $2.42 billion while household air pollution cost $1.27 billion, according to the environmental country analysis. Inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene have a direct impact of $0.43 billion while the indirect impact is $ 0.08 billion, arsenic in drinking water cost $0.80 billion while occupational pollution costs $1.52 billion in the economy. The World Bank observed that unplanned urbanisation and industrialization are affecting both big and small cities. In the last 40 years, Dhaka lost about 75% of its wetlands. \"Due to filling of wetland and now with high-rise buildings built on sand-filled areas, parts of the city are more susceptible to flood inundation. Smaller cities like Pabna see a similar toll from unplanned urbanisation. Since 1990, Pabna lost half of its wetlands, and its lifeline, the Ichamoti River, is dying.\" Dhaka and other cities can and must do far more to prevent encroachment, as well as invest in and sustainably manage their wetlands and canals, says the report."

The prime minister delivered her statement at high-level leaders' dialogue on \"Implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change: Towards COP24 and Beyond,\" held at the UN Headquarters on Wednesday, reports UNB. \"We need support for climate change adaptation and wider capacity-building-- and also for technology development and transfer in areas like agriculture, public health, and disaster management,\" she said. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was present at the event. Sheikh Hasina said she hoped member states would take the opportunity to have a discussion about climate finance, at COP24, to put the world on track to meet pre-2020 aims and long term goals of the Paris Agreement. Pointing out that Bangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change, the premier said: \"Climate change threatens the life and livelihood of 160 million of our people.\" She said Bangladesh has climate action and disaster risk reduction in its national plan.  \"We've investments of over 1 percent of our GDP to address  climate change impacts. Moreover, $450 million has been allocated, from our own resources, for adaptation and mitigation purposes,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh has adapted its agricultural methods to weather the impact of climate change.  She recalled the moment when she announced, in New York, five years ago,  that Bangladesh will never exceed the average per capita emissions of the developing world--as a responsible member of the international community.  Sheikh Hasina said: \"Our commitment to low-carbon, climate-resilient development is firm. We plan to move to carbon budgeting and resilient industrialization. We wish to de-carbonize our manufacturing pathways.\" She said Bangladesh has installed around six million Solar Home Systems and provided two million Improved Cook Stoves for the underprivileged. She also said that Bangladesh is developing stress-tolerant crop varieties to cope with the impacts of climate change.  \"In spite of our limitations, we allocated $385 million of our own funds for adaptation and mitigation,\" the prime minister added."

They must either publish an apology on their Facebook page or pay a sum of Tk5 crore within seven days.\"\n\nAlso Read- RFL courts controversy with Facebook ad\n\nThe notice said the picture in question was taken by the photographer at the risk of his life on April 8 during the clash between students and the police in the Dhaka University area.\nThe subject of the photo was photojournalist Abu Sufian Jewel, who was using a plastic stool he found on the street as a helmet to protect his head from bricks and tear shells that were being lobbed by students and policemen respectively.\nIt was at this intense moment that Abdul Ghani captured the photo which RFL used for an ad on their official Facebook page without permission.\nAbdul could have auctioned the powerful image or sent it to international photo competitions, but since it was used in the ad it has been rendered useless for such purposes.\nMoreover, since the photo was used in the ad, many people have been mocking and ridiculing Jewel on various social media platforms, which is an insult to his passionate efforts as a photojournalist.  \n\n\n\n\n"

The report, titled \"Global Terrorism Index 2018,\" ranked Bangladesh as 25th in terms of the impact of terrorism in 2017. This classifies the country as having had medium impact from terrorism. On the other hand, the USA was ranked 20th in the index, and classified as having had high impact from terrorism. As per the report, Bangladesh dropped by four ranks as compared to 2016, meaning the country has had a lower impact from terrorism in 2017. Conversely, the USA climbed 12 ranks after having been ranked 32nd in 2016.  Myanmar, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India are also among the countries that have had a higher impact from terrorism than Bangladesh in 2017. The Global Terrorism Index is produced based on data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). Data for the GTD is collected and collated by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. The key findings of the index include a 27% decrease in deaths from terrorism across the globe from 2016 to 2017. There were 18,814 deaths in 2017. This is the third consecutive year that number of deaths from terrorism has decreased. Deaths are now 44% below their peak in 2014. When compared to the peak of deaths from terrorism in 2014, the largest falls in the number of deaths occurred in Iraq, Nigeria, and Pakistan, with falls of 6,466, 5,950, and 912 deaths respectively."

If this situation continues, people will lose their trust in the election process.\"He said he was hopeful that if the election was free and fair, and the voters were able to exercise their voting rights, then the sheaf of paddy symbol would win by a large margin in the 11th general elections, due on Sunday.Moudud also claimed that the deployment of the armed forces members had done little to improve the situation.\"When there is no security for the candidates, the voters cannot be safe either,\" he said.Alleging the ruling party and the administration of not ensuring a level playing field, Moudud said: \"At least 31 cases have been filed against us, in which 965 of our leaders and activists have been made accused. At least 1,649 more have been listed as unidentified accused. Since December 10, 766 of our members have been injured in attacks on our campaigns. At least 78 of our field workers have been put in jail. Do those numbers speak of a good election environment?\"Despite this situation, we will remain in the election race till the last minute,\" the BNP leader vowed. \"Let the people of the country and the international community see how an election is held under a partisan government.\"Moudud further said this was a great opportunity for the Awami League to prove that holding a fair election is possible under a partisan government, but they failed to do so.The press briefing was also attended by BNP's Companiganj unit Orgnizational Secretary Md Jahangir Alam, Companiganj municipality unit Organizational Secretary Mominul Haque, and Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal's Noakhali district unit General Secretary Abu Hasan Md Noman, among others.In an immediate reaction to Moudud's press briefing, the Companiganj upazila unit of Awami League held a press briefing later in the day, where they refuted the BNP leader's allegations.Speaking at the press briefing, Companiganj Upazila Parishad Chairman and Awami League's district unit Organizational Secretary Mizanur Rahman Badal said: \"Barrister Moudud Ahmed's allegations are false and baseless. He made all these statements after not getting the expected response from the voters in the area (Noakhali 5).\""

At least 20 species of fish and aquatic animals, including two species of prawn were found floating in the river due to massive industrial pollution. A great number of fishes such as catfish or carp that lives in deep water were found dead on June 21 and 22, floating on the river. Halda River is known as the country's largest natural breeding ground for carps.  The committee points out the causes of the disaster and ways to restore the river from man-made pollutions. Also Read - Dead fish in Halda River pose danger to livelihoods, biodiversity President of Halda River Protection Committee Prof Dr ManzoorulKibria chaired the program while it was addressed by Shamshul Haque Haidari, Md Ali, Chowdhury Farid, Amin Munna and Reza Mozammel of the Halda River Protection Committee, among others. During the press conference, researcher Dr Manzoorul warned that the brief spell of massive pollution, for which a great number of fish died, would take a long term toll on the river. \"Although we have been conducting research on the river for a long time, we are not familiar with such type of disaster,\" he said. Dr Manzoorul further added: \"On behalf of Halda River Research Laboratory of Chittagong University and Halda River Protection Committee, we have collected water and dead fish samples from different points of the river and tried to identify the source of the problem.\"  Also Read - Paper mill sealed off for polluting Halda Quality of water in Halda \"After the recent disaster, water samples from 11 points of the river have been collected for lab tests,\" said Dr Manzoorul. \"The level of dissolved oxygen, found in the water was very low and is not suitable for fish and other aquatic organisms to survive. Pitch dark and foul smelling water was found in Chhayar Char to Ramdas Munshir Hat areas of the river. \"The water samples tested in the lab showed that the extent of pollution was higher in the downstream of the river. The average level of dissolved oxygen was found 1.01ml per litre against the required level of at least 5ml per litre, in the eight-kilometre stretch of the river from AzimerGhat to Madunaghat area,\" said Dr Manzoorul. Dr Manzoorul also pointed out: \"The level of ammonia in Khandia and Katakhali- two feeder canals of the Halda, were found to be hundred times higher than the tolerable limit. Apart from that, layers of oil were also found floating sporadically in the mouths of some feeder canals\" The fishes died due to low level of dissolved oxygen and exceedingly high levels of ammonia, which contaminated the river water.  Also Read - 17 Halda dolphins die in four months Industries responsible for polluting the Halda \"100MW Hathazari Peaking Power Plant and Asian Paper Mill were found to be the major industrial polluters for the Halda.The plant illegally constructed an underground pipeline to release its untreated furnace oil to the adjacent canal lined to the Halda. The power plant is yet to set up Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP),\" said Dr Manzoorul. While speaking about Asian Paper Mills Dr Manzoorul said: \"The mill has set up ETP. However, it virtually turned its adjacent canal into a dumping station. The waste released by the paper mill has deposited over a stretch of two kilometres of the canal and created a 1-1.5 ft thick layer of paper mill waste.\" Dr Manzoorul pointed out about the illegal set up of many poultry farms surrounding the river and the poultry bird excreta, also responsible for the falling level of dissolved oxygen in the river. \"Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) blocked Bamanshahi canal a few years ago, for a housing project. \"Both industrial and domestic wastes are now being channelled to the Halda through Khandakia canal due to the diversion,\" added Dr Manzoorul."

Such an initiative proves that development projects have been undertaken without thinking about the lives of people living near the river.\"\nHe made the comments on the concluding day of a two-day long conference titled \"Water Roots Innovation\", organized by ActionAid Bangladesh in the coastal town of Kuakata in Patuakhali.\n\"The rivers of Bangladesh are dying. The sweet water content inside the rivers has diminished, and there has been a steady rise of salinity,\" said Imtiaz.\nLocated in West Bengal, India, the Farakka barrage is roughly 16.5km distant from the Bangladeshi border. Built to revive the Kolkata port, it has been blamed for reducing water flow, increasing salinity and drying up the waters around the Sundarbans delta.\nBangladesh, heavily reliant on agriculture, bears the brunt of the barrage's destructive effect.\nOn the concluding day of the conference on Saturday, speakers discussed various solutions aimed at reducing river water pollution and the water crisis in Bangladesh.\nWater specialist and General Secretary of \"Ganga Bhangon Protirodh Samity\" (Ganges River Erosion Prevention Committee) of India, Toriqul Islam spoke: \"When it comes to the negative effects of the Farakka barrage, we are not against Bangladesh. People of Malda and Murshidabad inside India are similarly affected.\"\n\"People are losing their livelihoods on a daily basis because of Farakka,\" continued Toriqul. \"We wanted the barrage, but now it has become toxic for us.\"\nOn the concluding day of the conference, activists from China, India and Nepal shared their stories on topics related to river conservation.\nAccording to Prof Dr Liyan Zhang from Tianjin University in  China, while industrial activities are done in the name of development, rivers get polluted, destroying people's livelihoods. Farmers and the youth of the country can help to solve the problem, and the central leadership will have to take the initiative, he said.\nCountry Director of ActionAid Bangladesh Farah Kabir said: \"Historically, culturally and economically, our country has always been rich in the use of water and river multiplicity. Now, through regional initiatives such as unplanned development and urbanization, we are destroying the rivers.\"\nThe Chief Whip of Bangladesh Parliament, A S M Feroz, said: \"We want to save rivers. We want to remove structures near water bodies that are negatively impacting them.\"\n\"But due to obstacles like the Farakka barrage, the rivers in Bangladesh are going to die soon,\" he said. \"People use the rivers without taking the water and the river's own water flow into account. They need to start using the rivers responsibly.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-06-15 00:00:00      \nFor centuries, the locals of a small village in Shariatpur district have been praying in an ancient mosque. After 500 years of devoted use, however, the landmark building in Shibpur village under Nagerparha union of Goshairhat upazila has become dilapidated, and now poses serious risks to the safety of worshippers.  Locals have demanded the mosque be renovated and recognized as a national heritage site, because of its historical and aesthetic values.  They say it has a glorious history - although there are no surviving records of it. The site is not even listed in the government's architecture book list.  The mosque - situated about 8-10km from Sadar upazila of Shariatpur and 5km from the Arial Khan River - is popular because of its impressive decorative art.  The bricks were carved with ornate designs, while the structure itself is surrounded by serene green trees and a pond at the western side.  The square mosque, which has been set up on four kathas of land, has an ornate dome with a minaret on the top. The mosque's beauty is further enhanced by minarets on each of the four corners. The interior of the mosque is intricately designed with rosettes, while the exterior exhibits depictions of art during the Muslim rule in Bengal. The architectural patterns blend harmoniously to reflect both the Sultanate and Mughal rules. Locals have also attached superstitions to the ancient mosque, with some believing that it is possessed by spirits. Some have informed that for many years, people were afraid to enter the mosque in fear of spirits. Others have dismissed the idea. Their beliefs are that the mosque was constructed during Mughal Emperor Akbar's rule in 1576. Bengal remained a Mughal province until the beginning of the decline of the Mughal Empire in the 19th century. After the last great Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb's death in 1707, governors employed in Bengal practically became independent rulers.  However, others villagers believe the mosque was constructed during the Nawabi period between 1717 and 1765.  \"Nawab\" is a particular designation indicating political rank and power in the Mughal administrative hierarchy. In the British period, the term was used for a state conferred honorary title of rank, but it did not have any official attachment.  During the middle of the 18th century, they served as rulers of the provinces of Bengal. Nawabs were only nominally subordinate to the Mughal Empire. Abdus Salam Talukder, a tutelary of the mosque, said the truth would always be shrouded in conjecture. \"We cannot know the real history as there are no written documents, but I have always heard from my forefathers that the mosque was established by British Indian architects in the periods of Nawabs,\" he said. \"But maybe the mosque was constructed during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir.\" According to Abdus, Haji Shariatullah, an eminent 19th-century Islamic reformer from the Indian Subcontinent under whose name Shariatpur district was named, used to visit the mosque from time to time. Sometimes he would come with his son Dudu Mia to offer prayers. \"We tried to renovate the mosque because of its current dismal situation,\" Abdus said. \"But we failed as we lacked funds. We even sent a letter to Awami League leader and former minister Abdur Razzaq, as he is our MP, but did not get any response.\" Abdus Salam Talukder confided that currently, people come to pray inside the mosque five times a day, including for the Jumma prayers on Friday.  \"We try our best to preserve the heritage,\" he said. \"But we need the government's help to protect the mosque.\" Md Mujibur Rahman, director of Bangladesh Human Rights Enforcement council and a resident of the village, said despite the mosque's rundown state, he goes to pray there every now and then. \"Protection of such a heritage site is the government's duty, for the sake of the country,\" Mujibur said. Architect and Chief Executive of Urban Study Group (USG), Taimur Islam, said there are many historical sites in Bangladesh, but very few are listed officially.  \"If anything inside the mosque gets damaged, there is no way we will be able to restore it the way it was,\" he said. \"These structures should be preserved for their aesthetic values. Otherwise, our future generation will never witness our country's rich history.\" Taimur questioned the activities of the Ministry of Housing and Public Works. \"The authorities concerned rarely take the initiative to search the historical sites across the country, citing their lack of employees,\" he said.\"This cannot be a valid excuse.\" Ahmed Anisur Rahman, sub-assistant engineer of Shariatpur Public Works Department (PWD) told Dhaka Tribune that they did not know anything about the mosque in Shariatpur.  \"We can only renovate buildings that are included in the list provided by the government,\" he said. \"After obtaining the list from the government, we visit the site and fix the amount of money needed for renovation.  \"If the mosque in Shariatpur has an actual historical origin, and if it is in a dilapidated state, the concerned people can get in touch with the District Commissioner's office for renovation.\"  "

But 47 in 59 balls and 87 in 78 in two successful chases in the ODIs have made him feel slightly better about himself, reports ICC's official website Quinton de Kock has played two good hands as South Africa have gone 2-0 up in the one-day international series in Sri Lanka, and he's now hoping for a 5-0 scoreline. A sequence of 3, 10, 32 and 8 in the two Tests didn't make for happy reading for de Kock, but with South Africa totalling 126, 73, 124 and 290, his failures didn't stand out too much. But 47 in 59 balls and 87 in 78 in two successful chases in the ODIs have made him feel slightly better about himself, reports ICC's official website. This man was at his destructive-best in the second One-Day International against Sr Lanka. @QuinnyDeKock69's brilliant 87 (13 fours, 1 six) proved crucial in South Africa taking a 2-0 lead in the series and earned him the Man of the Match award. #ProteaFire #SLvSA  pic.twitter.com/XE7TNN9fjO \"Obviously I am feeling more satisfied than I was in the Test matches, it was quite tough then,\" he said after his knock from the top of the order helped South Africa win the second ODI by four wickets and earned him a Player of the Match award. \"Coming now into white ball, change of format, starting to add some value to the team is always nice. It's great also to be on the winning side in Sri Lanka, so all things are good at the moment. \"Coming from the Test series, it was quite difficult to play spin, especially when the wickets are given a chance to deteriorate over a couple of days. So it's nice to come into white-ball cricket, you know the spin is going to be a bit more truer. We practiced hard during the Test series to deal with the spin, so it's nice for me and for the team to finally be playing spin properly.\" South Africa's wins in the two matches have been set up by their bowlers, who have kept Sri Lanka to 193 and 244/8.  WATCH: 2nd ODI Highlights - Sri Lanka vs South Africa at Dambulla - https://t.co/rz9Rx0EkDh #SLvSA \"In the one-day format, it's always nice taking wickets up front,\" pointed out de Kock. \"That's the goal for any bowling side. The more wickets you take up front, the more you can control in the middle, so yes, that's the plan.\" Once the bowlers were done, it was over to the batsmen, and de Kock partnered Hashim Amla (43) for 91 runs to set up the chase before carrying on to put the game beyond Sri Lanka's reach. \"I think Hash's demeanour is very relaxed. We keep each other very calm. That's what we do well together. It was just wonderful to get along with him and score some runs together with him,\" said de Kock. And now, he hopes to do it again in the third game, and then the fourth and the fifth, to wrap up a series whitewash. \"It's the mission going two-nil. Hopefully three-nil, and then winning the series will also be a great way, to go through the series and hopefully win the last two after that,\" said de Kock. \"The Test series was obviously a tough one for us, so we're trying to play our best cricket now in the one-day format.\" The third ODI will be played on Sunday in Pallekele."

The only sand embankment in the area is under threat of being eroded, locals said. The people of Chotokhata, Banpara, Baishpukur Char, Chatunama Bhendabari Forest Char in Dimla upazila have been suffering as the roads and houses were submerged following the onrush of hilly water from the upstream. \"About 400 meters of the dam has already been gorged into the river,\" they said.Besides, the river has already swallowed the 10-meter approach road near dam no-4 at Dohalpara point due to rushing waves, reports UNB.   Meanwhile, more than 10,000 people of 23 villages in the char areas of Teesta and Dharala rivers have been trapped in flood water in Lalmonirhat district following onrush of water from upstream hilly areas. The officials of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) said the situation turned serious after India had opened the sluice-gates of the Gazaldoba barrage. However, the water level of Teesta River at Dalia Teesta Barrage Point is below the danger level on Wednesday. Rafiqul Alam Chowdhury, executive engineer of BWDB in Dalia said \"The flood situation has slightly improved in the district after 44 sluice gates of Teesta Barrage have been opened to control the flow of water."

Most of the drains in Dhaka are not correctly connected with one another, causing flood and waterlogging in the city,\" said Mobasher Hossain, a renowned architect.\n Causes of waterlogging\nThe sewerage system, water pumps, canals and rivers are maintained mainly by seven government bodies. Experts said there is a serious lapse of coordination among the organizations. As a result, the proper maintenance of the city's drainage system cannot be ensured, they added.\n\"There is a lack of coordination among the organizations responsible... Development work is going on, unplanned and uncoordinated. Waterlogging will never be solved unless the bodies coordinate their efforts and work in tandem,\" said Mobasher, former president of the Institute of Architects Bangladesh.\n\nEchoing him, Shyfun Naher, project coordinator at the Social and Economic Enhancement Programme, said: \"We always see the authorities are busy developing and repairing the drainage system all over the city. Their work never ends, as there is no coordination among the organizations.\"\nShe also stressed the need for reclaiming canals that have been grabbed over the years.\nDNCC's measures\nIn 2016, Annisul Haq, the late mayor of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC), took numerous measures to address the problem. As a result, the situations in such areas as Gulshan, Banani, and Baridhara have noticeably improved.\nHowever, people living in other areas including Mirpur, Mohammadpur, and Kuril are still reeling from the problem.\n\"Our work to mitigate the crisis at Mirpur, Mohammadpur, and some other places is in full swing. I hope the drainage development work will be completed before the monsoon,\" Osman Goni, a DNCC panel mayor, said.\n\n\n\n\n"

Also Read - Eight charged over Gulshan cafe attack  Defending her husband, Sharmina Parveen, who was also among the rescued 17, told different news outlets at the time that Hasnat was just following the instructions of his captors to keep her and their children safe during that dire situation.When asked whether the investigators were able to explain the pictures further, Monirul only said: \"We have analyzed those pictures. We have submitted our findings to the court.\"Monirul also said the investigators did not find any evidence of involvement of the cafe's pizza chef, Saiful Chowkidar, who was killed during the attack, or Zakir Hossain Shaon, who was detained as a suspect and later died of wounds at Dhaka Medical College Hospital.Police have pressed charges against eight people in the case. Six of them are behind bars, while the two others are fugitive.The names of a further 13 people suspected of involvement in the Holey Artisan attack have been wiped from the charge sheet as the suspects have all been killed in various drives conducted by different law enforcement agencies.Last year, the court acquitted another suspect, Tahmid Hasib Khan, as the prosecution failed to produce specific evidence to prove him guilty in the case.Tahmid was arrested on August 3, 2016 on suspicion of having links to the attackers."

The lake known for its scenic hilly surroundings and blue water is also associated with the memory of the Liberation War. But right now, the view is all grey. As far as the eye can see, there is nothing but sand on the banks. The lake is on the west side of the Chandpur village in the Tahirpur Upazila of Sunamganj. Every corner of the village is filled with sand. Crop fields, houses, and even Pochashulbill, a large wetland area, have disappeared under sand. Chandpur Government Primary School's ground floor and the playground in front has disappeared under sand. The school had to abandon the main building and move to an adjacent tin-shed house. The playground of Chandpur High School is also covered in sand. From the west bank of Zadukata River to Tekerghat point, the road is covered in sand.  A large canal that once supplied water to the Pochashulbill has completely disappeared, with only an abandoned bridge attesting to its presence. According to the Sunamganj Department of Agricultural Extension, 350 acres of land on the border of Tahirpur has been rendered inarable by sand. Other sources say the sand covers almost 500 hectares. All the freshwater fish and other animals in the area, including snakes, are dead or gone. Dr Md Abul Kashem, dean of agriculture at the Sylhet Agricultural University, said every year around 80 million tons of sand comes down to the area from upland, which is in the bordering state of Meghalaya in India. Most of it comes to the Sunamganj and Sylhet borders through rivers and waterfalls. Shaheed Siraj Lake in Chandpur village in the Tahirpur Upazila of Sunamganj Dhaka Tribune Tahirpur Agriculture Officer Abdus Salam said that the sand and stone fragments are flowing down from the Meghalaya. The flow of sand increases in the rainy season.  \"The biggest volume comes through Lakma Point. In three villages, 350 hectares of land are covered with sand,\" he said. Around 800 families in these three villages have been affected, many from the ethnic Khasia and Garo communities. The sand has filled up about 50 hectares of another wetland, the Pochasol Haor, on the south side of these villages. Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of the Sylhet Water Development Board, said: \"This massive influx of soil is due to landslides and trees getting uprooted upstream.\" Deserted land Sulai Sangma of Chandpur had been living in the area for 54 years, working as a farmer. He is now a manual worker. \"Around 57 families from ethnic communities lived in the Chandpur and Rajai villages. Of them, 14 have moved to different parts of Sylhet and eight to Mymensingh,\" Sulai said.  Andrew Solomon, 55, a resident of Rajinilain village, said he had lost 30 acres of farmland to sand and gravel from the Meghalaya.  \"The entire ecology of the region has changed. There are no crabs, no fish, and even snakes are moving away. No animal can live here. In the winter, the entire area becomes dry. In the rainy season, some canals become terrible,\" he said. Chandpur Government Primary School that has been declared abandoned owing to the massive influx of soil  Dhaka Tribune Abul Kashem, chairman of the Uttar Barua Union Parishad, said that about 700-800 families were affected due to the intrusion of sand.  \"There are about 1,200 families living in these three villages, about 100 of them ethnic minority families, and half of them have suffered losses,\" he said. \"The sand and gravel flood to Tahirpur through the canals Nayachara, Burunga, Pagla Ghat, Rajani Line, Puranghat and Rajai.  \"Even the water we get is reddish. This water cannot be used for anything. If you bathe with it you get rashes,\" Kashem added. 'Two countries have to work together' Various programs have been taken with an intention of solving the sand problem. Government intervention has been sought to sort out the issue by sending a letter to different levels of the government. But, it is a matter of sorrow that this is increasing day by day, let alone sorting it out. Kashmir Reza, a prominent Haor researcher, and president of the Environment and Haor Development Organization said local people are very concerned with the aggression of sand. To stop this, the government of both the countries will have to take effective measures, he said. Advocate Shah Shahida Akhter, Coordinator of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) Sylhet chapter, said: \"This is a bilateral problem. It can only be sorted through discussions between the two countries.\" Ministry of Environment and Forests requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 24, 2008 to take diplomatic measures to protect the agricultural land. Subsequently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka in 2009. Nevertheless, no further progress has been noticed.  At a meeting held between Sunamganj 17 Rifles Battalion and Shillong 83 BSF Battalion of India in the Meghalaya hills in November 2008 Bangladesh submitted a memorandum that called for stopping the unplanned extraction of stones in the hills. Asked about the crisis, General Secretary of the Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA) Abdul Matin said: \"Such cross-border environmental issues exist in many countries of the world.  \"But we have not noticed any effective initiative to overcome the problems of the sand pollution and disaster coming from India.\" he added. \"Nevertheless, the life and livelihood of the people of Tahirpur of Sunamganj are in jeopardy due to the sand, along with an issue of environmental disasters. Therefore, it is crucial to take sincere and pragmatic initiatives from the highest levels of the two countries,\" Matin said. "

      "text": "Date Published:2018-07-19 00:00:00      \nSeveral foreign tourists have been sexually assaulted in India in recent months Indian police were holding six men on Thursday after a Russian tourist was allegedly drugged and gang-raped in a popular southern tourist town, officials said. Media reports said the 21-year-old had bite marks on her face and arms when she was found naked and unconscious on the floor of her hostel room early on Monday. \"Six men have been detained over the rape and drugging of the woman,\" investigating officer Mangayar Karasi told AFP. The woman, who was travelling on her own, had arrived in the town of Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu state, 190 kilometres from Chennai, last Thursday. Those in custody included the hostel manger and her tourist guide, who told police he found her on the floor hours after they had consensual sex, another investigator said. She said the woman was being treated in hospital for a drug overdose and minor injuries, with efforts being made to record her statement. The medical report has confirmed sexual assault, the officer said.  Local and foreign tourists flock to Tiruvannamalai for its 9th-century Annamalaiyar Temple, one of the largest Hindu temple complexes spread over 25 acres. Sexual violence is rife in India with nearly 110 rapes reported every day but activists say that figure is the tip of the iceberg as most cases go unreported. Several foreign tourists have been sexually assaulted in India in recent months. Last month a Japanese tourist was raped by a taxi driver in a north Indian town, followed by the rape of a 20-year-old Canadian tourist by her guest house owner in Delhi. India's junior interior minister Wednesday told the national parliament that 110,333 rape cases were reported in the country between 2014 and 2016.  The country's dire record on sexual violence has been in the global spotlight since the 2012 gang-rape and murder of a woman on a New Delhi bus sparked angry protests. The incident led to tougher sentences and reforms in the country's rape laws but sexual crime against women, as well as against minors, remains rampant. "

No representative of the community has been appointed since Kauching Chak resigned on February 8 this year.  The Chak people had complained about his negligence to council Chairman Kyaw Shwe Hla and the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affair's (MoCHTA) State Minister Bir Bahadur Ushwe Sing.  The post was declared vacant on March 6 on the president's order. Sources say the council's recommendation to fill the vacancy has stalled at MoCHTA. MoCHTA increased the number of council members to 15, from five, with Kyaw as the chairman, on March 25, 2015. The council is comprised of representatives of 11 indigenous communities and Bangalis. This 2017 file photo shows a number of Chak community people are participating in health camp in the district | Dhaka TribuneCouncil sources say the absence of Chak representatives deprives the community of development and other facilities. \"We are facing many problems as we do not have a representative,\" Naikhyangchhari Chak leader Headman Mongchanu Chak told the Dhaka Tribune. He demanded the vacancy be filled as soon as possible. Sources say the prime minister will appoint new members to the district council as per MoCHTA's recommendation.  Awami League's Naikhyangchhari Upazila unit Vice-President Taslim Iqbal Chowdhury said: \"The Chak community is falling behind - socially and economically. A member should be appointed soon.\" Bandarban district council Chairman Kyaw told the Dhaka Tribune that they sent an application to MoCHTA to appoint a new member. \"We have yet to hear from them,\" he said"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-07-05 00:00:00      \nAfter civil war in the early 1990s, which destroyed much of the city, the Taliban took control in 1996, imposing strict Islamic law The aging Ariana Afghan Airlines Boeing 727 took off from Islamabad with about 10 passengers, myself included, huddled near the exits, bound for war-torn Kabul months after the 2001 fall of the Taliban. The Afghan capital had been consigned to rubble by rocket-propelled grenades and artillery fire, first in fighting between mujahideen warriors and the Soviets after their invasion in 1979, and then between different mujahideen factions. The airport was fringed with burnt-out fighter planes and scores of people, a skewer in each hand, scouring the tarmac for landmines. Someone put a ladder up against the fuselage, opened a flap, poured in some liquid and threw the empty can over his shoulder. Fast forward 16 years, or four World Cups. I fly in from Dubai, sipping red wine as we descend into Kabul, a city transformed from rubble into a bustling capital, though still visibly plagued by the escalating war with Taliban insurgents. The centre of the city is a heavily protected zone of concrete fortresses, razor wire and well-protected checkpoints. The ruins of an office building near the presidential palace bear witness to a massive bomb last year that killed 150 people. But in other areas, such as in the west of the city, shining blocks of flats have replaced the debris, behind lines of stalls and shops selling fresh vegetables, smart phones, fashion and kitchenware and the all-important building materials. The memory of women bowed by the all-enveloping burqa, enforced under Taliban rule, trudging past destroyed homes is also fading amid talk of possible further Taliban ceasefires, upcoming elections, the national cricket team's first \"test\" match against India - and the World Cup. \"The city has been transformed,\" said Omaid Sharifi, co-founder of ArtLords, a group promoting Afghan culture that is best known for painting murals on the city's many concrete blast walls. \"On the street, boys and girls are walking together. ... There is art, culture and music. People are contributing. People are being more kind.\" The heavy security presence across Kabul underscores the danger that continues to face the city, where hundreds of civilians have been killed and wounded in attacks this year and where regular blackouts and flooding make life a misery for many. But amid the danger, prosperity has improved for fortunate members of Kabul's middle class, which grew up on the flood of money that came into the city following the US-led campaign that overthrew the Taliban in 2001. Four women, their made-up faces free of veils, giggle as their car takes on what have become heavily jammed streets of workaday Kabul. A top-of-the-range tailor shows off his ware in a long, air-conditioned shop that would not be out of place in Paris. \"Business is good now and getting better,\" the tailor said. \"My quality is number one. European standards. I am happy.\" A few cafes have popped up down lanes where musicians and artists, who thrived in the pre-Soviet invasion days, have returned. But this part of the city is also home to many fair-skinned Hazaras, an Afghan minority often targeted by militants. After civil war in the early 1990s, which destroyed much of the city, the Taliban took control in 1996, imposing strict Islamic law. After a brief respite following the 2001 campaign, the city has been subjected to wave after wave of suicide attacks. \"That was the darkest period,\" said Sharifi of the years of Taliban rule. \"You couldn't even listen to music.\" He remembers being taken to see football matches by his father. Twice, the games were preceded by executions. \"My father tried to protect me and close my eyes. But a kid's curiosity - I could see with one eye. A bunch of guys turned up in three cars and killed the men. Like sheep.\" So what next for the fast-growing capital, sitting up against the khaki mountains of the Hindu Kush? An unprecedented three-day ceasefire by the Taliban over last month's Eid ul-Fitr festive period brought them roaming into the capital for hugs and selfies and raised hopes for a longer peace. \"You can't ignore the Taliban,\" Sharifi said. \"But there are red lines. If they come back and join the political process, we will be there with our art. People can't just keep killing.\" The tailor agreed. \"If the Taliban come back, it will be with a new government, not like before,\" he said. \"We will have a good future if there is no fighting.\" "

      "text": "Date Published:2018-10-30 00:00:00      \nExperts say the river water will be undrinkable in five years The cost of safe drinking water in Dhaka will triple if no action is taken against its current trend of pollution, a deputy director of the Department of Environment has warned. The bulk of Dhaka's water presently comes from groundwater provided by Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Dhaka Wasa). As the water table is now depleting faster than it can replenished, however, Dhaka Wasa has turned to Meghna river as an alternative, which has already started becoming polluted.  \"If the (river) pollution continues, the water quality may further deteriorate, leading to a very high price for making it drinkable through treatment,\" DoE deputy director Md Mustafizur Rahman Akhand said.  According to a recent report released by the DoE, Dhaka Wasa and other stakeholders, if the current pollution trend continues, a toxic mix of pollutants is going to make the Meghna river water undrinkable in five years. The joint report \"Protecting Water Quality of the Meghna River for Dhaka's Sustainable Water Supply\" was released under the Dhaka Environmentally Sustainable Water Supply Project (DESWSP) on October 11. The report's other stakeholders were the Department for Forests and Climate Change, the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It urged better governance and law enforcement to protect the river from uncontrolled industrialization, the dumping of waste, and the use of pesticides. 'Drastic rise' in pollution Currently, Dhaka Wasa supplies 605 deep tube wells in Dhaka with groundwater. Every year, the groundwater level declines by 2-3 metre, creating a shortage and causing 30-40 deep tube wells to become ineffective.  Authorities have turned to Meghna River as an alternative.  However, there are around 2,000 industrial factories situated along the banks of the Meghna in Narsingdi and Narayanganj, of which many are washing and dying factories which emit chemical waste into the river.  Most of these factories do not have any Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) and the ones that do hardly ever run them. Thirteen large factories are discharging wastewater directly into the river. Under the Meghna project, the authority will pump water from two intake points 30 kilometres away from Dhaka via the Bisnondi and Haria canals.  This is despite Bisnondi canal being routinely polluted with waste from a number of small-and medium-sized textile factories, as well as by untreated domestic waste. The other canals  located upstream - including Amider, Boatarder and Harihuda - are also being heavily polluted. The report also says that the Meghna has a high presence of E-coli from the domestic waste of 3.3 million people who live in the area.  The river also has high levels of the organophosphate insecticide Dimethoate, the herbicide Diuron, and the fungicide Carbendazim, and contains unacceptable levels of heavy metals such as chromium. The level of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) - the element most essential for the survival of fish, invertebrates, bacteria and underwater plants - has also fallen to below acceptable levels over the past two decades, making the waters inhospitable to life.  In 2002, the DO level of the Meghna was 7.5mg per litre, falling to 6mg by 2011 - both acceptable levels. From 2012 to 2016, however, the DO level fell to as low as 4.6mg.  Since 2007, the level of Electrical Conductivity (EC) - a measurement of dissolved pollutants in the water - has increased from 124 to 164 microsiemens per centimetre. Prior to 2007, it was around 100. The rise in the EC level directly affects the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Although COD standard for drinking water is 4mg per litre, the rate in the Meghna was found to be as high as 38mg from May 2016 to Jan 2017. What can be done? A director of the environment department, who wished to remain anonymous, said selected areas will be declared as Ecological Critical Areas (ECA) to prohibit the setting up of environmentally dangerous industries in order to maintain water quality and to prevent pollution.  \"In addition, the government has planned a number of economic zones both upstream and downstream of the intake points,\" he said. The Department of Environment (DoE) is providing technical assistance for the Dhaka Wasa project. \"If these areas can be declared as an ECA, industrialization can go in a planned and controlled way,\" said Md Mustafizur Rahman Akhand, DoE deputy director.   \"Industries with state of the art technology to treat their waste properly will be eligible to get environmental clearance certificate in the ECA. Also, existing industries can also be monitored properly.\" "

At a press conference at the party president's political office in Dhanmondi on Wednesday evening, Quader spoke to the media on various current issues. \"There should be some clarification about keeping some of our top leaders out of the election,\" he said. The ruling party has not nominated its joint general secretaries Abdur Rahman and Jahangir Kabir Nanak, and organizing secretaries Bahauddin Nasim, Ahmad Hossain and BM Mozammel Haque for the upcoming 11th general election. These leaders will be involved in conducting the election activities of the party, Quader said.  \"Our experienced and skilled leadership, who should be conducting the electoral activities, usually take part in the elections themselves. This time our leader has taken a decision,\" he added. \"There are many precedents of this. In India, BJP keeps its top leaders out of election,\" Quader said. He said Prime Minister and Awami League President Sheikh Hasina had sat down with these top leaders and given them some instructions. \"In democratic politics, not everybody takes part in elections. In India, many leaders avoid elections in order to help their parties,\" he said."

      "text": "Date Published:2018-09-06 00:00:00      \nArchitect Mohammed Rezwan's brainchild project is one of twenty-five designs and innovations to be exhibited at 'Design with the 90%'   Floating school innovator Architect Mohammed Rezwan's designs - floating school, training centre and health clinic of Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha - have once again been selected for inclusion in the forthcoming exhibition, 'Design with the 90%' organized by Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  The 'Design with the 90%' exhibition is focused on design solutions that addressed the most basic needs of the 90% of the world's population not traditionally served by professional designers. It is the third in a series of themed exhibitions that demonstrate how design can be a dynamic force in transforming and, in many cases, saving lives.  The exhibition will be on view from September 13, 2018 - May 19, 2019 at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's Headquarters Discovery Center in Seattle, Washington, United States.  The exhibition will highlight 25 designs and innovations including affordable and sustainable shelter, food, drinking water, sanitation, education, and health solutions for the most marginalized communities around the world. The exhibition will feature Shidhulai's school-boat along with D-Rev's ReMotion Knee (an affordable prosthetic that helps to restore natural movement), Bernard Kiwia's Bicycle Phone Charger (a mobile phone charger made from scrap bike and radio parts), PATH's Freeze-Preventive Vaccine Carrier (ensure the right temperature to keep vaccines from accidentally freezing during transport to rural areas) and other innovations. The organizers selected Rezwan's school-boat because of its innovative approach towards making education more accessible, and because of the way it helps integrate sustainable alternative technologies with Bangladeshi vernacular tradition. Furthermore, the school-boat now defines the social design movement by improving the daily living conditions of people in flood-prone areas. \"We are thrilled to bring this exhibition to the Gates Foundation to highlight the important role that design and innovative approaches can play in solving some of the world's most critical challenges that determine the quality of life for millions of people around the world,\" says Ms. Charlotte Beall, Deputy Director of the Gates Foundation Discovery Center.  Architect Mohammed Rezwan is the founding Executive Director of 'Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha'. He invented 'floating education system' to ensure access to year round and quality education in flood-prone regions. He developed, expanded, and sustained floating schools over 16 years period.  The non-profit organization, 'Shidhulai Swaniravar Sangstha' has been rendering exemplary service in providing education to children in flood-prone areas, who otherwise have no access to education. Rezwan introduced floating school in 2002, and other organizations started replicating it in 2010s. Now floating schools are replicated in eight countries - transforming the lives of millions. \"Architects usually design for the people who have the capacity to build buildings.  \"I always thought, 'Why can't an architect design wonderful things for the poor people living in rural communities?' That's the reason all of our projects are design solutions to solve social problems. After 16 years of designing the school-boat, our work will be showcased at the Gates Foundation again, for the second time. As an architect I am really honored, I hope we will be able to develop more life-transforming designs and impact more lives in flood-prone areas. Also I hope this recognition will encourage young designers, architects and non-designers to develop such design approaches to improve the rural communities around the world,\" says Rezwan. Also, the S AM (Swiss Architecture Museum) exhibited Rezwan's school-boat design in the 'Bengal Stream' architectural exhibition in Basel in Switzerland during 2017-2018. This travelling exhibition is scheduled to present in Architecture Center Arc-en-reve in Bordeaux in France, German Architecture Museum in Frankfurt, and Royal Academy in London during 2018-2020."

A circular issued by the Public Administration Ministry on Monday made Deputy Commissioner and District Magistrate Golamur Rahman and replaced him with Power Division Deputy Secretary Shahriaz. The move follows a written sexual harassment allegation submitted to the ministry by a female officer in the Natore district administration. The officer in her letter, submitted on October 24, said she had been working in that district since 2017. Golamur Rahman became Natore DC on October 9. She said Golamur had transferred her to another department immediately after taking up the post. He also asked her to take official documents and meet him at the circuit house where he lived alone. Three days after joining, the female officer alleged, Golamur connected with her on Facebook Messenger and sent her frequent messages. Often he sent the messages at late hours, seeking explanations from her the next morning if she did not reply. On October 15 he made grossly inappropriate proposals to the female officer. The Dhaka Tribune has received what appear to be screenshots of messages between the officer and Golamur Rahman. The messages attest to the allegations made by the officer. However, the Dhaka Tribune has not been able to verify the authenticity of these screenshots. On October 22 the Public Administration Ministry transferred the female officer to another district. Golamur also tried to interfere with this transfer."

The family of Tasfia and Adnan claim that the murder mystery will be solved when suspect Sohail is arrested.\nMohammad Amin, the victim's father, said, \"Sohail is a close friend of Adnan. Everything will be solved if Sohail is brought to book.\"\nHe alleged that Adnan had his daughter killed by his friends. \"I want exemplary punishment for the killers,\" Amin added.\nChattogram Metropolitan Police (Karnaphuli Zone) Assistant Commissioner Zahedul Islam said they were conducting drives to arrest Sohail and other accused, hoping to find out the reason behind the killing \"within a very short time.\"\nAmin filed a case with Patenga police accusing six persons including Adnan, a ninth grader of Bangladesh Elementary School, Sohail, 16, Sowkot Miraz, 16, Asif Mizan, 23, Imtiaj Sultan Ekram, 24, and Firoj, 30.\nAdnan is the son of Iskander Mirza, a businessman.\nAmin claimed that his 16-year-old daughter, who studied at Sunshine Grammar School, and Adnan were involved in a romantic relationship for about two to three months. But their affair turned sour for some reason. That is why, Amin suspects, Adnan and the other accused took his daughter to the beach and killed her.\nTasfia's father accused police of wasting time. \"Police can arrest the accused within a short time if they want. The reason behind the delay is not clear to us,\" he said.\nIskandar claimed that his son was innocent, saying that his family too wanted the murder to be solved.\nTasfia's family members said she had gone out to meet Adnan around 5pm on May 1.\n\"My son is innocent. He (Adnan) left the house at 5pm that day. He saw off the girl in the evening and went to his aunt's at 7pm,\" he said.\n\"He went out again after receiving a call from Tasfia's father and was with him until 11pm. He returned home at 11:45pm. Adnan was in the house until 5pm the next day. Then how was my son involved with the murder?\"\nPolice: We're trying our best\nPolice said that Adnan developed a relationship with Tasfia through Facebook five months ago. He had earlier studied at Sunshine Grammar School and later shifted to Bangladesh Elementary School.\nTasfia had been missing since Tuesday after going out to meet Adnan. The duo met at a restaurant in the city's Golpahara on Tuesday evening. Adnan's friend Sohail was also with them.\nAfter Tasfia's mother called her over phone, they went out of the restaurant and left the place separately by auto-rickshaws. But Tasfia did not return home.\nHours later, Tasfia's family called Adnan and wanted to know her whereabouts. Adnan went to Tasfia's house around 8pm and stayed with them until 11pm.\nThe girl's body was found on the concrete block of the Karnaphuli River at the Naval Road area the next day with multiple injury marks to her knees and forehead.\nAccording to the case filed by Amin, Tasfia's face was bruised and battered and there were signs that her body had been dragged around.\nTasfia's mobile phone could not be recovered. Meanwhile, her viscera samples have been sent to Dhaka to ascertain the cause of death.\nEarlier, police had requested a Chattogram court to allow them to interrogate Adnan for 10 days in their custody. But the court rejected the plea and ordered on Sunday to question the suspect in presence of the superintendent of Gazipur Juvenile Correction Centre, since he was not an adult.\nPatenga police's Officer-in-Charge Abul Kashem Bhuiyan said, \"We are trying our best to arrest the accused. We are conducting raids. We will be able to determine the real cause of death after getting the post-mortem report.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Date Published:2018-06-23 00:00:00      \nUN Under-Secretary-General Adama Dieng praises Bangladesh for the response to the refugee crisis The United Nations (UN) on Saturday commended the commitment demonstrated by the government of Bangladesh in supporting the Rohingya refugees and stressed that the root causes of the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar must be addressed. \"The Bangladeshi people demonstrated very early on, their solidarity towards the Rohingya people, providing them with shelter and support when they arrived,\" said UN Under Secretary General and Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide Adama Dieng. The under secretary general was addressing the closing session of a workshop titled \"Fostering Peaceful and Inclusive Communities in Bangladesh: The Role of Religious Leaders and Actors\" at a hotel in the city. He stressed the importance of ensuring Rohingya refugees are given opportunities to uplift themselves educationally and have access to livelihood opportunities in Bangladesh until they can return to Myanmar. Adama Dieng said religious leaders can play a very important role by promoting messages of peace and tolerance and by fostering dialogue between the Rohingya refugees and host communities. \"I hope the religious leaders and actors, as well as policy makers and civil society representatives present here today will continue to show this same humanity\", Dieng said. Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Md Nojibur Rahman, conveyed Sheikh Hasina's message of support for interfaith initiatives that promote social cohesion and respond to pressing development challenges in Cox's Bazar district resulting from the influx of Rohingya refugees. Stressing that the government of Bangladesh was fully committed to working with the United Nations and civil society to address the Rohingya crisis, the principal secretary encouraged religious leaders to also support this cause. UN Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh Mia Seppo emphasized that the government and the people of Bangladesh are the biggest donors to the Rohingya response.  She said the UN is committed to assisting Bangladesh, but it was host communities in Cox's Bazar who were the true 'first responders'. Mia Seppo praised Bangladeshi host communities for their compassion, stating that Bangladesh's traumatic experience in 1971, with millions of Bangladeshis forced to flee as refugees, had made the country particularly generous towards refugees from other nations. She also underlined that the biggest challenge in the region is to ensure a sense of hope for a better future, and that interventions need to address the urgent needs of Bangladeshi host communities affected by the crisis, just as they also aim to improve conditions for the refugees themselves. During the second and last day of the event, a broad range of Bangladeshi religious leaders and actors, government policymakers, academics, civil society and United Nations representatives discussed ways to promote dialogue and social cohesion in Cox's Bazar following the influx of Rohingya refugees. The event was jointly organized by the United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in partnership with the Save and Serve Foundation. The meeting also focused on how the Plan of Action for Religious Leaders and Actors to Prevent Incitement to Violence that Could Lead to Atrocity Crimes, developed by the Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect and launched by the United Nations Secretary General in July 2017, could be implemented in the areas in Cox's Bazar affected by the Rohingya crisis. Meanwhile, Deputy Spokesman for the UN SecretaryGeneral Farhan Haq said the UN is trying to facilitate the safe and voluntary return of the Rohingya refugees to Myanmar. \"We need to make sure that the conditions in Myanmar are conducive to their return,\" he told reporters in a regular briefing at the UN headquarters on Friday."

The NGO brings a ray of sunshine to the lives of people through  many training programs it offers at its Friendship Centre in the Gaibandha district, such as teaching, medicine, law and even theatre. The establishment, located in Madaner para, in the Kanchipara union of the Fulchhari upazila, Gaibandha, has impressive architecture designed by eminent architect Kashef Mahboob Chowdhury. The Friendship Centre built as a live-in training centre for the NGO's community social workers that helps people inhabiting nearby chars (riverine islands) inspired by the Buddhist monastic architecture of the North Bengal flood plains, was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2016. They were inspired by Louis Kahn, an American architect, who designed Buddhist monasteries with its forms and planned drawing on influences that integrated structural designs, which blends with natural serenity and modernity in perfectly. The NGO is getting accolades from the world over for its astounding architectural beauty. Offices, library, meeting rooms, and prayer and tea rooms adorn its spectacular premises in pavilion-like buildings surrounded by courts and pools. The Centre is also rented out for outside meetings, training, and conferences as a means of generating income.  The local hand-made brick construction has been inspired by the monastic aesthetic works of the 3rd century BC ruins of Mahasthangarh, the earliest urban archaeological site found in Bangladesh. In line with the rural orientation the single storey building is surrounded with greenery that it looks like a greenfield in a bird's eye view.  As Gaibandha is susceptible to flooding and earthquakes, and whose low-bearing soil has a low bearing capacity, the building is surrounded by embankments with a water run-off pumping facility which increases its beauty and protects the establishment. Constructed and finished primarily of one material - local hand-made bricks - the spaces are woven out of pavilions, courtyards, pools and greens, corridors and shadows encircled by trees. Lokman Hossain, manager of the centre said, to help and empower one of the neglected parts of the country, Friendship, the NGO established this 32000 sq ft training centre in 2011 on 7 bighas of land costing Tk8 crore in the riverine island of Gaibandha. The Friendship Centre is divided into two sections, the outer \"Ka\" block for the offices, library, and training classrooms and the inner \"Kha\" block for the residential section. At a time, 80 people can be trained here in four separate classrooms. He said: \"Our programs, including health, education, capacity building and women empowerment, are targeted at some of the poorest people in the country.\" He elaborated on their vision in making the building with the idea \"Simplicity is the intent, monastic is the feel.\""

The Rohingyas, including 17 children and six women, arrived on the other side of the border of the Kajiatoli area under the Kasba upazila on Friday evening to enter Bangladesh. They were escorted back by the BSF members on Tuesday morning in about six vehicles, confirmed Gopinathpur union parishad Chairman SM Mannan Jahangir and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) 25th Battalion Commander Lt Col Muhammad Golam Kabir. According to BSF Tripura Frontier sources, the 31 Rohingyas were officially handed over to the nearest Amtoli police station on Tuesday morning,  and later in the day, the West Tripura District Judicial Court in India put them in jail for the next 14 days Tension in border Gopinathpur Chairman SM Mannan Jahangir claimed the BSF was trying to force the refugees into Bangladesh. The BGB, meanwhile, intensified their vigil to prevent the Rohingyas from entering the country. Multiple flag meetings between BGB and BSF yielded no results. Mannan said the BGB had tightened security at the border to deter illegal entry into Bangladesh. Reports were circulating since Saturday that the BSF was trying to push in the Rohingyas, which the Indian force refuted in a statement. Inhumane situation The BSF set up tents for the Rohingyas and supplied them with food, before taking them back in phases on Tuesday. For the past four days, the 31 Rohingyas were living under the sky in the chilling cold, which made them ill. Cold and hunger took toll on the children as well. Indian central government denies involvement The Indian government said it is not a party to movements of Rohingyas, mentioning that it is aware of media reports of alleged movement into Bangladesh by some such persons, reports UNB. Also Read- BGB-BSF flag meeting yields no solution for 31 Rohingyas on B'baria border \"The government (India) is not a party to such movements,\" said a Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson in response to a question about the presence of Rohingya refugees stranded on the India-Bangladesh boundary in Tripura. The spokesperson said they will work with their neighbours to handle such matters through mutual consultation. \"The government is aware of the presence of 31 persons originally from the Rakhine State of Myanmar, currently at the Zero Line on the India-Bangladesh border,\" said the MEA spokesperson. Too little, too late? Reports published on Tuesday in the Dhaka Tribune said over 1,300 Rohingyas have arrived since May 2018. Though displeased at the arrival of Rohingyas from India to an already-overburdened Bangladesh, Dhaka is yet to take up this issue with New Delhi, according to a senior government official. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and the officials said that the issue will soon be raised with the Indians. However, they could not come up with a satisfactory answer when asked why this issue has not yet been discussed with the country's first neighbour; especially since Rohingyas have been arriving in Bangladesh from India since May last year. Some of the officials expressed their \"displeasure\" with India over the issue and questioned India's \"good intentions\" regarding helping Bangladesh on this issue."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-26 00:00:00      \nThe move has yet to be endorsed by UN agencies and major bilateral donors A global rights group cast doubt on Friday on Dhaka's claims that thousands of Rohingya refugees are ready to move to Bhashan Char that critics say is prone to natural disasters. Dhaka has long wanted to move 100,000 people to the silt islet of Bhashan Char to relieve overcrowded mainland camps where almost a million Rohingya have lived since fleeing a brutal military crackdown in Myanmar in 2017. Officials have said that between 6,000-7,000 Rohingya have already expressed their willingness to be relocated to the island, starting in November.  But Fortify Rights said it interviewed 14 Rohingya at three camps, including some who appeared on lists of refugees allegedly willing to go, and found that none had been consulted \"and all opposed it.\" \"The island is not a sustainable solution for refugees and no one knows that better than the #Rohingya themselves,\" says @matthewfsmith @FortifyRights. We interviewed 14 Rohingya no one said they were willing to go to Bhasan Char. @AFP: https://t.co/TSMv12qBY7 One woman on the list told Fortify Rights: \"If the Bangladesh government forces me to go to the island, I will commit suicide by drinking poison here in the camp. I will not go there... No one told me I was on the list.\" \"We are afraid of living near the water. People say that it takes four hours by boat to reach the island... Even if they force me to go there, I will not go,\" the US-based group quoted another woman as saying. It added that officials were pressuring Rohingya camp leaders to identify those to be relocated, and that it had seen a copy of a list identifying more than 70 families. \"The island is not a sustainable solution for refugees and no one knows that better than the Rohingya themselves,\" said Fortify Rights' Chief Executive Officer Matthew Smith.  Global rights group casts doubt on #Bangladesh claims that thousands of #Rohingya refugees are ready to move to a new island, saying many seem to oppose it and have not been consulted on the matterhttps://t.co/ERxHnXOKcD Other rights groups have also expressed misgivings about moving people to the island in the Bay of Bengal - which takes around three hours by boat to reach. The move has yet to be endorsed by UN agencies and major bilateral donors. Earlier this week US Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia Alice G Wells urged caution during a House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. \"We urge Bangladesh to postpone any refugee relocations to Bhashan Char until independent experts can determine it is a suitable location,\" she said. Bangladesh is growing impatient with the Rohingya's presence in the country, and has clamped down on them since a repatriation attempt collapsed in August with not one of the refugees agreeing to return to Myanmar.  This week the project's chief architect told AFP that the island and its storm-proof buildings would be protected by 11-feet high perimeter, calling it \"one of the safest embankments\" in Bangladesh. \"It will be safer than any other coastal region in Bangladesh,\" Ahmed Mukta from London-based firm MDM Architects said, saying it would be \"heaven\" for the Rohingya compared to their crowded, \"inhumane\" camps."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-28 00:00:00      \nBangladesh to hold expo in Brazil from November 7 to 8 to explore the export market The increase in import cost of onion is responsible for the sudden upsurge in onion prices at Bangladeshi kitchen markets, says Senior Commerce Secretary Md Mofizul Islam. He said: \"Onion prices have gone up in India by Tk10 to 12 per kilograms due to flood. As a result, the import cost has also gone up and Bangladeshi markets are witnessing the effect.\" The secretary said this in a press briefing on the outcome of Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi's recently concluded tour to Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The commerce minister visited the South American countries from Aug 14 to 24 to explore the markets to boost export.  Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said: \"Bangladesh will hold an expo in Brazil from November 7 to 8 to explore the export markets, especially for apparel goods.\" The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce & Industries (FBCCI), with assistance from the government, will organize the expo while Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) will coordinate the event.   Onion prices at the capital's kitchen markets shot up to Tk50 to 55 per kg from Tk40 last week, which the traders blamed on supply shortage. Nurul Haque, a Karwan Bazar-based wholesaler, said there was minimal import of onion after Eid-ul-Azha, causing the prices increase. \"The onion market is heavily dependent on imports, especially from India,\" he said. The wholesaler however hinted that prices might come down in a day or two as onion imports would start to increase again.   According to traders, Bangladesh consumes about 2.8 million tons of onion annually, of which about 50% are met by local produces and the rest with imported ones.   In fiscal year 2017-18, 2.33 million tons of onion was produced in 212,194 hectares in the country."

      "authors": "Md Saidun Nabi",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-25 00:00:00      \nExperts say the growing trend of land grabbing has put Dhaka under massive threat At least 3,483 acres of water bodies and lowlands across the metropolitan area in Dhaka have been filled up in the last nine years, causing concern among experts and environmentalists. Concerned by the earth filling in the name of development, the experts have said the government and its relevant agencies must take a strong position against land grabbers. Speaking at a media briefing on the situation of filling up of water bodies in Dhaka and its surrounding areas, violating the city's Detailed Area Plan (DAP), they said the government must also take proper and strict measures in restoring the water bodies and wetlands. The briefing took place on Thursday at the Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) office in Dhaka. Speaking at the event, the environment experts expressed their resentment as a number of government agencies, along with private organizations and individuals, have filled in many water bodies, low-lying areas, canals and rivers not only in and around Dhaka, but across the country. However, they did not categorically list how much wetland areas have faced earth filling or grabbing by the government agencies. Presenting a study on the topic, Adil Mohammad Khan, general secretary of Bangladesh Institute of Planners, said that Dhaka city has lost 36% of its water bodies to earth filling, considering the DAP adopted for the capital in 2010. The parts of the city under the jurisdiction of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkah (Rajuk) had 100,937 acres of water bodies and lowlands nine years ago, but 22% of those - 22,156 acres - have been filled up since then, greatly contributing to the perennial water-logging issue, he said.  However, the study, prepared based on satellite images, did not identify the land grabbers, he said, pledging that their identities will be confirmed and disclosed in the next report. Adil requested the government agencies responsible for protecting and monitoring the water bodies to publish an annual report, with the officials concerned held accountable for their duties. Citing the rampant and growing trend of land grabbing and environmental degradation, TIB Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman said Dhaka is facing an existential threat. \"If the authorities responsible are being negligent in duty, people have to raise their voices,\" he said. \"There is no scope of having faith (on action or pledges against the accused). Many in the government and in the administration do not want the rule of law to be in place,\" he viewed. Iftekharuzzaman attributed the current situation to the parliament, where 62% of the lawmakers are actually businessmen, saying: \"Now we can see the negative impact of having so many businessmen representing (the people) in the house. Businessmen, in association with the administration and politicians, harm the environment.\" Building public consensus emphasized The TIB chief suggested dissolving the tripartite syndicate and building public consensus to this end. Welcoming the High Court orders on the illegal BGMEA building and Modhumoti housing project, Iftekharuzzaman said the problem is that the government is not proactive in fighting the land grabbers. He also went on to say that the mindless earth filling and grabbing of water bodies clearly depict that irregularities have taken an organizational shape in the country.  Iftekharuzzaman said an upcoming revised DAP must address the matter seriously. Rajuk, which is largely blamed for the sorry state of the water bodies, must be made accountable for the losses incurred, and its activities have to be transparent, he said. Land grabbers to be punished on the spot Mubasshar Hussain, former president of Institute of Architects, Bangladesh (IEB), said land grabbers have to be tried and punished instantly on the spot, regardless of their political identity. He also suggested that a stricter law and tougher watchdog can stop such criminal offences. \"If we can't go for technology-based monitoring, we will lag behind and will help the culprits to take advantage,\" he opined. Bangladesh Poribesh Andolan (Bapa) Joint Secretary Iqbal Habib said: \"We are already late in addressing the issue. I hope the government will take this report into account and in due course, will take necessary measures.\" \"The filling of water bodies gained momentum in 1995, and the crisis has been deepening since then,\" he stated. Most water bodies were not marked in the previous development map until the DAP was issued in 2010, leading to the current situation, he said, adding that the authorities concerned should have put emphasis on tech-based surveillance to check the situation. Feroz Ahmed Kanak, a research associate at the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services, who released another report at the event, said the Amin Bazar landfill is a burning example of grabbing. It was built on a 52-acre land in 2004, but has expanded over the years to nearly 100 acres, mainly due to the negligence of the authorities, he said. \"Even before the DAP was designed, the dumping yard was not considered as a flood flow zone,\" mentioned Feroz. Jointly organised by TIB, BAPA, BIP, Nodi O Poribesh Unnoyon Parishad, and Bangladesh Environment Lawyers' Association (Bela), the event was addressed, among others, by BUET Professor Ishrat Islam."

Water Development Board Executive Engineer Abu Raihan and Sub Assistant Engineer Ashrafuzzaman Khan said strong currents, huge waves and an onrush of flood waters from the upper regions are causing the erosion. On a visit to the area on Monday it was  found that the authorities were trying to stop the erosion by erecting a barrier made of concrete cement blocks, stones, CC blocks and sand-bags to protect the area. Subhash Chandra Roy, president of the distriict Puja Udjapin Committee said the Meghna has devoured the basements of four Hindu Temples along with other houses on the Harishava Road. When contacted, Water Development Board Engineer Mohammad Rafiqullah said they have placed 2,500 geobags at vulnerable points till 6 pm on Sunday. Sub Assistant Engineer Ashrafuzzaman Khan, who surveyed the depth of the river, said it was about 45 to 65 feet at different points of the erosion area, and a length of almost 200 metres had been eroded. Another 500-metre area is under threat of fresh erosion as many cracks have developed in different spots.     Meanwhile, hundreds of curious men, women and children gathered at the erosion-heavy sites where police, and DB men were deployed to prevent people from visiting or loitering around vulnerable points. Local councilor Md Ali Majhee said at least 35 families have lost their homes so far due to the erosion along 200 metres of the town protection embankment. Many families are on the verge of becoming homeless, he added. Deputy Commissioner Shawkkat Osman said the district administration has taken steps to take the victims to safer places. Deputy Minister for Water Resources AKM Enamul Haque Shamim MP visited the area on Monday. He said, \" We have taken steps to protect the area from the river erosion.\""

The new act proposes to enhance existing fine of Tk50,000 to Tk5 lakh and also inflict one-year jail to persons at fault. \"The cabinet in principle approved the draft of Mongla Port Authority Act 2019 by replacing The Chalna Port Authority Ordinance, 1976 making some additions, adjustments and rearrangements of the laws,\" Cabinet Secretary Mohammad Shafiul Alam told a news briefing at the secretariat in Dhaka on Monday. The Mongla, earlier known as Chalna, was renamed as Mongla in 1987 and the port had so far been running under The Chalna Port Authority Ordinance, 1976, he said. Definition of the inland vessels has been incorporated into the new law adding few more terms such as lease, terminal, berth and container freight station to it. Moreover, the new law proposes incorporation of some sections and changes as well into it, he said. Under the proposed law one would now face jail term up to one year and Tk5 lakh fine instead of existing Tk50,000 for polluting environment, he said. The new law suggested enhancement of jail term up to two years from existing six months and Tk2 lakh fine from existing Tk50,000 for violating the law. It also recommended for six months imprisonment and Tk2 lakh fine from the existing six months and Tk50,000 respectively on charges of evading tolls, he said. Trial of the offences committed under the law will be held in accordance with the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code), he added.  Simultaneously, Shafiul said, in the proposed law there would be a board of seven members instead of four to run the port. Two new sections, one with provision of \"restricted port are\" and the rest for appointing operator, have been added to the law, he informed. The cabinet also approved the draft of two policies- Neuro-Developmental Disabilities (NDD) Related Integrated/Special Education Policy 2019 and Non Neuro-Developmental Disabilities Related Integrated/Special Education Policy 2019 by incorporating a set of guidelines. \"In line with the policies none can establish educational institutions for the disabled people without prior permission of the government. If anyone violates the policies he or she will be liable for punishment,\" the cabinet secretary said. The policy suggested having at least 75 students for approval of setting up an educational institution for the disabled, he said. It should be ensured that there would be a teacher against each five autistic students in such institutions, he said. At the beginning of the meeting, the prime minister unveiled a book of poetry titled \"Swapno Panshi\" written by Science and Technology Minister Yafesh Osman. Besides, the cabinet approved in principle the draft of \"The Chandpur Science and Technology University Act, 2019.\" The cabinet also approved two separate proposals to form a company titled \"Start Up Bangladesh Limited\" under Bangladesh Computer Council to create more entrepreneurs in the country's ICT sector and a joint venture company titled \"Bangladesh Power Equipment Manufacturing Company Limited\" in partnership with the state-run Rural Power Company Limited and Chinese private company Shenzhen Star Instrument Company Ltd. Besides, the cabinet was apprised of the official bilateral visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to China from July 1 to 6."

The call was made at a discussion on directives issued by the High Court after public interest litigation (PIL) on accessing justice after rape, and discrimination in marriage certificates. The discussion was organized by Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust (BLAST) at their office in Dhaka on Sunday afternoon. Supreme Court Advocate and BLAST legal advisor SM Rezaul Karim said: \"The major problem for us is that we have limited knowledge about marriage. If everyone knew about the safeguards available to them, it would be much easier for them to get justice.\" Aynunnahar Siddiqua, another Supreme Court advocate, said many lawyers were among those who did not know marriage law well, and misleading explanations from such lawyers was creating misconceptions among the public. \"Young girls are victimized as they are not aware of their rights. Everyone should learn about their rights before getting married,\" she added. Referring to the recent verdict on a PIL filed jointly by Blast, Naripokkho, and Bangladesh Mohila Parishad, where the High Court Division directed the government to omit the word \"Kumari\" (virgin) from in front of the bride's name on Muslim marriage registration forms, she said: \"The court also directed to mention if the groom was married or divorced, decreasing discrimination in the marriage registration forms further.\" Supreme Court Advocate Tajul Islam said many women did not know they could file for divorce without permission from their husbands by approaching the court. Advocate Rezaul Karim said while the government wished to raise awareness about rights, but field level officials responsible for circulating the information appear to be unwilling, on the basis of recent incidents. \"This is where the duty of the journalist comes in, as they can enrich news reports with information about rights so people can learn more,\" he added."

Visiting several spots in the city, the Dhaka Tribune found moderate traffic at the hubs in the morning, but it rose sharply later in the day. Transport staff said, holidaymakers started returning from Friday morning, and it is expected that traffic would have increased after 8pm on Saturday, and Sunday morning.  Among the three public transport options, waterways seemed to be busier during the day. Abul Kalam, manager of a Shyamoli bus counter in Sayedabad bus terminal said, he had witnessed huge traffic in Chittagong since noon as the passengers were trying to reach Dhaka before the rush-hour.  According to Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) data, over eight million people had left Dhaka by trains, buses, and launches till Tuesday to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr--one of the biggest religious festivals for Muslims-- Eid was celebrated across the country on Wednesday. Jahirul Haque, a private service holder, who returned to Dhaka on Saturday morning by a launch from Bhola, said he came back early so that he could have a day's rest before commencing work today.  Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, Abdur Rashid, a relative of a passenger returning to the capital from Khulna by train, claimed that the Dhaka-bound Sundarban Express had been running late by two hours.  Kamalapur Railway Station Master (acting) Sitangshu Chakrabarty said, the number of returning passengers had increased. \"However, there isn't a big rush of Dhaka-bound people to the extent we had assumed before, and the trains are running mostly on time.\" Meanwhile, the Dhaka Tribune's correspondents in Madaripur and Manikganj informed that there was a huge rush of vehicles in Shimulia-Kathalbari, and Paturia-Daulatdia routes.  Abdus Salam Miah, manager of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) at Kathalbari point, said: \"Generally, 18 ferries are operating on the route to transport people. But since Friday, three more ferries began operating in order to meet the huge demand for transport.\" The traffic inspector of the Kathalbari launch terminal said, there was a huge influx of Dhaka-bound passengers on Saturday, all launches were operating there with discipline, and they ensured that no vehicles were charging extra money for the journey."

The demand was echoed at a press briefing at the Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU) in the capital.  In the press briefing, the two environment-based organizations have also demanded that foreign investors to pull out the finances they have already invested in environmentally damaging coal-based power plant.  They also urged the government to conduct the scientific survey-strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) before planning to set up any large scale industries and buildings in the south-east region of the country.  They added: \"We have to determine how much industrialization should be allowed in a particular area so that tourism, salt and fishing industries do not go extinct.\" Human right activists Sultana Kamal expressing concern over government's plan to construct a coal-based plant said: \"This will destroy Cox's Bazar\". She also said: \"Few years back, we campaigned as Cox's Bazar being one of the most beautiful places in the world, but now we are literally strangling the life out of it with the construction of a coal-based power plant.  At the conference, Iftekharuzzaman, executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) emphasized the needs to conduct a survey to establish an industry. Companies like JICA surveyed and invested money in the Matarbari Project but they did not reveal the negative impacts it would have on the environment. Sharif Jamil, general secretary of BAPA and coordinator of Waterkeepers Bangladesh, published a report titled \"The tourist capital of Bangladesh endangered by plans to build the largest coal power hub in the world\" at the press conference. He said 17 fired coal power plants with a generating capacity of 17,944 megawatts (MW) of electricity are proposed for construction in 25-km of Cox's Bazar. Besides, 13 of the 17 coal plants are proposed for construction within 10 kilometres of each other on flood-prone Matarbari and Moheshkhali Islands. The cluster of eight coal plants proposed for Moheshkhali Island will make it the largest coal plant hub in the world.  In addition, Cox's Bazar coal plants will generate 72 million tons of carbon dioxide (Mt CO2) every year by 2031. The emission of carbon dioxide will be way more than countries like Albania, Armenia, Bhutan, Cambodia, Congo, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Senegal and Zambia combined, confirmed Jamil.  Terming these projects as harmful the speakers demanded renewable energy instead of coal-based power plant considering the impact.   Sultana Kamal chaired the press conference, while Executive Director of Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) Iftekharuzzaman, BAPA's executive vice-president Md. Abdul Matin, Joint Secretary Sharmin Murshid, President of Cox's Bazar branch of BAPA Fazlul Quader Chowdhury, and Abu Bakkar Siddique, member secretary of Maheshkhali branch  also spoke  in the conference."

The plane made the landing on Friday afternoon after one of its front tyres got damaged. Biman General Manager (Public Relations) Shakil Meraj said the pilot of the Dhaka-bound flight, carrying 61 passengers, noticed that one of its front tyres got damaged soon after it took off from Osmani International Airport in Sylhet at 3:30pm. Controller of Osmani International Airport AKM Anisuzzaman Talukder said: \"There was a loud noise soon after the flight took off. Later, part of a tyre was found on the runway. \"The tyre might have burst.\" The matter was informed to Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport through the control tower and a special arrangement was in place at the airport to face the situation, said an official at the security section of the Sylhet airport, preferring anonymity. However, the flight made an emergency landing at the Dhaka airport safely around 4:10pm, Shakil said. He also said all the passengers and the pilot along with his crewmembers disembarked from the aircraft unharmed. Earlier on February 24, another Biman Bangladesh Airlines aircraft made an emergency landing at Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong following a hijacking bid by a miscreant. The suspected hijacker was later overpowered and arrested during an eight-minute commando operation. He later succumbed to his injuries. The Dubai-bound Biman flight via Chittagong took off from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 5:13pm and made the landing at the Chittagong airport at 5:41pm on the same day."

But, like any configuration, it comes from a financial implication. And at present, South Africa is relooking our global presence,\" said Ambassador Dr Anil Sooklal at a lecture session in Dhaka on Wednesday. Sooklal is the deputy director general for Asia Pacific and the Middle East of Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) in South Africa. Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) organized the lecture on --Commemorating the Silver Jubilee of Diplomatic Relations between South Africa and Bangladesh -- at its auditorium. \"I think, after 25 years of democracy and having established our presence globally, it will be a time to revitalize it. I can assure you that if we open any new office in Asia, it will be in Bangladesh,\" Sooklal said. He said they discussed it at a meeting on Tuesday about opening an embassy in Bangladesh. \"We have a political agenda and decision that we will have to open an embassy in Dhaka,\" he added. The South African envoy acknowledged that Bangladesh people are now facing difficulties in processing visa application from Colombo. Noting that South Africa will shift this responsibility to New Delhi from Colombo soon, he said, \"South Africa is in a very advanced process of introducing e-visa within the next year to alleviate much of challenges you are facing now in terms of getting visa.\" Chaired by Foreign Secretary Md Shahidul Haque, the lecture session, was also addressed, by BIISS Director General AKM Abdur Rahman."

Owing to high demand in the market and lucrative prices, a large number of growers are getting more involved in the project, said Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) sources. DAE officials also said they have taken various steps in the project to educate farmers about the harmful effects of using pesticides and chemical fertilizers in vegetables fields. To grow various kinds of vegetables including brinjal, gourd, sweet gourd, kakral, karola, koida, cucumber, cabbage, cauliflower, tomato, potato, poi-shak, palong-shak and data-shak, a DAE team is working with farmers  in Vaterchar of Narayanpur union council, Belabo upazila. Because of the motivation and training, a large number of farmers are now inspired to cultivate more chemical free vegetables using vermicomposting and other organic fertilizers. The farmers are bringing more lands into this form of vegetable cultivation. The union has been declared a model union, the sources said. The farmers hope over one lakh tons of vegetables will be produced in the union this winter season. Ayub Ali, Hamida Begum, and Abul Kashem of Vaterchar village said they have achieved tremendous success in producing various chemical and pesticide free vegetables by using homemade vermicomposting. Many farmers of the village also have become solvent by producing chemical free organic vegetables as demand is very high in the area, said DAE officials. Chandi Das Kundu, director Field Service Wing of Department of Agriculture Extension, says two villages in every upazila will be brought under the 'Safe Vegetable Village' project to cultivate safe vegetables. Narayanpur is one of them, he added. Belabo upazila agriculture officer Naziur Rouf Khan said  a total of 150 farmers have been trained in three blocks of the union to cultivate vegetables on 30-hectares of land this season. On 15 December, a team led by Chairman of Bangladesh Food Safety Authority, Syeda Sarwar Jahan, visited the area. She said a market will be set up in the municipality to sell chemical free and safe vegetables of the upazila."

He said this responding to a starred question placed by treasury bench lawmaker Nasimul Alam Chowdhury of Comilla-8 in parliament with Speaker Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury in the chair on Sunday. In his words: \"If the international community fails to take effective measures to cope with climate change impacts, the country may incur a loss of  2% of its GDP (gross domestic product) by 2050, and as much as 9.4% of its GDP by 2100.\" Citing study findings of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Shahab Uddin said the country suffered a loss of US$ 1.67 billion in 2007, which was equivalent to 6 to 8% of its GDP, due to a devastating cyclone induced by global climate change. He added that a countrywide flood caused a loss of 4.8% of the country's GDP in 1998. The environment minister further said that the government has been implementing various programs across the country to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change."

      "authors": "Kaifi Azmi",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-13 00:00:00      \nPoetry Translated by Sudeep Sen  Kaifi Azmi is a major Urdu poet in India who introduced Urdu literature to Indian cinema. He has written many ghazals, and worked as a lyricist, writer and actor in Indian film. He received the Padma Shri, Sahitya Akademi Award for Urdu (1975) for his collection Awaara Sajde and Sahitya Akademi Fellowship for lifetime achievement (2002). He also won the National Film Award for Best Lyrics (1970) for the film Saat Hindustani.   One kiss (Ek bosa)   The moment I kiss these beautiful eyes-- a hundred lamps in the darkness--glow, glitter.  What flowers, what buds, what moon, what stars-- all my rivals--bow at your feet--head lowered.  They begin their dance--the idols of Ajanta, as the long close-lipped caves start to sing.  Flowers bloom in unkempt wilted gardens  on the thirst-wrenched earth--clouds collect, hover.  Momentarily, the world relinquishes cruelty-- momentarily, all stones start to smile.  One moment (Ek lamha)   What we call life, is but a few moments--  and within them that one moment-- when a pair of expressive eyes look up from a teacup  and drown in the heart-- drowning, say:  today, you should keep your silence--   today, I will keep mine. Let us just sit, hand in hand with our mutual gift of grief, with our shared heat of emotions.  Who knows in this moment on some distant mountain-- the snow might start to melt.   Courage (Hausla)   You are the sun--don't hide behind clouds You are the moon--don't stop shinning  You are a coquette--don't subdue your desire You are lightning--don't stop sparking  As yet, love hasn't conceded defeat-- As yet, don't give up on love--   Two nights (Do raatein)   Jumbled-confused emotions, ask not about them. Scared-frightened favors, ask not for them. Again and again her benevolence. Timidly, furtively, arriving at my bed  wanting to explain to me who knows what all-- and then being overcome, by shyness. How fleeting the night was, do not ask.  Let us see whether or not, my sighs bear fruit. Let us see whether or not, this night will pass. Scattered clouds hang aimlessly. Her manner is subdued and scared.  A few tears have appeared on her cheek-- and a few, balanced on her lashes.  Now God only knows whether or not, morning will come.  Calm ocean (Pursukoon samandar)   Tired, defeated ocean--why aren't you agitated? Why aren't you angry?  Breaking the banks--why don't you overflow? Why don't you rise? Why aren't you angry?  On your shores lie shanties born of oppression By builders who have ruined homes. These illegal shanties--why don't you erase them? Why aren't you agitated? Why aren't you angry?  You have no waves, crests or sound-- The helpless, oppressed world looks at you. Why don't you fret-and-foam? Why aren't you angry? Why aren't you agitated?  Tired, defeated ocean--why aren't you agitated? Why aren't you angry?  Custom of giving (Dastoor-e bakshish)   The sea overflows for some--for others, the goblet is empty. What times are these, what unfair apportioning--o wine-bearer?   You haven't grasped yet, the thirst-ridden's disposition-- Your nature of giving, must change--o wine-bearer!   Renewal (Tajdeed)   Tumult, zeal, commotion, yearning-- all these deserted me, when she left. I was certain now, there'd be no laughter, no tears. I'd already laughed aloud, cried aloud.    Someone, today, stretching her limbs  cast rings of silken-light around my sight. Tumult, zeal, commotion, yearning-- these same sparks, smiled once again.  Smile (Tabassum)   The bud--light of this garden's eyes,  night's pearl, spring garden's radiance--  soft, delicate, blooming, rosy-- shiny, innocent, quiet, mischievous-- once showered her myriad charms on me.  Alas, I erased this joyful, beautiful vision. I extended my desirous hands. Hidden within the petals, a spark that burnt my hands.  Still, the bud--smiled at me.   Second storm (Doosra toofan)   And then such a night arrived when taverns closed  and fire-temples stayed unlit.  He, who opposed taverns and temples--  the dissenter, the writer-- he, who always fought against the divine will for life  who for the sake of humanity, challenged God's will--  he, who always fought--fell quiet one day,  masking his face with his own book, falling asleep. However, his pen-- which bears a hundred names and has a hundred tasks-- continues fighting, as before; continues moving, as before-- sometimes in one hand, sometimes in another. Moving along, several fingers got bent-- and some fingers weaving daily, new conspiracies-- daily, new nooses-- and then hung him on a scaffold.  Skies didn't send any consolations, he was not called to the heavens. From his broken ribs  blood trickled, dripped in such a way-- the ropes burnt away, the conspiracies rotted away. This isn't an episode from Noah's age, but it is from the present day. On his tongue's tip, he raised the ocean and decanted it into the wind. On his beak's tip, he picked up the earth and flung it into the void. Jungles and villages trembled, the oceans trembled, unintelligent people trembled, intelligent people trembled. This is not a storm that drowns the earth-- instead, the submerged emerges.  Advice (Mashvarey)   Age: 'This storm, this cyclone, this fast current-- the crackling show, thunderous scenes, dark vastness, heaving ocean-- no guiding light, no stars in the firmament-- the traveler stood still, motionless, disillusioned.'  Youth: 'For him, the companion; for him, the shore's rim-- who caught in a storm-flood, attempts to swim-- dark vastness, heaving ocean-- these currents will keep beating their heads in-- how far will you go, sticking to the shore's rim?'  Celebration of love (Pyar Ka Jashn)   Celebration of love--we must rejoice in a new way. Sadness in any heart--this sadness mustn't stay.  On trembling lips, a promise of fidelity--bravo, I say? Your unsure feet, see where they've carried you--bravo, I say? In my home, your face all lit--bravo, I say? In every home--I must light a lamp, today.  The soul shies away--seeing smoke masking every face. Bashfully-abash--on my lips, a laugh appears. Ecstasy of our meeting--transforms into torment. If we are to laugh--we must help others to laugh.  In your sleep-asleep eyes--chalice spills over. Your lost-distracted glances--contain missives of love. Thirst on my lips--your lips, my reward. Will I be rewarded--or will I have to steal it away?  Around my neck, your arms--a sandalwood garland. Awhile back, these eyes, tearful--now, intoxicated. Did I not say--spring will enter my house too?  Only condition--the first to enter, will be you!  The poems have been excerpted from Kaifi Azmi: Poems | Nazms: New & Selected Poems (Bloomsbury UK).  "

With inadequate warm clothing at their disposal, poor people of these areas were seen trying to stay warm by lighting up small fires.  Dhaka also continued to feel the chills yesterday, with the Met Office recording the capital's temperature at 14.8deg Celsius at 6pm.  Weather in the city may remain dry, while moderate to thick fog may occur from midnight till morning. Night temperature may also fall slightly, said the Met Office.  According to the Met Office, the weather may remain dry with temporary partly cloudy sky over the country in the next 24 hours till 6pm Friday; while moderate to thick fog may also occur at places from midnight till morning.  The country's highest temperature -- 28.3deg Celsius -- was recorded in Teknaf yesterday, and the lowest -- 7.9deg Celsius -- in Chuadanga.  Night temperature may fall slightly and day temperature may remain nearly unchanged across the country.  \"Temperature may remain unchanged for the next two days. It'll start rising from December 22,\" said Ruhul Kuddus, a meteorologist at Dhaka Met office.  He said a cold wave may sweep over the country in the first week of January, reports UNB.  In Chuadanga, the mild cold wave is continuing to disrupt the everyday life of the people.  The local weather office has indicated that the temperature may further drop, reports our correspondent Mehedi Hasan.   Not enough winter clothing   In Dinajpur's Hili, the cold has intensified due to the cold wind blowing in from the Himalayas.  Dense fog from morning till the afternoon is forcing vehicles to keep their headlights during daytime, reports our correspondent Halim Al Raji.  Hakimpur Upazila Nirbahi Officer Abdur Rafiul Alam said they have already started distributing winter clothing and blankets among the poor.  But he also sought help from aid organizations that donate winter clothing for the poor to deal with the cold wave.  In Panchagarh, the country's northern most district, weather continued to deteriorate yesterday, reports our correspondent Sazzadur Rahman.  Tetulia Met Office In-Charge Md Rohidul Islam said temperature in the area fluctuated from 8deg Celsius to 13deg Celsius during last week, and the mercury will drop further if there was rain.  Panchagarh Modern Sadar Hospital's Resident Medical Officer Md Sirajuddaula Polin said most of the patients suffering from cold and cold-related diseases were children and the elderly people.  The district's Deputy Commissioner Sabina Yasmin said around 30,000 blankets have already been distributed among the poor through government and non-government initiatives.  The locals, however, said that the distributed blankets were still insufficient compared to the number of people in need.  \"We have sent a requisition letter to the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry, seeking additional winter clothing for the people,\" Sabina said.  In Kurigram, temperature continued to drop yesterday due to the cold wave, with the Rajarhat Met Office recording the lowest at 9.8deg Celsius, which was lower than the previous day, reports our correspondent Ariful Islam.  Chairman of Sadar upazila's Jatrapur Union Parishad Ayub Ali said the cold was more intense in most of the areas in his union as they were located on shoals.  Saying they have received 440 blankets in two phases, he stressed: \"There are more 6,000 families in my union and most of them are underprivileged. This is not enough.\"  However, according to the relief department of the district administration, 51,514 blankets allotted for Kurigram were already distributed among the people in nine upazilas.  Indicating the possibility of another cold wave in the last week of the month, Rajarhat Met Office In-Charge Subol Chandra said there was a chance of light rain next week. "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-04 00:00:00      \nWhy is it High Time to Concentrate on Proper Youth Centric Climate Financing in Bangladesh? Most of the disastrous impacts of climate change are expected to be felt within the near future. Young people are particularly vulnerable to the impacts, as they are often on the margins of decision-making and will face the climate change impacts for many more years to come. So it would be unethical to take steps (or not) to mitigate climate change or adapt to the problems without their contributions. Globally, youths have participated in movements spontaneously (and in large numbers), they have collaborated with organizations that are working to address their concerns and provide solutions to real-world problems. According to UNFPA (2014), 48 million youth are living in Bangladesh, which is 30 percent of the total population. Securing the future of this large segment of society cannot be ensured without their participation and engagement at much larger scales than currently. The Joint Framework Initiative on Children, Youth, and Climate Change is recognition of the role of youths in tackling climate change, given by the United Nations. This initiative coordinates efforts of 16 intergovernmental entities (e.g. UNFCC, FAO, UNDP, the World Bank group), some nongovernmental organizations (e.g. the British Council, EarthChild Institute, the World Association of Girls Guides) and many youth organizations to empower young people to take adaptation and mitigation actions and enhance active participation of youths in climate change policy and decision making processes. In 2009, the UNFCC secretariat allowed the Youth Non-Governmental Organizations (YOUNGOs) to receive official information and notices, to participate in the meetings, to request speaking slots, and to receive logistical support. The YOUNGO networks have been organising the Conference of the Youth (COY) every year on the weekend before the UN-Level COP, since 2005. This conference brings together the climate change enthusiastic young people from around the world, who promote sustainable lifestyles, look to reduce their emissions footprints and are eager to engage. In the 21st UNFCC intergovernmental negotiation conference (COP 21), youth delegates got involved through a broad range of activities for the very first time. At the latest conference, COP24, a sixteen-year-old girl, Greta Thunberg gave a powerful speech on climate change which drew the attention of the world, proving the power of youth activities and their voices. Examples of climate actions taken by the youth are not only in international conferences. Youths are also implementing various projects around the world. In Central Guyana, the Amerindian people are \"Custodians\" of the rainforest but have a severe lacking in their basic needs. A project designed to ensure the protection of the forest, aiming at improving health, hygiene and environmental management delivered a child-to-child educational programme. This programme engaged and empowered the children, of that particular area, to conserve the rainforests, which vastly contributed to mitigation efforts, by absorbing CO2 emissions. In Morocco, the El Moudda adaptation Initiative is an award-winning project, which is led by young people under 30; this is a community-based adaptation project aiming at various sustainable development measures. They build infrastructure such as dams and early flood warning systems to support community-based Disaster Risk Management. They helped the community through local consultations, awareness raising for conservation, reforestation and re-vegetation of the land aside from the villages. In Ethiopia, UNICEF financed 50,000 school going students, through their environmental clubs, for planting trees in the region of Addis Ababa as a mitigation and adaptation measure. It is imperative that the Bangladesh government and society as a whole help prepare our significant youth population to fight for a sustainable future. There is a vast opportunity in supporting the youth to contribute to existing policies and agenda of the Government and boost national development. Among the key policies developed by the government (in relation to climate change) are; the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP 2009) and the Country Investment Plan (CIP) of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change--both of which focus on community-based adaptation, increasing resilience at the community level and capacity building as crucial approaches to sustainable development for Bangladesh. Similar to the examples above, such as El Moudda Initiative, the youth of Bangladesh can be engaged to deliver real changes at the community levels. Youth actions in climate change have already been activated in Bangladesh. Various environment-related university clubs had started working in this problem. They are arranging workshops, seminars, innovation fair, various competitions on climate change and environment-related problems.  For example, Local chapters of Youth-mappers are contributing a lot in mapping base volunteering, and Green Planet Club of Independent University organized Green Genius Contest, where university students present their innovative ideas to make a sustainable environment. Academic institutions are also promoting youth-oriented climate actions. Department of Environmental Sciences, Bangladesh University of Professionals, arranged Environmental Fest last year. Institute of Remote Sensing, Jahangirnagar University arranged two days workshop on applications of GIS and Remote Sensing, where 100 students from ten universities participated and had some introductory lessons about applications of geospatial technologies in environmental management. A recent initiative, developed by the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) supported by UKAid and British Council, aims to build the capacity of young people to become the actors in taking climate actions. It is designed as a year-long mentorship programme, entitled \"Re-think & Innovate for a Sustainable Environment (RISE)\" that works to engage the youth (selected university students from across Bangladesh) to break down the complex sustainability issues that will challenge their generation and to identify opportunities in how they can initiate projects and activities on their own. The programme focuses on providing a grounding of climate science and sustainability issues, mentoring on project design and implementation, representing their peers among various stakeholders (policymakers/practitioners/private sector firms, etc.) and engaging their peers to collaborate and participate in national development issues. As a critical barrier to most initiatives is support (mostly financial and technical), the programme aims to catalyze the youth into; identifying the appropriate assistance and guidance needed, to approach key stakeholders (investors/decision-makers, etc.) and propose feasible solutions and mobilize their peers into making real changes. The youth of any nation is a valuable asset for prosperity and sustainable development, and the youth of Bangladesh is no different. These eager and enthusiastic minds can, and should, be channeled towards adaptation & mitigation projects (under our existing policies/frameworks). To network and share their ideas, and most importantly, to become actors that take climate actions it is vital to provide adequate support and assistance by investing in the youth of our nation.

There are 78 rivers in the division and 25 of them have dried up while 10 are on the verge of dying, said sources at Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA). These 25 rivers are Haria, Mayur, Hamkura, Kocha, Shela in Khulna, Bhola, Haura, Sara, Chuna, Jamuna, Ramsagar in Bagerhat; Sonai in Satkhira; Teka in Kushtia; Chitra in Narail; Kumar, Maragang and Bhadra in Madaripur. Besides, sholas have developed in the middle of Rupsha and Pashur rivers under Khulna-Mongla river route, hampering the movement of vessels. Goods-laden cargo vessels navigate the area braving risks as a shoal emerged in the Kazibachha River in Batiaghata upazila. A huge shoal has emerged in the Shibsha River from Deluti to Goroikhali in Paikgaccha upazila of the district, disrupting the movement of small engine-run boats. Launches and boats are moving through three routes - Khulna-Madinabad, Khulna-Nildumur and Khulna-Jorsing routes - of the district while cargo vessels are operating on Abhaynagar and Nauapara routes in the northern parts of the division. Recently, the BIWTA has written to the authorities concerned for dredging at 20 points of the rivers. The points are - Hodda, Nalian, Ghugrakathi, Manipur, Kurikaunia, Madinabad, Patakhali on Khulna-Nildumur route, Sardarghat, Mathbaria, Manipur, both sides of Bagi ghat, on Khulna-Jorsing route, Maninabad ghat to Patakhali point, Jaigir Mohol to Madinabad on Kopotakkho river, Chalna, Dakope, Kamarkhali, Botbunia, Kalibari, Arshibosha, Mongla-Chalna, Angtihara-Raimangal route, Khulna-Kalabogi and Joymonirgol-Sonnashi route. According to the letter, dredging work is needed on the listed routes to maintain river transportation but the authorities concerned did not take any effective measure despite being informed several times. Mostafizur Rahman, deputy director of BIWTA, said, \"We've sent a proposal seeking dredging work on the internal river routes of Khulna-Mongla, Khulna-Barishal, Khulna-Bagerhat, Daulatpur-Gopalganj and Tekerhat-Gopalganj routes. The dredging works will start once the authorities concerned give the nod.\" SM Asaduzzaman, president of BIWTA Khulna Workers Union, lamented the current shabby state of the river transportation sector. \"Vessels used to operate on 19 river routes from Khulna port only a decade ago. But now, no goods-laden vessels, except those carrying government food and fertiliser, ply these routes,\" he said."

Bangladesh -- a densely populated and impoverished low-lying nation of 168 million people -- is among the most vulnerable to global warming with rising sea levels threatening coastal villages. Flood-affected people in Balasi Ghat, Gaibadha heading  for shelter on Monday, July 22, 2019 |Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka TribuneIn a study billed as the first of its kind in comparing household spending to public financing, researchers found rural families were shelling out an average $2 billion a year to address the impacts of climate change. In contrast, Dhaka's budget for climate change in rural areas for 2018-19 was $1.46 billion, while international financing was an estimated $154 million annually, the report by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) found. 'We're losing the race': UN secretary general calls climate change an 'emergency' https://t.co/NiGZ57dyS8 The report was released days before a United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York between governments, business leaders and international organizations. \"This research reveals an alarming imbalance,\" IIED's director Andrew Norton said in a statement. He said: \"It is unacceptable that the poorest people are shouldering the burden of spending for adapting to climate change in Bangladesh. \"Much more needs to be done to make sure more public climate finance reaches the people who need it most.\" Also Read- Leading the way in adaptation  Families -- instead of buying food or spending their money on health and education -- were repairing damaged homes and replacing animals and crops. They were using the money to raise their houses above flood levels, and some were even taking out high-interest loans from informal sources, pushing them further into poverty, the researchers said.

He told AFP he borrowed money at an interest rate of more than 20% to make ends meet after the disaster, which experts said was due to climate change. \"I became penniless after losing my home and property... when the Padma devoured our entire village,\" the 50-year-old said. Local mayor Shahidul Islam said just a handful of families were provided with new homes, with hundreds of others having to rent or move to cities. Atiq Rahman, a Bangladeshi expert who sits in a UN climate change panel, welcomed the study but said $2 billion was \"a fraction of the amount\" Bangladeshis and the government spent every year. \"This is an underestimate. There are many climate change-related costs that cannot be easily monetized,\" he told AFP, citing the impacts on health, land fertility and livestock."

Chittagong, just like Dhaka, has been suffering from a never-ending water-logging problem, and the main culprits of this problem are the more than 1,500 illegal structures in the city that obstruct the free flow of water -- these structures include concrete buildings, shanties, tin-shed houses, graveyards, and crematoriums. Our second-most populous city, and trading hub, is particularly vulnerable to water-logging, with around a third of the district of Chittagong going under water during the monsoon each year, while parts of the city get flooded during high tides even when there is no rain. Of course, while illegal encroachments constitute a large part of the problem, there is more to the whole picture. Our cities are fitted with faulty and outdated drainage systems; furthermore, waste disposal is an issue that needs to be addressed without delay, as plastic waste matter in particular is rarely disposed of properly, usually being thrown out on to the street -- this plastic then goes on to clog up our drains, leaving with the water with no place to move to. The authorities have made assurances that the problem in Chittagong is being taken seriously, with the government undertaking a Tk1,620 crore project to tackle the problem of water-logging, address flood control, and improve drainage facilities.  We hope this money is put to good use, so that our port city can function to its full potential, not just commercially, but in terms of the quality of people's lives. "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-28 00:00:00      \nThese jute mills are located in Khulna's Khalishpur, Dighalia, and Atra industrial regions, and also in Jessore's Noapara industrial area Approximately 30,642 tons of jute goods are currently in stock at the nine state-owned jute mills located in Khulna and Jessore, having a market value is Tk270 crore. Sources said the goods were sitting idle in the jute mills as exports to Sudan have been halted for a long time, but with the increase in demand in the local market, the number of idle jute goods are also decreasing. Lack of capital is another reason why there are no stocks of raw jute in the mills, where industry insiders blame the inefficiency of the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) for lack of funds and fall in production. Md Baniz Uddin Miah, liaison officer at BJMC Khulna office, said out of the 30,642 tons of idle jute goods, 8,130 tons are located in Crescent Jute Mills, 6,117 tons in Platinum Jute Mills, 6,594 tons in Khalishpur Jute Mills, and 978 tons in the Daulatpur Jute Mills, 1,116 tons in Star Jute Mills, 1,474 tons in Alim Jute Mills, 2,057 tons in Eastern Jute Mills, 3,396 tons in Jessore Jute Industry and 600 tons in Carpeting Jute Mills. These jute mills are located in Khulna's Khalishpur, Dighalia, and Atra industrial regions, and also in Jessore's Noapara industrial area.  Sources also said the nine state-owned jute mills owe the workers 10-11 weeks wages, worth Tk44.22 crore, while officials have to be paid four months' wages worth Tk9.84 crore, all totaling Tk54.7 crore. Md Mizanur Rahman, director at the Khulna Department of Labour (DOL) office, said the Director-General at the DOL as well as the Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment have both been notified of the dire conditions, but lack of funds at BJMC has stalled the payment process. The fund crisis has further been intensified by lack of raw jute available in the mills, he added. Abdul Hamid Sardar, convener of CBA, non-CBA Sangram Parishad, said the workers had staged countless protests and organized strikes, demanding payment of all their wages and other dues, but to no avail so far."

The fertilizer is being kept out in the open in the metropolitan's jetty no 7, Roosevelt jetty, Port jetty and Shiromoni areas, for lack of space in the Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation (BADC) warehouses in the district. According to BADC sources, in FY2018-19, three types of fertilizers--Triple Super Phosphate (TSP), Muriate of Potash (MOP), and Diammonium phosphate (DAP)--were imported from Morocco, Canada, and Saudi Arabia. The imported fertilizer were brought to Khulna from Mongla port by six contractor companies. The companies, Poton Traders Ltd, South Delta Shipping and Trading Ltd, Bulk Trade Intl, Nawab and Co, MSK Ship Management and Chartering Ltd, and Taiba Saifullah were responsible for the preservation of the consignments of fertilizer until the BADC took over.  The sources also said, the matter was brought to notice at the BADC meeting in the district on July 27.  Probhash Kumar, joint director of BADC, said: \"The fertilizer imported in FY2018-19, were yet to be stored in our warehouse. Currently, the BADC's warehouse has a capacity of 13 metric tons and there aren't any warehouses for rent,  and there is no adequate space to store the load of fertlizer.\" \"The fertilizer is being preserved in airtight plastic covers, but stagnant waters may damage it.\" Kamrul Ashraf Khan, proprietor of Poton Traders Ltd, said: \"The quantity of fertilizer imported were more than the capacity of the BADC warehouse. We have to spend extra to rent, guard, load and unload. If the fertilizer consignments are not delivered to BADC's warehouse, we cannot claim the payment.\""

Many marginal farmers have become self-reliant by rearing cows' There will be no crisis of sacrificial animals, and the cattle markets would not face any crunch for the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha in Chittagong this year, livestock officials, and traders opined. According to the district livestock office, around 6,10,000 heads of cattle are currently available for Eid sacrifice purposes. Of them, 4,14,000 cows, 1,47,000 goats and sheep, and 46,000 buffaloes are in stock at different farms of Chittagong. Last year, 6,55,000 cattle were sacrificed in the district. According to district livestock office, 1,50,000-2,00,000 cattle which come to Chittagong from different parts of the country will fill the shortfall. While speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, livestock officer of Chittagong Dr Md Reajul Huq, assured that the local demand for sacrificial animals could easily be met as there is an adequate supply from domestic sources. \"Many people have inclined towards rearing cows due to its high demand, especially during Eid-ul-Azha. Many marginal farmers have become self-reliant by rearing cows,\" said the livestock officer.         Agreeing with the livestock official, Md Shafiqur Rahman, president of Chittagong Cattle Cooperative Association Ltd also said that the district cattle markets would not witness any supply crisis. Animals to arrive from next week \"Sacrificial animals will begin to arrive in the next few days. Local cows are in huge demand, cattle reared in different farms of Chittagong fulfill 30% of the demand, while the rest is procured from other districts like Bogra, Kushtia, Jessore, Faridpur, and Chapainawabganj,\" he said, adding that the recent flood would not have any impact on the supply.    There are more than 300 cattle farms in Chittagong, also cattle are raised by individual farmers, particularly for Eid-ul-Azha, sources in the livestock office said. Around 47 veterinary teams headed by a veterinary surgeon, each comprising of three to five members would be deployed in 200 cattle markets of the district, including 40 permanent ones.    Livestock officer Dr Md Reajul Huq told the Dhaka Tribune that the veterinary medical teams would check the health of cattle, provide emergency treatment, inspect if the cattle are fit for sacrificing, and detect whether those have been fattened artificially, through the conventional symptom-based methods. \"There will be more than one medical team in the permanent cattle markets. Besides, a mobile veterinary clinic will provide service in the port city,\" said the livestock officer.   Steroid-fattened cattle Some dishonest, and profit-hungry cattle traders bring steroid-fattened cattle for sale at the time of Eid-ul-Azha. Use of hormones, and steroids for fattening cattle is banned, according to the Animal Disease Control Act, 2010. The Act has set at least two years imprisonment, or a fine amounting to Tk50,000, or both for those involved in the offence.   \"Such cattle can be easily identified. Artificially fattened cattle carry some telltale signs. Healthy cattle appears vigorous, while an artificially fattened cow will move slowly, and appear lethargic, it will also show symptoms of respiratory problems,\" said the livestock officer. Dr Azizur Rahman Siddiqui, Civil Surgeon of Chittagong told the Dhaka Tribune that the consumption of artificially fattened cattle poses a serious health hazard."

Deputy Inspector General Md Ruhul Amin at police headquarters, who heads the probe committee, said: \"We have found preliminary evidence against the former officer-in-charge of Sonagazi police station and senior police officers. We are taking this very seriously and are looking into it. \"But, had the local administration and madrasa managing committee taken action when the sexual harassment was first reported, this tragedy could have been avoided.\" DIG Ruhul Amin said the investigation will take several more days to wrap up as investigators are examining various documents. He said Sirajuddaula, the madrasa principal, had a history of condemnable behaviour that was known to the madrasa governing body. The police officer also notably stressed the involvement of political figures in the murder. The DIG was with four other police officers who formed the probe committee. They visited the madrasa and Nusrat's home. They spoke to madrasa staff and students, and Nusrat's family. Three days after the Police Bureau of Investigation (PBI) assumed responsibility of the case, PBI Chief, Banaj Kumar Majumdar, submitted a report to the inspector general of police, noting negligence on the part of police and local administration. Nusrat was set on fire on April 6, refusing to withdraw a case her family filed last month against Sirajuddaula for sexually harassing and assaulting her. After she was set on fire, her family filed another case against eight people, including Sirajuddaula, on April 8. The 18-year-old girl died at Dhaka Medical College Hospital on April 10, after five days in treatment."

We must organize ourselves and guard our rights,\" said Dr Kamal while addressing the inaugural session of Gono Forum's fifth national council on Friday. He said no one, including the president and the prime minister, is above the constitution, reports UNB. \"We must register our protest if anything is done beyond the constitution. We must make the government accountable. Or else, we will lose our ownership of the country,\" he said. The Gono Forum chief said people must remain aware of the way the country is being run.  Dr Kamal, also the Jatiya Oikya Front convener, said the police can help ensure a democratic and constitutional rule in the country by playing its proper role. He said people will have to force the government to run the country as per the constitution with their united efforts. Depicting the country's overall situation, Dr Kamal urged people not to get frustrated. The council began at the Mohanagar Natya Mancha in the morning with party president Dr Kamal Hossain in the chair. Dr Kamal together with party senior leaders inaugurated the council by hoisting the national and Gono Forum flags around 10am.  Mokobbir joins Gono Forum council Although he took oath as an MP violating his party decision, Gono Forum presidium member Mokobbir Khan joined its fifth national council on Friday. Mokobbir, who was elected MP from Sylhet 2 with Gono Forum ticket in the December 30 general election, took oath as an MP of the 11th parliament on April 2, going against the party decision. On April 20, Gono Forum central committee at a meeting decided to send a show-cause notice to Mokobbir Khan for \"violating\" its constitution and indulging \"anti- party\" activities. Mokobbir joined today's council and sat on the dais with Dr Kamal Hossain, creating resentment among party leaders and activists. Talking to UNB, party training affairs secretary Rafiqul Islam Pathik said it is painful that Kamal Hossain is doing \"dual politics\" over Mokobbir's issue. \"I came out of the council and boycotted it in protest against Mokobbir's presence at the council,\" he said. He said many party leaders and activists were angered seeing Mokobbir on the stage. Nearly 1,000 party delegates from across the country joined the event. The last council of Gono Forum was held on December 10, 2011."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-11 00:00:00      \nThe hunger strike is still ongoing Around seven people have been hospitalized as state-owned jute mill workers in Khulna, Jessore, and Narsingdi have continued their hunger strike for the second consecutive day. The workers have been taken to Khulna Medical College Hospital on Wednesday morning. Workers of 24 state-owned jute mills, out of the 26 which are under the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC), began the strike on Tuesday afternoon. The workers, along with their dependants, are currently still carrying on with the strike under the banner of CBA-Non CBA Sangram Parishad. In Khulna and Jessore industrial areas, several workers from nine state-owned jute mills -- Star, Platinum, Crescent, Alum, Eastern, Carpeting and three others -- fell sick after almost 21 hours of starvation, and were administered intravenous saline. Examining the ill workers, the healthcare worker of Khalishpur jute mill, Shyamoli Mandal, said: \"The workers are also suffering from low blood pressure.\" One of the sick workers, Platinum Jute Mill CBA President Shahana Sharmin said: \"The workers hoped that they will come to a resolution during the meeting with the chairman; however, they were disappointed again. As a result, they went to a hunger strike.\" Jessore Jute Industries (JJI) Labour Union Treasurer Israil Sarder said the jute mill workers of Jessore are also continuing the protest. In Narsingdi, thousands of jute mill workers, including workers of UMC jute mill, have continued   Tuesday's hunger strike as well. All activities in the jute mills have come to a standstill due to the protests. No jute laden trucks or any jute mill officials were allowed to enter the mills on Wednesday. Besides, traffic movement has been severely hindered as workers have positioned themselves near the main gate of the UMC jute mill. Workers' union leaders during the strike said that non-payment of wages had led them to destitution, therefore they were protesting to press home their 11-point demand. Their demands include implementation of the National Wage Commission, payment of all weekly wages, adequate budgetary allocation for the jute sector and ensuring sale of jute products, payment of the outstanding provident fund and gratuity to retired workers and settlement of insurance benefits to the families of the deceased workers, recruitment of workers, regularization of temporary workers, reinstatement of sacked workers, and balancing, modernizing, rehabilitating, and expanding the jute mills for better productivity.

A project worth Tk48 crore aims to ensure safe water for at least 600000 residents of the upazilas, namely Rupsa, Terkhada  and Digholia, has been sent to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) for approval. Jahed Parvez, executive engineer of the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) of Khulna said: ''To supply safe drinking water to the three upazilas, 1500 water tanks having a capacity of 3000 liters each, 2200 deep tube wells, 223 tube-wells, 1,500 feet deep each, 50 hand-driven tube wells , 30 community latrines and modern latrines for high schools will be set up under the project which would start next year upon approval.''  According to the Upazila Health complex, at least 10 people including man and woman died of arsenic in last 10 years and residents have been asked not to drink water from arsenic contaminated tube wells.  Even residents of many unions of Rupsa, Terkhada upazilas reserve rainwater for drinking as they have been suffering without safe drinking water, locals said. According to the Terkhada upazila health complex, currently 46 people are affected with arsenic in six unions and water of shallow tube wells are being tested on a daily basis."

Rural women have gradually taken an active role in the labour force. According to the Asian Development Bank, they were about 8% around mid-1980s. But in 2017, they account for nearly 36% of the national labour. According to the latest data, overall migration (internal and overseas) by men is at 11%, so the economic work in the village farm is likely to be taken over by women. So their role has increased and they are contributing The role of women in rural economic has increased and they are contributing more in rural labour.   What are the existing obstacles hindering rural women from being more involved in economic activities? A number of factors may discourage women from being actively involved. One is lack of accessibility to resources. Traditionally, men have been facilitated in this role. Accessibilities to resources, to land and finance is something hindered by the culture. There has also been a lack of proper freedom to freely participate.     Climate challenge will be an emerging challenge. It is going to affect women as well. There is no anti-discriminatory law that might benefit the woman. Besides, migration increases workload of women and they will be expected to take care of all household chores. How can Bangladesh eradicate discrimination and underdevelopment of rural women? First, take a look at the laws and policies in place with affirmative action with proper revision. If it is clear, then see that it is enforced and closely monitored. If it is not clear, consider affirmative action. Women need to be included in mainstream development processes. If that happens, they will feel that they are empowered and will contribute more. Empower them with finance, infrastructure, education and skills to make it balanced and sustainable.   While the theme for International Rural Women Day talks about sustainable accessibilities to infrastructure, services and social protection with empowerment, do you think this is being practiced in Bangladesh? Look past the offices. They are accessible. The laws are there. But the thing is, are the practitioners giving them proper opportunities? The practitioner and implementers of the laws need to be act properly to improve accessibility.              How can an increase in gender-based violence and sexual harassment impact the national economic progress? The impact would be devastating. Bangladesh has made good economic progress, and women have largely contributed. They are now more engaged in rural production than ever. But this can be affected if they do not feel comfortable to go out. If their movement is restricted, their outdoor activities will be restricted. Imagine what would happen if millions of women were confined in their house out of discomfort. How can we promote agricultural cooperatives and entrepreneurship involving rural women? My general statement is - make the rural area more attractive than what garments factories could offer. When you want to make it attractive you have to empower them, give them access to resources, finance, capacity building. Make them feel secure. Give them all-in-one packages including incentives for entrepreneurs. You must provide a support system where they know they are happy living in rural areas. How could Bangladesh ensure food security for rural women?    Agriculture is a source of income. Besides, non-farming activities can strengthen can secure their livelihood. Secure means settled. If they have settled their livelihood, it means they have food security. Home gardening could be a contributing factor. Food loss has been a concern for Bangladesh. How can rural women help reduce food loss through involvement in agro-processing and other relevant areas? Food loss is major threat. It affects Bangladesh just like the rest of the developing world.   Processing foods at home would be great solution. In Sri Lanka, they have small, affordable machines which are easily accessible. Women there use work with their families to process food. There is an obligation for the supply chain to buy from them. It works well there. We are working with Daffodil International university and Philmac, one of our partners, to replicate the Sri Lanka model here. What would you say is the best quality of Bangladeshi rural women that is helping them succeed economically? Rural women in Bangladesh are very hard-working. The existing limitations could not prevent them from working. Their love and concern for their family drive them. What is CIRDAP doing to enable rural women of Bangladesh? I have already mentioned one.We are planning to do a research next year on women aged between 18-27 who are out of work and educations. We want to facilitate their involvement in economic activities.   In addition, we are trying to promote good practices in Bangladesh and promoting and mobilizing the women participating in economic activities.   Do you think current initiatives is enough for the development of rural people? If not, what can the government and stakeholders do to help? There are some good practices in Bangladesh already. Brac, RDA, and BARD are doing good work. We have found that \"One House One Cow/One Farm\" program really improved the situation. But we need to do better. To do better, we need to find the gap, and more importantly, implement properly. A number of projects were implemented without knowing the lives and micro-politics of the rural area, and so they failed, might have even damaged things somewhat. You can have the resources to help, but unless you find the person who needs the help, it is a waste. You need to find who actually needs the benefits and work accordingly. "

For the celebration, 89 Puja mandaps have been set up and hundreds of gates have been erected across the district town. Although Durga Puja is the biggest festival for Hindus across the country, Magura is an exception where Kartiany Puja is observed with pompous festivity.  Local Hindus say Shatish Chandra Biswas of village Nanduali in Magura sadar upazila was the pioneer of Kartiany Puja in the district. Shatish observed the puja in his house 65 years ago and the festivity of the puja is increasing day by day. According to Hindu legend,  women in the Dapore era who lived on the banks of the Jamuna River, worshiped Lord Shree Kishna in the Bangla month of Kartik. Following their tradition, residents of Magura have been observing the puja. Basudev Kundu, president of Magura district Puja Udjapan Parishad said 89 puja stages have been set up in the district.

Monowar Ahmed, Secretary, Economic Relations Division (ERD), and Manmohan Parkash, Country Director, ADB, signed the agreement on behalf of Bangladesh and ADB, respectively, at a ceremony in Dhaka, said a press release. The Second City Region Development Project builds on a similar such project which was completed in 2018, according to ADB. The project will bolster growth, improve living standards, and improve mobility, flood resilience, and solid waste management in Dhaka and Khulna city regions, said ADB Country Director Manmohan Parkash. He said by improving institutional capacity and community awareness, the project will strengthen municipal governance, institutional coordination, and sustainable service delivery. \"It'll also support preparation and implementation of comprehensive frameworks for integration of urban development with south-west economic corridor (SWEC) development, and thereby contribute to establishing the SWEC as a major economic corridor in South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation,\" Parkash added. The project will support the rehabilitation of 300 km of urban roads in the Dhaka city region and 30 km of drains around Dhaka and 120 km around Khulna. It will also fund the preparation of an integrated solid waste management plan, including the construction of a composting plant for Khulna. To strengthen capacity, the project will help identify priority investments, prepare or update various plans, and provide training in pourashavas and city corporations in integrated urban planning, sustainable service delivery, and operation and maintenance of urban infrastructure, ADB said. To reduce startup delays for future projects, support for the preparation of detailed engineering designs for investments involving the latest technologies and smart applications will be provided, it said. This will include integrated real-time data platforms and sensors, advanced building materials, and geotechnical engineering. The project will also conduct community awareness campaigns covering at least 200,000 people, including at least 100,000 women on reducing, reusing, and recycling solid waste."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-23 00:00:00      \nPromoting agro-tourism in our country can do wonders in terms of revenue generation Geographically, Bangladesh is a rich land of agro-tourism resources with enormous appeal to sight-seers. Internationally, Bangladesh is now fourth in vegetable production and fourth in fish production. In addition, native capacities for rice, flower, wheat, prawn, and tobacco cultivation have promoted our rural development. These rural dynamic products may uphold agro-tourism.  If we reform land-water-forest sectors through home grown strategies, all -- environment, water, land, forest, marginal farmers, fishermen, women, minorities, and indigenous peoples -- will be economically, socially, and environmentally included for sustainable rural development.  Time has come to preserve rural farming practices and cultural diversity to a great extent for collective welfare, and to distribute the benefits of the tourism industry even at a marginal level.  The promise of tourism in Bangladesh Agro-ecological tourism as a distinctive field that covers the rural environment with its agricultural products, processing and packaging, agro-based services, rural community, and their culture and belief system. It is also called eco-tourism, agricultural tourism, dairy farm tourism, farm vacation tourism, bucolic tourism, agro-entertainment, and honey-tasting tourism.  Bangladesh Economic Review (2010) states that Bangladesh has basically three avenues of generating revenue: Industry, agriculture, and services. Tourism is a part of the service sector, which contributes to the GDP of Bangladesh.  Agriculture is the lifeblood of the Bangladesh economy, and a powerful driver of poverty reduction in Bangladesh. In rural Bangladesh, the factors behind the agriculture sector growth are: Irrigation expansion, improved technology, more efficient markets, and finally, widespread mechanization.  Really, Bangladesh's agriculture sector has been enhanced in terms of productivity and output growth over the last 46 years, regardless of recurrent natural disasters, like climate change, cyclones, drought, and flood and population growth.  Needless to say, challenges to sustainable agricultural growth are numerous. It can be a loss of arable land due to climate change and salinity intrusion in the south, severe droughts in the north, building of industry and infrastructure, and excessive emphasis on urbanization and house-building, as well as water shortages in the dry season due to unresolved river-related disputes with neighbouring India.  It is expected that the Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation, along with other private tour operators, will prefer the issue of correcting the image by undertaking promotional measures in order to develop tourism in Bangladesh. The government should also extend cooperation in this regard by playing the foremost role in building this positive image, so that the industry can play its proper responsibility to the economy of the country.  Why we need eco-tourism The lands of Kushtia are fertile for tobacco, Mymensingh for paddy, Chandpur and Barisal are known for fish, Sathkhira for prawn, Jessore for flowers, Dinajpur for its wheat, and so on. So, Bangladesh has a lot of options when it comes to promoting the concept of agro-tourism, and find new means that can contribute to its overall economy.  Cox's Bazar is the tourist capital of Bangladesh. The shark-free beach is good for bathing, sun-bathing, and swimming. The breath-taking beauty of the setting sun behind the waves of the sea is captivating. Visiting the fascinating spot like Himchhari, Teknaf, Inani beach, and various temples can form memorable experiences of one's lifetime. The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove forest in the world. Two-thirds of the Sundarbans is in Bangladesh. Wildlife photography is an important part of eco-tourism, and related experiences include boating inside the forest, nature study, meeting fishermen, wood-cutters, and honey-collectors. Rangamati is a wonderful repository of scenic splendor, with flora and fauna of varied descriptions. The township is located on the Western bank of Kaptai Lake. Rangamati is a favourite holiday resort, because of its beautiful landscape, scenic beauty, lakes, colourful tribes, its flora and fauna, indigenous museums, hanging bridges, homespun textile products, ivory jewellery.  arketing strategies  The international tourism system is totally reliant on information technology for its growth, competitiveness, and long-term survival. In promoting the agro-tourism industry of any country, the internet can play a leading role to facilitate information exchange internationally.  The internet can be used effectively for the many purposes of tourism and marketing, including direct sales, advertisement, and customer support. The tourism authority needs to consider the effective use of this technology for the promotional activity of this industry.  Advertising is a non-personal form of mass communication, and it offers a high degree of control for those responsible for the design and delivery of the advertising message. Different tourist attractions of the country can be advertised on television, radio, newspapers, and magazines.  To market agro-ecological tourism, geographical information systems (GIS) are very important. Through these systems, the tourism authorities can easily sell agro-tourism products and indigenous farming tools, show suitable localities for the incorporation of various plants and animals, elucidate geo-demographic characteristics.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-08 00:00:00      \nThe six-month-long pilot project was inaugurated on March 3 The national emergency helpline provides three distinct services - police, fire, and ambulance. As the national helpline has no dedicated legal aid service, Project Shetu, set up by Justice Vision Foundation (JVF), has been working with the national helpline provide legal counselling and assistance to those in need as a pilot project. The six-month-long pilot project was inaugurated on March 3.  Dhaka Tribune obtained detailed records of the calls and complaints received and the assistance provided over 76 days of operation. How does the service work? The national emergency helpline - 999 - has allocated three other emergency numbers to Project Shetu for use. When a caller asks about legal issues, 999 refer them to one of the Project Shetu. These calls, referred as \"case calls\" by the 999 service, provide the caller to a network of over 200 volunteer lawyers. Before proceeding, a team of volunteers vet the call to assess its genuinity and determine viability and urgency. The lawyers take the case pro bono if the complainant is needy, and charge only half the usual cost if they can somewhat afford to pay.  When the issue is about police stations reluctant to register a GD or case, the lawyers address them by visiting the pertinent police station. In many situations, the lawyers try to arbitrate between both parties and involve local leaders like the chairman or ward councillor. And in extreme situations, when neither arbitration nor police involvement is satisfactory, the lawyers file cases directly with the courts. Between March 3 and May 18 this year, 58 cases were filed with the courts. Divorce and remarriage in Gazipur Around 50% of all recorded cases originated in the Gazipur district, 10% from the Dhaka division excluding Gazipur, 15% in the Rajshahi division, and the other 15% were from all over the country. Project Shetu looked into the unusually high number of complaints - mostly regarding domestic abuse, women and children repression, and dowry - from Gazipur. They found that there was a tendency among the RMG workers in the area to engage in multiple relationships. Many female RMG workers were found to have married four or five times, and male RMG workers were married seven or eight times. Project Shetu observed that due to a high concentration of RMG factories in the district and employee turnover, divorces and remarrying are frequent phenomena, according to Project Shetu Director Sayeda Ferdous Ahmed, who is also chairman of the Justice Vision Foundation. Cybercrimes in Barisal Project Shetu reported that the majority of complaints over cybercrime came from Barisal. Likewise, most cybercrime cases that were filed also originated from Barisal. From the case details, it was noted that the victims were mostly lonely housewives with husbands elsewhere or teenagers with jilted ex-boyfriends. Most victims were aged 14-26.  Married women who seek company to cope with loneliness, and young girls with vengeful ex-boyfriends - both groups are frequent victims of blackmail at the hands of predators masquerading in society. For the women, having their husband send them money on a regular basis make them lucrative targets. The much younger girls, however, suffer from intimate photos and videos uploaded to the internet. Furthermore, the conservative nature of society and the scandalous nature of the crime prevent the victims from asking for help from their families.  How are cybercrimes dealt with? Cybercrimes by nature are murky grounds for many prosecutors and judges to delve into, considering they are a relatively new by-product of the internet. The Information and Communication Technology ACT passed in 2006 was overhauled and a more up-to-date, nonetheless controversial, Digital Security Act was passed by the parliament in 2018.  The fact that there is just one cybercrime tribunal in Bangladesh only drives the point home further. The lawyers go to the police, whose cybercrimes unit then take down the offensive content, which can take up to seven days. The online removal is not a permanent solution, as the perpetrators can re-upload faster than they can be removed. Uncertain future despite success Mohammad Tabarak Ullah, superintendent of police (Telecom & Information Management), attached to the National Emergency Service, told Dhaka Tribune: \"When the callers ask us where they can find legal aid, we refer them to Project Shetu or 109, a dedicated hotline for issues regarding violence against women and children.  \"We would like for victimized women to receive the legal assistance they seek. We partnered with Project Shetu as they were able to provide the necessary service. The pilot project has been going well, but we cannot really say how things will be after the project concludes.\" Advocate Salma Ali, a rights activist and executive director of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association, said: \"I've received several calls pertaining to this nature. The alarming rate of cases from Gazipur is eventually going to blow up beyond reasonable proportions soon. Many women, even those who seek legal aid, are reluctant to admit how many times they have been married.  \"The men file cases to prevent divorces, hoping that arbitration can hold the marriage together so they do not have to pay the dowry. And the women file cases in order to realize their dowry. Some men believe that if a woman asks for divorce, the husband is not required to pay them anything. The confusion leads to lawsuits.\" The lawyer noted that the BNWLA has found that the majority of people involved in these cases had moved to Gazipur from northern Bangladesh in search of work. She suggested that the RMG workers be provided dormitory facilities and personnel training on how to interact, who to interact with, what to avoid, etc to prevent untoward incidents. Advocate Salma Ali also stressed for the implementation of the Sexual Harassment Guideline. Magnitude of violence Sutopa (pseudonym), a 26-year-old woman from Dhaka's Gulshan, inherited a vast fortune from her parents. But her mother had remarried, and after her death, the stepfather conspired with Sutopa's husband to appropriate her property by getting her committed to a rehabilitation centre after labelling her a drug abuser. Her business partner contacted the national emergency service and informed them of the plight. Project Shetu's actions saw the heiress released from rehab. Currently, they are litigating against the stepfather and husband. In Rajshahi, an eight-year-old boy called 999 after his uncle cut off his mother's left breast when she refused his advances. The boy's father was working abroad, and was contacted by Project Shetu. The issue was not brought before the court or the police. The husband, concerned over the reputation, asked for arbitration and the legal team provided the required counselling to resolve the issue without involving the law. The woman was provided medical treatment, and her brother-in-law faced no action. Tamanna (pseudonym), a 20-year-old from Dhaka's Rampura, divorced her husband because he would abuse her during sex. He was a large 102kg man and she was less than half his weight at 49kg. Unable to fend off his beatings, she sought freedom in divorce. But Tamanna would find no respite as her husband had recorded videos of their intercourse without her knowledge. He threatened to upload the videos online, and she contacted the emergency helpline. Project Shetu saw to it that a GD was filed and the case was turned over to the DB. Project Director Sayeda Ferdous Ahmed said the High Court is now quite familiar with Project Shetu. She said the High Court has advised to engage in more counselling and raise awareness for the widespread domestic violence.  The lawyer said the non-profit project is funded entirely by the volunteers themselves, but always open to donations."

The inundated roads are making it worse as the villagers couldn't even travel to the nearby health complexes for treatment. In Kurigram, Although the water level of major rivers has fallen, the sufferings of about a million flood-hit people have increased, because of a shortage of drinking water, food, fodder, and fuel. Sanitation has also turned out to be a major problem with many people suffering from water-borne diseases. Locals alleged that they are not receiving proper medical care from the authority, and are lacking of doctors, and medicine, making the situation worse. Locals of Namarchor village of Sadar upazila, Munni, Shahida Kajli, and Nejam Uddin said they are treating their sick children only with oral salines from nearby shops.

Petrol pump owners began their strike on Sunday morning upon a decision of Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Khulna Divisional committees of the Bangladesh Petrol Pump and Tank Lorry Malik-Sramik Oikya Parishad. Around 26 petrol pumps in Natore were shut down due to the strike, causing severe problems for vehicle owners. Under these circumstances, traffic on the roads has also declined. The shutdown of petrol pumps has led to a fuel crisis in Rangpur division. Interdistrict supplies and supply of fuel to buses that operate between Rangpur and Dhaka, came to a halt due to the strike. All of the petrol pumps in Rajshahi division were quite crowded on Saturday night, following the declaration of this strike. Owner of Bengal Travels, Khalid Ebadullah, who went to Rajshahi town's Afrin Filling Station to get fuel, said people crowded the filling stations since morning for fuel since the announcement of the strike. Bangladesh Petrol Pump Owners' Association's Rajshahi Division General Secretary Rafikul Islam told Dhaka Tribune: \"The protest initially began from Khulna division and gradually spread out to Rajshahi and Rangpur. Today, around 500 petrol pump owners of these two divisions joined the strike. \"If our demands are not met, drivers of CNG-run auto rickshaws will also join us, and gradually it will become a nationwide protest.\" 15-point demands pressed by Bangladesh Petrol Pump Owners' Association | Dhaka Tribune He said that they will continue demonstrating until their demands are met. Bangladesh Petrol Pump Owners' Association's Rangpur Division Vice President Abul Majed said: \"We have urged the government previously to raise the commission for selling fuel as well as to increase the rent for tank lorries, but our demands were not carried out even after government assurances to that effect. \"As a result, we were forced to call this indefinite strike. We will not withdraw it until all our demands are met.\" On November 26, the association's leaders gave an ultimatum to meet their 15 point demand by November 30. Their demands include payment of 7.5% commission for selling fuel, introduction of accident insurance of Tk5 lakh for tank lorry workers, increasing fares for tank lorries, stopping police harassment and extortion, and dismissing the order to collect licenses for pumps from the Department of Environment.  Several petrol pump owners said they can hardly make al profit after paying workers their due wages, because of the nominally small commission they receive. Customers are also distressed by the sudden strike as they have been forced to buy fuel at a higher price from retailers. MP denied fuel in Thakurgaon Workers of Chowdhury Filling Station in Thakurgaon refused to fill the tanks of two cars of Awami League Presidium Member Ramesh Chandra Sen, MP. The Thakurgaon 1 constituency MP went to the filling station on his way to Dhaka after visiting his area. Regarding this incident, Thakurgaon District President of Bangladesh Petrol Pump Owners' Association, Enamul Haque, said the owners would continue their strike until the government meets their 15 point demand."

Speakers made this remark in a peace conference during an event observing the International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, in front of the National Press Club in Dhaka on Tuesday.  Successful diplomacy of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and dedication of the Bangladeshi government along with relentless efforts of the men and women peacekeepers from this country has now been established all over the world, the speakers stated.  The event was presided over CLNB President Harunur Rashid. Among others, Bir Protik Colonel (rtd) Didarul Alam, was present at event.  The International Day of United Nations Peacekeepers, 29 May, offers a chance to pay tribute to the uniformed and civilians personnel's invaluable contribution to the work of the organization and to honour more than 3,800 peacekeepers who have lost their lives serving under the UN flag since 1948, including 98 last year.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-12 00:00:00      \nNew study claims rising sea levels far worse that previously calculated   A new research suggests that if carbon emissions peak by 2020, land now home to roughly a fifth of the populations of Bangladesh and Vietnam may be lower than high tide lines by 2100. Quoting the research by Nature Communications, the World Economic Forum in an article said hundreds of millions more people are already at risk from climate breakdown-caused coastal flooding and sea level rise than previously thought.  The research also fears that the proportion under threat would rise to a third of the population in Bangladesh if emissions continue unchecked. Even with immediate and deep emissions cuts, large swathes of the coastal land we live on now could be uninhabitable by the end of the century, the article said.   \"Existing estimates of risk from sea-level rise - taken from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission - did not exactly paint a rosy picture for coastal communities. But, in using space-based satellite imagery to measures the elevations of surfaces closest to the sky, much of the data actually reported the elevation of treetops and rooftops, rather than the ground itself.\"  Flood-affected people in Balasi Ghat, Gaibadha heading  for shelter on July 22, 2019 | Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune\"As a result, it overestimates coastal elevations by more than two metres on average, and more than four metres in urban areas,\" the article added. Based on the new model, it has been estimated not 28 million but 110 million people already live below the current high tide line. At the same time, instead of 68 million people living below annual flood levels, the figure is now 250 million - the same number that live less than one metre above sea level. Mentioning that the increase in vulnerability to sea-level rise and flooding is not evenly distributed, the report also said more than 70% of those living on at-risk land are in eight Asian countries: Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, China, and Japan.  \"And for many of these countries, the increase in risk that the new model predicts for the coming decades is much higher than three-fold.\" It also mentions that modern defences, such as levees and seawalls, will remain vital in protecting hundreds of millions of coastal residents, but these by no means guarantees protection against future sea levels and storms as superstorms already breach flood defences in the most developed cities in the world. It also said that away from urban areas, the astronomical costs of protecting large areas from sea-level rise and flooding means that millions will need to be resettled in the coming decades - or else forcefully displaced by the rising seas.  \"Even in countries such as the US and the UK, sea-level rise this century may require large-scale migration away from unprotected coastlines. In countries less able to cope, loss of lives and livelihoods, political chaos, and conflict are highly likely without support,\" it said."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-16 00:00:00      \nHe added that Japan's aid to Bangladesh, last year, totalled $1.8 billion  Japanese Ambassador in Dhaka Hiroyasu Izumi has said the Special Economic Zone for Japanese investors in Bangladesh--and the One Stop Service Act--are likely to attract more Japanese companies; especially in the fields of: food, commodity products, light industry, and ICT. \"Since the year 2008, the investment from Japan to Bangladesh has been expanding and the trend is getting stronger, especially after 2011,\" he told UNB in an interview.  This trend, Ambassador Izumi said, is likely to continue for the coming years; considering the competitive labour force and the size of the market of Bangladesh with its large, young population. He, however, said the investment climate and doing business in Bangladesh \"are not very favourable\" for foreign companies.  The time-consuming process of applying to launch businesses and registration, as well as a lack of sufficient infrastructure, an intricate process of applying for work visas, and a complicated tax system-- including retroactive taxation--could be named as the main bottlenecks to start businesses in Bangladesh, he said. In particular, Ambassador Izumi said, the insufficiencies in logistics and taxation systems, such as \"too-heavy tariffs,\" need to be addressed.  \"They are not only the hindrances for FDI from Japan but also cause drawbacks to the growth of the local economy in Bangladesh,\" he said. Analysing the current situation of the foreign companies, and listening to their requests, are essential to make the overall investment environment more attractive, said Ambassador Izumi. Responding to a question, the Japanese envoy said that surrounded on all sides by the sea, Japan is also deeply rooted in the blue economy and has a long history of using marine resources.  \"I, therefore, believe Japan and Bangladesh can exchange knowledge and expertise in blue economy and marine resources,\" he said. A conference was co-organised in March by the Ministry of Fisheries & Livestock and Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, the envoy said adding, \"'Bangladesh Blue Economy Dialogue on Fisheries and Marine Culture'\" was quite suggestive and meaningful.\" \"We would like to consider future cooperation in the field of blue economy with the government of Bangladesh,\" said the Ambassador. When asked about Bangladesh's exports to Japan, he said in Japan they are seeing more and more clothes manufactured in Bangladesh, but Japanese people are not very aware that they are made in Bangladesh. \"To further encourage exports from Bangladesh to Japan, I believe it is very important for Bangladesh's companies to conduct thorough market research in Japan, especially focusing on the quality-oriented tendency of the Japanese consumers,\" said the Japanese envoy. Other potential exports from Bangladesh to Japan, he thinks, could be medicine, leather goods or agricultural (marine) products.  \"For any product, however, creating additional value that attracts Japanese consumer is the key to expand and boost exports to Japan from Bangladesh,\" said the Ambassador. To do so, he suggested having more opportunities to introduce Bangladeshi products in Japan, such as organising trade fairs or exhibitions, to make them familiar to Japanese consumers. Responding to a question on people-to-people contact, he said friendship between Japan and Bangladesh started immediately after the independence of Bangladesh. \"Since then, the two nations have always been very close friends.\" For example, the Ambassador said, Japan has provided scholarships for more than 4,000 Bangladeshi students over decades. Last year, more than 120 students received this scholarship and went to Japan from Bangladesh. Also in the field of business, there are currently more than 260 Japanese companies operating their businesses in Bangladesh, and interaction through business is also growing rapidly. Dhaka, Tokyo plan big for 2022 The year 2022 will mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Bangladesh and Japan. \"The coming years will be very important for our two countries. Toward this anniversary, we are working hard to enhance our bilateral relations even further,\" said the Japanese Ambassador. In celebration of this anniversary, Bangladesh and Japan are expecting to see more and more interaction between the two countries, including cultural and people-to-people exchanges in the years to come. The Ambassador said several cooperation projects were launched with the successful mutual visits by the two Prime Ministers-- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe--in 2014.  \"Apart from bridges, we are working on other projects like the Dhaka International Airport Terminal, Dhaka Metro lines, and Matarbari port and power plant, and all these projects are going well as planned with high quality.  It is my tremendous joy to celebrate this anniversary with the people of Bangladesh based on this ever-growing relationship,\" he said. Since his arrival in 2017, Ambassador Izumi said he has been witnessing an increasing number of visits both at ministerial and other levels.  \"I expect our bilateral relationship to grow even closer and stronger in the years to come.\" He said Japan has been the single biggest bilateral development partner for Bangladesh and the amount of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to Bangladesh from Japan last year marked $1.8 billion. \"This figure was a record, the largest-ever Japanese ODA support to Bangladesh for one year. I am pleased to inform you that Bangladesh is now the second-largest recipient of Japan's ODA in the world,\" he said."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-19 00:00:00      \nLast couple of seasons witnessed a substantial growth in rice production Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal on Sunday hinted about rice exports and restricting imports in a bid to bring relief to the growers hit hard by lower pieces of paddy.  \"The country will export rice even though it needs subsidy,\" said the minister while addressing a program at planning ministry in the capital. The farmers were suffering not getting fair price of their produce as the markets had higher amount of stocks than what was needed. Meanwhile, the rice, imported in recent years, increased the stocks, lowering the price further. The minister, in the program, also criticized the rice import and said that the import would be banned immediately. \"The country's farmers need to be saved and for that import must be stopped,\" he said. According to food ministry data, the country imported 2,00,000 tons of rice over the last 10 months of the current fiscal and 3,80,000 more tons are under process of import. The government promoted rice imports two years ago withdrawing the import duties to meet rice supply shortage caused by 2017 flood, which badly affected crops, especially in hoar areas. The government then had said they would require 10,00,000 tons of rice but a total of 60,00,000 tons were imported in last two years, said the food ministry. Besides, last couple of seasons witnessed a substantial growth in rice production.   As a result, the prices of rice were not rational with farmers' cost of production, which caused losses to the growers. Meanwhile, boro rice has started coming to market, bringing down the rice prices further. \"Boro rice has started coming, adding to the stocks, which was already higher than the demand,\" said HM Asad, a Karwan Bazar-based wholesaler. \"As a result, we have to cut the price by Tk300-400 per 50kg bag of rice to maintain market competitiveness,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune.  \"The government initiative to keep the rice prices in favour of consumers deprives farmers of fair prices,\" he claimed. During a visit to several markets of the capital on Saturday, the Dhaka Tribune has found rice selling at Tk30 to Tk50 depending on their verities, which was Tk38 to Tk65 last week, a Tk8-15 fall per kilogram. Experts were repeatedly calling for reducing production costs though increasing yield. The minister Mustafa Kamal said the use of new technology could reduce the cost of production, bringing more profit to the harvesters. Hinting at government initiatives for technological revolution in agricultural sector, he said that the government would bring high-tech agriculture machineries for the farmers.  \"We want to provide such machineries at subsidized rates but the farmers are not interested to buy those,\" the minister expressed frustration."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-24 00:00:00      \nThe evolution of home essentials in Bangladesh How does one tell the story of Bangladesh? The road most taken leads to the country's violent birth and the glory of its founding fathers. Another popular approach is to talk about this rising South Asian tiger that is smashing its development goals and making strides in other arenas, such as sports. But in the tales of heroes and legends, the everyday colours of Bangladesh fade into the background, and to really see them, you'll have to enter the homes of ordinary Bangladeshis.  This is exactly what International Homeware has been doing for the past 62 years, and the story of this family business might well be the story of the evolution of lifestyles in Bangladesh.  A little background In 1957, the late Alhaj Abdul Wazed opened a ceramics outlet in New Market, called \"Crockeries View\", importing fine crockery and tableware. This expanded into three more showrooms under the names, \"Unique Traders\" (since 1964), \"General Gift House\" (since 1967) and \"Unique Promotion\" (since 1992). He was succeeded in 1992 by his son Mizanur Rahman, who took the business further, expanding the range of products and the reach of the brand. In the early years of the present decade, the separate stores were brought under the umbrella of International Homeware (IHW), which boasts 7 outlets around the country, and has expanded its product range to include not only ceramics and glassware, but also kitchen appliances and industrial grade dishware and equipment for restaurants and hotels. In 2010, the founder's grandson Moin Ur Rahman joined the company as Managing Director, thus bringing the company into its third generation. Avenue T caught up with the young MD to talk about the journey of this family owned business. The face of change A week before our cover shoot, I'm sitting in the air-conditioned boardroom at IHW's corporate headquarters in Banani. The reception area outside bears the three framed photographs of the founder, his son, and his grandson, and looking at it, one can fill the weight of history settle down on one's shoulders. Moin enters, a little late, red-faced from wrestling the traffic to get here, apologizing profusely for the delay. Stuffy businessman? Absolutely not. His funky haircut, infectious energy, and the habit of prefacing every statement with an emphatic \"auughhhh\" all give him the vibe of the laid back best friend. For a business looking to adapt to the contemporary zeitgeist, you could not have asked for a better face for the company. We settle in to a comfortable chat about the evolution of the business and lifestyles in Bangladesh 5  Questions with Moin Ur Rahman What's it been like, entering the business in its third generation? It's been familiar and intimidating all at the same time. On one hand, my Dadaji and my father have created a legacy of quality products, importing only the finest goods from all over the world, and the goodwill and the reputation they have created makes it easier to do business than it would have if we'd had to start from scratch.  The downside of being the young voice in a company which has been doing things a certain way for the past two generations is that you meet a certain resistance to change. When I push forward some innovations, I am met with a lot of: \"But this is how we've always done things\" and it can get frustrating. It's a process, but I think I'm getting better at handling it.' How, in your opinion, has the business changed? To start with, things are much more complicated now. When my grandfather started out, there wasn't so much competition, but at the same time, the client base is also much, much smaller. Pre-Liberation, the spending power of the population was much lower; their tastes were very different. The bulk of Dadaji's clients were wealthy Aga Khani families.  Then immediately after 1971, there was a ban on imports for a while, and we had to switch to local ceramics and products, and that was a struggle to innovate and maintain the standards we had already set.   When the ban was finally lifted, the market had begun to change. When my father took over, he had to travel extensively, undertaking long voyages, sacrificing a lot of his comfort to find the best products. I marvel at it because I could never travel like that. It definitely paid off -- where most other home essentials companies flood the market with Chinese products, we actually bring top quality products from Brazil, UK, France, Germany, Italy, UAE, India, Czech Republic, Singapore, Indonesia, Japan, and China. We diversified our product ranges into three categories: Home & living, Kitchen & Dining and Household Electric Appliances. We had brought all our outlets under the IHW brand banner.  By the time I came in, we'd already seen the rise of the middle class, and the restaurant boom. Right now, we're seeing people, particularly young corporate and entrepreneurs, new couples, with a lot more disposable income. And mind you, I'm not just talking about Dhaka - I've seen lifestyle stores in Chittagong, Rajshahi, Barisal and Khulna, devoted to beautiful home essentials.  There are new businesses, hotels and restaurants popping up all the time, and these need the industrial and restaurant-grade appliances, so we're seeing an increased demand for those as well.   Bangladeshis now travel more, and are social media savvy, and this informs a lot of their purchase decisions, not just what they buy, but also, how they buy.  So what's the plan? What changes are you trying to bring in? To begin with, we're looking at a future that is very digital. So far, the business model my Dadaji and my father had been used to was based on face-to-face interactions, but increasingly, people prefer to buy their goods online, especially if it's a brand they trust, so we're working on our e-commerce platform, which is launching very soon.  If we want to match the current trends and face the future, we also have to adopt newer methods of business and sustainable resources to import as a trading company, thus ensuring effective and efficient output. A lot of this involves incorporating new management principles  centred on building a better relationship with our employees, patrons and partners.  In addition to evolving the business for the contemporary client, I also want to bring some changes into the workplace culture at IHW. We've so far run the traditional model of business, with formal hierarchies and relationships. While I acknowledge that I don't have access to unlimited funds, and we do have some 300+ dedicated employees, I also want to make this a fun place to work at. Ideally, I'd like to change the office design to incorporate more open spaces, and maybe bring in some facilities that will allow the employees to relax. Our previous generations didn't really mix work and play, but newer studies have shown that productivity goes up in an office environment that allows a reasonable amount of opportunities for recreation and relaxation. And happier employees will just be better at customer service. It's going to be a process of adjustment, but hopefully I'll be able to bring that change in. IHW has also been involved in some admirable CSR projects and collaborations. Could you please elaborate on these a little? We're partnering with the It's Humanity Foundation (IHF), which provides free education, healthcare and vocational training to underprivileged children. One of the foundation's projects is an artisan project called Protibha, which facilitates the mothers of these unprivileged children to generate an income by using their creative skills. When we found out that one of those creative skills included glass painting and they were using glassware from IHW, we decided to get further involved, by providing them the glassware, and then displaying the finished artisanal glassware at our outlets for sale. In this way, we promote their work, and also help them earn an income, which then supplements the support already provided to their children, who are enrolled in the IHF schools.  What is your message to the readers of Avenue T? Enjoy your life. Use the 'good' china, instead of storing it in the cabinet for the 'proper' occasion. Life is short; give yourself the permission to enjoy it.  "

According to district Department of Agriculture Extension sources, the devastating storm damaged least 5,017 fish enclosures, and 2,000 hectares of Aman, along with large amounts of winter vegetables, betel leaves, mustard, and boroi across the district. Md Osman Gani Sohab, a farmer from Shyamnagar, said he lost his Aman crops on four bighas of land in the flood caused by incessant rain during the cyclone Bulbul. Another Aman farmer Khalilur Rahman from Sadar upazila, who planted his crops on five bighas of leased land, said: \"All my crops were damaged overnight during the storm.\" Abdul Bari, a shrimp farmer from Assasuni upazila, said: \"My shrimp enclosure on 150 bighas was completely flooded, causing me to lose shrimps and whitefishes worth around Tk35-40 lakh.\" Belal Hossain, another shrimp farmer from Shyamnagar upazila, said: \"After my fish enclosure on 30 bighas was flooded, I lost shrimps and whitefishes worth around Tk30-35 lakh.\" Arbinda Biswas, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension of Satkhira district, said: \"2,000 hectares of Aman which were destroyed by the flood and storm were worth approximately Tk28.33 crore. Apart from this, 80 hectares of winter vegetables worth Tk2.8 crore, 12 hectares of betel leaves worth Tk1.51 crore, 50 hectares of mustard worth Tk26.4 lakh, were also damaged, causing an aggregate loss of around Tk33,10,90,000.\" Satkhira Fisheries Officer Moshiur Rahman said: \"At least 5,017 shrimp enclosures on 5,719 hectares across Assasuni, Shyamnagar, and Kaliganj upazilas were flooded causing a loss of 414 tons shrimps and whitefishes worth around Tk10.36 crore.\" Burigoalini UP Chairman Bhabatash Mandal said: \"The cyclonic storm wreaked havoc in my union. The sheer force of the storm uprooted a large number of big trees. Pucca and tin-shed homes were damaged, and shrimp enclosures and croplands were inundated.\" Ahead of the cyclonic storm Bulbul, the danger signal 10 was hoisted at Satkhira. The storm which hit the district around 5am on Sunday lasted till 9am, causing substantial damage to homes, croplands, and roads alike."

Around 100 feet of embankment wall in Kola village in Pratapnagar union of the upazila collapsed into the river.  The collapse flooded the low areas of the Kola and Hizlia villages. Several houses and over a hundred fish enclosures have been marooned and damaged.  If not repaired quickly, some 250 kilometers of the embankments across Satkhira might collapse in the coming rainy season.  According to sources concerned, two rivers--the Kapotakkha and Kholpetua--flow through seven unions in the Shyamnagar and Assasuni upazilas of the cyclone-Aila-hit district.  Moreover, the embankment on the Ichamati river, flowing through parts of the Debhata upazila, have also become dilapidated due to a lack of overhaul.  The embankment bars in these areas are in such ramshackle condition that they could collapse anytime; resulting a huge amount of land being submerged. According to the Water Development Board, around 250 kilometers of the 799.10 kilometer-long embankments in the district have been labeled extremely risky.     Subrata Mandal, a resident of Kamalkati village under Padmapukur union of Shyamnagar upazila, said: \"The embankment's condition--in the Kamalkati, Purbapatakhali, Chaulkhola and Banyatala villages of Padmapukur union--is very risky and might collapse anytime.\" Padmapukur Union Chairman SM Ataur Rahman said nearly six kilometers of the embankments in his union are badly decayed. Masudul Alam, chairman of Gabura union in Shyamnagar upazila, also said the barrage in his union and adjacent areas is extremely vulnerable after being damaged by two cyclones -- Aila and Sidr. He also complained about negligence of duty by the Water Development Board as it is their duty to look after the well-being of the dam. According to sources, there are 377.10 kilometers of embankment line under Water Development Board 1 in Satkhira. Sixty kilometers of that embankment line is damaged.  On the other, Water Development Board 2 is responsible for 422 kilometers of embankment line. One hundred and fifty kilometers of the line is also damaged.  Arifuzzaman Khan, executive engineer of Water Development Board 2, said: \"We have sent notice to the higher authority concerned about the embankment's risky condition. Necessary steps will be taken after receiving funds.\" Meanwhile, Ekata Jubo Sangha and development organization BARCIK staged a human chain in Padmapukur union's Kamalkati village; demanding the repair of the embankments on Kholpetua and Kapatakkha rivers. People of all strata of life took part in the human chain."

BSTI recently issued three separate letters in this regard. With this there will be no bar to manufacture, sell and market PRAN Turmeric powder, curry powder and lachcha semai, reports UNB. Earlier on June 11, BSTI withdrawn suspension of 26 companies, clearing them to sell their products, barely a month after it found the same products substandard.   In a circular issued on that, BSTI said these companies were  again permitted to sell their products after they had managed to ensure the required standards. It also said the decision to revoke the licences of 25 companies and suspend the licence of one was upheld. Licences of all these companies were either revoked or suspended when BSTI in the first phase of tests found 52 out of 406 food items to be substandard. BSTI on Tuesday also said that 22 of the 93 other food items, currently being sold in the market, were found substandard in the second phase of testing."

Even though locals identify it as the Rudrakar Jamindar Bari Math, it is in fact the mausoleum of Nilmoni Chakraborty, an influential Jamindar who lived over 250 years ago. However, this tall historic structure is in near ruins, neglected by the authorities.   Locals say renovation and preservation could potentially turn this place into a tourist spot for people keen on travelling. It is approximately 3km south of the Shariatpur deputy commissioner's office. Locals know this place as the Babu Bari Math. Visiting, this correspondent found this historic site in a dire state, with collapsing wall plaster, garbage, and weeds all around. There used to be inscriptions on the wall even a few years ago, and the valuable artifacts used in the structure were stolen over the years since the liberation war.   During the war the Pakistani army, with the help of local Razakars (Pakistani collaborators), tried to destroy the math using machine gun and mortar shells, but it did little to no damage to the structure. According to local history, at the beginning of the era of Jamindars, the Mandir was established in phases by Banilal Chakraborty, Khitilal Chakraborty, and Boshontolal Chakraborty, the three sons of Nilmoni Chakraborty.     It took renowned masons Tilok Bhuiya and Gurucharan Bhuiya, and hundreds of extra hands, to complete the structure  over a span of 10 years.  Senior citizens in the region said that under Jamindar rule, this region saw  great advancement in the practice of education and culture. During British rule, they built 19 schools in a half square kilometre area, where education and cultural practices flourished.  Rudrakar Jamindar Bari was surrounded by 8 or 10 multistoried buildings. Among them, the three storied buildings were residential chambers. The others were used for court sessions, warehouses, theatres, kitchens, and worshipping purposes.     Rudrakar Union Parishad Chairman Habibur Rahman Dhali said: \"A lot of valuables were stolen from the site due to negligence. It is my sincere request to the government that they look into preserving and renovating this historic monument, so that it can be turned into an attractive tourist spot.\"  Shariatpur Additional District Commissioner Md Mamun Ul Hasan said: \"We have previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Department of Archaeology regarding renovation of the Rudrakar Jamindar Bari Math. We will once again notify the authorities concerned to renovate and preserve this ancient archaeological site. \""

September-October (Ashwin-Kartik) is their peak breeding season, he added. \"Ilish follows the lunar cycles of seasons for breeding. This year's ilish ban started four days before the first full moon and ended seven days after the new moon of Ashwin-Kartik. This means their conception period started just few days before ban ended\", said another District Fisheries Officer Abu Sayed. According local fishermen, ilish breeding season started after the end of imposed restriction period due to the delayed start to the rainy season. Ajit Kumar Das, a leader of the Barisal Fish Traders Association, said the huge quantity of egg bearing ilish may indicate the change of breeding season of ilish."

      "authors": "Mohammed Monirul Alam",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-31 00:00:00      \nBB unveils monetary policy statement The Bangladesh Bank (BB) on Wednesday unveiled a cautious monetary policy focused on achieving 8.2% economic growth in the current fiscal year, claiming a surplus of liquidity in the banking sector to fund the private sector. In the new monetary program, the central bank lowered the target of credit to private sector to 14.80% for the current 2019-20 fiscal from 16.50% set for the second half of the last fiscal year. The policy projected 24.30% credit growth for the public sector. Actual credit growth to private sector was 11.29% and 21.10% for public sector in January-June, according to BB data. Governor Fazle Kabir unveiled the monetary policy statement (MPS) at a press conference held at the central bank headquarters in the city. Senior BB officials were present at the program. Fazle Kabir said the central bank reviewed the budgetary investment requirements before setting up the fresh credit growth targets to ensure sufficient flow of finance to public and private sectors to enhance the economic expansion. \"This is 'a cautiously accommodative' monetary program in order to help the government achieve 8.2% GDP (gross domestic product) growth target and contain inflation at 5.5%,\" Fazle Kabir said. He said that the central bank thought the 14.80% growth in private sector credit would be enough to raise investment towards achieving the targeted GDP growth. He said the BB would pursue its policy instruments for keeping inflation at 5.5% as projected by the government in the budget for 2019-20 fiscal. Fazle Kabir said this MPS would  be in action for the entire fiscal, from July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. He said the BB decided to enforce one monetary program for each  financial year, effective from the current fiscal, instead of twice. He said the BB had been announcing two MPS since 2006 -- one in January and another in July. Capital market  Regarding the capital market, the MPS stated that correctly priced new IPOs (initial public offerings) of healthy and well-managed corporations might bring lasting solution to intermittent volatility at capital market.  It says the newly introduced IPO rules by Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission will be instrumental to overcoming manipulation of the market information. In his speech, the governor, however, didn't make any comment over the capital market. Non-performing loans (NPL) The governor said the NPL would decrease in the last quarter that ended on June 30, 2019 as the central bank pursued banks to enforce policy instruments like new provisioning guidelines for the defaulters. Banks were also advised to avoid imprudent lending so that no new NPL was generated. Till March 2019, the NPL rose to Tk110,874 crore or 11.87% of total loans and advances of the banking sector. The Banking Regulations and Policy Department of Bangladesh Bank established a Task Force to monitor banks' NPL.  Single-digit interest rates Regarding single digit interest rates, the BB governor said the weighted average lending rates of banks came down to 9.58% in June 2019 from 9.95% in the same month of previous fiscal. He said the BB would continue pursuing banks to reduce lending rate to single digit.  Liquidity mismatch Denying the much-talked-about liquidity shortfall in the banking sector, the governor said a mismatch had been detected in liquidity status of banks as some banks had sufficient liquidity while some did not.  Till June 2019, surplus liquidity was at Tk86,816 crore at banks after maintaining CRR (cash reserve requirements) and SLR (statutory liquidity ratio) provisions, he claimed. The governor said high export earnings, rise in remittance and FDI (foreign direct investment) inflows together eased the liquidity pressure. \"In addition, there is a money market from where a bank can borrow on call to meet liquidity demand, if any,\" he said. The governor said the central bank would not consider any change in key-policy rates like repo, reverse repo and CRR and SLR right now as it felt no liquidity crisis existed. Foreign exchange market Trashing the possibility of any depreciation of taka against US dollars, the governor said the forex market was stable now with exchange rate at Tk84.50 for one unit of greenback.  \"We are comfortable with that. No depreciation will take place right now. However, we are not rigid. Situation will tell us what to do and the central bank will do that for sure,\" he added. Incentive for inward remittance  The governor said the central bank recently proposed a monthly ceiling for inward remittance for getting incentive for the approval of the Ministry of Finance. The proposal came following the government's announcement of providing 2% cash incentive for inward remittance. \"This initiative is aimed at widening scope of exploiting the external resources as cash incentives will encourage remitters to send higher amount of money through banking and other legal channels,\" said the governor. Replying to a question on outgoing remittances, the governor said the central bank would include the information distinctly in next monetary programs. BB to carry out study on informal economy, employment Replying to a question over the disclosure of employment statistics simultaneously with the country's development, the governor said the BB would carry out employment statistics in its next monetary program. Admitting the necessity of carrying out study on informal economy, governor Fazle Kabir said, \"We will go for conducting the study soon.\" BB measures in aid of flood-affected people  The governor said the central bank took initiatives to help flood-affected people across the country by undertaking different programs. The initiatives include suspension of farm-credit repayment until flood situation improves, fresh credit for farmers and flood-affected people to help implement income generation schemes, relief works for flood-affected peoples from the Corporate Social Responsibility funds of banks."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-23 00:00:00      \nThe Cricket Association of Bengal organized the program at the Eden Garden on completion of the first day of the historic day-night test match there Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday said Bangladesh is working for the development of cricket as it is the most popular game in the country and sought India's help in this regard. \"Now, cricket is the most popular game in Bangladesh as it's in India. We have put in much efforts to improve the game. Hope, India would continue to help Bangladesh develop its cricket,\" she said while addressing a cultural program at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, reports UNB. The Cricket Association of Bengal organized the program at the Eden Garden on completion of the first day of the historic day-night test match there. Sheikh Hasina said the multi-faceted relationship between Bangladesh and India has reached a new height over the last decade. \"It's my sincere hope that the deep ties of friendship that exist between Bangladesh and India will continue to grow and flourish in the coming days.\" About hosting international cricket events, Hasina said Bangladesh hosted many international competitions, including ICC World Cup matches. She recalled the first test match of Bangladesh against India at Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka in 2000 when the present president of Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Shourav Ganguly was the Captain of the Indian team. \"Today is a memorable day for the cricket fans in both Bangladesh and India. Many of team members of the first test match between India and Bangladesh are present here today. I extend my greetings to them. I'm sure we'll have many more similar and happy occasions in the days ahead,\" the PM said. Hasina said Bangladesh and India share identical history, culture, language, sports and other unique commonalities, and recalled the enormous contributions of Indian government and its people, especially the people of West Bengal, to the Liberation War of Bangladesh in 1971. \"We fought a war against an unjust military ruler at the clarion call of our Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. At that time, a number of critical activities was mobilized and carried out from West Bengal, particularly from Kolkata with the support of the people of India,\" she said. Hasina said Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman visited Kolkata on February 6, 1972 during his first oversees tour of India. \"We have a very special relationship with India. The relationship is the friendliest one. The friendship of Bangladesh and India is in our hearts. The bonds of friendship will remain firm and long-lasting,\" she quoted Bangabandhu as saying in a dinner party during his first visit to Kolkata after the Liberation War. \"This is still the guiding principle of Bangladesh-India relations. Today, our relationship has become a role model of good neighborliness for the rest of the world,\" Hasina added. She said Bangladesh Bhavan at Santiniketan is yet another milestone of the growing cultural ties of the relationship of Bangladesh and India. Last year, she along with her Indian counterpart Narendra Modi and Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee inaugurated it, Hasina mentioned. The people of Bangladesh and West Bengal share food habits, poets, novelists and artists, the Prime Minister pointed out. She said the overwhelming influence of Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore and Rebel poet Kazi Nazrul Islam on the lives of the two peoples is unique. \"Cricket is another binding force between the people of our two countries,\" the premier said. Chief Minister of West Bengal Mamata Banerjee, Bangladesh Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque, Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alam, BCCI President Sourav Ganguly and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Nazmul Hassan Papon were, among others, present."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-14 00:00:00      \n'We were about to harvest our ripe Aman crops, but before we could, the cyclone flooded all our crops' Farmers in Koyra upazila of Khulna are frustrated and in despair. It will be a bad harvest for them, with 26,000 hectares of crops destroyed by Cyclone Bulbul across the district which hit the coastal areas of Bangladesh early Sunday. Shamim Sheikh, a local fish farmer, said his fish enclosure on two acres of leased land was completely destroyed by the cyclone. He also said there were other farmers in the upazila who will face similar if not greater losses.  Abu Taher, a paddy farmer from Ghatakhali, said: \"We were about to harvest our ripe Aman crops, but before we could, the cyclone flooded all our crops.\" Abul Kashem, another paddy farmer, said: \"The paddy on my eight bighas of land was just about to form grains, and we could harvest within a few weeks. But the storm ruined everything.\" Koyra Upazila Agriculture Officer Mizan Mahmud said: \"Farmers in the upazila have been instructed to bind their collapsed paddy crops together to save them from rotting. However, crops which have lost the sheaf are most likely going to get spoiled.\" Pankaj Kumar Majumdar, deputy director of the Department of Agricultural Extension of Khulna district, said: \"At least 25,000 hectares of Aman, 864 hectares of vegetables, 52 hectares of banana, 100 hectares of papaya, 40 hectares of mustard, and 36 hectares of betel leaves were destroyed. \"Farmers in the district were expected to harvest 91,000 hectares of Aman, 3,610 hectares of vegetables, 503 hectares of banana, 357 hectares of papaya, 40 hectares of mustard, 790 hectares of betel leaves.\"    Koyra Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Shimul Kumar Saha said: \"At least 2,300 home were completely destroyed, while around 4,800 homes were partially affected in seven unions of Koyra upazila due to cyclonic storm Bulbul.\" On Sunday, cyclonic storm Bulbul hit the coastal areas including Khulna, around 3:30am and wreaked havoc for five hours."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-18 00:00:00      \nSince morning, no goods were unloaded or released from Benapole Land Port Since on Monday morning, no goods were unloaded or released from Benapole Land Port. Drivers in three North Bengal districts also joined the strike. Bus and truck drivers in 10 districts have gone on strike, protesting the new Road Transport Act 2018 (RTA) which came into effect across Bangladesh on November 17. The unannounced strike has crippled the country's southwestern districts since Monday morning, causing immense suffering to passengers and cargo transport. The 10 districts are Jessore, Khulna, Bagerhat, Satkhira, Magura, Narail, Jhenaidah, Meherpur, Kushtia, and Chuadanga. \"Transport workers in 10 districts in the country's southwestern region have stopped bus services,\" Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association General Secretary Mortaza Hossain told Dhaka Tribune.  Since morning, no goods were unloaded or released from Benapole Land Port, with a line of empty trucks on both sides of the border, waiting for goods to transport. However, export-import and immigration services remained active at the land port. At the same time, vehicular movement of other smaller transport remained normal along the  Jessore-Benapole route. In Khulna, bus drivers went on an indefinite strike, demanding correction in some sections of the RTA, halting communication on all road routes in the district. The demands include rectification of fines imposed on vehicle owners and drivers, and withdrawing restrictions imposed on small vehicles. Confirming the matter to Dhaka Tribune, Kazi Md Nurul Islam Bebi, president of Khulna Motor Workers' Union, said: \"The bus drivers decided to go on an indefinite strike demanding amendments to the newly enacted act. \"Transport workers do respect the new law; however, it affects transport workers and owners directly. Therefore, they are protesting so that some of the sections in the law, including penalties and fines on drivers and owners, and making them a non-bailable offence, are amended.\" Meanwhile, the Dhaka Tribune found bus drivers and workers, and other transport workers, playing cricket on the lawn of Sonadanga bus stand on Monday morning. \"We work all day and do not get any time to play. On Tuesday we are relieved from our everyday duties.  We are making good use of our free time, playing cricket,\" said transport worker Abul Hossain. Khulna Bus Workers Union President Mahabubul Islam said the drivers suspended their service as most of them did not have a license. Transport workers play cricket in the bus stand area due to leisure in their regular work flow on Monday, November 18, 2019 | Dhaka TribuneThe drivers cannot get a new license or renew their old license from the BRTA due to the sudden demand brought on by the implementation of the new law, he added. Strike leaves passengers stranded Passengers from different districts who are currently trapped in Khulna, expressed frustration with the situation. \"I wanted to go to my village home from Khulna, but I found no mode of transportation at the Sonadanga bus stand,\" said Rajia Aktar of Faridpur.  Mamun Sheikh, a resident of Dhaka, said: \"I could not get back to work after vacation as my Royal Falguni Paribahan bus ticket was refunded because of the strike.\" In Satkhira, transport workers declared an indefinite strike by halting services on all routes until the new Road Transport Act is amended. Meanwhile, thousands of passengers were in distress as bus services were suddenly suspended in the district. They have been trying to reach their destinations on three-wheelers paying higher fares. Transport workers, including bus drivers, said the new law imposes the death penalty on drivers if anyone dies in a road accident and a fine of Tk5 lakh if anyone injured.  They said a driver cannot afford to pay such a large sum of money as the maximum salary of a driver is around Tk15,000-20,000.  As such, the transport workers refused to resume their services until the law is amended. Former president of Satkhira Bus-Minibus Owners' Association, Abu Ahmed, said: \"The transport workers want the new transport law to be amended before it is implemented. \"The owners can do nothing if the workers stop operating the buses.\" In Jhenaidah, bus services along district's routes to Jessore, Kushtia, Magura and Chuadanga remained suspended since on Monday morning, but a few easy-bikes and now-banned three-wheeler autorickshaws were plying the highway routes. In Kushtia, bus service remained unavailable since the morning due to the strike demanding the amendment of the Road Transport Act. In Narail, all transport from the district were suspended since on Monday morning. Ibrahim Mollah, a driver, alleged that with the new transport laws do not favour them and will increase driver harassment.  In Tangail, movement of all transport from Bhuapur was suspended since morning. In Rajshahi, bus services came to a halt on all routes, including the Rajshahi-Naogaon route. Rajshahi Motor Workers Union President Jahangir Alam said the strike was not called by the union. In Hili, all bus services on the Hili-Bogra route have been suspended since Saturday. Local bus driver Shariful Islam said the drivers would have to pay fines exceeding their income if the new law is implemented.

The houses and croplands of the villages of the Kalapara and Mirzaganj upazilas were submerged under water, as the increased water level of the rivers and the sea--caused by Fani --forced the dams at several points to break, on Friday afternoon.  Panel Chairman of Subidhkhali union, in Mirzaganj upazila, Md Ismail said: \"Around 11am, the Mehendiabad, Charkhali, Golkhali, and Ranipur villages became submerged, after the dams broke due to the high tide. The houses of nearly 2,500 villagers, and their croplands, have been damaged. Lalua Union Parishad Chairman, Md Shawkat Hossain Biswas, said: \"Because of the high tide, 16 villages under Lalua union, of Kalapara upazila, were flooded. The dams for four-five kilometres, from Munshipara to Pasharbunia, are badly broken.\"  He added: \"The Charipara, Manzupara, Munshipara, Nachnapara, Chowdhurypara, Nayakata, Bhanjupara, Hawla, Kalaupara, Banatipara, Pasharbunia, Chandupara, Char Chandupara, Chhata no. 10 , Chhata no. 5, and Nawapara villages have been submerged.\" Mirzaganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO), Md Iqbal Hossain, said he has gone to inspect the flooded regions.

Confirming the matter, Khaleda's lawyer and panel member Advocate Sagir Hossain Leon said: \"We filed the appeal on Thursday against the High Court order and now we are seeking her bail in the case as well.\" Earlier on July 31, a High Court bench rejected the bail petition in the Zia Charitable Trust corruption case, in which Khaleda had been sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. The court also ordered a status quo on the sub-ordinate court's order to confiscate 4,200,000 katha of land bought in the name of the Zia Charitable Trust, and asked it to send the court all of the documents related with the case.  On April 30, the High Court accepted Khaleda's appeal petition challenging a trial court verdict. On November 18, 2018, Khaleda had filed the appeal on 20 grounds, asking the court to scrap the verdict along with fine and grant her bail. The conviction On October 29, 2018, a special court in Dhaka found Khaleda guilty in the Zia Charitable Trust graft case--in absentia--and sentenced her to seven years of rigorous imprisonment. The three-time former prime minister was fined Tk10 lakh, and given a six months' additional jail term if she fails to pay the sum. Apart from her, the court also sentenced Harris Chowdhury, political secretary to then-Prime Minister Khaleda; his assistant personal secretary, Ziaul Haq Munna; and Monirul Islam Khan, assistant personal secretary to then-Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka. The court also ordered that the land bought in the trust's name be confiscated. The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) filed the case against the four with the capital's Tejgaon police station on August 8, 2011. The same court on February 8, 2018, had also sentenced BNP chief Khaleda to five-year imprisonment in the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case. Her son Tarique Rahman and four others--Kamal Uddin Siddique, Kazi Salimul Haque, Sharfuddin Ahmed, and Ziaur Rahman's nephew Mominur Rahman--were sentenced to 10 years in prison in this case, as well. However, on October 30, 2018, the High Court dismissed Khaleda's appeal in the case and doubled her punishment to 10 years of imprisonment."

The motives behind Palash's hijacking attempt are yet to be discovered. Palash's family members described him as an unruly and rebellious youth, who had become disconnected from them. Although he had quit his studies at the higher secondary level, he loved to introduce himself as a student of Dhaka University. Palash used to live in Dhaka, while his family lives and runs a grocery shop in Sonargaon upazila of Narayanganj. His family said they have no idea what he used to do in Dhaka, but had heard that he was involved in acting. They added that Palash would regularly request financial assistance, most recently borrowing 500 UAE Dirhams from his father Piyar Jahan on Friday after saying he was leaving Bangladesh for Dubai. \"What he has done is embarrassing for us. We do not want to see him again. The hijacking incident has left his mother bedridden. We will have a discussion about his body later,\" his father said. Doctors at Chattogram Medical College Hospital conducted an autopsy on Palash's body yesterday afternoon, but did not want to reveal details to the press. Sources said he sustained a bullet injury in his abdomen.  A fake explosive vest and firearm that may also be fake were recovered from Palash's body. Bangladesh's Civil Aviation Authority Chairman Naim Hassan told reporters Palash seemed mentally unstable based on his behavior on the plane. A stint in jail According to Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), Palash's fingerprint matched with records in RAB's criminal database as he had been arrested in connection with an abduction case and served 20 days in jail before securing bail in 2012.  The 25-year-old had studied at Taherpur Senior Madrassa in Narayanganj, and passed SSC level examinations.  RAB Legal and Media Wing Director Mufti Mahmud Khan told the Dhaka Tribune: \"He has a prior criminal record from an arrest seven years ago. He was arrested with an accomplice for abducting a teenager. They had asked for Tk800,000 in ransom.\" \"A case was filed against him on February 22, 2012. The police rescued the victim of the kidnapping a little over a month later, on March 24. Palash was in jail for 20 days before he was let out on bail,\" the RAB spokesperson said. He added that RAB had no information on any criminal activity by Palash from 2012 till the hijacking attempt. Quoting a police officer in Palash's home district, the New York Times reported that he was a conman who would take money from people by promising to secure jobs for them abroad. Married to an actress? Palash's family members said he visited their home with film actress Shimla about 10 months ago, saying she had wanted to visit the area. Two months later, the family learned that the two had gotten married. After the marriage, Palash visited his family less regularly and would spend most of his time in Dhaka. However, he recently returned home and stayed there for 15 days. Palash did not have a national identity card, but he had a Facebook profile under the name Mahibi Jahan. The account listed Shimla as his wife and included a number of photos of the two, while identifying Palash as an IT Business Analyst for British Airways who lived in the UK. Shimla could not be reached for comment, despite repeated attempts to contact her. \"Palash was married once before, and has a child from that marriage, but got divorced,\" his father said. His family members also said they were not aware of any links between Palash and militant groups. \"A team from Sonargaon police station visited my home around 1am yesterday, and searched my residence. The police left us alone after that. Palash was the youngest of my four children.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-30 00:00:00      \nThe representatives from development organizations demanded the government to redesign the draft by repealing inconsistent and unclear sections  Expressing grave concern over the draft of the Volunteer Social Welfare Organizations (Registration and Control) Act 2019, local and international development organizations on Sunday called upon the government to change, edit and repeal some of the sections that are unclear and conflicting. In a statement issued to media, they also demanded the government to consult with stakeholders and experts to redesign the draft before placing it for approval. What does the draft say? Section 11, sub-sections 1 and 2 stipulates that this law takes precedence over other existing laws regarding registration, and all NGOs have to register, and renew their registrations every five years. Failure to renew registration or rejection by the authority will result in the dissolution of the NGO. Section 17 has the provision for dissolving an NGO, if the government authorities have reason to believe they are not in the best interest of the public, or have broken the law. Sub-section 2 says, the government can dissolve the NGO from the date an order is issued. Sub-section 3 says, an NGO will be declared dissolved from the day its registration is revoked. Also Read- Could the new social welfare law cripple NGOs? Section 3 of the draft act, says the law will get preference no matter what is said in other relevant laws, but section 4 (1) says no development organization can continue its activity without following rules of the new act which is conflicting with constitution, Trust Act 1882, Foreign Donations (Voluntary Activities) Regulation Act 2016, Societies Regulation Act 1860 and Cooperative Societies Law 2001. What do NGOs say? It is completely illogical when a foreign funded non government development organization needs to be registered under this law, despite being already registered with NGO Affairs Bureau, the NGOs said. Also, the draft has proposed that all NGOs will have to register with the Ministry of Social Welfare, even after already having registration with NGO Affairs Bureau.  The controlling system of two different government offices to a development organization will create double rule and create bureaucratic problems which will create risk of significantly curtailing NGO operations, it added. Section 10 introduces the most restrictive part of the law - all NGOs will be able to work in only one district, when they first register. After registration, NGOs can expand their scope of work, but only to five districts at a time. \"The provision will create obstacles for foreign funded NGOs and other local NGOs currently doping development work in different districts which needs to be reconsidered immediately,\" it said. Demands Expressing utter dissatisfaction, the representatives from development organizations demanded the government to redesign the draft by repealing inconsistent and unclear sections in consultation with stakeholders including local and foreign development organizations before it gets a final nod.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-29 00:00:00      \nAccording to the log book of the landfill, around 2,000 tons of waste are dumped on a daily basis from different parts of north Dhaka Amin Bazar sanitary landfill, the lone landfill for all of Dhaka North City Corporation's (DNCC) waste has turned into an artificial floating island in the flood flow zone near the Turag River, severely damaging the ecosystem. According to the log book of the landfill, around 2,000 tons of waste are dumped on a daily basis from different parts of north Dhaka. The project does not have an environmental clearance certificate from the Department of Environment (DoE). An August 5 inter-ministerial meeting at the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change claimed that DNCC did not follow the directives prescribed in the Environment Conservation Rules, 1997, in the first place while building the landfill, failing to ensure a sound environment. Interestingly, 12 years after DNCC started using the area as a landfill has just started operating an effluent plant, that again, on a trial basis and saying it would erect a wall to save waters from getting polluted from the waste. What took it so long remained a mystery.  DNCC chief waste management officer Md Manzur Hossain said they have requested for more land for further extension of the landfill. The dump yard has become over-loaded from all sides and falls on the path of a flood flow zone near a canal of the Turag River. During a recent visit, this correspondent witnessed the sorry state of the landfill as the waste was polluting with water.  The water in the river had a dark bluish tint while nearby plants lost their leaves due to the high toxicity levels in water. Solid waste is floating on the water and carried for miles as there are no walls or barriers dividing the garbage and the water. The landfill built in 2007 on 52 acres of land was expanded in 2017 as the garbage over the years exceeded the capacity, but the sanitary landfill has turned into an open dump due to the haphazard disposal of waste. Locals claimed that all the adjacent agricultural lands have also become infertile. Before the landfill was built, rice was cultivated in those lands. At present, people find dead fish frequently in the river while people living in the neighbouring area suffer from various skin diseases. A local, Mizanur Rahman, said: \"I am suffering from itches on my hands and legs. Skin diseases are inevitable if someone comes in contact with this water. \"Also, rice cannot be cultivated in nearby lands and fish are not found in the water body nowadays since it has become toxic,\" he added. Inter-ministerial meeting finds huge loss of ecosystem The surface and ground water has been polluted over time due to the unplanned dumping of various types of municipality waste in the landfill, according to the minutes of the August 5 inter-ministerial meeting. During rainy season, untreated solid and liquid waste mix with the water as the site is in flood flow zone, thus polluting the Turag River, wetlands as well as the whole environment, it added. \"Huge amount of agricultural land has been damaged, and the environment is being polluted with hazardous waste affecting birds and insects,\" the minutes of the meeting reads. The Environment Conservation Rules 1997 made it mandatory to have an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and maintain sound environmental conditions in all steps of building and operation of landfills. However the DNCC neither conducted the EIA, nor obtained any environmental clearance - a clear violation of the rules. \"They only set up a Leachate water treatment plant. Even this plant did not obtain any clearance certificate and DoE has no information whether it is enough to treat leachate water,\" the minute reads.  Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Service (Cegis) research associate Feroze Ahmed Kanak, in a study released in April, said the 200 to 300 acres of land surrounding the landfill, are not cultivable which is forcing the inhabitants nearby to leave their homes as there are no livelihood from farming or fishing and the environment is too toxic to live in. DNCC now wants land extension Meanwhile, DNCC has requested for more land for extending the landfill further. Md Manzur Hossain, DNCC chief waste management officer said that they have set up an Effluent Treatment Plant and it is treating leachate waste on a trial basis. \"We are going to incinerate the waste to produce electricity from it,\" he said.  \"We applied for 80 acre land acquisition for the extension of the landfill. We have a plan to build a wall in second phase so that waste cannot mix with water and adjacent lands,\" he added. When contacted, the DoE's designated officer for Dhaka district Sahida Begum said that they notified the DNCC several times to take the necessary steps as per the law.  \"They promised us that they would do so. We hope, as a government organization DNCC will become more respectful to the rules and regulation,\" she said."

The attack occurred as the violence in India's state of Assam spilled over to Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Guwahati, reports UNB. Acting foreign secretary Kamrul Ahsan held a meeting with Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Riva Ganguly Das at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday evening and requested the protection of personnel and property of the mission by the host government. Ganguly assured that the authorities concerned of the Indian government are being immediately alerted to enhance security of the chancery and residential premises of the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Guwahati.  It has come to the attention of the ministry that some people from the processions and agitations taking place throughout Thursday in Guwahati torn down two signposts of the mission approximately 30 yards away from the chancery premise. On Wednesday, the security vehicle escorting the assistant high commissioner from the airport to the city was attacked by mobs protesting adoption of the bill. The appropriate Indian authorities have already taken enhanced security measures to protect the Assistant High Commission premises, its personnel and members of their families, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The government of Bangladesh believes that the attack on the convoy of the assistant high commissioner and vandalization of the signposts is a one-off incident and it will not affect the excellent bilateral relations that Bangladesh and India enjoy."

Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation, however, suspended their strike around 18 hours after enforcing it across the country, to press home their 11-point demand, including increasing salary, providing appointment letter, and identity card, and landing pass for India bound workers. Passengers of Dhaka-Chandpur route, which leaves the terminal during the day, suffered the most due to the strike, said Sadarghat police station Officer-in-Charge Md Rezaul Karim Bhuiyan. Sufferings of Passengers started to ease from the evening, after the agitating workers decided to keep passenger vessels out of the purview of the strike. They decided to allow plying of all types of passenger vessels, considering the country's present situation, and the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha, said Bangladesh Shipping Workers' Federation Office Secretary Prakash Dutta. After a meeting with the director general of the Department of Shipping, the strikers withdrew the strike after being assured that their demands would be met by August 30. Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam, the secretary general of Bangladesh Naujan Sramik Federation told Dhaka Tribune: \"Considering nationwide flood, upcoming Eid, absence of State Minister of Labour and Employment Monnujan Sufian, we have decided to postpone the strike.\" \"Passenger launches resumed operations on 43 river routes this evening (Wednesday),\" he said. On July 20, Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation announced the strike. During the strike no passenger and cargo carriers operated on any inland water routes. As a result, cargo handling remained stagnant at Chittagong, and Mongla sea ports, causing losses to exporters, and importers. In Chittagong, some 352 vessels loaded with around 4,94,155 tons of different types of goods remained stranded all day on Wednesday at different jetties of the port city.  The unloading operations were halted due to the work abstention, said Ataul Kabir Ranju, joint secretary of Water Transport Cell (WTC). The unloading from mother vessels anchored at the outer anchorage of Chittagong Port faced a huge loss due to the strike, said Mahbub Chowdhury, Vice-President of Chittagong Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce & Industries. \"The port will face container and vessel congestion, and the economy will have to bear the brunt if the deadlock continues,\" Nabi Alam, Joint Secretary of Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation said. In Khulna, around 1200 carrier vessels at Bhairab, Rupsa, Kajibacha, Shalta, Pashur, Shivasa, and Shakbaria rivers remained stranded due to the strike. No launches left the BIWTA jetty, as well as no ferries plied on the rivers since on Wednesday morning, causing huge sufferings to the commuters. In Barisal, no vessel, including good-laden ones, operated on some 18 routes in the southern parts of the country, since the morning, due to the strike, said Hashem Ali, Barisal unit president of Bangladesh Noonan Sramik Federation.

The protest began around 8am on Wednesday, with the workers taking positions in front of the main gates of the jute mills that they are employed in. The protest will continue until 5pm. Md Murad Hossain, convener of Jute Mills Sramik League (Khulna, Jessore region), said: \"This workers' movement mainly began with workers demanding the implementation of national wage commission.  Jute mill workers protest in Khulna on November 27, 2019 | Dhaka Tribune\"But, somehow, the authorities managed to assuage the protesters and thus stop the protest by settling their outstanding wages. He added: \"However, this time, the workers would not cease the protest at any cost because most of us are outraged with the fact that the national wage commission has not been implemented in five years.\" He, therefore, said they began this symbolic hunger strike as part of the demonstration and will continue to protest until the wage commission is implemented. On November 25, the workers went on a hunger strike for the first time. Jute mill workers in Khulna and Jessore held demonstrations by blocking roads and highways to press home their demands. File Photo: A worker piles his trade at a jute mill factory in Khulna on Wednesday, May 22, 2019 | Dhaka Tribune The demands included implementation of the national wage commission, repeal of public-private partnership (PPP) and payment of gratuities to retired workers and staff of the factories. The workers announced the outline of their protest program on November 23. According to their program, they will hold a procession and strike on December 2 and 3, respectively.  The jute mill workers are also scheduled to hold a rally on December 8, and planned to go on a hunger strike on December 10, by staging a sit-in protest in front of the main gates of the mills they work for."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-14 00:00:00      \nClimate change cannot be mitigated through discussions alone Bangladesh is globally known as one of the countries most vulnerable to the impacts of global warming and climate calamity. It not only affects human development and biodiversity conservation but also poses a threat to human security, with an increased frequency of extreme weather events leading to degrading socio-economic conditions. Sea-level rise is expected to continue for centuries. In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected that during the 21st century, sea-levels will rise another 18 to 59cm, but these numbers do not include \"uncertainties in climate-carbon cycle feedbacks\" or \"the full effects of changes in ice sheet flow.\" A sea-level rise of just 400mm in the Bay of Bengal would put 11% of Bangladesh's coastal land underwater, creating 7-10 million climate refugees. The variation of humidity, temperature, and rainfall caused by climate change is likely to have ample health consequences. High temperature manipulates the reproduction and survival of infective agents within the vector, thereby further influencing disease diffusion in areas where the vector is previously present. In general, by reducing fresh water supplies, climate alteration affects sanitation and lowers the efficiency of local sewer systems, leading to amplified concentrations of pathogens in unprocessed water supplies. Subsequently, mosquito larvae develop in such places, which may in turn cause mosquito-borne diseases. Apart from that, numerous diseases that are transmitted by mosquitoes (chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever), sand flies (leishmaniasis) and ticks (Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis) may also be amplified by climate alteration. Dengue has lately taken a serious turn in many parts of the country. In Dhaka alone, there were reports of hundreds of people suffering attacks, a majority of whom were hospitalized.  Economic losses will increase by threefold to a cumulative $129 billion -- and as high as $5.1 billion per year under more pessimistic climate scenarios -- with economic losses rising in later years. Based on this model, the southern coastal regions and the northwestern regions are expected to experience the largest income declines. IPCC estimates that, in Bangladesh, production of rice and wheat might drop by 8% and 32%, respectively, by the year 2050. The degradation of the quality of the urban environment is a consequence of economic activities which affect the environment, sanitation security, and public health, either directly or indirectly.  Every day, thousands of people migrate to the cities after being affected by landlessness, impoverishment, employment contraction among the poor and marginalized, river erosion, and natural calamities. In general, the urban poor live in slums and low-income settlements. Many who cannot afford to live in slum dwellings live on the streets.  They suffer from non-sanitary latrines, unhygienic garbage disposal, and impure water supply. No sanitation is safe when covered by flood waters, as fecal matter mixes with flood waters and spreads everywhere the flood water goes. In Dhaka, which has a piped sewage network, only 2% of fecal load is treated. In reality, human health depends on an adequate supply of potable water. By reducing fresh water supplies, climate change affects sanitation and lowers the efficiency of local sewer systems, leading to concentrations of pathogens in unprocessed water supplies. The unforeseen increase in extreme rainfall events, which is associated with outbreaks of diarrheal disease, may overwhelm the public water supply system. The poor, who are environmentally or agriculturally displaced and live in urban areas, have no capacity, education, or financial aptitude to fight against this climate-induced health insecurity. Scientists predict that, due to tropical cyclones and salinity intrusion into farming lands in coastal areas, environmental refugees will exceed 20 million in the future. As a result, their demand for land, water, employment, and other public services generate conflict with local residents.  Some foreign and local alliances -- WHO, IPCC, Bangladesh poribesh andolon, Bangladesh environment network, Bangladesh environmental lawyers association -- believe that climate change cannot be mitigated through discussions. To reduce the climatic impacts, we have to take financial initiatives, share adaptive technology, and increase awareness to reduce carbon use. What is critical now is to move away from producing \"papers and reports,\" and towards investing human, material, and financial resources on the issues at the places where climate change is having an impact, for a collective and sustainable Bangladesh.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-03 00:00:00      \nShe was addressing the 'national standard' handing over ceremony in Rajshahi Cantonment Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has directed members of Bangladesh Army to keep a constant vigil to face any \"internal and external threats\" for safeguarding Bangladesh's constitution and sovereignty. \"You will have to always remain ready to face any 'internal or external threats' united for protecting the sacred constitution and sovereignty of the motherland,\" she said on Sunday. The prime minister was addressing the \"national standard\" handing over ceremony of the Bangladesh Infantry Regiments (BIR)-7th, 8th, 9th and 10th at Shaheed Col Anis Parade Ground in Rajshahi Cantonment. She handed over the national standard to the commander of the respective regiments. A smartly turned out contingent of Bangladesh Army gave salute to the prime minister through a spectacular parade. Along with Chief of Army Staff Gen Aziz Ahmed and the parade commander, the prime minister reviewed the parade riding on a decorated open jeep. Describing Bangladesh Army as an \"asset\" of the country and a \"symbol\" of the confidence and the trust of the people, the premier also asked its members to be more \"professionally-efficient\" and \"welfare-minded\" with social and religious values. \"Bangladesh Army is our asset and a symbol of confidence and trust of the people. So, you will have to be even more competent, efficient, honest, and welfare-minded being imbued with social and religious values to achieve desired standard of professionalism,\" she said.  Noting that her government always received constant support of the army to serve the people, Sheikh Hasina expressed her firm belief that the army will stand beside the people whenever it will be necessary during the running of the state by the present government. The premier said the members of Bangladesh Army played an important role in upholding democratic trend of the country by performing their responsibilities with utmost sincerity in the 11th general election. \"I extend my thanks to you for it and I also express gratitude to the countrymen for getting a scope of formation of the government for the fourth time and the third consecutive term,\" she said. The premier said her government always wants to run the country as the servants of the people, never rulers. Mentioning that the government is pledge-bound to build a modern and all-round armed forces, Sheikh Hasina said for this, the government has framed the Forces Goal-2030 which is being implemented in phases. As part of it, she said, new infantry divisions, brigades, units and training centres have been established. Besides, three new divisions have been formed in the army, she also said. The prime minister said her government has established para commando brigade for the first time, while MLRS and Missile Regiment have also been added to the army for further strengthening the country's air defence system. Besides, the present government has strengthened operational capability of the army to a great extent through inducting various modern war equipment, helicopters and modern infantry gazettes to keep pace with the developed world, she added. Referring to her government's steps for women empowerment, the prime minister said the government took an epoch making decision to get female officers and soldiers admitted to the army. Sheikh Hasina said in continuation of the initiative, appointing female pilots for the first time in the history of the army initiated a new horizon. The premier recalled that despite economic constraints, Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman took steps for establishing strong armed forces in the country. At the directives of Bangabandhu, she said, Bangladesh Military Academy was founded in Comilla Cantonment in 1972. Sheikh Hasina said Bangabandhu framed the defence policy in 1974 by realizing the necessity of a developed and professional army. The premier said in the light of Bangabandhu's far-reaching defence policy, a process for modernization of the army is underway. Today, Bangladesh Army has been elevated to a dignified position at home and abroad, she said. Sheikh Hasina said to infuse more dynamism into the Infantry Division, her government for the first time realized to establish its second regiment alongside the East Bengal Regiment. \"I approved in principle the formation of Bangladesh Infantry Regiment in 1999 and formally hoisted its flag in April 2001,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh Infantry Regiment is the first regiment established after independence. There are 43 units including two para commando battalions in the regiment, she said. \"The members of the regiment are working with reputation at home and abroad and I hope that they will continue work to uphold this reputation,\" she added. Sheikh Hasina said her government has taken all kinds of steps to build Bangladesh Infantry Regimental Centre as a modern training centre. The work on increasing training and administrative facilities is underway, she said. Besides safeguarding the country's independence and sovereignty, she said, the army has engaged themselves in the nation-building programs. \"Due to your professional efficiency, the important responsibility for supervision work of the Padma Bridge and the construction work of Cox's Bazar-Teknaf Marine Drive, the Hatirjheel Project in Dhaka, and Mohipal Flyover in Feni was given to you,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the army members in different foreign missions are bringing honour and dignity through sacrifice, dutifulness and professionalism which have further brightened Bangladesh's image abroad. She said the flag is a symbol of independence, sovereignty, honour and dignity. \"So it's a responsibility of all soldiers to protect the dignity of the flag,\" she said. The premier said earning ability of getting the national flag by any unit is a matter of rare honour and pride. \"The national flag, a symbol of independence and sovereignty, has been handed over to you and I extend my heartiest congratulations to BIR-7,8, 9 and 10 for achieving this honour and glory,\" she said. \"You will have to always remain prepared to protect the dignity of the flag which you've got as recognition to your work with efficiency, hard exercise and dutifulness,\" she said. Earlier on her arrival at the venue, the prime minister was received by Chief of Army Staff Gen Aziz Ahmed and GOC and Area Commander of the army and the Commandant of the Bangladesh Infantry Regimental Centre. Ministers, advisers to the prime minister, parliament members, the chiefs of navy and air force, former army chiefs, foreign diplomats and high civil and military officials were present on the occasion."

The minister made the statement at the roundtable meeting, \"Safe food and agriculture management,\" arranged by Daily Bangladesher Khabar at the National Press Club in Dhaka on Tuesday. \"We cannot change anything rapidly due to bureaucratic problems in our country.  There is lack of skilled manpower and infrastructure for a safe food institute,\" he said. To solve the manpower shortage, new employees have to be recruited and the process of recruiting them is underway, he added.  Saying that the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority needs to be well equipped and that there is a need for labs in all districts to conduct food tests, he continued: \"We need to form a task force along with all ministries and authorities concerned that will work together to ensure food safety.\" The future of the coming generation depends on food safety, he added.  He expressed disappointment, saying the media does not focus on issues of food safety.  Dr Md Fazlul Karim, dean of the agriculture department at the Sher-e-Bangla Agriculture University, said the rule of law must be sustained to ensure food safety. He said: \"We cannot ensure food safety without ensuring rule of law.\" Chairman of Bangladesh Food Safety Authority, Syeda Sarwar Jahan, said food safety is a basic right, and food safety has to be ensured to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). She said: \"Everyone in the food industry has to take responsibility to ensure food safety,\" adding that the government plans to set up \"healthy markets\" across Bangladesh to promote organic agriculture. She continued: \"We have already sat with CEOs of city corporations and theyhave  agreed to help set up healthy markets where farmers can sell their produce. She also urged the mass media to publish reports on healthy markets soelt that people are made aware of such products in the market. Shajahan Ali Badsha, a poultry farm owner, said authorities have to arrange training sessions for farmers so that they are made aware of everything about food safety. Bangladesh Food Safety Authority member Abdul Alim, Member Director of Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council Monirul Islam, former managing director of Directorate General of Health Services, Sha Munir Hossain, and Dr Nurul Islam, director of Agriculture Information Service, and others, spoke at the roundtable meeting. Daily Bangladesher Khabar Editor Azizul Islam Bhuiyan was chaired the discussion."

Economic Affairs Advisor to the Prime Minister Dr Mashiur Rahman, Shipping Ministry Secretary Md Abdus Samad, India Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry (IBCCI) President Abdul Matlub Ahmad, and Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce Industry (FBCCI) Senior Vice President Sheikh Fazle Fahim also spoke on the occasion. The acting High Commissioner requested FBCCI and IBCCI to consider leading business delegations for the conclave. The event focused on promotion of Maritime India Conclave 2019 being organized jointly by the Ministry of Shipping and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas of the Indian Government. The conclave will provide a major platform for promotion of investment in the maritime sector in India. The event is expected to be attended by over 200 investors, developers and over 1,000 delegates, both domestic and international. Besides, representatives from government, public sector enterprises, developers and financial institutions, state maritime boards, and other related stakeholders are also expected to attend. In the last few years government of India has taken a number of initiatives to upgrade their maritime and logistics infrastructure, said Dr Adarsh. The acting high commissioner said Bangladesh-India cooperation in the area of maritime and waterways connectivity has also made rapid strides since the visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Bangladesh in June 2015. Under the third Line of Credit of $5 billion, he said, India and Bangladesh are also partnering to develop infrastructure of three major ports in Bangladesh."

It is alarming given the fact that only 15 percent of the ilish caught in the previous year had eggs in them, officials said. Eighty-five percent of ilish caught in Khulna this time contain eggs, said Bangladesh Fisheries Development Corporation Manager of Khulna region Md Jahidul Islam. He said the wholesale markets at Boro Rail Station fish jetty in Chandpur, and those along the shore, are packed with ilish with eggs since 90 percent of the catch is pregnant ilish.  The government had imposed a 22-day ban from October 9 to October 30 on catching, selling, storing, and transporting ilish during its peak breeding period. But the mother ilish could not complete releasing the eggs.  Consequently, shoals of mother ilish full of eggs have been caught by fishermen after the ban was lifted. The lack of rainfall delayed the cycle. \"Ilish breeding is related to rainfall,\" said Professor Abdul Wahab, who is leading the ECOFISHBD Project of WorldFish. Bangladesh's southern region did not receive much rain this monsoon. It recorded only 143mm of rainfall in June and 235mm in July. Last year, it was 220mm in June and 367mm in July. Prof Wahab said he was surprised that most of the fish contained eggs. Fish traders in Chandpur said the production will fall if the breeding is not protected. They feared the national fish will face extinction if mother ilish continues to be caught at this rate.  They say the fishing ban during the breeding season should have been extended by 10-12 days.  Chandpur Fisheries Officer Md Asadul Baki claimed the drive to protect mother ilish was successful. \"That is why the fishermen have been able to catch a huge quantity of ilish,\" he said, claiming that 80 percent  of the ilish have released eggs.  Dr Anisur Rahman of the Fisheries Research Institute said they need a few more days to determine the percentage of mother ilish that have released eggs.  In Khulna, ilish weighing 1 kg was selling at Tk 800. The same size of fish is selling at Tk 700 in Chandpur. But the huge supply of the fish is hardly making people happy.  \"Ilish with eggs don't taste good,\" one of the buyers said."

Dr ATM Manjur Morshed, KMCH Director and Director of the Project, said the only way to prevent the disease is raising awareness. \"If we can detect HIV in the blood of a pregnant woman, it's possible to save the child in the womb from through treatment,\" he said. 37.9 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide in 2018, according to WHO. Last year, 770,000 people died of HIV-related illnesses."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-23 00:00:00      \nMonirul islam says they are also yet to find any evidence to IS's claims of appointing a chief in Bangladesh The police counter-terrorism chief has said Bangladeshis returning to the country after having joined the terror group Islamic State (IS) in the Middle East, will face legal action. Additional Commissioner Monirul Islam, head of Dhaka Metropolitan Police's (DMP) Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit, was speaking at a Dhaka event yesterday. The event was organized by the Crime Reporters Association of Bangladesh (CRAB) and CTTC at the Cirdap auditorium. The CTTC chief was asked about several issues in light of the massive terrorist attack in Sri Lanka on Sunday, including if he had the exact number for Bangladeshis who had joined IS, and what would happen if they came back home. \"Young people began going out to join IS in late 2014,\" Monirul Islam said in response. \"We suspect that some were detained or arrested, some were killed and some of them were identified. But we do not have accurate statistics,\" he said. \"If they want to return home now, they have no alternative but to come via air. So they need passports. But people who left the country in 2014 no longer have valid passports. If anybody wants to return, they will have to apply for a travel pass,\" Monirul explained. \"When we receive an application for a travel pass, it is given a very serious scrutiny,\" he added. \"So, they cannot come in to the country without us knowing.Even if anyone wants to return, they will face legal action,\" the official said. Asked about the possibility of Rohingya refugees getting involved in militancy and extremism, the CTTC chief said that the refugees are a big problem for Bangladesh.  \"Rohingyas have lost their homes, lost family members; they may be involved in extremism in the future,\" he added. All intelligence agencies are keeping the refugees under strong surveillance, he said. Asked if there was any truth to IS's claims of appointing a chief in Bangladesh, the official said police had not found any evidence to support this. \"They may have appointed a Bangladeshi abroad,\" he added. The additional commissioner said that Afghanistan-returnees were the first to bring religious extremism and militancy into Bangladesh. \"Many of them have been arrested. Some have been hanged. Three or four are absconding but all of them have been identified,\" he said. Responding to a question about the spread of militancy in prison, Monirul said this is a global problem.  \"Many people become radicalized in prisons across the world. Bangladesh is at particular risk because incarcerations become lengthy due to slow trial,\" he said. He said two anti-terrorism tribunals have been established to speed up the trial of militants. CRAB President Abul Khayer, General Secretary Dipu Sarwar, DMP's Deputy Commissioner (Media) Masudur Rahman and senior officials of CTTC were present at the event. Public attention turned to the Bangladeshi Islamic State fighters from Syria and Iraq for the first time when they issued video messages hailing the Gulshan terrorist attack of 2016. At least 50 young men and a few women and children were reported missing after that."

Joint leadership has made the party stronger and organized than ever. There's no rift among us,\" he said at a press briefing at the party president's Banani office yesterday. GM Quader also said that JaPa is prepared to extend their help for flood victims across the country. \"JaPa will always follow Ershad's footprints in terms of helping people. As his successor, JaPa is prepared to stand by flood affected people,\" GM Quader said. \"Through our work, we will keep Ershad's principle alive which is to serve the country people selflessly,\" he added. JaPa's Secretary General Mashiur Rahman Ranga said at present, a massive area of Bangladesh is under water and the party is ready to extend their help to government's relief activities. Earlier, political analysts and researchers expressed their doubts whether JaPa, that has no definite ideology, organizational strength and most importantly lost the person who kept their politics alive, would sustain as a political party in the future.  They might get extinct like the party established by Maulana Bhasani or AK Fazlul Huq, as those were abolished after their death. They said, to be alive in Bangladesh politics, a party needs an authoritarian leadership and it may be the major lacking for the party in the future. Besides, the party has internal \"lack of democracy.\" The press conference was held following a joint meeting of the party's Central Executive Committee. However, party's Senior Co-Chairman Raushon Ershad and the presidium members, known to be as her followers, skipped the meeting."

This decision came right after a meeting between the representatives of Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation (BWTWF), and director general (DG) of Department of Shipping on Wednesday night. Authorities concerned assured the water transport workers that all of their 11-point-demands will be met by August 30. Confirming the matter to Dhaka Tribune BWTWF Secretary General Chowdhury Ashiqul Alam said: \"Considering various factors such as the nationwide flood situation, upcoming Eid-ul-Azha, absence of the State Minister of Labour and Employment Monnujan Sufian, we have decided to postpone our strike.  \"The decision came up based on the assurance to solve all our problems within August 30. All types of water transports can now operate freely.\" Earlier in the morning, water transport workers went on a countrywide indefinite strike to press home their 11-point demand. Bangladesh Water Transport Workers' Federation enforced the strike at Sadarghat in Dhaka on Tuesday midnight with various demands, including increasing salary, providing appointment letter and identity card, and issuing landing pass for India bound workers. Sadarghat police station Officer-in-Charge Md Rezaul Karim Bhuiyan told Dhaka Tribune that launch services of all routes were suspended. \"For the last few days, they [workers] were also putting up posters at Sadarghat launch terminal to press home their demands,\" he said. Passengers of Dhaka-Chandpur route, which leaves the terminal during the day, suffered the most due to the strike.  Prakash Dutta said: \"If there is no positive discussion on our problems, the strike will continue.\"   Earlier on April 15, the workers had staged a strike with the same demands. Following the strike, the government, and the launch owners were given an ultimatum to resolve the problem within 45 working days. The ultimatum ended on June 26, without any outcome. State Minister of Labour and Employment Monnujan Sufian held a meeting regarding the issue on July 15. However, no solution was reached."

      "authors": "Thomson Reuters Foundation",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-02 00:00:00      \nMany are victims of trafficking, but have little redress for the crimes they have suffered in Bangladesh Like many poor Bangladeshis, Komol Shohlagar thought moving overseas for work would change his life. It did - but not in the way he hoped. Shohlagar, 33, travelled to Libya with people smugglers in the hope of reaching Europe, but when he got there, the smugglers held him captive to extort money from his family. He was only freed after they paid $14,000 to get him back - money they had to borrow from loan sharks. When he finally returned to Bangladesh last year, he was jobless and saddled with huge debts - a situation that left him feeling suicidal. \"I was really depressed. My family had borrowed a lot of money to save me,\" Shohlagar told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. \"The lenders came home every other day and threatened us. There were times when I thought about taking a rope and hanging myself.\" Charities in Bangladesh say thousands of returning migrants face such struggles and little official help is available. Many are victims of trafficking, but have little redress for the crimes they have suffered in Bangladesh. The country depends heavily on foreign remittances and has an official policy of encouraging citizens to look for jobs abroad. According to official data, at least 1 million Bangladeshis secured jobs overseas in 2017 - the highest number ever recorded. But the system depends largely on unlicensed brokers working in rural areas and opens the door to trafficking and cheating. Last month, 64 Bangladeshi migrants hoping to get to Europe had to be rescued from a boat off Tunisia. In May, 37 drowned in the same region when their boat capsized. \"The state does not have a proper system to support the returnees,\" said Shariful Hasan, who heads the migration department of Bangladeshi aid group Brac. \"All our policies are focused on sending people abroad. We don't even have a system that can count the total number of returnees every year.\" Abu Bakar Siddique, the civil servant who leads the Home Ministry's anti-trafficking work, acknowledged the government needed to develop a system of support for the returnees. \"For now, what we do is, we ensure that the victims reach their families,\" he said. \"With the kind of capacity that we have, this is what's possible. \"We do work with girls who were trafficked to India. We also have shelters for victims. But as far as counselling is concerned, it's not something that we have not managed to do effectively. We have to develop our system.\" False promise There is no official data on how many migrants are defrauded, but charities say thousands return to Bangladesh every year after being cheated abroad. A 2017 study by the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit, a migrants rights group, found 51% of returning migrants had experienced fraud or degrading treatment while abroad. Nearly one in five of those who paid to be taken abroad did not even make it out of the country, it found. Stories like Shohlagar's are common. The International Organization for Migration (IOM), which helps repatriate migrants, said many were left with little choice but to go abroad again to try to pay off their debts. \"Due to the mounting pressure from the money lenders to pay back the loan, they migrants are unable to stay in their house upon return,\" said Pravina Gurung, the IOM's head of migration and development. \"The result of an inability to achieve economic self-sufficiency, social re-integration and psychosocial suffering often lead them to another unsafe migration attempt, further debt, and even suicide.\" Mohammad Jakir Hossen, 40, worked as a technician in a garment factory before he paid a broker to take him to Italy in search of more lucrative work. Instead he was taken to Libya, where he was made to work by traffickers who took a cut of his salary, holding him there with the false promise that he would eventually make it to Italy. Since he returned to Dhaka he has been running a roadside fruit stall, with little hope of making back the $5,000 he borrowed to pay for the trip. But he said he would do the same again. \"You may think that I am crazy, but if I get a chance to go outside, I will take a loan again,\" Hossen said. \"Five people including my old mother depend upon me right now. And what I earn is clearly not enough.\" Brac, one of the few local organisations that provides support to the returnees, follows a three-fold approach, said Hasan, offering practical help with their return, financial help, and counselling. Kamal Chowdhury, an associate professor at the Department of Clinical Psychology at Dhaka University, has counselled migrant returnees. Some had been raped or sexually harassed and all need help, he said, urging the government to make assessments of returnees mandatory. \"Migrant workers return home with dreams that are broken,\" he said."

Khulna Metropolitan Magistrate Amirul Islam delivered the verdict on Monday afternoon. The court also fined Shahjalal Tk5000, and in default, he will have to serve one month more behind bars. The convict, who was on bail, was escorted to jail soon after the verdict.  Shahjalal's lawyer Nurul Haque said they will file an appeal with the apex court against the verdict.  On July 18, 2017, police arrested Shahjalal in a mugging case and took him to the Khalishpur police station in Khulna city. The convict's mother, Renu Begum, claimed police demanded Tk1.5 lakh from the family to release Shahjalal.  As they refused to do so, police members took Shahjalal out of the police station in their vehicle and tortured him, she said. The next day the family found him lying on a bed of the Khulna Medical College and Hospital with gouged eyes. Quoting Shahjalal, Renu Begum claimed the law enforcement members gouged out both his eyes with a screwdriver. On September 7, 2017, the victim's mother filed a case with a Khulna court against 13 people including 11 police personnel in connection with the incident. The then officer-in-charge of Khalishpur police station, Nasim Khan, was made one of the accused. Renu Begum said police are still threatening her and other family members for filing the case."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-26 00:00:00      \nNone of the governments in Bangladesh have managed to compile a complete, verified list of Pakistan's collaborators yet Nearly five decades on after Bangladesh gained independence, there is still no specific data on exactly how many Bangladeshis collaborated with the Pakistani occupation forces and committed crimes against humanity during the 1971 Liberation War. During the nine-month war - which began with the Declaration of Independence by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on March 25 and ended with the liberation of Bangladesh on December 16 in 1971 - these collaborators, collectively referred to as \"razakars,\" helped the Pakistanis kill nearly three million people and brutally rape, torture and kill over 200,000 girls and women.  There were several organizations who were the Pakistani occupation forces' partners in crime - Peace Committee, al Badr and al Shams being among the prominent ones.  In the five decades that followed, none of the governments in the country succeeded in preparing a complete, verified list of the razakars - something that the Liberation War researchers, human rights advocates and people involved with the war crimes trial see as a failure.  Shortly after the war, Bangabandhu enacted the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 to try the razakars who assisted the Pakistani army in the killing of Bangladeshis.  Until November 30, 1973, the government arrested 37,471 collaborators under the 1972 order, but a general amnesty was declared for them in 1973. The amnesty, however, was not applicable for those who committed criminal offences like murder, rape and arson.  Later in 1975, the order was repealed and about 11,000 people, who were in custody then, were freed, officials at the Ministry of Liberation Wars Affairs said. Asked, Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Huq said an initiative had been taken to make the list in the 90s, but whatever work had been done went missing after the formation of the cabinet following the eighth general elections in 2001.  Led by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia, the cabinet of the eighth parliament included Jamaat-e-Islami leaders Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujaheed - both with strong allegations of having been active partners of the Pakistani occupational forces.  \"That's when the list disappeared,\" the minister claimed when speaking to the Dhaka Tribune.  Both Nizami and Mujaheed had been convicted during the war crimes trial and sentenced to death penalty.  Jamaat-e-Islami, the Islamist political party that has been banned from taking part in elections in the country, is a known associate of the Pakistani occupational forces in 1971. The minister said the government was currently working on a plan to list all the razakars once the list of freedom fighters is complete. 'Preparing such a list requires political will' Preparing the list of razakar, based on crimes committed nearly five decades ago, requires strong political will and cooperation from the Pakistani government, a top official of the International Crimes Tribunal said. Abdul Hannan Khan, coordinator of the tribunal, said the government has a list of 195 Pakistani prisoners of war (POWs) who reportedly masterminded the barbaric war crimes committed during in 1971. \"But in order to prepare a full list of Pakistan's collaborators, the government needs to take a strong political decision, since identification of those people will require cooperation support from the Pakistani government,\" he added. Also Read- What ICT has achieved in 9 years Bangladesh signed a tripartite pact with India and Pakistan in 1974, following a reconciliation talk between India and Pakistan in 1972. The pact allowed the Pakistani war criminals and many senior commanders to return to their country from Indian jails. The repatriation was facilitated after Islamabad issued a statement in April 1973 assuring Bangladesh of putting the soldiers on trial for their actions during the war. \"Also, the report by Hamoodur Rahman Commission, constituted by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1971, inquired on the issue and also recommended that identified Pakistani soldiers be put on trial for their atrocities in the former East Pakistan. Nothing of that sort has happened as yet,\" Hannan told the Dhaka Tribune. If the Pakistani government does not cooperate, the trial of war criminals or their listing will be difficult, he added.  The complexities of the job Prof Mizanur Rahman, former chairman of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), said the government should have put more focus on preparing the list of razakars instead of preparing the list of freedom fighters. \"It is nothing but an utter failure from our part. It was the biggest mistake not take any initiatives in the last 48 years to identify those who committed such violence against our people in 1971. If the initiative had been taken right after the war, preparing the list would have been very easy,\" he added.  \"The list is a must-have, but I doubt it would be possible to prepare it properly now.\" Speaking on the issue, Liberation War Museum trustee Sarwar Ali urged the government to be cautious when preparing the list so there are no legal issues, and the list must reflect historical facts.  \"It is indeed a shame that it took us this long to do this; it is too late. Still, the government can prepare the list based on the gazettes issued in 1971, but there are legal issues too,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. Sarwar pointed out that when someone was made a collaborator of the Pakistani occupation forces - a member of razakars or Peace Committee - a gazette notification was issued against them in 1971.  \"The government must also verify the information to confirm that the people on the gazette lists were indeed the perpetrators,\" he said. Being cautious in preparing the list is of utmost importance, because wrongful accusation may lead to a legal battle, Sarwar further added.   \"The list will have to be concrete, accurate and evidence-based to avoid any complexities,\" he added."

On Monday, almost 40 meters of the embankment, surrounding the city, was damaged by the receding flood water coming from Padma, and Jamuna rivers. Areas under Harisabha, Madhya, and Paschim Sreeramdi are at a huge risk due to the renewed erosion.   Locals said, the receding whirling flood water is at its most dangerous form, and in a sudden strike the erosion devoured a large area, while they were able to transfer six buildings.  They confirmed that already four households were washed away, and there are ten other at risk, including a temple. Abu Raihan, deputy engineer of Chandpur Water Development Board (WDB) said: \"We had no idea that the erosion would hit this area again. The whole embankment is at risk right now. \"We are dumping sand bags to reduce the casualties, and another 3000 bags are ready to be used if necessary,\" he added. Visiting the area, Deputy Commissioner Majedur Rahman Khan, Superintendent of Police Mahabubur Rahman, and WDB Deputy Engineer Abu Raihan promised to take every necessary step possible to save the city. Earlier, two months ago, in another erosion strike of Meghna a 300 meter area of the embankment was washed away."

      "headline": "World Heritage Day: Shariatpur's historic medieval landmark of Manasha Bari in ruins",
      "authors": "Kazi Nazrul Islam, Shariatpur",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-18 00:00:00      \nIf the historic site is renovated and preserved then it can become a tourist spot Due to lack of renovation and preservation, the historical and archaeological landmark of Mayurbhatta's Dhanuka Manasha Bari, in Shariatpur, has almost been lost to the mists of time. On World Heritage day today, we found that although the owner lost possession of most relics of the house, Shyamapad Chakrabarty -- the last man of his family line -- has preserved around five of the household's buildings. During his recent visit to Shariatpur, the education minister instructed the local administration to preserve the almost-500-year-old historical structure. According to archeologist Dr AKM Shahnawaz, if the government provides incentives, then Manasha Bari can become a historical tourist spot for visitors. Dhanuka village is situated in the region just behind the Shariatpur police superintendent's office; and the Dhanuka Manasha Bari is located just inside the town. This ancient structure has two significant legends attached to it. Myths surrounding the landmark The first myth says that Mayurbhatta's parents -- the Bhattacharya family -- was on a pilgrimage to Kashidham, when Mayurbhatta's mother gave birth to him inside a forest. The Brahmin family believed that religion was their priority, rather than their newborn child. Thus, the family set off for their journey once again, leaving the infant in the forest, covered with a \"shal pata,\" or sal leaf. Once their pilgrimage concluded, a deity came to Bhattacharya, in his dreams, saying that their prayers would not be accepted as they were wrong to leave their child unprotected. Realizing their mistake, the couple returned to the forest and found a peacock covering their son with its feathers. Hence, Mayurbhatta was named after the \"mayur,\" or peacock, that sheltered him; and the area later became the house of the ancient Sanskrit scholar and poet. The second legend tells the story of a teenager who had a habit of collecting flowers from the garden at dawn. One day, the teenager found a massive serpent in the garden and returned home frightened. When he went to the garden the next day, he faced the snake again, but this time it follows the teen to his house. The snake slithered around the boys in a dance in the presence of terrified onlookers. Later at night, the Manasha goddess came to the dreams of the household members, and instructed them to worship the goddess -- thus establishing the Manasha temple in the house. Since then, Mayurbhatta's house has been known as Manasha Bari. The shrines of goddesses and educational institutes A large pond is situated on the entrance of the landmark. The borders to the main house began from the west bank of the pond. At present, there are a total of five structures still standing, the: Kali Mandir -- mandir is a temple--, Durga Mandir, Manasha Mandir, a Nahabat Khana, and a Sanskrit school. Near the west border of the house, facing east, is a monument with a bungalow style two-way sloping roof, which was once used as the Manasha Mandir. Manshabari dining room Dhaka Tribune Another bigger edifice is situated on the northern border, facing south, which also has a two-way sloping roof. This monument has been marked as Durga Mandir. There is another two-storey building facing the temple--that is mostly in ruins--known as the Nahabat Khana. There is a two-storey temple for the Goddess Kali, adjacent to the west side of the manor's courtyard. A lot of the second floor and parts of the first floor of the temple have collapsed.  Another two-storey building, that has survived, on the southwest area, used to house a Sanskrit  school. Next to this school was the residence of Acharya family, however there is no way to excavate it at present. The history behind the Manasha Bari  According to historic descriptions, the descendants of Mayurbhatta came to reside in the Manasha Bari from Kannauj to present-day Dhanuka of Shariatpur. Lakshman Mishra has been shown as the descendant of Mayurbhatta in their family tree. After Shyamol Sen -- second son of the King of Sen Dynasty -- conquered Kotalipara, he brought a Brahmin named Yashdhar Mishra with him. Meanwhile, a sorceress died in Bikrampur, befalling an inauspicious haze over the kingdom. The king decided to call his priest to sacrifice all other sorceresses, when Yashdhar pointed out the fault in the idea. The king then asked Yashdhar to carry out the sacrifice; when he concluded it successfully, Yashdhar was rewarded heartily by the king. He started to live on the land rewarded to him by the king, and the king brought more Brahmins from Kannauj so that Yashdhar felt at ease living there. Lakshman Mishra is a successor of these Brahmins, but he left Bikrampur because of river erosion -- and moved to Dhanuka. Meanwhile, it is believed that Mayurbhatta and Lakshman Mishra, together, built the structures of Manasha Bari at the end of the 15th century. Architectural and cultural significance There are no inscriptions that elucidate the construction period of these buildings. Nonetheless, seeing the construction style, it is believed that they were either built at the end of the Sultanate period or the early Mughal period.  The construction style is such that there are several doors arched to enter the room from the rear of the building. These medieval monuments were built with limestone and bricks. There are also traces of Islamic architecture in the construction style of these structures. The institution and the temple were built in late 16th or early 17th century. According to the locals, the Sanskrit school building has underground cells, but it is impossible to prove its authenticity without an archaeological excavation. An excavation project was initiated by the authorities and later abandoned. However, after a bit of digging, evidence of a brick-lining was found deep inside the ground. The facade of the building is greatly damaged and the inner chamber walls have smooth plaster. There is no decoration on the wall, but there are light and simple notched designs on the walls. There are also arched alcoves every two-or-three feet on the wall. The architectural excellence of Manasha Bari proved there is a rich past and culture in this region. With the existence of the educational institution in Manasha Bari, it appears that during the contemporary period, a cultural circle has been formed in this region.  Mayurbhatta's daughter--poet Jayanti Devi, or Vaijayanti--was a Sanskrit poet Manasha Bari. She received Sanskrit education from her father, Mayurbhatta, and achieved special knowledge in scripture about conciliation. Vaijayanti husband was born into the famous Pandit family of Kotalipara in Faridpur. Her husband, Krishnanath Sarvabhouma, was also a Sanskrit poet. Temples of Manasha Bari have some significant other features of the ancient era. There are 11 ornamental tiles under the roof of the Manasha temple, and there is a big lotus in-between each tile. The flower and sapling designs on a flower vase--situated on a pillar near the main entrance of the Durga temple, and under its rooftop panel--are simply remarkable. Colored tiles were used on the walls of the eastern side of this temple. The use of these motifs were commonplace during the Mughal era. Mayurbhatta's last successor, Shyamapad Chakrabarty, said: \"Manasha Bari was established on a property of almost seven acres. Some influential people have occasionally pressured me to knock down these buildings. He said he has preserved these medieval institutions even in the face of immense pressure. Govinda Chandra Chakrabarty, son of Shyamapad Chakrabarty, said many journalists, tourists and researchers have come to receive information about the tradition of this house. However, no-one has taken any action to protect this ancient heritage. If this asset is preserved, this Dhanuka Manasha Bari can be established as one of the key tourist centers of Shariatpur. Shariatpur Deputy Commissioner Kazi Abu Taher said: \"We have sent a letter regarding the renovation and maintenance of Manasha Bari to the Department of Archeology. \"On March 15, the education minister and state minister of water resources visited the Manasha Bari. Then, both ministers instructed us to write letters again and assured us of the financial allocation in this regard.\" Former chairman of Archaeology Department in Jahangirnagar University, Dr Shahnawaz said: \"An analysis of these structures showed that these buildings were constructed in late 16th and early 17th century.  \"I have repeatedly requested the government's Archaeology Department to include the Manasha Bari of Shariatpur on their list. It is possible to build a tourism area here if the Cultural Affairs Ministry takes responsibility for the renovation and preservation of Manasha Bari.\" "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-23 00:00:00      \nVarious NGOs have decried several sections of the draft as 'restrictive and unconstitutional' Non-governmental organizations, and civil society members have expressed grave concern over the draft of the Volunteer Social Welfare Organizations (Registration and Control) Act 2019.  Various NGOs have decried several sections of the draft as \"restrictive and unconstitutional\". According to the NGO Affairs Bureau, between March and June 2019, the government canceled the registration of 197 NGOs. There are 2,470 NGO's registered with the NGO Affairs Bureau for their foreign funding. Another 2,217 are registered as domestic NGOs, and 253 are foreign organizations. What does the draft say? Section 4 of the draft proposes that all NGOs will have to register with the Ministry of Social Welfare, but with the caveat that all NGOs with foreign funding will have to additionally register with the NGO Affairs Bureau. No NGOs will be allowed to set up or continue their operations without government permits. Section 10 introduces the most restrictive part of the law - all NGOs will be able to work in only one district, when they first register. After registration, NGOs can expand their scope of work, but only to five districts at a time. Section 11, sub-sections 1 and 2 stipulates that this law takes precedence over other existing laws regarding registration, and all NGOs have to register, and renew their registrations every five years. Failure to renew registration or rejection by the authority will result in the dissolution of the NGO. Section 14 requires NGOs to have an account with a state owned bank, and conduct all financial transactions via state owned banks. It requires the NGOs to submit their annual work plans, audit reports, activity reports, etc. It also requires NGOS to submit tri-monthly bank statements to the local social welfare office, and registration authorities. Section 16 says, the government can expel the executive committee of an NGO, and replace them with a five-member government appointed committee. Section 17 has the provision for dissolving an NGO, if the government authorities have reason to believe they are not in the best interest of the public, or have broken the law. Sub-section 2 says, the government can dissolve the NGO from the date an order is issued. Sub-section 3 says, an NGO will be declared dissolved from the day its registration is revoked. If an NGO wants to shut down its operations, Section 18 says it must meet a series of requirements. At least three-fourths of the members of the NGO will have to vote for its dissolution at a general meeting. Only then, they can appeal to the registration authorities to shut the NGO down. The authorities will scrutinize the request, and pass it to the director general with their recommendations. If the director general deems fit, a gazette will be issued to proclaim the dissolution of the NGO. After the gazette notification, there will be a three-month period to clear all dues, and if there are no complaints at the end of the period, the NGO will be declared closed. Section 21 lists the provisions for punitive measures, which clearly state that the government can fine an NGO Tk50,000, or issue a year-long prison sentence, or both, if any NGO member is found to be in breach of existing laws, or provide any misinformation in any public statements.  Sub-section 3 stipulates that no legal action can be pursued against authorities or individuals who have enforced the punitive action against the NGO. Sub-section 4 plainly states that no criminal or civil cases can be filed against the government or any government officers if their actions in good faith harm the NGO in any way. However, there is a clause to file a case with the court if there is any grievance with the NGO's financials. Opportunity for misuse On May 26, watchdog Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) expressed deep concern over the proposed law. In a press statement TIB Executive Director Dr Iftekharuzzaman said, the proposed law will create serious obstacles in NGO activities, cautioning that it will create too many chances for misuse.  He expressed his frustration with the provision that requires NGOs with foreign funding to register with two different government offices, emphasizing the risk of the boggy nature of the government bureaucracy to significantly curtail NGO operations. The statement demanded that the government change, modify, and cancel the sections which are unclear, repressive, and conflicting, and calling for a swift amendment to the draft. NGOs perturbed Khushi Kabir, coordinator of Nijera Kori, expressing her disappointment, said: \"When we expressed our anxiety with the draft, the concerned government authority said we (NGOs) will be consulted before the draft is sent to the cabinet, but that did not happen. \"NGOs are not working against the government, they are working for development. But if the government imposes any laws to impede our work, we would like to further discuss, and try to change the law.\"  TIB Chairperson Sultana Kamal said that various sections of the law will terribly diminish NGO activities which are highly-acclaimed, and served to develop the economy, society building, reducing poverty, empowering women, and implementing the SDG. She warned that it will discourage NGO activities not only because of the restrictions, but the nature of the law, which appears to reflect the government's attitude towards citizen rights organizations. Sultana Kamal decried the draft as \"unconstitutional and unacceptable.\"  She recommended the government to sit with stakeholders, and consider their opinion before drafting a law of this magnitude.  Government feedback AJM Ershad Ahsan Habib, deputy secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare said: \"We sent the draft to the cabinet with all the opinions we received. Any changes, replacements, or additions to the law can be made before vetting. The cabinet might even take into consideration the objections or statements by various NGOs.\""

Damage In Barguna, water levels of three rivers- the Baleshwar, Bishkhali, and Payra - were about 25cm above the danger level. However, the Water development board's Barguna office Deputy Divisional Engineer Hannan Pradhan said there was no risk of water entering the locality. In Barisal, the cultivation of boro paddy on 3,680 hectares of land, muug pulses on 1,510 hectares, pepper on 1,476 hectares , sesamum (til) on 250 hectares, vegetables on 940 hectares,  maize on 120 hectares, betel-leaf on 535 hetares, and soya bean  on 552 hectares were damaged, according to reports from different upazilas. In addition, 1,015 non-brick houses, 65km of unpaved roads, fish cultivation on  25 private ponds, and 6,065 plants and trees were also damaged by Cyclone Fani in the district, reports our correspondent.  Furthermore, 20m of the Satla-Bagda flood control embankments at Shibpur point and the river erosion control embankment in ward -11 of Barisal City Corporation were damaged but repaired immediately, said Barisal District Deputy Commissioner SM Ajiar Rahman. In Sonagazi of Feni, 50 houses were damaged, as well as crops and electrical pylons. Sonagazi UNO M Sohel Parvez said there was massive damage at four unions of the upazila, and initial estimates suggest the damage to crops and electrical lines would amount to about Tk1 crore. Jessore district Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Nurul Islam said damage was relatively low, as about 50% of rice crops had already been harvested. At maximum, damage was sustained at about 5% of the cropland.

A total 6,000 acres of cropland was damaged, while about 3000 trees, 10km of embankments, and 2,092 houses were partially damaged in eight upazila of Patuakhali, said District Deputy Commissioner Motiul Islam Chowdhury at a press briefing on Saturday. An embankment on the Ichamoti river in Satkhira also sustained damage. In Sunamganj, the harvesting of paddy was still suspended because of the rain and bad weather.  In Netrokona, water was flowing 8.42m above the danger level in the Sumeshwari river, 4.33m in the Kangsha river, 3.31m in Dhanu river, and 4.1 meter in Ubdhakhali river, while 89mm rain was recorded in the district on Saturday. Shelters barely occupied, people head back home As a pre-caution, the government had evacuated 1,640,000 people and moved them to 4,071 cyclone shelters in 19 districts.  After the Met Office issued danger signals, the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief in conjunction with Bangladesh Red Crescent Society began evacuating residents of coastal districts and sending them to cyclone shelters. However, most of the shelters remained vacant as locals termed Fani a usual natural phenomenon.    People who took shelter in the cyclone centres returned home on Saturday afternoon, after Fani had passed through their areas. 13 flights cancelled A total of 13 flights were cancelled on Saturday, and some others were delayed due to bad weather caused by Cyclone Fani. National flag carrier Bangladesh Biman cancelled two flights on the Dhaka-Chittagong route, Novo Air cancelled eight flights to Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Jessore, and Kolkata, Regent Airways cancelled its Dhaka-Kolkata flight, and US-Bangla Airlines cancelled its Dhaka-Syedpur flight."

The meeting - 5th Joint Consultative Commission (JCC) - will be held in New Delhi, paving the way for new Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen to make his maiden foreign tour to India after formation of the new government, reports UNB. A preparatory inter-ministerial meeting is scheduled to be held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday to finalize  5th JCC agenda. Foreign Secretary M Shahidul Haque will preside over the meeting. The representatives of relevant ministries, divisions, and agencies will attend the meeting. The 4th Joint Consultative Commission between Bangladesh and India, led by former Foreign Minister AH Mahmood Ali and Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj respectively, was held in October 2017. The 5th JCC meeting, once the date is set, will review progress made in areas such as trade and investment, security, connectivity, border management, power, energy, shipping, and people-to-people exchanges, said a diplomatic source. The two countries will also discuss common challenges and find ways on how the two friendly countries, along with other like-minded nations can continue fighting the scourge of terrorism, extremism, and radicalisation, the source indicates. The Rohingya issue might come up for discussions as well during the meeting. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Momen on Monday said he will make his maiden visit as the Foreign Minister to New Delhi as India has invited him. \"India is our neighbour and friendly country and we have a warm relationship\" he said, without giving any date and purpose of his India trip. Earlier, acting High Commissioner of India to Bangladesh, Dr Adarsh Swaika, met the new Foreign Minister of Bangladesh and handed over a letter of congratulations from the External Affairs Minister of India, Sushma Swaraj. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the first among global leaders to congratulate Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina after her party, Awami League's absolute victory in the December 30 elections. Prime Minister Modi expressed confidence that the partnership between Bangladesh and India will continue to flourish under her \"farsighted\" leadership. He also reiterated the priority India attaches to Bangladesh as a neighbour, a close partner for regional development, security and cooperation, and a central pillar in India's ''Neighbourhood First\" policy."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-05 00:00:00      \nBahamians struggle in Dorian's devastating wake  Stunned residents of the Bahamas surveyed the wreckage of their homes and officials struggled to assess the number killed by Hurricane Dorian, as the storm bore down on the South Carolina coast, threatening record flooding on Thursday. The United Nations said 70,000 people in the Bahamas needed immediate humanitarian relief after the most damaging storm ever to hit the island nation. Aerial video of the worst-hit Abaco Islands in the northern Bahamas showed widespread devastation, with the harbor, shops, workplaces, a hospital and airport landing strips damaged or decimated, frustrating rescue efforts. One of the most powerful Caribbean storms on record, Dorian was rated a Category 5 hurricane when it killed at least 20 people in the Bahamas. Authorities expect that number to rise, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said at a news briefing, as retreating floodwaters revealed the scope of destruction. \"My island of Abaco, everything is gone. No banks, no stores, no nothing,\" said Marsh Harbour resident, Ramond A King as he surveyed the wreckage of his home, which had its roof ripped off and debris scattered throughout. \"Everything is gone, just bodies.\" With telephones down in many areas, residents posted lists of missing loved ones on social media. One Facebook post by media outlet Our News Bahamas had 2,500 comments, mainly listing lost family members. Dorian killed one person in Puerto Rico before hovering over the Bahamas for two days with torrential rains and fierce winds that whipped up 12- to 18-foot (3.7- to 5.5-metre) storm surges. Possible record surge South Carolina was preparing for a record storm surge, potentially reaching a height of eight feet (two metres) at the popular vacation destination of Myrtle Beach, the US National Hurricane Center said in an advisory. The storm was located about 115km south-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, at 8am EST (1200 GMT) on Thursday and was headed north-northeast at about 13kph, the NHC said. It was packing 185kph winds. About a foot (30cm) of rain will drop on flood-prone Charleston and many parts of the coasts of the Carolinas on Thursday and Friday, said Bob Oravec, a forecaster with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. \"It's pretty substantial,\" he said early on Thursday. \"It's already raining heavy in Charleston and up and down the coast.\" More than 185,000 homes and businesses were without power along the South Carolina and Georgia coastal areas, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us. The streets of downtown Charleston were all but deserted early Thursday as driving rain and strong winds lashed the city. On South Battery Street, a block away from the water, Brys Stephens and his family worked hard to keep the water away from a large gray home with white verandas along the front, the type of home that has made Charleston famous and is a major tourist draw. He was working to reattach metal flood gates to a sturdy high wall fronting the property. \"The gates worked pretty well so far and we've managed to keep water away from the house,\" Stephens said. \"But we've got another storm surge coming later on, so we'll see then if it holds.\" The NHC's storm surge warning covered parts of the coasts of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina stretching from the Savannah River and extending to southern Virginia. More than 2.2 million people in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina have been ordered to evacuate, although Florida has avoided a direct hit. Relief efforts An international relief effort was underway for the Bahamas, with a British Royal Navy vessel providing assistance and Jamaica sending a 150-member military contingent to help secure Abaco and Grand Bahama, officials said. Volunteers also ferried supplies to the islands in a flotilla of small boats. \"Let us give of our best in this moment of historic tragedy,\" Minnis said. He also encouraged international tourists to visit the Bahamas, which relies heavily on its hospitality industry. As many as 13,000 homes in the Bahamas may have been destroyed or severely damaged, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said. Norwegian energy company Equinor said it had discovered a spill on the ground outside tanks at its damaged storage terminal in the Bahamas, but was unclear on volumes and had not seen any oil at sea. The State Department said it did not believe any U.S. citizens who were in the Bahamas during the storm were killed. President Donald Trump said the United States was sending supplies, including materials originally intended for any Dorian victims in Florida."

The press release, issued on Wednesday, instructs members of all Chhatra League units, nationwide, to help farmers with their harvest. These directives came amid protests by farmers--in villages, towns, districts, and Dhaka--as the farmers are facing great losses due to the very low price of paddy. Some farmers set fire to their harvests as they could not afford day laborers to  cut the paddy  -as this year's paddy price is the lowest of the last three years. Over the past three weeks, a bountiful harvest has been overshadowed by the grief of rice farmers throughout Bangladesh. Farmers are demanding purchases be made directly from farms, and that crops be sold at a fair price. Currently, paddy is sold wholesale at Tk450 to Tk500 for every maund (1 maund=40kg). Many farmers have said the cost of harvesting each maund of paddy is between Tk1,000 to Tk1,500. Other reports say that farmers will suffer a loss of at least Tk300 per maund if they sell paddy at the current market price."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-08 00:00:00      \nDisasters are a threat to human rights In September 2019, a UN panel of scientists associated with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a report on the future impact of climate change and rising temperatures. It signaled a red alert pertaining to devastating effects that would arise from ice melting in our seas and frozen regions.  The oceans have soaked up more than 90% of the extra heat generated by humans over the past decades.  This rising water level is now being driven principally by the melting of Greenland and Antarctica.  It has also been observed that glaciers are also melting at a fast pace in areas like the tropical Andes, Central Europe, and North Asia.  These regions will lose 80% of their ice by 2100 under the high carbon emissions scenario. The global average sea levels could increase by up to 1.1m by 2100. Coastal flooding will hit nearly 42 million people in Bangladesh by 2050.  Researchers have found that nearly 300 million people across the world will be vulnerable by 2050 to flooding made worse by climate change.  By 2050, low-lying areas in some South and Southeast Asian cities not far from the coast (without proper embankments) are likely to face inundation during high tide as part of the flood zone.  Bangladeshi climate experts have denoted that 100km away from the coastal zones, the districts of Pirojpur and Shariatpur might be badly affected as there are no embankments there. These debacles that are staring us in the face have raised several questions as to how the concerned countries are expected to respond to the evolving disastrous situation, and how basic human rights of the affected people need to be safeguarded while tackling and managing this growing emergency. This aspect is receiving attention because environmental sustainability and the promotion of human rights are closely intertwined and complementary objectives that are at the core of sustainable development. Efforts to promote environmental sustainability can only be effective if they occur in the context of conductive legal frameworks, and by the exercise of certain human rights, such as the rights to information, public participation in decision-making, and access to justice. It needs to be understood that the implementation of any agenda to tackle the impending climate change disaster will require relevant actors to adopt policies and mobilize resources to advance equitable, human-rights-based, and sustainable development.  Human rights mechanisms will have to address issues within the right to a healthy environment directly and also focus on the environmental dimensions of more established rights, through emerging rights, such as the right to water and development.  A number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) recognize the link between the environment and human health, and many MEAs also include provisions regarding civil liability and compensation for damage caused by environmental degradation. Human rights tribunals in the context of environmental law have also dealt with the protection of collective intellectual property rights, through principles of benefit sharing, ie in the context of genetic resources.  In addition, the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on certain groups could amount to a violation of rights to freedom from discrimination. This potential is referred primarily in the context of discrimination against indigenous peoples or racial minorities. There is also the question of environmental degradation playing a decisive role in many conflict situations. Such degradation can contribute to the outbreak of a conflict and result in the infringement of fundamental human rights, such as the right to life and health.  These infringements would include damages to the life and properties of victims of conflict, disruption of normal living conditions, and loss of access to basic services. Conflicts can also fuel environmental degradation by weakening governance structures, undermining positive environmental practices, and promoting uncontrolled systems of resource exploitation.  Thus it is crucial that conflict management is taken into account from the outset, along with humanitarian, economic, and social needs.  Neglect in the establishment of strong governance systems that factor in the environmental rule of law can consequently jeopardize the peace process and the well-being of the population and environment. Ensuring a human rights framework also denotes the importance of accountability mechanisms in the implementation of measures and policies in the area of climate change that requires access to administrative and judicial remedies. Such an approach can then serve to bring greater clarity about the underlying causes of positive or negative impacts of various economic measures related to environmental protection.  It will also allow for better choices among policies and projects. This can then improve outcomes by facilitating positive synergies, and generally improving the governance of natural resources.  It will also facilitate and increase the legitimacy of activities, programs, and policies by integrating social concerns with environmental goals and responsibilities of all actors.  This will ensure the accountability of governments, the private sector, and environmental or human rights organizations with regard to the impact of their activities on the environment.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-10 00:00:00      \nThe huge quantity of fertilizer, worth around Tk57 crore, was imported from abroad to meet the demands of farmers from the 19 northern districts of the country when Jamuna Fertilizer Company Ltd (JFCL) came to a halt after a fire incident on November 11, 2018 For almost a year, around 28,000 tons of imported urea fertilizers have been wasting away due to being stored in the open in front of the Jamuna Fertilizer Company Ltd (JFCL) at Tarakandi in Jamalpur's Sarishabari upazila. The huge quantity of fertilizer, worth around Tk57 crore, was imported from abroad to meet the demands of farmers from the 19 northern districts of the country when Jamuna Fertilizer Company Ltd (JFCL) came to a halt after a fire incident on November 11, 2018. According to JFCL, since the fire the factory was unable to resume despite repeated attempts, during which over 350,000 tons of urea fertilizer were imported through a government initiative. Among which, 40,810 tons are still reserved at the factory. But the factory owns only two warehouses with a storage capacity of 12,000 tons, therefore almost 28,810 tons are stored in front of the administrative building. However, while visiting the area it was found that the rest of the fertilizers are barely covered with sheets of tarpaulins, and lying under the open sky beside the factory. In the process, the fertilizer, which is otherwise in granular form, absorbs moisture, and turns rocky or melts into liquid in the seasonal heatwave, rain and cold, said local farmers. Workers of the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) said the damage being done to the urea fertilizers which are not being maintained properly, due to lack of warehouse spaces, is going to cause not only the farmers but the government a huge financial loss. Sarker Abul Hossain, Osman Gani along with other BCIC dealers, said, the stored fertilizer loses its effectiveness, becomes coagulated, and then becomes hard to sell, and use.  Aligning with the dealers, Jamalpur Truck and Tank Lorry Owner's Association's Tarakandi union's President Ashraful Alam Manik said: \"The imported fertilizers have declined so much in quality that the sacks leak while loading in them in the truck. Dealers often refuse to store them in their warehouses.\" Farmers from different areas of the district, Hurmuz Ali of Sarishabari, Abdul Karim Mandal of Saatpoa, Belayet Mia, Rafet Mandalo of Charpalisha said, the northern part of Bangladesh has recently suffered a severe flood, and most of the croplands went underwater causing huge loss to the farmers. So, the Jamalpur farmers were planning to make up their losses by harvesting on a large scale. However, the deteriorated fertilizers are shattering their hopes. Frustrated over the maintenance failure of the authority, farmer Belayet Miya said: \"If the farmers do not get enough quality fertilizers for the upcoming Irri-Borro harvest season, the net harvest would be affected.\" \"The authority must import more fertilizers or resume the JFCL, otherwise farmers of the 19 districts would face huge loss due to shortage of fertilizers,\" he added. Regarding the inefficient maintenance of the fertilizers, JFCL's Manager (Commercial) Wahedur Rahman said: \"The fertilizers were stored in front of the factory for the lack of storage capacity in our warehouses. Though it is possible that some of the sacks can get damaged but it would not affect their overall quality by any means. \"Enough fertilizers are stored for the upcoming harvesting season. We would ensure proper supply to field level farmers. And hopefully, they would not face any shortage,\" he added."

Previously on Saturday, police recovered the throat-slit bodies of Abu Taher, 35, a day labourer, and his daughter Bibi Fatema from their house in Nimtoli area of the city. Police also recovered a bloodstained knife from the spot.  Hasina killed her daughter Fatema after the little girl discovered her mother's illicit affair with Mainuddin in the morning, Additional Commissioner Amena Begum said. \"When Fatema threatened her mother that she would reveal the matter to her father, Mainuddin held the girl tightly, and Hasina slit her throat. After sometime, Taher entered the house, and they strangled him first, and then slit his throat,\" Amena said.  Immediately after the murders, Mainuddin went into hiding, and was arrested from Noakhali early on Saturday. Nur Alam, elder brother of Abu Taher lodged a case with Bandar police station against Hasina Begum, and Mainuddin."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-20 00:00:00      \nAnyone can be jailed for up to 14 years for for violating the law that was passed in September last year It has been a year now since the Digital Security Bill, 2018, was passed in the parliament on September 19, 2018, amid much criticism from journalists, and human rights activists.  Within the first year of its enactment, four cases were recorded under the Digital Security Act (DSA) in Khulna, where two journalists were sued.  Md Hedait Hossain Molla, local correspondent of Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune, was sued, and arrested on January 1, for publishing \"false\" information on the number of votes cast in a constituency in the aftermath of the general election.  Rashidul Islam, staff reporter of the daily Manab Zamin was also accused in the same case. According to the initial announcement of the election results, the number of votes cast in Khulna 1 was higher than the total number of voters in the constituency. As the matter was brought to the returning officer's attention, he said it was a mistake, and later came up with a correction. By the time the correction could be made, the two media outlets ran reports saying the number of votes cast was around 22,000 higher than the actual number of voters. Even though Hedayet was released on permanent bail two days later, the police have yet to submit the case investigation report in court, despite the passage of eight months. Yet, it is clearly mentioned in the law that, for cases filed under the act, the investigation reports must be submitted within 120 days. Later on August 22, publisher and editor of 'Prothom Shomoy', an online media portal, Shahin Rahman was arrested for allegedly spreading defamatory information on social media.  Khulna Press Club President SM Habib started a case against him under sections 29 and 31 of the Digital Security Act on August 9. Two more cases under the same act was filed against him by August 28. The law authorises prison sentences for up to 14 years for anyone who secretly records government officials, or gathers information from a government agency using a computer or other digital device. Mominul Islam, district convener of Bangladesh Society for the Enforcement of Human Rights (BSEHR), said: \"Each law poses some variations of pros and cons. However, in the first year of enactment of the Digital Security Act, it has mostly been abused, and journalists were victimized. This new law puts restraints on the media's freedom of expression. I think several sections of the act need to be revised again.\" Kudrot E Khoda, district general secretary of Shushashoner Jonno Nagorik (Shujan), said: \"The Digital Security Act was enacted after scrapping the ICT act. The law looks good on paper, but it is important to monitor if it is implemented objectively. The misuse of this law is preventing journalists in the district to practice their right to freedom of expression.\""

Affiliated sources have confirmed that numerous fake Facebook IDs had been opened using the names of prominent personalities, politicians, and other renowned people. Based on this information, a request was sent to the Facebook authority to shut the fake personal IDs, pages, and groups, by using certain focal points in the country.  Mustafa Jabbar said: \"We were able to shut down 1,500 Facebook IDs recently. They were being used to spread false propaganda; several of them were owned by militants.\" The removed Facebook IDs are not related to pornography, Jabbar further said. \"These rumours circulated as we are closing down porn sites as well. However, the rumours are false.\" Bangladesh has a better relationship with Facebook than before, the technocrat minister said. \"If we ask for something, Facebook's authorities listen to us. They evaluate the requests with their community standards and try to respond to our requests as fast as possible. I believe it is a great achievement.\" He added: \"More accounts will be blocked in the future. We have already identified them, and our team is working diligently to monitor their activities.\" The Department of Telecom (Dot), under the Posts and Telecommunications Division, is working to monitor the cyber world. A cybersecurity monitoring project has been introduced under Dot, and half of the project has already been realized. Affiliated sources have said the ever since the cybersecurity monitoring project began being implemented, it has become easier to monitor social media sites. The government has IT monitoring cells to gather data on the cyber world as well. Other than that, due to better monitoring--by law enforcement agencies, BTRC, National Telecom Monitoring Cells, and other affiliated organizations--it has become easier to identify IDs, the sources said.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-28 00:00:00      \nMigration continues to be a serious issue for climate-vulnerable Bangladesh There are over 258 million migrants around the world living outside their country of birth. This figure is expected to grow for a number of reasons, including population growth, increasing connectivity, trade, rising inequality, demographic imbalances, and climate change. Globally, over 68.5 million people are forcibly displaced among which 25.4 million are refugees. To address the growing number of migrants and refugees in a way that upholds the principles of human rights, in 2018, the global leaders adopted two major reports to address issues related to refugees and migration. These are called the Global Compact on Refugees and Global Compact for Migration. Bangladesh is signatory to both the agreements will be addressing the agreements taking series of actions nationally and globally. To better understand the implications of these agreement in Bangladesh, it is important to look at what the compacts are about.  The Refugee Compact The Refugee Compact has four objectives: Ease pressures on host countries; enhance refugee self-reliance; expand access to third country solutions, and support conditions in countries of origin for return in safety and dignity.  The Migration Compact The Migration Compact comprises 23 objectives for better managing migration at local, national, regional and global levels. It expresses states' \"collective commitment to improving cooperation on international migration.\" Both compacts were being questioned by various stakeholders especially with regards to how this will be delivered when there is less clarity about few definitions (such as refugee). It is widely agreed that the compacts will only make a difference to the lives of the refugees and migrants if there is enough political will of the government to live up to their commitments. While we continue demanding for better clarity and implementation of the compacts in line with Agenda 2030, it is important to also recognize that climate change and conflict-related displacement and forced migration are on the rise -- we can start thinking of supporting the proposal of the New NANSEN Passport as one of the response mechanisms. However, this doesn't take away the fact that we need take action to prevent displacement and forced migration to take place.  National response Bangladesh continues to be within the top 10 at-risk countries to climate change impacts and disasters in the world. There are a number of scenarios with linking the temperature raise trajectory, especially how this will displace and force people to migrate. There are a number of efforts made to understand the future scenario including efforts to track what is happening with regards to displacement and migration in recent years:  * Between 1980 and 2008, it experienced 219 natural disasters -- but not enough information about how many people are displaced. Cyclone Sidr alone impacted 9 million people and at least 3 million people were displaced (NRC)  * Between 2008 and 2014 it is estimated that 4.7 million people were displaced due to disasters in Bangladesh (displacement solutions). Some of the major events include Cyclone Aila (as many as two million people lost their home)  * In 2017, the majority of new displacements occurred due to sudden-onset disasters including Tropical Cyclone Mora in May and Monsoon flooding between June and August. A total of 946,000 new displacements due to these disasters. The South Asian flood (2017) impacted 8 million people in Bangladesh   * A recent RMMRU study found Dhaka receives three out of every five (59.2%) migrants from rural areas, with one in five (20.1%) preferring the port city of Chittagong  * RMMRU surveyed 1,431 internal migrant households of 20 districts and found other urban destinations included Gazipur (2.9% of all migrants), Sylhet (1.9%), Khulna (1%), Mymensingh and Narayanganj (0.6% each), and Satkhira (0.4%). The remaining 13.2% of migrants were spread among the other districts and towns of the country Dhaka alone receives about 500,000 people each year The silver lining Bangladesh has the potential to be the biggest mover in the global gross domestic product rankings in 2030. According to the latest report of HSBC Global Research, the country is becoming the 26th largest economy in the world from 42nd now. However, such growth is tied up with the migrant workers' hard earned money and how the entire economy will be impacted by climate change and development-induced displacement and migration.  It is crucial to recognize that the government is the primary duty bearer to address the issue of migrants and refugees while the civil society organizations and movements can support in developing policy instruments to field level implementation. It is absolutely critical, while implementing the commitments, to recognize the differentiated vulnerability and struggle of women and children as migrant and refugees. Therefore, the government must develop a safeguard mechanism for the most vulnerable and marginalized. Furthermore, the government can also consider the following:  * At the policy level in Bangladesh, the government can adopt a \"people's safeguard policy\"   * Establish a national tracking mechanism for displaced and migrated people   * Establish a safety-net mechanism/fund for displaced and forcibly migrated people  For civil society organizations addressing such massive issues is a collective responsibility. Furthermore, CSOs can support the government's position on compensation from polluter countries. As the government is planning to develop 100 economic zones, support developing skills, and of local communities who can be employed within the zone, therefore, reduce displacement and migration.

Doctors are never on time; they come, and go as they please' The Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital was designed and built to accommodate 250 in-patients. But, on any given day there are between 400 to 600 in-patients from all corners of the district, during the current monsoon, and cyclone season. International non-governmental organizations (NGOs) along with the Bangladesh government are working to improve the services of the much important hospital, which is the primary source of health care for nearly 250,000 people in the district. Although the hospital is returning to its former glory in providing standardized services, the grievance of the patients from near, and far has not minimized in proportion.  The patients coming to receive health care are raising various complaints regarding mismanagement, irregularities, corruption, and overall patient-doctor experience. The health care process has improved somewhat, but to no good end. Patients said, they are suffering from a shortage of beds, frequent power outages, and hassle from brokers looking for commissions. The hospital should be able to accommodate 250 patients, but in reality, it does not have the required manpower or resources to even run a 150-bed hospital, said locals.   Patients waiting in a jam-packed line in front of the ticket counter to see the doctor is an everyday scenario. After a daylong wait, some who manage to see the doctor is satisfied, while others are disappointed as they do not get the chance.  According to patients and visitors, the women's ward on the fourth floor is always crowded with patients, making it difficult for doctors to attend to each, and everyone. Due to the shortage of beds some patients share beds, while others are accommodated on the floor, and the corridors. Razia Begum, a patient accommodated on the floor said: \"I was admitted two days ago but I was not given a bed yet. I am not getting proper health care. Doctors are never on time; they come, and go as they please.\"  Another patient, Mehrab Hossain said: \"A hospital is supposed to have the cleanest environment, but this place is making people even sicker. The management should promptly take steps to provide more patient-centric services.\" Hospital Coordinator Md Mohiuddin said: \"International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), an NGO, along with the Health and Planning Ministry yesterday inaugurated the newly improved emergency room with increased staff members, and modern equipment. \"We hope to provide modern, and international standard services from now on.\""

Three were from Char Jabbar, two each from Purba Char Bata and Mohammadpur, and one from Char Jubilee. The police have said the rape cases in the area are almost always filed from these four chars. On August 17, a 14-year-old was gang-raped reportedly by six men on her way to visit her ailing sister in Mohammadpur's Char Alauddin. On August 4, a widowed mother of one was gang-raped allegedly by three men in Mohammadpur over land disputes. On August 2, a man filed a case against another man of raping his wife. The case was later settled out of court. On March 31, a mother of six was reportedly gang-raped and her husband assaulted in Char Jabbar after the upazila elections. According to the case docket, they were attacked by one political faction because they had voted for another. The medical report confirmed that there were \"signs of forcible sexual intercourse\" consistent with rape. Among the 12 accused, eight were named. Several were teenagers as young as 15 years old, aiding their father or uncles with the rape. On March 1, a woman was raped allegedly by a man in her home. Locals detained the rapist, but released him after influential UP members intervened. The woman committed suicide the next day. Also Read- Rape in Subarnachar: Where looms the spectre of sexual violence On January 31, a 13-year-old was gang-raped reportedly by two men when they offered to give her a lift home. On January 1, a couple were attacked in their home after the general elections. The husband was tied up and the wife was gang-raped by 10-15 people. A brief examination of Subarnachar The residents are all settlers, originating from Chittagong's Sandwip, or Bhola, or Lakshmipur's Kabirhat, Hatia or Ramgati. Difficulties in their daily lives, distance from civic facilities, and remote location of the region have fostered a culture of intolerance among the groups for one another. Very few residents are educated. Fishing and farming are the only means of living in the char. But to maintain their living, a majority of the men work in brick kilns in neighbouring districts for eight months every year. Many girls are subject to child marriage as soon as they reach puberty.  In the past, the char was plagued, like many other chars, by bandits. But regular police action and increased coast guard activities have all but rooted out the violent groups who could be used to seize the land. Located at the southeastern edge of Noakhali, the 576 sq-km upazila has 289,000 residents, according to the 2011 national census. With only 500 people per square kilometres, less than half the national average population density of 1,237, the desolate and remote features of the land is only stressed.

The raids began around 7pm and continued till around 10:30pm on Saturday. Confirming the matter, Senior Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) of RAB Mimtanur Rahman said: \"Three separate teams of the elite force conducted various drives at Mohammedan Sporting Club in Sadarghat, Bangladesh Muktijoddha Sangsad Krira Chakra in Ice Factory Road, and Chittagong Abahani Limited in Halishahar area.\" Acting on a tip-off, RAB officials raided the three clubs, but no gambler or club owners were found, he added.

According to the fishermen and traders, Ilish fishes have started coming in from the coastal areas in Hatia, Swandeep, Barisal, Bhola, and Charfashion at the beginning of this month. Jishan, who went to Chandpur from Comilla to buy the fish said, \"We thought that we'd get it at less price, but it's really expensive.\" Dhaka resident Tuhin reiterated that he expected the fish to be cheaper, and added, \"Since it's really expensive, I bought only five kilograms, each kilo for Tk 1,200.\" A worker at the fishing warehouse, Mofiz Uddin said, \"The good quality fish are expensive. Plus prices are always steep.\" Also Read- Ilish production up by nearly 160% in 15 yrs  \"Fishes coming in from Swandeep, and Hatia are comparatively cheaper,\" said Abul Hossain, the warehouse manager. Although, Ilish production has been less in the rivers in Chandpur, the prices of the ones that weigh one kilogram are selling for Tk 1,400 each. According to warehouse workers, Ilish weighing 200-500 grams are selling for Tk 18,000-20,000 per maund. The ones weighing 700-800 grams are selling for Tk 32,000 per maund, and the 1 kg to 1200 grams Ilish costs Tk 45,000-50,000 per maund, and up to Tk 1,200 per kilograms.

Even yesterday I sold a two kilogram fish at the rate of Tk 130,000 per maund,\" said warehouse merchant Matin Patwary. He recommended taking time before buying the fish as saltwater Ilish are a bit reddish, while famous Chandpur Ilish, known as 'Rupali Ilish [silver Ilish], is silver-ish in colour. District fisheries officer Asadul Baqi said that in a few days Ilish supplies will increase, and the prices are likely to go down then."

He made the call at the 11th convocation of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) in Dhaka. Abdul Hamid said a large number of engineers, technologists, architects, and planners from Bangladesh travel to developed countries for higher education every year and many of them migrate. \"As a result, the country is deprived of their talents and services,\" he said, noting that there were congenial work atmosphere and ample professional fields in Bangladesh. He reminded the graduates that their institution is renowned at home and abroad. \"Remember, the university is not just a single entity. The students are its life and the honourable teachers are its soul. So, the students, who were honoured and recognized shouldn't forget the contributions of this university,\" said the president. He urged the graduates not to forget the role of the university and said he firmly believes that they will make a meaningful contribution to the development of this university and the country. The president reminded everyone that Bangladesh is making rapid progress and that it is now a member of the elite club of satellite owners. \"We want to become a developed country by 2041. To achieve this, the government is implementing mega projects like Padma Bridge, Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, Rampal, and Matarbari power plant, Payra Deep Sea Port, Dhaka Metro Rail, Elevated Express Highway, and Padma Railway link project,\" he said.  \"The role of engineers in implementing, managing, and maintaining these mega projects is very important. I believe the skilled engineers of Buet will play an important role,\" Hamid said. The president said the government has adopted 'Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100' to tackle climate change induced disaster risks as part of a long-term plan. \"In this master plan, long-term strategies have been fixed for flood, river erosion, river management, water supply and waste management, urban water management and drainage. Engineers will play an important role in implementing these projects in national interest,\" he said. Terming the graduates as the most skilled human resources, the chancellor said the convocation not only recognizes them formally but also bestows responsibility on them.  \"You have to be always ready to carry out that duty. Never forget your motherland ... the general people, to whom you are indebted. Now it's your turn to pay back the country and the nation,\" President Hamid said. Stating that the fresh graduates are a standard for young generation, he said freshers will follow their ideal and get the inspiration to move forward. \"The birth anniversary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 2020 and the golden jubilee of our great independence will be celebrated in 2021. I hope you will make that celebration more colourful, bright, and successful with your invigorating enthusiasm,\" he said. Education Minister Dr Dipu Moni, Buet Vice-Chancellor Saiful Islam, and former finance minister ABA Muhith spoke at the program. A total of 5,284 graduates from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2018, registered for the convocation. Five students received gold medals from the president for outstanding academic performances."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-13 00:00:00      \nAt least 3,483 acres of water bodies, low-lying lands filled up over the last nine years Residents of Dhaka are once again facing the threat of severe water logging, as incessant rain has inundated many parts and major roads of the capital.  The Dhaka met office recorded 48mm of rainfall from 12pm-2pm on Friday but the poor state of the capital's drainage system ensured that two hours of rain was enough to flood a considerable part of the city. Mirpur Road, Nayapaltan, Green Road, Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, Motijheel, Rampura, Banani-11, Tejgaon, Karwan Bazar, Monipuri para, Kazipara, Begum Rokeya Sarani, Mohammadpur, and Dhanmondi were among the areas flooded by the rain, with water even entering homes and business establishments in low-lying areas. The situation was even worse in areas such as Malibagh and Rokeya Sharani, where road renovation work and ongoing development projects, like the Metro Rail, pose further obstacles for commuters and residents.  However, the Gulshan area saw little to no water logging, following the revamp of the drainage system during the tenure of late Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) mayor Anisul Huq. 36% of Dhaka's water bodies filled up in 9 years At least 3,483 acres of water bodies and lowlands across the metropolitan area in Dhaka have been filled up in the last nine years, according to a recent study. Presenting the findings of the study at an event on April 25, the Bangladesh Institute of Planners (BIP) General Secretary Adil Mohammad Khan said 36% of the water bodies in Dhaka had been filled up, violating the Detailed Area Plan (DAP) for the capital adopted in 2010. The parts of the city under the jurisdiction of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkah (Rajuk) had 100,937 acres of water bodies and lowlands nine years ago, but 22% of those - 22,156 acres - have been filled up since then, greatly contributing to the perennial water-logging issue, he added. The report was prepared on the basis of satellite images. No immediate relief In Dhaka, the drainage system, water pump, canals, and rivers are maintained by a total seven government agencies:  The Bangladesh Water Development Board (WDB), Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), Rajdhani Unnayan Katripakha (Rajuk), Dhaka District Administration, Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority (Dhaka Wasa), Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) and Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC).   Each of the organizations works separately to improve the drainage system in different parts of the capital. Dhaka Wasa works on the storm drain system, which handles surface water. Most drains in Dhaka are clogged by solid waste and plastic garbage, due to irregular cleanup and lack of awareness of city dwellers. Dhaka used to have 65 natural canals running throughout the city, but the number currently stands at only 26, as most of them are clogged by garbage and illegal occupiers. Urban planner and BIP General Secretary Adil Mohammad Khan said the city has been planned in a manner that does not consider the connectivity of the water management. \"There is no shortcut remedy. We have already blocked the natural connectivity to accommodate the high population density in this mega-city. We have made it a concrete jungle. Now, we have to improve the efficiencies of all existing water bodies first, and then immediately recover all the canals from grabbers and re-install their connectivity, to help the water drain from city properly,\" he added. Both Dhaka city mayors said illegally occupied city canals must be reclaimed to save Dhaka, as the blocking of the canals is largely responsible for the water logging.  DNCC Mayor Atiqul Islam said the water in Dhaka should reach rivers through canals and drainage lines of Dhaka Wasa.  \"However, the drainage lines are clogged and canals have been illegally occupied,\" he added. \"Dhaka was supposed to have 12% Aadhar (reservoir), which is now only 3%. All the ponds and water bodies have been filled up. Also, unplanned urbanization has put us in trouble, as 330 sq-km out of the total 400 sq-km area of Dhaka has already full of houses, hampering water flow routes,\" the DNCC mayor further said, adding that the authorities are in the process of mapping problem areas to find a solution. Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) Mayor Sayeed Khokhon said: \"Due to lack of proper maintenance of box culverts, water flows very slowly- at maybe at 5-10% the speed of the usual flow.\" Criticizing Dhaka Wasa, he said most city canals have been illegally occupied, and the few remaining ones are not even cleaned regularly. The DSCC mayor emphasized the need to increase the capacity of public service organizations and raise public awareness in order to address water logging. Dhaka Water Supply & Sewerage Authority (Wasa) Managing Director Taqsem A Khan could not be reached for comment as he is out of the country, while other senior Dhaka Wasa officials refused to speak on the matter."

When the BGB members returned fire in self defence, the BSF members retreated, during which one of them was killed and another wounded.\" Lt Col Ferdousalso said: \"A flag meeting between the two forces was held later in the afternoon over the incident, where both sides agreed to not let the matter escalate and take action peacefully through investigation.\" The detained fisherman was handed over to Charghat police station on Thursday night, the BGB official added.

A bench of Justice Mamnoon Rahman and Justice Ashish Ranjan Das passed the order on Sunday, as the DG failed to comply with its previous order on issuing Monthly Pay Order (MPO) scheme to the 19 teachers, and staff of Saleha Begum Mohila Degree College at Jhenaidah district. The DG has been asked to appear before the court, and present his explanation on July 31. Lawyer Mohammad Siddique Ullah Mia, who stood on behalf of the applicants in court, said the High Court on March 13, 2017 issued a verdict on issuing MPO to the 19 teachers and staff of the college, which got rejected on August 6, 2018 following an appeal. Meanwhile, as the order of HC was not followed, the teachers filed a case with the High Court for non-compliance of the HC order. On December 18, 2018, the HC issued a rule on contempt of court. Later on April 16, 2019 it gave the director general a week to comply. As the directive was not complied to, yet again, the HC summoned him on Saturday, and asked him to produce explanations over the matter."

The party also said that the dengue situation has turned epidemic in the capital due to the government's failure to take any effective preventive measure and conduct drive against Aedes mosquito. \"The Department of Public Health and the Directorate General of Health Services have no extensive drive and action to prevent it,\" said BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi on Sunday. Speaking at a press conference at the party's Nayapaltan central office, he said the city corporations are only giving lip services instead of carrying out adequate anti-mosquito drives. \"Many people are dying getting affected with dengue, but no effective step in sight to protect them.\" The senior BNP leader said this government has no sense of responsibility for people as it is only busy pocketing public money. He also said the government is hardly bothered about public welfare and improving public health and checking diseases since it is not elected by people. Rizvi alleged that though the ruling party leaders are used to talk about the country's development, people are going through immense sufferings due to serious tailbacks and sorry state of roads.  He came down hard on the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Chairman Iqbal Mahmood for his comment that corruption committed \"in good faith\" by public servants is not an offence, saying he encouraged the government employees to indulge in corruption. Rizvi also said the ACC chief's remark is a dangerous message of bad governance. The BNP leader said Iqbal Mahmood has no other alternative to defending the corruption by government officials since the ACC officials themselves are involved in corruption. He also alleged that the ACC is busy suppressing opposition in the name of preventing corruption while it has turned a blind eye to the real corrupt plundering public money and making second homes in different countries. Rizvi said the banking sector has been ruined due to government officials' corruption \"in good faith\". About the deteriorating flood situation, he said the ministers and the ruling party MPs are giving lip services from the capital instead of standing beside the victims with necessary relief materials."

On Friday afternoon, a BSF  patrol team from Amit camp under the Shitalkuchi police station of India stopped the construction of Keramatia Boro Mosque when its windows were being installed.

We are discussing the issue with BSF.\"  Locals say, in Mughal times a darbesh (holy man) by the name of Keramatia Hujur built a mosque in the Dolpara area. By the side of the mosque, a shrine was later built around his grave and the mosque was developed further over time.  During the partition of India in 1947 the mosque and the shrine fell in no man's land, where thousands of Muslims go to pray every Friday. The mosque committee's secretary, Alimuddin said: \"The reconstruction of the mosque was approved in 2011 by the authorities of both Bangladesh and India and construction work began on April 29 that year.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-01 00:00:00      \nIn conversation with guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend on his memories of \"Goodbye Summer Concert for Bangladesh\" Goodbye Summer, a rock concert in aid of famine relief of Bangladesh on Sunday September 18, 1971, was not the only Bangladesh related rock event that summer in the UK. Though far less remembered than the ground-breaking event with George Harrison, Ravi Shankar, Bob Dylan, Ringo Starr et al six weeks earlier in Manhattan, the day-long festival at the Oval cricket ground in South London had its own rock superstars. Headlined by The Who and The Faces in their Rod Stewart and Ronnie Wood heyday, it drew about as many people in one sitting as the two shows, (matinee and evening) of the historic Concert for Bangladesh in New York on Sunday, August 1, 1971. Here is a conversation with guitarist/songwriter Pete Townshend on his memories of the event. Pete Townshend is happy to answer the question and waxes lyrical with a paean to growing up in a multicultural part of West London (\"a mixed-race place\") Unsurprisingly given the years that have past, he veers between remembering some things in detail, and saying \"I don't remember the concert\" (With thanks to Deborah Bonetti, Foreign Press Association Director for reading out my question and prompts) Do you have any memories of the \"Goodbye Summer Concert for Bangladesh\" at the Oval cricket ground on September 18, 1971? Pete Townshend: I remember it very well, I can't actually remember the concert. I remember the event. Rod Stewart kicked out I think 500 footballs into the crowd, which caused absolute chaos because they kept bouncing around two or three hours, all the way through our show Fun with the Faces I remember getting very drunk. Because the Faces used to know how to have a good time. They were good fun and Ronnie Lane was my best friend (he was the bass player in the Faces) we hung out and had fun Drive home I tried to give (my manager Chris Stamp's) ex-wife a lift home and she started kicking off. She was in bad shape. I pushed her out of the car and she went through a shoe shop window and I thought she would be dead. So, I wasn't feeling particularly charitable ... Pushed out of a car while driving?  No, no. We stopped the car and then pushed her out. She staggered back and (then) went through a shoe shop window On not mentioning the Oval concert in memoirs Roger's actually strange, why would he not mention that? I don't suppose I mentioned it either. I suppose it's because in a sense if you mention something like that you feel like you're bragging. I know that we did lots of amazing charitable breakthroughs On charity gigs Double O, my charity, was started by The Who (in 1976) to help Erin Pizzey start the Women's refuge system. She ran the first women's refuge in the world in Chiswick in the UK, and subsequently other charities. Double O went on to be a charity that became well known for helping people with drug problems, putting them through rehab and so on. And more recently, the teen cancer (Teenage Cancer Trust) stuff that we do, so we've always done that stuff On the Oval concert and growing up in 'a really mixed place' The thing about Bangladesh was ... These were our people. People that don't know about London, people that think, oh well its's just a big conurbation full of all different kinds of people. In West London, we grew up in a really mixed race place. Polish, Japanese, lots of Jewish people, mainly from Poland, but also from Russia. People from Somalia, I think we brought in ten thousand Somalians after the War (WWII). So, these were kids of our age from the Caribbean (and Bangladesh). The Bangladeshis tended to work very hard, so we respected them. We adored them and you know we wanted to help. It was a terrible tragedy (flood wasn't it, I think it was). We were honoured to be able to help and... I feel the same way now. I know the difference between somebody from India and somebody from Bangladesh. (pause) And, also somebody from Pakistan.

Due to their habitat being destroyed, hunting, and other problems such as viruses, they have a population that is very low. As a result of this they are struggling to survive out there in the wild.\" Wildlife and Biodiversity Conservation Officer of Dinajpur Forest Division, Smriti Singha Ray, said: \"Barn owls are not considered as endangered in this country as it is commonly found.\" \"So when we received the call to rescue the owl, we suggested the college authority to contact DLS for medical attention, and set it free afterwards.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-01 00:00:00      \nDB's North, East and West divisions conducted separate drives in different parts of Dhaka and arrested them The Detective Branch (DB) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) has detained several people allegedly involved in identity theft, drug possession and attempted robbery, during separate drives in Dhaka. Police seized equipments used for production of fake Indian currency worth Tk1 crore from Jatrabari's Matuail area around 6pm Wednesday, said Abdul Baten, DB's Additional Commissioner,  at a press briefing on Thursday. \"Acting on a tip-off, a team of DB [North division] conducted a drive and busted a money counterfeiting factory,\" he said. \"Three people were also arrested, and we recovered fake Indian Rupees worth Tk26 lakh and other counterfeiting equipments from there.\" The three are Liakat Hossain alias Zakir, the ringleader, Shanta Akter and Momtaz Begum.   Baten said Liakat has connections with a similar ring based in India and traders in Chapainawabganj.  \"Liakat and his gang were planning to use the fake currency to purchase cattle ahead of the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha,\" the DMP additional commissioner said.   With Eid just a few days away, a certain syndicate is planning to release the counterfeit banknotes in shopping malls and cattle markets, Baten added. In another drive in Jatrabari area, police arrested six people- Bojlu Hossain, Afsar Hossain Babu, Nurul Afsar, Md Harun, Al-Amin and Monju Mia- for possessing arms and drugs. They had 3 arms, 10 rounds of bullets, one microbus and 2,100 pieces of yaba in their possession.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-01-08 00:00:00      \nIn the last general election held on December 30, a total of 881,619 non-EVM votes were declared invalid by the returning officers of 299 constituencies Experts are saying Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) can prevent invalid or spoilt votes during any polls in Bangladesh. The 11th parliament polls on December 30, which witnessed highest number of invalid votes ever recorded, is also a testimony that EVMs are fullproof as far as  rate of spoilt ballot papers or invalid votes is concerned.   In the election held on December 30 last year, a total of 881,619 votes were declared invalid by the returning officers of 299 constituencies.  Invalid votes have been seen in almost all constituencies (except Rangpur 6) where votes were cast manually, i.e. by stamping a seal on the ballot paper. But all the votes were declared valid in the following constituencies, where electronic voting machines (EVMs) were used: Dhaka 6 and 13, Chittagong 9, Rangpur 3, Khulna 2 and Satkhira 2. Muhammed Sohul Hussain and Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Sakhawat Hussain, who served the ATM Shamsul Huda-led Election Commission as election commissioners from 2007 to 2012, had suggested the use of EVMs to prevent invalid or spoilt votes. While talking to the Dhaka Tribune over the phone, Sohul Hussain said \"Hopefully Bangladesh will adopt EVMs for the whole electoral process in future.\" \"We introduced EVMs during our tenure. People will realize no vote-rigging can be done using these voting machines; rather votes are easily and safely cast. There will be no misconception in this regard,\" the former election commissioner added. While talking about how votes are counted as spoilt, he explained: \"Votes can become invalid on the off-chance that the voter did not intend to vote for that specific symbol. Sometimes, they might unfortunately stamp seals onto the wrong symbol during the manual ballot paper process. They then stamp the seal again on their favoured symbol. In these cases, ballot papers are announced invalid due to the double seal. \"But in EVMs, just pressing a button, the valuable vote is cast and then locked to count as a valid vote. People can easily go through this process. Furthermore, there is no chance to count any vote as invalid in EVMs,\" he further added. Former election commissioner Brig Gen (retd) Muhammad Sakhawat Hussain told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Allegations of vote-rigging, like in the recently held 11th parliamentary election, would be reduced if EVMs are installed in all constituencies.\" He said: \"There is no issue of counting invalid votes in EVMs. I think the time has come to think about overall issues regarding this. Are we going to take votes by EVMs or not?\" \"As you are saying, the number of invalid votes in this election is not a small number. EVMs will be beneficial in the future, where everyone can cast their votes and no vote will be considered as invalid,\" the former election commissioner added. \"Regarding other allegations, I think party people seizing the election booths should be prevented,\" he said. In 2014's 10th parliamentary polls, the invalid vote count was 263,037; 636,294 in the 9th; 449,082 in the 8th; 462,302 in the 7th; and 373,322 in the 5th."

Short supply, bad weather conditions and increasing demand were the reasons of the price hike, traders claimed. While visiting different kitchen markets in the capital on Wednesday, Dhaka Tribune found per dozen of egg was selling at Tk115 to Tk125 which was Tk105 to Tk110 last week. Shohel Rahman, a resident of Farmgate, while speaking to Dhaka Tribune, said: \"I bought a dozen of egg for Tk105 last week, but I paid Tk125 today for a dozen from the same shop.\" \"As there is no one to monitor this price hike, shopkeepers are charging prices as they want,\" he added.  Md Jahir, a trader at Hatirpool Kitchen market area, said: \"I sold per dozen eggs at Tk125 which I sold for TkTk110 a week earlier. \"There is a high demand in the market for eggs, compared to a supply shortage and for that we also had to buy eggs at higher prices than before.\"  The prices per 100 pieces of eggs increased by Tk30 at the wholesale markets. At the wholesale outlets in Karwanbazar, per 100 pieces of brown eggs were selling at Tk890, white eggs at Tk870, local chicken eggs at Tk1,300, Pakistani chicken eggs at Tk1,100 and duck eggs between Tk1,050-Tk1,100.   Abdul Bachir Mona, an egg wholesaler at Karwan Bazar, said: \"Because of adverse weather, there are half of the total supplies of eggs available in the markets now. \"Besides, increasing cost of meat and fish has created an extra demand for eggs which is another reason for the price hike.\" Another wholesaler Iman Ali, said: \"The production of eggs have also decreased, as chickens fell sick or laid fewer eggs. \" However, egg traders also claimed that the hot and humid weather were another reason for which eggs were rotting and to make the cost balance they had to sell eggs at a higher price.  Syed Abu Siddiqui, president of Bangladesh Poultry Industries Association, said: \"Because of the flood, many poultry farms have been damaged.  \"Chicks production have decreased and overall poultry production cost has gone up as feed prices also went up. \" He further said: \"Due to the high cost of production, farm owners were unable to cope up with the demands in the market.\" \"Until the situation becomes normal, egg prices will remain unchanged in the markets,\" he added.

The approval came at an Ecnec meeting, with its chairperson and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair, held at the NEC Conference Room in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area on Tuesday. While briefing reporters after the meeting, Planning Minister MA Mannan said a total of 6 projects involving an overall estimated cost of Taka 4,447.76 crore were approved, reports BSS. \"Of the total project cost, Tk4,439.86 crore will come from the state exchequer while the rest of Tk7.90 crore will come from the organization's own fund,\" he said. Of the approved six projects, five are new while the other is a revised project. The minister said the Nuclear Security and Physical Protection System Cell and Bangladesh Army, Army Headquarters, GS Section (coordination) will implement the project by March 2023. The main project objectives include ensuring security to the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant through implementing the physical protection system side by side, creating a supporting environment for generating safe and protected nuclear power. It also aims to face the risks generating from Design Basis Threat (DBT) or outside of DBT for the nuclear power plant. The planning minister said concerned experts from Bangladesh Army in cooperation with the experts from Russian Federation would implement the project. A bilateral protocol between Bangladesh and the Russian Federation was signed on September 17 last year and in light of that agreement, the project has been undertaken. According to the Planning Commission, establishing nuclear security infrastructures is indispensable for implementing any nuclear power plant project and it is also separate from the construction work of nuclear power plant. Besides, establishing an effective national nuclear security infrastructure is also very much important as a precondition for setting up a nuclear power plant. The main project operations include some 300 acres of land acquisition, 1214678 cubic meter of land development, public works for security and physical protection system."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-04 00:00:00      \nRPI students bring forth various allegations against the ruling party student wing An assault on the Rajshahi Polytechnic Institute (RPI) principal has apparently opened up the Pandora's Box for the leaders and activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League's RPI unit. Amidst protests by teachers and students, a \"torture cell\" reportedly used by Chhatra League has been found on RPI campus by an investigation committee. Allegations have also arisen that the leaders and activist of the ruling party student wing have established a reign of terror on campus through various criminal activists and misdeeds. Leaders and activists of Chhatra League's RPI unit beat dissenters in that torture cell on many occasions, several teachers and students on Sunday told the probe team formed by the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE). The three-member probe team on Sunday recovered metal rods and pipes from Room No 1119 of a building on campus during its visit. Torture instruments found inside the torture cell of Rajhsahi Polytechnic | Dhaka Tribune The building is situated on the west side of the pond into which Principal Farid Uddin Ahmed was thrown by some Chhatra League leaders and activists on Saturday. The recovered metal rods and pipes were later handed over to the police. Top leaders of Chhatra League's RPI unit and Rajshahi metropolitan unit were unavailable for comments regarding the torture cell until the filing of this report at midnight. DTE Director and probe team Convener SM Ferdous Alam said they would submit their findings within three days. He declined going into the details regarding the torture cell, but said: \"All of our findings will be in our probe report.\" Principal Farid said he also heard about the torture cell of Chhatra League. \"But no student or teacher ever lodged any formal complaint out of fear.\" The room in Rajshahi Polytechnic where the torture cell is situated | Dhaka Tribune Allegations Many have also accused Chhatra league leaders and activists of extorting students, threatening and assaulting teachers, publicly humiliating female students who rejected their advances, and sitting for exams without attending classes, among other misdeeds. The allegations were made during a demonstration of RPI students, teachers and staff on Sunday. They formed a human chain in front of RPI around 11am on Rajshahi-Naogaon Highway, placing a number of demands to the institute authorities. The demands include permanent expulsion of those involved in the assault on the principal, bringing them to book, ban on politics on campus, ban on outsiders' entry in RPI, ensuring safety of general students and suitable environment for education. Agitated students also tore down many banners of Chhatra League leaders and activists inside the campus during their hour-long demonstration. However, Chhatra League's RPI unit President Mehedi Hasan Regan rejected the allegations levelled against them, including embezzlement of money taken from around 4,000 students -- Tk300 each -- for a freshers' reception that was never organized. He claimed that the teachers and students were lying. \"We didn't embezzle that money. The department heads have the money meant for the freshers' reception,\" he claimed. Regan said he was not on campus when Principal Farid was assaulted. \"We saw in the CCTV camera footage [of the assault] that Chhatra League's [RPI unit] Joint General Secretary Kamal Hossain Sourav was present there only. \"No one else from Chhatra League was there. We are looking into this too and will take organizational action against anyone involved in this,\" he claimed further. Requesting anonymity, many students alleged that Regan and Sourav are very close and they have established a reign of terror on campus by getting involved in different criminal activists. But everyone has been afraid to raise their voice against them, until now. Chhatra League's central committee in Dhaka on Sunday also expelled Sourav from the organization over the assault on the principal and violation of organizational discipline. The organization's Rajshahi metropolitan unit President Rocky Kumar Ghosh also said that they formed a six-member committee to look into the incident. \"Organizational action will be taken against anyone involved.\" Case and arrests Principal Farid on Saturday night had filed a case at Chandrima police station, naming eight people and accusing at least 50 unidentified others over the assault. Rajshahi Metropolitan Police Additional Deputy Commissioner Golam Ruhul Kuddus said five RPI students were arrested and sent to court on Sunday for their involvement in the incident. They are Shafi Shahriar, 24, Sohel Rana, 20, Badhon Ray, 19, Ariful Islam, 23, and Ripon Ali, 20. However, police are yet to arrest the Chhatra League men who were named in the case. From the CCTV camera footage, RPI teachers had identified Sourav, Murad, Shanto, Bony, Hasibul Islam, Salman Tony, Habibul and Maruf. Of them, only Sourav and Murad are current students. All of them have gone into hiding, said ADC Kuddus. \"But our detectives are on the case. No one will be spared. We are working to bring all of them to book.\""

A special flight of Biman Bangladesh Airlines will depart Dhaka's Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport for Brunei on Sunday, carrying the premier and her entourage members, reports BSS. The flight is scheduled to land at Brunei International Airport in Bandar Seri Begawan, the Brunei capital, at 2:45pm, where Crown Prince of Brunei Darussalam Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah is expected to receive her. After the official welcoming function, a ceremonial motorcade will escort the prime minister to Empire Hotel and Country Club, where she will be staying during her visit. On the first day of the visit, Sheikh Hasina will join a community reception to be hosted in her honour by the expatriate Bangladeshis in Brunei at Indera Samudera Ballroom of Empire Hotel and Country Club. The prime minister will attend a dinner to be hosted by the high commissioner of Bangladesh to Brunei the same day. On Monday morning, Sheikh Hasina will have a general audience with Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah and Royal family at Cheradi Laila Kenchana at the Istana Nurul Iman, the official residence of the Sultan. The prime minister will then hold bilateral talks with the Sultan at Baitul Mesyuarah in Istana Nurul Iman. The talks will be followed by the signing ceremony of a memorandum of understanding (MoU). On Monday afternoon, the prime minister will join a meeting between Bangladesh Business Community, Brunei Business Community, and Brunei National Chamber of Commerce and Industry at the Empire Hotel and Country Club. She will then visit Jame Asr Mosque and offer Asr prayers there. Later, Sheikh Hasina will attend official banquet to be hosted in her honour by the Sultan at Istana Nurul Iman.  On Tuesday morning, the prime minister will lay the foundation stone of the new Chancery Building of Bangladesh High Commission at the Diplomatic Enclave at Jalan Kebangsaan in the Brunei capital. Later, she will visit the Royal Regalia Museum. The premier is schedule to depart Brunei for Dhaka at 5pm on Tuesday, and is expected to land at the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in the evening. During the visit, Bangladesh is likely to sign seven MoUs with Brunei in various sectors. At a news briefing at the Foreign Ministry on Thursday, Foreign Minister Dr AK Abdul Momen said: \"We have already finalized six MoUs in various sectors, with one still under consideration.\"  The six MoUs that have been finalized are: assistance in using science and technology in agriculture; liaison in the field of arts and culture; cooperation in sports and youth related activities; cooperation in the field of fisheries; assistance in the field of livestock; and cooperation in the field of fuel and energy. Apart from boosting relations between the two countries, the foreign minister hoped that the visit will be successful in increasing bilateral trade relations. He added: \"We do believe that the prime minister's visit will further strengthen the bilateral relations as well as cooperation on energy, trade, investment, agriculture, food, air connectivity, human resource development, tourism, and technology between the two countries. \"Brunei has already expressed keen interest to invest in different sectors in Bangladesh, especially agriculture and energy fields.\" Minister Momen said Brunei is an important partner of Bangladesh in the international arena as the country is a member of both the OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) and ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). The minister mentioned a discussion to be held on Rohingya repatriation, and said: \"Wherever we are going, we are raising the Rohingya repatriation issue with utmost importance. Hence it will also get priority during the Brunei visit.\""

Not only the junior minister, but Senior Secretary Md Shah Kamal of the ministry was also late by an hour to the event titled \"Enhancing Earthquake Resilience: MoU Signing Cemermony\" held at Department of Disaster Management (DDM) in Mohakhali yesterday. The event was scheduled for 11am yesterday and was expected to end at 1:30pm. But it started after 2pm. Shockingly, Swedish Ambassador to Dhaka, Charlotta Schlyter, left the event after waiting for the state minister for about two hours. Among other dignitaries, DFID-Bangladesh Head Jane Edmondson, UNDP Bangladesh Resident Representative Sudipto Mukerjee, and DDM Director General Shahadat Hossain were present at the event. The mayors of Tangail, Sunamganj, and Rangamati municipalities, and Mostafizur Rahman, on behalf of Rangpur city mayor, also attended the program along with a number of high ranking government officials, to face the schedule debacle. When contacted, Selim Hossen, public relations officer of the ministry, said: \"There was an urgent program for the state minister at Savar [in the morning] which is why he was late.\" MoU for earthquake preparedness Considering the vulnerability to earthquakes in Rangpur, Tangail, Sunamganj, and Rangamati, the DDM part of the National Resilience Program (NRP) signed memorandums of understanding (MoU) at Dhaka's DDM office yesterday. The Project Director of the NRP:DDM part and the mayors of Rangpur City Corporation and Tangail, Sunamganj, and Rangamati municipalities signed four separate MoUs on behalf of their respective agencies. Under the MoUs, the municipalities will work closely with project representatives in revisiting existing assessments and conducting vulnerability assessments to identify the major hazards and risks as well as appropriate options for building capacities of the institutions, including all Disaster Management Committees (DMCs), volunteers and the at-risk communities. State Minister Md Enamur Rahman said: \"A gap remains in developing structural responses to earthquakes. Bangladesh can learn a lot from Japan and becoming zero earthquake loss is our goal.\" UNDP Bangladesh Resident Representative Sudipto Mukerjee said: \"The destructive and deadly hazards associated with earthquakes pose a real and serious threat to the lives of people, property damage, economic growth, and development of the country. The earthquake risk for Bangladesh is doubly high when one considers its rapid urbanization.\" National Resilience Program is a unique collaboration among the Bangladesh Government and UNDP, UN Women and United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) that provides strategic support to develop national capacity to keep pace with the changing nature of disasters."

His bail petition was denied by the court.  A human rights defender, a poet and a lawyer have been arrested in Bangladesh under draconian laws that punish speech with heavy fines.

Pakshi Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Md Mizanur Rahman, who formed the probe committee, confirmed the matter to Dhaka Tribune on Saturday. Md Abdullah Al Mamun, divisional traffic officer (DTO) of Pakshi Western Rail Division, is leading the prove committee to investigate the accident. Three other probe committees formed by the Ministry of Railways, Sirajganj district administration, and Rajshahi Western Rail Division have already begun their investigation. DTO Md Abdullah Al Mamun on Friday, said the accident was caused by a problem on the railway tracks, as found during their primary investigation. DRM Md Mizanur Rahman in a press briefing on Saturday said, the signal system had no problem as it was controlled by CBI (Computer Based Interlocked) system developed by European engineers.  Rajshahi unit Chief Engineer Al Fattah Md Masudur of Western Rail Division said all the rail tracks were accessible 30 hours after the accident. On a visit to the Ullapara Railway Station this correspondent found workers busy fixing the rail track 1 yesterday. Ullapara Railway Station's Assistant Station Master Rafiqul Islam said: \"It will likely take about another week to fully renovate the rail tracks. Train schedule still continues to suffer.\" On Thursday, the engine and seven bogies of Rangpur Express derailed after the train, bound for Rangpur, left the Ullapara rail station. The engine along with four bogies also caught fire. Around 25 people were injured in the incident. After the accident, rail links between Dhaka, and the northern districts remained cut off for nearly seven hours, collapsing the schedule of trains in that route."

However, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared Chilmari as a river port during her official visit to Kurigram on September 7, 2016 Although three years have elapsed since the formal inauguration of Chilmari River Port in Kurigram, it is yet to see any activities, causing frustration to local people. Sources said a Shipping Protocol Treaty was signed between the governments of India and Bangladesh in 1972 to transport goods through rivers. During the British period, one could travel through rivers from Kolkata to Guwahati as far as Dhubri in Assam. As the river route has not been developed for years of mismanagement, this river port remained inoperative. However, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared Chilmari as a river port during her official visit to Kurigram on September 7, 2016. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) set up a pontoon at Ramna Shallowghat, Chilmari on September 23, 2017, which was inaugurated by then Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan. Besides, a project was taken to develop the river port. However, the Zilla Parishad does not want to hand over the responsibility of managing the ghats of this river port. The port was given out on lease without informing the BIWTA, resulting in a conflict between the two parties. When the conflict intensified and the matter went to the court, then Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan visited the river port in June, 2018 and assured all concerned of solving the problem. But neither the problem was solved or the river port became operational, alleged locals. According to sources at the Shipping Ministry, once Chilmari was a traditional business hub. The area was recognised as 'Chilmari River Port' from the early days when big ships carrying thousands of maunds of jute, paddy, rice and other goods started moving along this river port. During the British period, big warehouses of jute, mustard, paddy, peanuts and maize were set up at Chilmari around the river port. Renowned jute companies in the country came to Chilmari and established their offices to procure jute. Besides, businessmen and traders of various areas came and stayed at Chilmari day after day to buy goods. The commercial activities based on Chilmari came to a halt due to river erosion and navigability crisis. The present government has taken up the project to improve navigability by dredging rivers. This river port is the only route to establish regional connectivity among India, Bhutan and Nepal from the Payra Sea Port. If the river port can be developed, the entire Kurigram region as well as the national economy will see a good growth. \"We can't see any ray of hope as the river port is not being operational. So, we demand this river port be made operational as soon as possible,\" said Shahidul."

He said this after meeting with top officials of the division, the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), and the transport owners' association's leaders on ensuring a safe, comfortable, and hassle-free journey for homebound people, on Thursday. However, vehicles carrying daily essentials and medicines will not fall under the purview of the instructions, he added.  The secretary said the condition of the roads is better than in previous years, and the authorities concerned will take immediate steps to resolve any issues that might arise.  \"The public will not suffer on the roads [during the Eid holidays], this year,\" Nazrul said.  Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC), and the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges, will operate control rooms that will work round-the-clock with the BRTA to ease the movement of the holidaymakers.  BTRC will also operate a special bus service. Mobile courts will remain active at all times, and will conduct drives to check on ticket prices and unfit vehicles.  Public transport owners have also been asked to remain alert, Nazrul said. Law enforcement will ensure that no makeshift markets are set up on highways, and no buses are parked arbitrarily. The government has asked garment factory owners to provide Eid workers their holidays in phases, to avoid an extra rush prior to Eid day, the secretary added."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-22 00:00:00      \nCustomers claimed the price hike was because of syndication, but the port traders denied the claim  The prices of Indian onion have doubled in the country in two weeks. Satkhira's Bhomra Land port traders have blamed the Indian online automation system, and lifting of incentives by the Indian government for the price hike. Sakhawatullah, a resident of Satkhira city, said: \"Even two week back per kg of onion was Tk20 to Tk25, which is now being sold at Tk35 to Tk40 per kg.\" Customers claimed the price hike was because of syndication, but the port traders denied the claim and said, the demand of onions in Indian local markets had increased, and at the same time imports to Bangladesh had decreased in comparison to the demand. A trader at the land port, Amir Hamza, confirming the matter said: \"Indian government previously gave 10% incentives to us traders to import more onions, which was lifted in June after the demand increased in the Indian markets.\" \"We have to buy per kg onion at Tk22 now, which we bought at Tk16 last month,\" he said.  Amir also blamed the new automation system at the Indian border, which lacked efficient workforce, therefore, was delaying the import process.  According to Bhomra Customs assistant commissioner's office, Bhomra Land port is the biggest channel for onion imports in the country. In April 48,000MT of onion were imported from this channel, in May, it was 26,000MT and in June it was only 8,617MT. Bhomra Land Port Export-Import Association Vice President Ferdous Alfa, said: \"Due to the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha, the  demand for onion in the country have increased a little, but the main reason of the price hike is due to onion fields going under water because of flood in India's Nasik.  \"Also, due to the automation system, trucks carrying perishable goods are not being allowed to pass before other goods laden trucks.\"   Bhomra C&F Association President Arafat Hossain said: \"Imports are getting delayed everyday due to online server problems, and less number of scales at the border, which must be fixed, if not, both countries will lose huge revenues, and the prices of onion will go beyond the customers' purchasing power.\" Assistant Revenue Official at the land port, Bikash Chandra Debnath, said: \"There were multiple reasons which caused the price hike, but it will soon be fixed, I hope.\""

The three restaurants were Bailey Bar B Q, Dhaka Biriyani, and Rooster Cafe. The quasi-judicial government department also fined Vaggokul Sweets for unclean and expired food items, and S Baker for not labeling their packaged products.  Bailey Bar B Q, Vaggokul Sweets, and S Baker, were fined Tk 50,000 each, while Dhaka Biriyani was fined Tk 30,000 and Rooster Cafe, Tk 20,000. Md Adbul Jabbar Mondol, assistant director of the Directorate of National Consumers' Right Protection, said if they continue to run their businesses in this way, the authorities concerned would cancel their trade licenses.    \"We are keeping them under pressure. If there is any lapse, our team will visit and take necessary action,\" he said.    The Directorate of National Consumers' Rights Protection team also identified expired tomato sauces and other condiments at Vaggokul Sweets. The popular store did not put any price tags for the sweets they were selling. It also stored some sweets in a very unclean bucket.  The staff and employees of Bailey Bar B Q kitchen were working in an unhygienic and congested atmosphere. The authorities found grilled chicken and kebabs being kept overnight on the kitchen countertop.  Dhaka Biriyani stored almost rotten vegetables and stale dough at their restaurant.  The National Consumers' Right Protection team raided BFC and Chittagong General Store in the Bailey Road neighbourhood and found their services and products to be satisfactory.  Sabiha Zaman Shobha, a customer who heading towards BFC, said the average consumer is frustrated with these restaurants and their services, and demanded exemplary punishment against restaurant owners responsible for not living up to maintaining standard operating procedures."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-02 00:00:00      \nThe lower intensity of conflict in Syria and Iraq has contributed to this decrease, observes PEC The Press Emblem Campaign (PEC) noted with satisfaction a decrease in the number of journalists killed so far in the year compared with the same period last year.  On the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, the PEC noted a 56% decrease registering 20 victims in 12 countries from January 1 to April 30 against 46 during the same period last year, using the same metrics. The figure is the lowest figure since 2006.  PEC Secretary-General Blaise Lempen observed the lower intensity of conflict in Syria and Iraq contributed to this decrease. In addition, the continuous engagement of governments, associations and civil society in favor of the issue of the safety of journalists has certainly produced positive effects. It is also true that other means are used to neutralize journalists. The situation remains steadily hostile in Mexico with six journalists killed and Afghanistan with four killed, which adds up to half the victims since the beginning of 2019.  One journalist was killed in the following countries: Ghana, Honduras, India, Iraq, Northern Ireland, Kenya, Libya, Pakistan, the Philippines and Yemen. The PEC strongly condemns the killings and calls for quick identification of the killers and bringing them to justice."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-02 00:00:00      \nFollowing approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), Dhaka Wasa had initiated two projects to tackle the issue and improve the water logging situation The water logging situation in the capital has not changed over the years, even after promises from Dhaka Wasa about implementing a master-plan and commitment of the government to find a solution to this problem. People of the city were reminded of the unfulfilled pledges yesterday, after a downpour left numerous areas waterlogged and led to major gridlock on the streets until well after evening. Following approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), Dhaka Wasa had initiated two projects to tackle the issue and improve the water logging situation. But their progress is very slow to make any significant headway. On June 28, 2018, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, then LGRD minister, had blamed development projects around the city for its water logging problem. He had also expressed hope that the problem would end by 2019 -- which has not happened. As a result, the perennial waterlogging scenario in Dhaka is still unchanged. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) recorded 46mm rainfall in the city between 12pm and 6pm yesterday. Just within half-an-hour of thundershowers a little after 12pm, citizens were seen posting on social media videos of waterlogging in a number of areas. Dhaka Tribune correspondents during visits also found many streets and areas inundated. The areas that suffered most include Mirpur's Rokeya Sarani and Kazipara, Jahangir Gate, Green Road, parts of Indira Road, Tejgaon, Panthapath, Shukrabad, Kalabagan, Dhanmondi, Jhigatala, Shankar, Jatrabari, Bashundhara Residential Area, Motijheel, Gulistan, Paltan, Bijoynagar, Fakirapool, Karwan Bazar, Arambagh, some areas in Mohakhali and Gulshan, and many places of Old Dhaka. Talking to Dhaka Tribune, many said waterlogging was still occurring as the drains that are supposed to take the rainwater out are clogged with garbage. At the same time, heavy gridlock on major roads, which were inundated, made it extremely difficult for city dwellers to commute. Sufferings Many people were seen wading through the water to reach their destinations. Sarjin Sharif, a resident of Shankar area, told Dhaka Tribune: \"The road in front of my house is completely submerged. \"I need to go to work, but I cannot even get out of the house to find a vehicle.\" Dhanmondi's Road No 27 also went under knee-deep water very quickly, leaving many including students suffering amid heavy rain. Nafisa Nazmul, a former student of Brac University, said: \"I cannot find transport to go to Panthapath from Mirpur 10. The roads are completely underwater.\" East Jurain resident Awenim Rahman also told Dhaka Tribune that the main streets in his area were fine, as they were rebuilt and their heights increased recently. \"But the branch lanes, which are still low-lying, are completely inundated.\" He said he also faced horrible traffic jam on his way to the office later in the afternoon. \"I found all the roads leading from Gulistan to Paltan, Shahbagh, Kakrail, Dainik Bangla, and Farmgate via Banglamotor and Karwan Bazar absolutely gridlocked,\" Awenim said expressing frustration. Independent University Bangladesh faculty member Kazi Mubinul Hasan said: \"I live in the Bashundhara Residential area. On a usual day, it takes me less than an hour to reach Shukrabad. But today [Tuesday], it took me nearly two hours.\" Nilkhet and New Market areas, Elephant Road and Mirpur Road also saw major gridlock after the rain stopped a little after 3pm. The rain even left the roads leading from the main entrances to archways in the Bangladesh Secretariat, adjacent to Zero Point in Gulistan, under knee-deep water for at least three hours. Officers and outsiders both suffered while going from one building to another. Many were even seen entering the offices barefoot. Those turning up at the secretariat without cars were among the worst sufferers. Many said the secretariat had seen a similar problem on Sunday. More rains incoming BMD Meteorologist AKM Ruhul Quddus told Dhaka Tribune that they recorded 45.3mm of rainfall in the capital between noon and 3pm yesterday. Between 12pm and 6pm, a total of 46mm rainfall was recorded. Meanwhile, BMD also recorded the highest rainfall in Sylhet - 120mm. According to a Met Office weather bulletin, light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind over the country was likely again in the next 24 hours as of 9am today. \"There is a chance of light rain on Wednesday in Dhaka, Khulna and Chittagong regions, and in the rest of the country it will rainless,\" said Ruhul. The bulletin added that light to moderate rain or thundershowers accompanied by temporary gusty wind is likely to occur at most places in Dhaka, Mymensingh, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions, many places in Khulna and Barisal divisions, and a few places in Rangpur and Rajshahi divisions during the time. Moreover, it said, some places in Barisal, Chittagong, Mymensingh and Sylhet divisions may see moderately heavy to very heavy falls until this morning. Slow progress of master-plan Aiming to fix the perennial problem, the Ecnec last year had approved two projects -- \"Expansion of Drainage Networks and Development of Canals Project in Dhaka City\" and \"Land acquisition, excavation and re-excavation of Hazaribagh, Baishteki, Kurmitola, Manda and Begunbari canals.\" But both, being implemented by Dhaka Wasa are advancing at a snail's pace. One of the projects has registered only 8.25% progress in the past one year, while the other just 1.5% over the span of 14 months. Regarding the extremely sluggish progress, urban development expert Prof Nazrul Islam said such projects, after being passed, advance slowly due to many issues. \"But in course of time, their progress gained pace. But these two projects seem to be progressing very slowly. Only the authorities implementing them can explain why,\" he said. Dhaka Wasa Managing Director Taqsem A Khan was unavailable for comment over phone. However, engineer Nuruzzaman, former member of Dhaka Wasa Board, told Dhaka Tribune: \"Wasa is trying to solve the waterlogging issue by implementing some projects. It is visible that once areas used to remain waterlogged for five to six hours, but this year the water cleared from roads in two to three hours. It is a significant improvement.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2019-03-31 00:00:00      \nA necessity for the vulnerable sector    Bangladesh is recognized as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change because of its geographical location and socio-demographic features. Agriculture is the most significant economic sector in Bangladesh. Despite Bangladesh's remarkable achievement in improving agricultural productivity, the sector is facing risk from climate change, extreme weather events, and sea level rise to address the adverse impact of climate change on agriculture. Climate change is expected to decrease Bangladesh's agriculture GDP by 3.1 % each year (World Bank). For example, the damage from climate change effect in 2007 and 2009 cyclones were estimated at around 2 million metric tons of rice, which is enough to feed 10 million people.  Transforming the agricultural sector and building resilience will not be possible if there is no significant amount of capital available for climate-smart investments in agriculture. Moreover, robust financial investments are needed to support the global food system. Climate finance plays a pivotal role by supporting developing countries to reduce emissions, decarbonize their economies. Climate finance in agricultural sector innovates ways to use climate finance to improve and increases access to finance for smallholder farmers in the agricultural sector while delivering positive outcomes namely increased resilience and reduced emissions intensity. The smallholder farmers are the most vulnerable vast majority of farmers who have little or no capacity to adapt, lack a safety net, and are highly exposed threat in their livelihood and food security risks. Bangladesh is among the largest recipients of climate funds from International Finance Corporation, World Bank mostly for adaptation in the agricultural sector. Climate finance budget allocation for the Ministry of Agriculture in 2018-19 is Tk13,915 crore where climate-relevant allocation is 39 percent (Finance Division, Ministry of Finance). Adaptations to climate change for agricultural sectors include: resilient variety crops, new and diverse cropping pattern, irrigation techniques, sustainable land management, early warning systems, new research. In this case, climate finance acts as a remedy as it helps to adopt many strategies to cope with the existing situations and those expected to impact the country in the future. Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) mainly focuses on the promotion of agricultural practises focusing on floating gardens, community-based adaptation, advocacy for climate change adaptation measures, coastline and flood defences. Bangladeshi agricultural scientists have encouraged adopting new technologies and developing climate-smart crop varieties, as a means to diversify the agrarian practices of subsistence farmers. Due to the fund, many farmers are reporting experiencing increasing bumper yields. Thus through the use of new practices and new technologies climate change finance has, for now, improved the situation for some farmers.   CourtesyExamples of adaptation for the agriculture sector Floating Gardens are a process used in many regions during the monsoon season, ingenious farmers create their floating seedbeds and grow plants on floating gardens. Hydroponics system in Bangladesh, based on floating gardens, was recognized in December 2014 by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) for innovation, sustainability, and adaptability. Farmers in some parts of the country where flood waters can remain for a prolonged period have developed floating gardens in which plants can grow on the water on floating organic beds of water hyacinth, algae and other plant residues. This environmentally friendly traditional cultivation technique utilizes the natural resources of wetlands to grow vegetables and other crops almost all year round, providing numerous social, economic, agricultural, and ecological benefits to the local population. It helps the farmers to cope with the situation. Sunflower oil production is recently introduced as a quality-based oilseed crop and is gaining popularity among local farmers because of its easy extraction method. Sunflower is categorised as a low to medium drought sensitive crop. The cultivation of sunflower may be suitable in the coastal environment because of its high yield and wide adaptability. In 16 districts of Bangladesh, sunflower oil is being harvested, and the average production is about 1.2t/ha, which is relatively encouraging. Shrimp farming is a relatively new form of agriculture introduced in Bangladesh on a commercial scale. Shrimp can cultivation is possible in both brackish and freshwater. Currently, shrimp fish cultivation is widespread throughout the coastal region and Bangladesh produces more than 2.5 % of the global production of shrimp and has become the seventh largest exporter of shrimp to the Japanese and USA markets. Rainwater harvesting is a method of inducing, collecting, storing, and conserving local surface runoff for agricultural production. Farmers in water-scarce areas face difficulties in agricultural output due to unavailability of water at the right time and in the right amount. It is expected that the use of rainwater will save farmers' money as well as increase production. Rainwater harvesting can be effectively used by farmers to overcome the hardships of nature. The method of rainwater harvesting for agriculture is standard as a result of the irregular nature of rain in many countries and is widely practised in areas where there is an irregularity in seasonal rains. Rainwater harvesting technology help store water in the rainy seasons, for usage, during the drought period. Agriculture is the most vulnerable sector as its productivity depends on climatic factors like temperature, rainfall, light intensity, radiation and sunshine duration, which are predicted to become increasingly erratic. The number of climate change induced disasters has and will continue to increase over the coming years. Therefore, climate finance mechanisms have the potential to continue to strengthen the links between financial institutions and smallholder farmers by addressing some of the critical financial-sector constraints on agriculture.

Bangladesh have achieved their first ever win against India in T20 format on Sunday when they defeat the hosts by seven wickets at Delhi. Now, Tigers have the golden chance to seal the three-match series as India are on a backfoot with a relatively inexperienced bowling attack. Weather is a big concern for the match due to effect of cyclone 'Maha'. According to Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Cyclone Maha, which is expected to hit the Gujarat coast today, has weakened into a severe storm on Wednesday. But still the storm is likely to bring \"heavy rains\" during the next 48 hours in Gujrat state. The weather, however, was clear on Wednesday morning as Bangladesh team practiced in their scheduled time at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium. Tigers started their training with warm-up session in morning and after an intense fielding practice session the batsmen went to nets adjacent to the stadium. India had an optional practice session on Wednesday in the afternoon session. Like their counterparts, they enjoyed the condition which was hot and humid all the day until evening. But, before the sunset the first sign of rain was seen as the dark cloud started to gather during. And around 7pm local time a light thunderstorm hit Rajkot with moderate wind. At the stadium area, pitch covers were blown away and suddenly all the flood lights were went off for few minutes. From the press box area of the Saurashtra Cricket Stadium, strong wind was felt during the raining period. After half an hour the rain, however, stopped.   The weather forecast was suggesting near 50 percent on precipitation on Wednesday evening while the forecast at Thursday evening is predicting near 15-20 percent of precipitation. However, in morning and noon session both teams were preparing for an exciting contest amid rain threat. The pitch in Delhi, where the first game took place, was a tricky one for the batsmen but pitches in Saurashtra Cricket Stadium generally offer good help to the batsmen. Both the captains are focusing on their own game plans rather than concerned about the weather too much. \"We will observe the wicket before the match and then decide about the playing eleven. The wicket looks good. We are expecting a good batting track with an average score of 170-180. Probably we will field the same eleven and don't break the inning combination but the final call will be taken before the toss,\" said Bangladesh captain Mahmudullah Riyad at the pre match press conference at Rajkot on Wednesday.  His counterpart Rohit Sharma was also expecting a run feast. \"The pitch looks good. Rajkot is always a good track to bat and it does offer some assistance to the bowlers also. I think it will better pitch than that of Delhi,\" said India captain Rohit  in the pre match media session. "

At least six people were killed - including a 17-year old high school student - after two nights of rioting in the capital as police clashed with protesters opposed to the re-election of President Joko Widodo. The violence has been fanned by claims from Widodo's rival Prabowo Subianto, a retired general, that the April 17 poll was a fraud. Indonesia's election commission on Tuesday confirmed Widodo had beaten Subianto, who has until Friday to challenge the results at the Constitutional Court. The 67-year-old has appealed for calm and said he would pursue legal channels, as he did, unsuccessfully, against Widodo in the 2014 election. Election officials and analysts discounted Subianto's claims of rampant cheating in the world's third-biggest democracy, after India and the United States. The government has partly blocked access to social media - including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram - in a bid to clamp down on fake news and hoaxes linked to the violence. At least six people are dead and hundreds injured as Indonesia continues to grapple with post-election riots. https://t.co/o6L14Mm4QT On Wednesday evening, the area around the election supervisory agency's office erupted in fresh skirmishes with thousands of protesters chanting and waving Indonesian flags. Some hurled stones, fireworks and molotov cocktails at riot police who lined up behind a razor wire barricade near the election supervisory agency building, where a police post was torched. Police pushed back the main group of rioters after firing tear gas and rubber bullets at the demonstrators.  An Australian Broadcasting Corporation news crew said it was attacked without warning by a mob. 'Provocateurs' Indonesia's capital been gripped by bigger demonstrations in the past, but the level of violence in this week's clashes has not been seen in years. Among the half-dozen people killed was a 17-year-old high school student and a 19-year-old, according to local media. Authorities said the victims died from gunshots or blunt force trauma, but denied that they fired live rounds on the crowds. It remained unclear who was responsible for their deaths. By Thursday morning, Jakarta's streets were relatively quiet as the police and military kept a close watch on buildings in the downtown core, including the election supervisory agency building - the centre of much of the violence - as well as parliament, embassies and the presidential palace amid fears of more unrest. Nearly 60,000 security personnel were deployed Thursday, nearly double the previous number, after Widodo vowed that he \"won't tolerate\" more riots. Authorities have blamed the violence on \"provocateurs\" that they claimed had come from outside Jakarta to stir up trouble. \"We've detained more than 300 suspects and are now interrogating them,\" said national police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo. Elsewhere, smaller election protests were held in Sumatra's Medan city and in Pontianak on Borneo island, where over 500 demonstrators armed with stones and firecrackers blocked roads, damaged vehicles and set two police posts alight, local police said."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-26 00:00:00      \nWhat makes it different from the last DNCC polls is the absence of strong candidates As many as three million voters are set to go to the polls tomorrow to elect a new mayor and councillors for new wards, in the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) by-polls, without any enthusiasm or electioneering in sight. What makes it different from the last DNCC polls is the absence of strong candidates.  This has failed to generate a buzz among voters, not to mention lack of strong opposition candidates. While five candidates will vie for the mayoral position, only ruling Awami League-nominated candidate Atiqul Islam was seen to be electioneering, which ended yesterday.  The other candidates are Shafin Ahmed from Jatiya Party, Anisur Rahman Dewan from National People's Party, Shahin Khan of Progressive Democratic Party, and independent candidate Abdur Rahim. Polling for mayoral elections will be held in 54 wards of DNCC. Also 36 new wards, 18 in DNCC and 18 in Dhaka South City Corporation, are up for elections on the same day. Unlike the mayoral by-polls, vigorous campaigns are being conducted by candidates for councillor posts, as the posts are being contested for the first time. Election materials, including ballot papers, have already reached the offices of the returning officers concerned, as the Election Commission finalizes its preparations for the elections scheduled tomorrow. Arrangements are already in place to send the election materials to the polling centres by today, before voters head to cast their ballots starting 8am tomorrow.  The elections will take place until 4pm without any interval. A public holiday has been announced in DNCC areas so that all voters can exercise their voting rights. Electioneering concluded on Tuesday Returning Officer for the DNCC mayoral polls, Md Abul Kashem, told BSS that no candidate or none in favor of any candidate can conduct any meeting, rally, or procession starting midnight in the DNCC areas, after the electioneering schedule ended on Tuesday.  \"No offices will remain open on that day. But Public academic examinations will be held as per schedule. Students residing in hostels or residences for study purposes will be exempt from the directives concerning leaving election areas\" the RO said. Kashem added that the ban on traffic movement will be relaxed on highways and inter-district roads inside DNCC, considering the issue of public suffering, but vehicular movement on connecting roads will remain banned. Vehicle restrictions According to a home ministry circular, motorcycle transport will be banned in DNCC polling areas from today till Friday 6am.   Meanwhile, all vehicle traffic in the area--excluding emergency services--will be banned for 24 hours starting Wednesday midnight (12am) to Thursday midnight (12am). Vehicles affected by the ban during the by-elections are: motorcycles, trucks, motorized three-wheelers, taxis, microbuses, jeeps, pickups, and cars. Water vessels moving through the area will also fall under the vehicle ban. However, the restriction on vehicle traffic will be loosely implemented on important roads, streets, and highways leading into and out of Dhaka, and at inter-district bus terminals. The circular also directed non residents or voters in the DNCC to leave the area by Tuesday midnight (12am), to ensure a peaceful by-election, and to avoid facing legal action on voting day. Filling a void The DNCC mayoral post fell vacant with the death of Annisul Huq on November 30, 2017. According to the schedule declared by the Election Commission, the by-polls for the DNCC mayoral post were supposed to be held on February 26 last year. But a High Court bench stayed the election for six months after hearing two separate writ petitions on January 14 last year. However, another High Court bench later cleared the way to hold the by-election by withdrawing the stay order."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-03 00:00:00      \nA pregnant woman dies at Bangabanadhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University At least three people including a pregnant woman died of dengue as the tally of patients suffering from the mosquito-borne virus kept spiraling with 1,687 new cases across the country on Friday.  Shockingly, two of the victims died in Dhaka.  The deceased are Md Raiyan Sarkar, Mosharraf Hossain and Maliha Mahfuz Onnya. Raiyan, a 6th grader of Government Mohammadpur Model School and College, died while undergoing treatment at Square Hospitals in Dhaka while Mosharraf, 30, at a Noakhali hospital. The expectant mother, Maliha Mahfuz Onnya, died at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), a private news channel reported, without disclosing her identity.  She had been suffering from dengue fever for the last ten days. With the latest deaths, the number of people who died of the mosquito-borne virus jumped to at least 47, according to the unofficial tally.  Interestingly, the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) claimed that no deaths took place due to dengue in a 24-hour span until last afternoon. In a media release issued at 4pm, the DGHS made the claim, confirming that 1,687 people were affected with dengue anew.  Also Read- Quader for united efforts to control dengue With this, the number of dengue patients hit a record high of 21,253 since the beginning of this year. Dhaka city alone saw 992 new patients, clearly depicting that it continued to bear the brunt of dengue.  Outside Dhaka, Chittagong division became the second most affected area having 119 cases, followed by Khulna division (91 patients) and Rajshahi division (87 patients).   Since January, according to DGHS, a total of 14 people died of dengue across the country, with the highest 10 deaths registered only in July.  Currently, 6,582 people are hospitalised while the number was 4,903 on Thursday afternoon.   From January to March, there were only 73 infections in total. In April, there were 58 infections and two fatalities. The number of infected patients nearly quadrupled to 193 in May, and blew up to 1,863 in June with two more deaths. The outbreak far surpasses the previous largest instance from 2002 when there were 6,232 confirmed dengue cases with over 62 deaths. The dengue outbreak was largely attributed to the flood situation at the time. Fears, promises, criticism pour in  Urging all to work together to control the dengue outbreak, Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader said there was no improvement in the dengue situation.  \"The dengue situation is bad in Bangladesh. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is also worried about the country's dengue situation,\" said the minister while addressing a program in Dhaka on Friday. Also Read- Fakhrul : Declare state of emergency to tackle dengue \"The dengue situation is not out of control. We have strength to control the situation. It is possible to control it through united efforts,\" he said. Quader furthered there is no way to deny that dengue has spread all over the country. Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Mayor Atiqul Islam told reporters that the new sample of insecticide to kill mosquito will arrive from abroad in a day or two. But, on Thursday, lawyers of the DNCC and its southern counterpart claimed that samples of mosquito repellent would be brought from abroad by later in the day.  Meanwhile, Information Minister Dr Hasan Mahmud on Friday urged physicians to stand by dengue patients on humanitarian ground.  He also accused some doctors for trying to utilize dengue prevalence as a means of business. \"Most of the physicians have already stood beside the dengue patients on humanitarian grounds, but a section of doctors is trying to utilise the dengue prevalence as a means of business,\" he said while inaugurating a cleanliness and mosquito killing drive in the capital.  Blaming the health minister and both the mayors of Dhaka for the dengue outbreak, Nagoril Oikya Convener Mahmudur Rahman Manna at a discussion in Dhaka said the entire country is grappling with the mosquito menace.  \"People are not safe. But the minister and the mayors failed to act properly to resolve the issue. They are staging a drama on the pretext of procuring insecticide to kill mosquitoes,\" he added. Also Read- Mamata: Bangladeshi mosquitoes behind dengue in West Bengal  The government is deliberately importing effective  repellents, alleged BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi.  \"Dengue menace is an annual affair. But, why the government turned a blind eye despite knowing the fact? It willingly procured insecticide that does not destroy mosquitoes. Who embezzled the money?\" he questioned.  Health Rights Movement's President Prof Rashid-E-Mahbub said negligence among the authorities concerned caused the dengue to take an epidemic shape.  \"All has to take responsibility for the failure. Firstly, the government has engaged in a blame game. But right now, we have to think of treating dengue patients and fighting the mosquito menace,\" he furthered.  The scenario across the country In Jhenaidah, five more cases including that of 7th grader were recorded in the district's Kaliganj upazila. Four of them were infected with the dengue virus while in Dhaka, said local hospital sources. All five patients were being treated at the Jhenidah Sadar Hospital.  Dr Hussain Shafayet of the Kaliganj Upazila Health Complex said they were yet to receive the dengue-testing kits.  In Barishal, 48 more patients have been admitted to the Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital in 24 hours ending last afternoon. Local health officials said people returning home from Dhaka ahead of Eid-ul-Azha are pushing up the number of the positive dengue case.  Dr Abdur Rahim, divisional heath director, said patients are approaching to private pathologies since no dengue testing-kits (like NS-I) reached at any of the 43 public hospitals in the district as yet. In Gaibandha, an upward trend of dengue cases is noticed. Until Friday, at least 11 dengue patients were confirmed. All of them live in Dhaka, but returned to their village home with the dengue virus, said Gaibandha's Civil Surgeon Abu Janif.  Other than taking measures to contain the virus, local authorities concerned have launched a loudspeaker campaign asking people not to panic over the menace as well to be aware of Aedes mosquitoes. In Dinajpur, three people were found to be dengue positive. Like most cases, the trio lives in Dhaka and returned to the district after being infected by the dengue virus. Local administration said the government clinics and hospitals have no dengue-testing kits. In Madaripur, 18 new cases were confirmed until 2pm yesterday, pushing the number of dengue-affected people to 48. Of them, 15 patients were being treated at local hospitals.  Most of the new patients came from Dhaka, said local hospital sources.  In Tangail, the situation is no different from other districts. Eight more patients were hospitalised yesterday, with total number of dengue cases soaring to 66.  In Bogra, the number of patients continued to rise. Until last morning, 148 patients were confirmed at Saheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-14 00:00:00      \nThe Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change has assured that action will be taken against DNCC A parliamentary standing committee has recommended that the highest amount of fines be realized from the Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) for polluting environment by dumping waste haphazardly at the Amin Bazar sanitary landfill. The Standing Committee on Ministry of Environment Forest and Climate Change, at a meeting held at the parliament on Satruday, came up with the decision as the DNCC has been using the landfill for dumping waste without any environmental clearance. Appearing from the meeting, Committee Chairman Saber Hossain Chowdhury, said the law is equal for all and there are provisions for fines if a person or an organisation pollutes the environment.  \"The dumping ground used by DNCC is illegal. The environment department earlier issued letters to the organization, but they did not respond. Also Read - A landfill in flood flow zone The ministry has assured that action will be taken against the DNCC, in line with the recommendations made by the standing committee, he added. According to the meeting minutes, three separate letters had been issued to shut the dumping station, but the DNCC has not paid heed to the letters. Dhaka Tribune on August 29 ran a report on \"A landfill in flood flow zone\" that said that Aminbazar sanitary landfill, the lone landfill for all the DNCC waste has turned into an artificial floating island in the flood flow zone near the Turag River, severely damaging the ecosystem. About 2,000 tons of waste is dumped on a daily basis from different parts of north Dhaka to the landfill that does not have an environmental clearance certificate from the Department of Environment (DoE). An August 5 inter-ministerial meeting at the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change claimed that  DNCC did not follow the directives prescribed in the Environment Conservation Rules, 1997, in the first place while building the landfill, failing to ensure a sound environment, it says. The dump yard has become over-loaded from all sides and falls on the path of a flood flow zone near a canal of the Turag River. The landfill built-in 2007 on 52 acres of land was expanded in 2017 as the garbage over the years exceeded the capacity, but the sanitary landfill has turned into an open dump due to the haphazard disposal of waste. The Environment Conservation Rules 1997 made it mandatory to have an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and maintain sound environmental conditions in all steps of building and operation of landfills. However, the DNCC neither conducted the EIA nor obtained any environmental clearance - a clear violation of the rules."

Mounting the land scarcity issue around Dhaka city prompts authorities to re-assess the solid waste management strategy, because generating renewable energy from solid waste not only reduces the land pressure problem, but also generates cleaner energy and better environemnt. A proposal was sent to the Local Government Division, in this regard, Atiqul said while launching a combing operation against dengue-carrying Aedes mosquitoes in the capital on Sunday. The mayor said he had a discussion with the chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Saber Hossain Chowdhury, who is now out of country. \"Upon his return, we will hold a meeting on September 21 at the DNCC and will try to determine a viable solution to mounting solid wastes in the landfills,\" he said. The Standing Committee on Saturday recommended that hefty fines will be realized from the DNCC for polluting environment by dumping municipal solid waste unsystematically at the Aminbazar landfill requisite environmental clearance. \"We are always concerned about ecology and environmental pollution. As an immediate action plan, we [DNCC] have proposed to produce cleaner energy from recycling the solid waste,\" the mayor said. Sources said the DNCC has long been using the Aminbazar landfill for dumping waste without any environmental clearance. As the dumping ground used by DNCC is illegal, the environment department earlier issued letters to the organization, but they did not respond. Dhaka Tribune on August 29 ran a report on \"A landfill in flood flow zone\" that said that Aminbazar landfill, the only landfill for all the DNCC solid waste has turned into an artificial floating island in the flood flow zone near the Turag River, severely damaging the ecosystem. An estimated 2,000 tons of municipal solid waste is dumped on a daily basis from different parts of north Dhaka to the landfill that does not have an environmental clearance certificate from the Department of Environment (DoE). The dumping ground has become over-used from all sides and falls on the path of a flood flow zone near a canal of the Turag River. This untreated garbage is also contaminating the groundwater The Aminbazar landfill was built on 2007 on 52 acres of land. Thereafter,  it was further expanded in 2017, as the solid waste and garbage have exceeded the capacity of the landfill. Since then, it has turned into an open dumping station due to the chaotic disposal of solid waste.  The Environment Conservation Rules-1997 made it mandatory to have an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and maintain sound environmental conditions in all steps of building and operation of landfills. However, the DNCC neither conducted the EIA nor obtained any environmental clearance - a clear violation of the rules."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-29 00:00:00      \nIndia is the second largest onion producer and exporter in the world after China India's ban on onion export will not affect the local market as the country has sufficient stock, a top trade official has claimed, saying a large quantity of onion imports from Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar are in the pipeline. \"There is nothing to be worried about India's ban. We have adequate stock,\" Commerce Secretary Jafar Uddin told Dhaka Tribune last night. He said two ships carrying onions from Myanmar already anchored at Chittagong port, which would raise the domestic stock.  \"I don't see any possibility of instability in local market. What we need is coordinated efforts to strongly monitor the market to ensure smooth supply and check price manipulation,\" he maintained.     The Indian government on Sunday banned onion export amid growing prices in their domestic market after production of the vegetable fell short of target due to flood caused from incessant rainfall, India Today reports.  India is the second largest onion producer and exporter in the world after China. In last couple of months, the Union government of India started tightening onion export by imposing several initiatives leading to price hikes.  Apart from this, the Indian government firstly withdrew 10% incentives on onion export in June and later, in mid-September, it re-fixed the vegetable's minimum export price per ton at $850. Reuters adds: The Indian government said exports would be prohibited with immediate effect. In several cities, prices of the essential kitchen item have doubled in recent weeks, prompting the government of the world's major onion exporter to take steps to calm prices ahead of key state elections later this year. In June, India withdrew 10% export incentives on onions after prices started to rise due to dwindling supplies from last year's harvest and a delay in planting of the summer-sown crop. Excessive rainfall in the second half of the monsoon season has led to crop damage in several states and stocks held by traders are insufficient to meet demand until the new crop arrives in end-October.  The government has also attempted to bring down prices by releasing more onions from federal buffer stocks, prices have remained fairly high. The ban has sent waves of panic in the country that the essential cooking commodity will be costlier.  Bangladesh consumes a higher quantity of onions than the country produces annually.  According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, the country's onion production in 2016-17 fiscal year was 1.86 million tons against the demand for 2.4 million tons. The country has been facing a price spiral of the cooking ingredient since the Eid-ul-Azha celebrations early last August. In recent weeks, prices of the commodity escalated further. On August 17, the commerce ministry came up with the statement that the country had 1.6 million tons of onions in stock and claimed that the quantity of stock was enough to meet domestic demand.  Onion prices in the country jumped from Tk45 to Tk70 per kg on September 14, a day after India fixed minimum onions export price per ton at $850. Usually, the minimum export price of onion at international market stays in between $250 and $300. Yesterday evening, visiting Sukrabad kitchen market, Dhaka Tribune found per kilogram local onion selling for Tk80-90 while imported one for Tk70-80. On the other hand, super shop Shwapno at Panthapath was selling Indian onion at Tk74 per kilogram.  Bangladeshi is eighth on the Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) list of top ten countries producing onion.  China tops the FAO list with annual production of 24.28 million tons, followed by India 22.42 million tons, USA 3.73 million tons, Iran 2.37 million tons, Egypt 2.37 million tons, Russian Federation 2.13 million tons, Turkey 2.13 million tons, Bangladesh 1.86 million tons, Pakistan 1.83 million tons and The Netherlands 1.77 million tons."

The prime minister said this in replying to a supplementary raised by Jatiya Party lawmaker Kazi Feroz Rashid in the House during a question-answer session with Speaker Dr Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury. The Leader of the House said her government has reintroduced an automatic signalling system in the capital which had almost gone out of order previously. She said traffic could be controlled manually in some areas, but there are allegations that manual traffic control is ineffective.    Sheikh Hasina said the biggest problem is that city commuters do not follow traffic rules. Referring to the notorious traffic jams in London and Washington, the Leader of the House said traffic jams are now a worldwide problem. She said people are buying more cars as the population's financial solvency is on the rise. In reply to a question from treasury bench member Didarul Alam, the premier said a number of projects were executed in the last 10 years through various ministries and departments, while many schemes are being implemented to ease traffic jams in the capital. If the schemes are implemented, she said, it is expected that Dhaka city will be free from traffic jams very soon. The Leader of the House also said her government is considering implementing projects similar to Dhaka, in Chittagong also, to reduce traffic jams in the port city."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-01-21 00:00:00      \nAlthough still producing earthen pots and utensils, lack of innovation and inability to use technology has held them back without ever reaching their full potential. In the small village of Kartikpur in Bhedarganj upazila of Shariatpur, a dynasty of potters, namely Pals and Kumars, have sustained the rare pottery industry in spite of the onslaught of technological advancements. Although still producing earthen pots and utensils, lack of innovation and inability to use technology has held them back without ever reaching their full potential. A host of potters in Kartikpur, namely Samir Pal, Pradip Pal, Sandip Pal, Gobind Pal, Jawahar Lal Pal and Uttam Pal, have a few factories set up in the region, where they create at least 3,000 items, including utensils, collectibles, and household products. These items include terracotta shades, tiles, candle stands, flower vases, coin boxes, wall coverings, wall pots, visiting card boxes and scores of other such products. Hundreds of workers from the neighbouring villages of Rambhadrapur and Dingamanik are also recruited in the factories, breaking an age-old tradition of only Pal community members working in the craft. A wide range of NGOs and other development agencies, namely Aarong, Caritas, Heed Bangladesh, Usha Handicrafts and more, usually purchase products from Kartikpur's potters, which are sold across the country, as well as internationally in countries spanning Europe, North America, the Middle East, and neighbouring countries like India. Every factory etches their logo on their products for authenticity. Work reportedly goes on throughout the year, with products ranging between 1.5 inches to 6 feet, costing anywhere between Tk5,000-30,000. Potters said they usually begin the process by gathering alluvial soil and mixing it with water. The clay mixture is then processed, using an imported filter from Germany, and kept on a special pan for 20 days. After 20 days, the excess water is drained and the clay formation that remains, known locally as mundu, is dried in the sun and mixed with very little water, forming the base for all their pottery items. They said that newly-formed pottery items and must be stored in closed rooms for 10-12 days before fire curing, after which they are colored as required and are then delivered to clients.  Previously, clients would market the products for the potters, but now they have taken over the marketing process themselves. Sandip Kumar Pal, a potter, said his family has been in the pottery business for generations. He was first inspired by an art faculty of then-Dhaka Art College in 1976 to showcase his products and to sell them in Dhaka and Chittagong. After gaining exposure, he was approached by several NGOs and other agencies, who signed contracts with him to market his products further and beyond Bangladesh. He also said the agencies are now showcasing his products in countries across the world, fetching foreign currency in the process. Uttam Kumar Pal, another potter, lamented that the production price of a night lamp is between Tk70-80, but sells for only Tk90-95. Even worse, when it is sent to Dhaka it sells for anywhere between Tk400-500. \"My factory also builds clay elephants 5-7ft long, which cost Tk15,000-20,000 to make,\" he added, \"but they sell in Dhaka for Tk30,000-40,000.\" Rangadip Pal lamented that at one point, he used to earn Tk60,000 a month from selling his pottery items, but now the scenario is not as rosy as before. He has gained a lot more in state honors and recognition than before, but his income has not been the same, as the revenue numbers are not good enough to replenish his working capital on a monthly basis. The potters sought government intervention for the sustainability of the industry. Enam Ahmed, deputy manager of the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) industry assistance centre in the district, acknowledged the contribution of these potters to the economy and culture. He added they will provide more technical support to the potters if they request their assistance, in terms of innovation, integrating technology into their trade, and financial support, if necessary."

The minister also said: \"The highways all over the country are in good shape at the moment, and better than any time prior - except the ones in flood-affected areas, which got damaged and are being repaired on an emergency basis.\" He made the statement at a press briefing held at the Secretariat on Monday. Quader blamed the cattle markets on roads and alongside highways as the main cause of congestion during Eid days. \"This is totally prohibited this time, and orders have been sent to the concerned authorities to take steps,\" the minister said. The two city corporations in Dhaka have also been requested to look after the matter, so roads do not get blocked for cattle markets, he added. Quader said to ensure smooth movement for homebound people, trucks, lorries and covered vans will be off the roads for three days before and after Eid.  Vehicles carrying medicine, export-oriented garments, goods and fuel will be outside the purview of the restrictions. The expected date for Eid-ul-Azha is August 12. The government will help the BGMEA to send garment workers back home by providing BRTC buses. The garment owners have been asked to give Eid holidays to workers in phases, so the last minute rush can be avoided, the minister added."

Padma River erosion took an alarming turn in the last few days, rendering over 200 families homeless in the Rajeswhawar union of the Chandpur Sadar upazila. The affected people of Rajarchar, Mander Bazar, Khaskandi, Lagnimararchar, and Dewan Bazar areas of the union said onrush of flood waters from upstream and heavy rain in the last few days  swelled Padma-Meghna, flooding the areas on its banks. This made over 200 families of low-lying areas homeless, locals and Water Development Board officials said. A large number of flood victims took shelter on nearby highlands including  Bashgari, Majherchar, Goal Nagar and Rayerchar. Hajrat Ali Bepari , chairman of the Rajeswhawar union said about a thousand other families, living close to the river, are passing their days in anxiety and fear of being devoured by the Padma in the near future. He also said the  erosion along vast areas on the river bank earlier washed away scores of homesteads, schools in the area. The situation had been deteriorated due to constant erosion, he added.  Erosion-hit Kamal, 40, and Akkel Ali, 35, of the union said they had been passing sleepless nights in fear of erosion. \"Where will we go? We are all poor people,\" said Akkel Ali. Gourango, Abul Kalam and Laila of Mander Bazar alleged that unplanned dredging had sped up the erosion.  Executive Engineer of Chandpur Water Development Board Abu Raihan said, \"During the monsoon season the water stream in the river is very high. There are strong vortex current flows. This place is very risky within the union.\" He said they have nothing to do as the union is situated in the char area.  "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-08 00:00:00      \nWithout a collective effort, we cannot fight climate change The global temperature has been increasing since the pre-industrial era. This year, a widespread increase in temperatures continues to affect several parts of the world.  India witnessed its highest temperature in the northern part of the country. Some parts of the country experienced temperatures exceeding 45 degrees Celsius. On June 10, the highest temperature soared to 48C, which was highest temperature recorded in June.  On June 8, Kuwait recorded the highest temperature in the world, reaching 52.2C in the shadows and 63C under direct sunlight.  In early May, parts of Bangladesh experienced searing heat. The highest temperature recorded was 39.5C in Rajshahi. According to a World Bank report, \"South Asia's Hotspots: The Impact of Temperature and Precipitation Changes on Living standard,\" the average temperature of South Asia has increased and will continue to increase, with negative impacts on agriculture, health, and productivity.  The report said that the average temperature of Bangladesh is projected to increase by 1C to 1.5C by 2050. Chittagong has been selected as the most vulnerable to changes in average temperature and precipitation followed by Barisal and Dhaka divisions. One of the major impacts of rising temperature is rapid glacier retreat across countries.  Approximately, there are 150,000 glaciers in the world, excluding large ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, which occupy about 200,000 square miles of the Earth's surface.  Over the last 40 years, the glaciers that have been lost or melted are equivalent to a layer of ice 70 feet thick.  The Tuyuksu glacier, 30km (or 18 miles) south of Kazakhstan's largest city Almaty, is melting at an unprecedented rate.  Millions of people rely on the melted waters of the Tuyuksu glacier. In the past 60 years, glaciers equivalent to more than half a mile have been lost.  Between 1986 and 2014, the glaciers of Bolivia have shrunk by 43%, according to new research. Researchers studied the satellite images produced by NASA of the Bolivia Cordillera Oriental and found out that the glaciers had decreased from 530sq-km to 300sq-km. In the long run, more than two million people will be in a dire situation in the dry season. The Himalayan region has lost 13% of its glaciers contributing to a loss of 443 billion tons of glacial ice over the past 40 years.  Himalayan glaciers are a vital source of water for eight countries, including Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, and India and capture 10% of the world's freshwater and support irrigation, energy, and the livelihoods of 750 million people living downstream.  Hence, further melting of the Himalayan glaciers will wreak havoc on bio-diversity and economic growth, and lead to food and water shortages of billions of people.  Climate vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh have primarily relied on devising climate adaptation approaches and strategies.  It is imperative for the developing countries to devise climate adaptation approaches in conjunction with mitigation measures to effectively address climate change.  The NGOs of different developing countries should also come forward in this regard. For example, by the end of the year 2019, BRAC's Climate Change Program (CCP) is planting around 200,000 trees in 65,000 households with the intention of sequestering carbon dioxide and enhancing livelihood options in three selected environmentally critical areas that include cyclone, flood, and drought-prone areas of Bangladesh. Also, different mitigation efforts through application of renewable energy technology will be undertaken in conjunction with climate adaptation approaches.  Developing countries such as Bangladesh contribute insignificant greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. However, collective efforts may help to minimize the problem to some extent.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-14 00:00:00      \nLocal farmers are worried about their yield as adverse weather conditions are threatening their crops   Farmers of Moulvibazar's Hakaluki, Kauadighi, and Hail haors, along with other haors, have started harvesting their Boro paddies--ahead of schedule--due to adverse weather conditions and heavy rain. Whenever thy sky turns black with thick clouds, the hearts of the local farmers fill with fear, and panic strikes among them, as they worry about whether they will be able to collect this year's harvest without losing some to unfavorable weather conditions. According to the Moulvibazar Agriculture Extension Department, farmers cultivated Boro paddy on 130,031 acres of land against the target 131,252 acres, in the whole district.  Expressing great worry, local farmers Selim Ahmad, Laikujjaman, and Kamruzzaman have already started harvesting as they fear that heavy rain and adverse weather conditions, will cause them extensive loses despite a bumper Boro yield in the area.  It has been observed that due to the heavy rain in the area, water levels of the local rivers and canals have risen to alarming heights. Hailstorms are also responsible for causing immense damage to the Boro yield of the district. Anfar Ali, Abdul Khaliq, Majnu Miah--all Boro paddy farmers from the Bhukshimoil union--told the reporter that they are fearing a flood this year, which could take away all of their yield and leave them empty-handed. \"We have started harvesting. Despite the pesticide attacks on our crops, we expected a good yield, but bad weather has forced us to worry a great deal about the harvest and profit.  \"We are very concerned\"  Commenting on the situation, Haor Bachao, Krishak Bachao, Krishi Bachao Sangram Parishad President Siraj Uddin Ahmed Badshah said: \"People of the haor region have been neglected for a very long time. The government has not implemented their promises to develop the haor areas.  He added: \"The government needs to come forward to save all the haors and rivers of the district, as well as the people living here, from the verge of destruction. Only then--along with natural resources here--the haor will live, agriculture will live, and the local farmers will be able to live.\" Kulaura Agriculture Officer Jagalul Haider said, \"The crop is good. Boro paddy harvesting began in a different way in the haor. Rice is rotten in many places. It will take another week for Boro. There is nothing to worry about. There will be some rain during Chaitra and Boishakh.\" Addressing the issue Moulvibazar Agriculture Extension Department Deputy Director Mohammad Shahjahan told Dhaka Tribune: \"The amount of rainfall in area till now has caused no damage to Boro paddy cultivation in the district. \"Farmers in Hakaluka have already started harvesting their crops. I hope the farmers will be able to collect their harvest without any interruption.  Responding to a question about farmers harvesting their crops ahead of schedule due to the fear of rain and adverse weather conditions, he said: \"Why would the farmers harvest partially-ripened paddy? No-one does that.   \"According to the correct scientific methods, farmers should harvest their cultivation when 80% of their whole yield is ripe, but our farmers wait even longer.\""

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-30 00:00:00      \nA 'Dead Stop' sign at rail bridges instruct train to stop first before crossing it at only 5km/h There are at least 13 rail bridges with \"Dead Stop\" signs on the 179km Sylhet-Akhaura route, posing a serious risk of accident to thousands of passengers. A \"Dead Stop\" sign at rail bridges instruct trains to stop first before crossing it at only 5km/h. Sources at Bangladesh Railway (East) said six trains - Parabat, Jayantika, Paharika, Udayan, Upaban and Kalni - carry 12,000 to 15,000 passengers every day over these dangerouse locations, reports UNB. Eight of these \"Dead Stops\" are situated in an 18km stretch from Sylhet to Mogla Bazar and five in 164km stretch from Mogla Bazar to Akhaura Bridge.  According to Railway Engineering's Sylhet branch, the 13 bridges with \"Dead Stop\" signs are - Samshernagar-Tilagon section's bridge No 200, Mogla Bazar-Maijgaon section's bridge No 43, 45 and 47, Kulaura-Baramchal section's bridge No 5 and 7, Satgaon-Sreemangal section's bridge No 141, Sreemangal-Vanugach section's bridge No 157, Maijgaon-Vater Bazar section's bridge No 29, and Montola-Itakhola section's bridge No 56. Sajib Kumar Malakar, assistant station manager of Sylhet railway station, said most of the bridges in this section are in risky condition. \"I cannot confirm whether the June 23 accident happened only because of the bridge's condition,\" he added. Five people were killed when six coaches of Dhaka-bound \"Upaban Express\" went off the rails on June 23 after a culvert over the Barochhara canal, near the Baramchal railway station, caved in. A coach of fertilizer-carrying BC Special Train from Shahjalal Fertilizer Factory derailed at Maijgaon station adjacent area on April 5. A coach of Jalalabad Express ran off the tracks at Mollikapur area under Fenchuganj upazila on May 16. An oil tanker train derailed at Kulaura in Moulvibazar in March 2018, snapping rail communication for two hours with other parts of the country. Trains on Sylhet-Chittagong and Dhaka-Sylhet routes were halted for 15 hours on February 23 last year due to derailment of Upaban Express at Satgaon in Sreemangal. In 2017, media reports highlighted the sorry state of Monu Bridge and how bamboo was used to repair it. The bridge remained that way since then and is currently included in the list of risky bridges. Bhoismara Rail Bridge between Sreemangal and Satgaon stations was damaged in a flash flood on April 5, 2017. The condition of the bridge has not improved yet. The same is the case with the rest of the bridges that are using \"Dead Stops\" to prevent accidents and loss of life. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on June 25 ordered the authorities concerned to conduct a survey of rail bridges and culverts across the country and repair those damaged or risky."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-27 00:00:00      \nFarmers are acutely at risk of contracting sewage-borne diseases Comilla City Corporation's unplanned drainage system is turning farmland into water bodies; as polluted water is flooding hundreds of hectares of farmland. However, the city corporation has undertaken several mega projects to improve  rural infrastructure and increase opportunities for urbanization. Among these projects, one of them was undertaken to ensure a better sewerage system. However, the newly-constructed drainage system--in nine wards of Comilla City Corporation, including wards 23 and 24-- has brought sewage onto arable farmland, into open fields, and near educational institutions; mostly harming farmers in the process. Diseases--such as: cholera, dysentery, typhoid, and diarrhea--are emerging from these unhealthy conditions. Various crops, dwellings, schools, and other institutions, are in danger of becoming water-logged. Farmers complain that due to the negligence of the city corporation officials, the drains empty onto farmland instead of into rivers or canals. They claim that if the sewerage system had been carefully planned, the farmers would not be suffering. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said the drainage line empties onto farmland for various reasons; including that some cases filed against construction of the line, by people who do not want drains over their land, have left the process incomplete. He said: \"We are trying to find a solution to this problem.\" Visiting the area, this correspondent found that starting from the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) Comilla sector, the main drain pipe ends near Nandanpur Bishwaroad. Branches of drainpipes from other areas link to this main drain line, leading the sewage water away to places near farmlands, houses, and educational institutions in several areas, including: Gandhamati, Changini, Batabaria, and Rampur. The main drain line of the 23rd and 24th ward ends near Batabaria school, while Ghungaijhuri canal is only 2700 square feet away. If the drain had been extended by 2700 square feet--over the Changini-Nandanpur area to the canal--then the problems would not have existed. There are at least 30 government and non-government institutions in wards 23 and 24, including: the Bangladesh Academy for Rural Development (Bard), the BGB sector headquarters, Comilla University, a section of cantonment, a cadet college, Shalban Vihara, and the Buddhist Bihar Museum. Locals said if the unplanned sewerage system persists, these places will flood with polluted water. A farmer from Nandanpur, Abul Hashem said they are struggling to yield crops as contaminated water is flooding their arable farmland. They demand the pipeline be moved so that it ends at Ghungaijhuri canal, rather than on the farmland. Many people--including Md Ayub Ali, Md Lutfur Rahman, Zahid Hossain Mithu, and Md Abul Kalam--have complained that apart from harming the crops, farmers are also contracting skin diseases from the contaminated water. Dr Mosleh Uddin, president of Comilla Environment Movement, said: \"Due to the dirty and contaminated water of the drains, the farmers of those areas are [working] in extremely dangerous conditions. \"All the polluted water from the city is flowing onto agricultural land. As there is no way to dispose of the sewage--other than in the southern area of the city corporation--the area will be considered a recycling zone.\" He said it is possible to protect the agricultural land--at least in those areas--by creating a recycling project. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said: \"The work to extend the drainpipes, for them to empty into canals, is going ahead according to the master plan. It will be completed in phases. He also said alongside it, there is a plan to extend the main drain line of Nandanpur towards Ghungaijhuri canal. The mayor said: \"A man named Abdul Jalil from ward 24 has filed cases against seven city corporation officials, including me. Construction of drains in various places is hindered due to these problems.\""

      "authors": "Kamrul Hasan",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-12 00:00:00      \nParents dream of financial security, advancement  Unable to bear the cost of their children's education, many parents push them into work in the transport sector with dreams of financial security and advancement, employers, transport leaders and experts told Dhaka Tribune. While visiting the Amin Bazar, Gabtoli, Mohammadpur, Sutrapur, Jatrabari and Kachpur areas, it was seen that a significant number of children were employed on human haulers, as well as in automobile workshops and battery recharging shops. The employers claimed the children were employed as per the wishes of their parents.  Md Bulu, owner of Janani Engineering Workshop in Gabtoli, said although a number of children and teenagers were employed at the workshop, they were all well taken care of and trained in the necessary skills to succeed in the industry. \"Children who leave the workshop in search of better earnings often go astray and fall into drug addiction,\" he added. Meanwhile, a workshop owner in Amin Bazar and another in Sutrapur urged the government to set up a mechanism to measure and certify the skills of children trained in the workshops, to ease their progress in the industry. Challenges to addressing child labour in transport sector Experts said the informal nature of the transport sector made it difficult for the government to bring discipline to it. The Labour Act prohibits employing children under the age of 14 in hazardous work, but the act is not applicable for the informal sector. Save the Children Director (Child Rights Governance and Child Protection) Abdullah Al Mamun said listing the names of child labours would help monitor the rate of enrolment of children in the transport sector. He also said that among the 38 types of child labour categorized as hazardous, the transport sector offers some of the highest salaries. Education and Development Foundation (EDUCO) specialist (child labour) Afzal Kabir Khan said money was not the only reason many children were employed in the transport sector.   A number of parents push their children into child labour as they are unable to monitor them properly owing to their own jobs, he added. \"Many parents tell employers they cannot take care of their children as they both have jobs, and they wish for a successful person to take care of them so that they do not end up committing crimes and become addicted to drugs,\" Afzal said, mentioning that the parents harbour hopes of their children's quick advancement in life and starting their own business. During a presentation in April this year, INCIDIN Bangladesh Executive Director AKM Masud Ali said many boys were dropping out of school to join the workforce, as their parents were unable to bear the cost of education. The current state of child labour in Bangladesh Comparing data on child labour in the country in 2003 and 2013, from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) and International Labour Organization (ILO) Bangladesh, Bangladesh Shishu Adhikar Forum (BSAF) said the number of child labourers decreased from 4.7 million to 1.7 million. However, the number of children employed in hazardous work only decreased from 1.3 million to 1.2 million over the same period.   Experts and transport workers said a number of initiatives to address child labour were taken after the first survey in 2003, but political turmoil from 2005-2008 hampered the initiatives.  The Awami League government once again prioritized child rights after coming to power in 2009, bringing significant improvement until 2013. However, the initiatives appear to have had little impact on the numbers of children in hazardous work, the experts added. Subsequently, the government made a list of 38 categories of hazardous work. Transport sector related work on the list includes truck, three-wheeler, and bus helpers, as well as automobile workshop and battery recharging shop workers. Although the categories have been made, the country is yet to collect data on how many children are employed in each category of hazardous work. BSAF said surveys show that about 25.4% of child labours work in transportation. Experts also said the number of underage bus helpers has decreased over time, and most child labourers are employed on three-wheelers and in workshops. Political willingness crucial to preventing child labour in transport sector EDUCO specialist Afzal Kabir Khan said the government has taken a number of initiatives to reduce child labour, but few of them were targeted at the transport sector. Save the Children's Abdullah Al Mamun said political willingness is crucial to preventing child labour in the transport sector, and some of the government's activities had raised questions over they had effectively rectified the convention related to minimum working age. The country has ratified 33 conventions related to child labour.  Mamun said the government has made education compulsory until grade 8, but a surprisingly large number of children still dropout before this point. A large number of them go into work in the transport sector. \"If the government can ensure that no one drops out before the age of 14 and implements courses on ICT training, the problem could have a good solution,\" he said, mentioning that children may be more eager to receive ICT training than traditional vocational training such as livestock rearing.  EDUCO specialist Afzal Kabir Khan said a special social safety net program is needed for child labourers.    Meanwhile, BSAF Director Abdus Sahid Mahmood pointed out that a lack of monitoring mechanisms and government willingness is making the child labour situation worse. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) Chairman Kazi Reazul haque said monitoring child labour is a complex issue, and suggested the government form a Child Directorate to coordinate between government institutions and address child labour. The government reiterated its promise to eliminate child labour from the country by 2025 when adopting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). According to the law, a court can slap a maximum Tk5,000 fine on the employer and maximum Tk1,000 fine on parents for child employment.   The National Child Policy 2011 called for ensuring a child friendly environment at workplaces. Furthermore, it said that the cost of treatment from any accident at the workplace would be borne by the employers. "

In Natore, around 1,700 families in five unions of Lalpur upazila have become waterlogged as the Padma River continues to swell as a result of the opening of Farakka Barrage gates. Farmers in the affected areas are counting losses as their sugarcane fields and crop lands were inundated, causing immense sufferings to the residents of the areas. Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Ummul Banin Duti said: \"Three shelter homes were opened and the flood victims were asked to move there.\" The local administration said 500 flood-affected families in Lalpur union received 15kg rice each as relief. Assistant Engineer of Natore Water Development Board Al Asad said: \"The water level of Padma will continue to rise till Saturday.\" The flood situation in the upazila has been worsening for the last several days following a rise of the Padma water level. In Rajbari, water level of the Padma River was recorded at 12cm above the danger point at Goaland point in the district, and the water continually rose for the past 7 days.  As a result, three out of six ferry ghats in Daulatdia have been shut down due to strong currents in the river, said the Launch Ghat Supervisor Md Mofazzal. In Faridpur, the Padma has been continually rising since the past two days and remained above the danger mark yesterday. Faridpur Water Development Board (WDB) Executive Engineer Sultan Mahmud said: \"The water level in the Padma River here increased by 6cm and is flowing at 13cm above the danger point on Thursday.\" Due the current conditions, low-lying areas of the district were completely inundated causing severe distress to locals. Water somewhat receding in Pabna, Tangail  In Pabna, the Padma is flowing 14.33cm above the danger level at Pakshey Hardinge Bridge point as the water level has risen only by 0.8cm in last 24 hours, according to the hydrology department of WDB. Meanwhile, the district administration began distributing relief items to  the affected waterlogged flood victims since Wednesday. In Tangail, the water level of the rivers in the district are starting to recede. Even though the Daleshwari fell by 2cm, it was still flowing 20cm above the danger mark.  On the other hand, the Jamuna was flowing 51cm under the danger mark, and the Jhenai River was flowing 71cm under the danger mark, said WDB Deputy Assistant Engineer of science department Rezaul Karim.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-17 00:00:00      \nClimate change has become a real threat to human beings with an unabated rise in global temperature, says the prime minister Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has underscored the \"will\" of the richer segments of societies - everywhere - to act ambitiously against climate change as there are enormous amount of science, technology, innovation and finance to address the problem. \"Let me also say we've enormous amount of science - technology - innovation - finance to address climate change. We only need the 'will' of the richer segments of societies - everywhere - to act ambitiously against climate change. We need to 'transform' our lifestyles, attitudes, systems, economies,\" she said on Saturday. She made the remarks while delivering her speech at a panel discussion on \"Climate Change as a Security Threat\" at the Conference Hall of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich, Germany. She said that climate change has become a real threat to human beings with an unabated rise in global temperature. About Bangladesh, the prime minister said increasing cyclones, storm, surge, and monsoon flooding challenge livelihood of its people. \"Our Bay of Bengal is increasingly getting acidic. Twenty percent of our people living along the coast and one third of Bangladesh's population eventually risk displacement with rising sea level although we have little contribution to global warming,\" she added. She said flooding erodes river banks during every monsoon while numerous families overnight become homeless and helpless. \"We lose thousands of acres of precious farmlands. And, let's note that our mighty rivers carry nearly one fourth of entire load of sediment carried by all the major river systems in the world every year.\"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina addresses a panel discussion on 'Climate Change as a Security Threat' at the Conference Hall of the Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich, Germany on Saturday, February 16, 2019 |Focus Bangla Hasina mentioned that the erratic pattern and intensity of rainfall and rising heat make farming difficult for Bangladesh's people. There are also reports of growing water stress during dry season. She said changing climate is taking its toll through the emergence of new pathogens. \"Diseases like malaria, which we successfully eradicated risks a comeback. Similar risks are evident in diseases in serials, livestock and poultry,\" she said, adding that temperature variation is challenging breeding of Bangladesh's national fish ilish. \"There are serious enough challenges for the precious gains we made in development.\" Displacement issue The prime minister said despite the fact and also the IPCC findings - a lot of people - including those that are conscious of climate change are yet to understand the climate displacement issue. She said South Asia, East Asia and the pacific experience most displacement in such contexts. All together, these regions at present have 8.6 million displaced people due to sudden-onset disasters mounting to 40% of the global total, and had new displacements in 2017. She mentioned that an estimated 46 million people were displaced in South Asia alone by sudden onset disasters during 2008 to 2013, though the actual number of people moving internally and across borders in South Asia is not known. \"It's anticipated that population movements in the context of disasters and climate change in South Asia, south East Asia and in the Indian Ocean rim are likely to increase over the next decades,\" Hasina apprehended. She said the challenges ahead are likely to be enormous, as a recent World Bank report -- titled \"Groundswell - Preparing for Internal Climate Migration\" -- projects that without concrete climate and development actions, in South Asia alone, more than 40 million people could be forced to move within their countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change. \"Bangladesh has been in the forefront in addressing coping mechanisms, in particular in agricultural sector. We've invented flood-resistant, salt- tolerant and drought- tolerant rice varieties.\" Collective good Replying to a question, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh military has been engaging with a lot of development activities as well as leading the disaster response in the country. They can also be engaged in early warning mechanisms. She said most of the UN members are engaged in the discourse of climate change in the multilateral fora. \"We need to keep the discussions and engagements up.\" Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable front line countries, she said, and added that her government has mainstreamed climate actions and disaster risks reduction in its national plan. \"We've investment of over 1% of our GDP to address climate change impacts. Moreover, $450 million has been allocated from our own sources for adoption and mitigation purposes.\" In 2012, Hasina recalled, she pledged in New York that Bangladesh will pursue a low-carbon development pathway as its commitment to \"collective good\" of tackling climate change. \"Our commitment to low carbon, climate resilient development is firm. We planned to move to 'carbon budgeting,' resilient industrialisation. We wish to decarbonise our manufacturing pathways.\" She said Bangladesh has installed around six million solar home systems, provided two million Improved Cooking Stoves among the poor, in spite of limitations the country allocated $385 million to the Bangladesh climate change trust fund for adaptation and mitigation. Director of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Hans Joachim chaired the panel discussion on Saturday, which was moderated by Chief Political Correspondent of Deutsche Welle Berlin Melinda Crane-Rohrs. Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs and International Trade of Kenya Monica Juma, Foreign Minister of Norway Ine Eriksen Soreide, US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Co-Executive Director of Greenpeace International Bunny McDiarmid were also present as panel discussants."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-08-08 00:00:00      \nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit India in the first week of October There appears to be a sudden increase in the engagements between Bangladesh and India in many areas of mutual interest. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit India in the first week of October, while the Indian External Affairs Minister is most likely to pay his maiden visit to Bangladesh on August 20-21. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan is now in India to hold meetings with his counterpart Amit Shah. Railways Minister Md Nurul Islam Sujan will conclude his visit to India today (Thursday). After more than eight years, the Water Resources Secretary-level talks will be held today (Thursday) in Dhaka.  These engagements are taking place in a short period of time and there is no scope for anything different, diplomats concerned told Dhaka Tribune. In such broad relations between Dhaka and New Delhi, engagements in different sectors are quite natural, they said.  Prime Minister Hasina will attend the India Economic Summit of the World Economic Forum, 'Innovating for India: Strengthening South Asia, Impacting the World,' to be held in New Delhi on October 3-4, according to multiple government sources. Although she is going to attend a multilateral event, there will be bilateral meetings on the sidelines with Indian leadership . Also Read- PM Hasina to visit India in October At those meetings, Hasina will discuss bilateral issues concerning the Bangladesh-India relationship, including the water sharing of common rivers. Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar is scheduled to arrive in the capital on August 20 on a two-day trip, his first visit since he was appointed following the formation of the new Indian government led by Narendra Modi.  As this visit will be his first, it is unlikely to have any substantial outcome. Both sides will just touch upon pending issues and talk about ways to find solutions, and will explore new areas of cooperation. The timeframe for the prime minister's visit will be finalised during his visit. Home minister Khan was due to hold bilateral meetings with his Indian counterpart Amit Shah, also president of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, at 7:30pm (Bangladesh time) on Wednesday, said a Bangladesh High Commission official in Delhi. The meeting was scheduled to take place in New Delhi at 4:30pm (Bangladesh time), but was delayed due to the death of former Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, he said, adding that the meeting was due to end at around 9:30pm followed by dinner. According to the agenda, the meeting would discuss issues related to putting a halt to the killing of innocent Bangladeshis along the border by the Indian Border Security Force, the smuggling of drugs, human trafficking, and militancy and terrorism, as these are common problems for both neighbours, said a senior official. About the national register of citizens (NRC) in Assam, he said the agenda doesn't list the issue, but if the issue is raised, Bangladesh will put forward its arguments emphasising that it's an internal affair of India. \"We are prepared (regarding NRC),\" he added. A Bangladeshi delegation, led by Railways Minister Sujan, discussed the ongoing railway projects under an Indian line of credit, including the expedited supply of 10 broad gauge and 10 metre gauge locomotives under Indian grants, and other issues. The delegation visiting India from August 3 to August 8, has also gathered experience on Indian railway's catering, ticketing, and operation of trains.  The first Water Resources Secretary-level meeting in more than eight and a half years will take place on Thursday at state guest house Meghna. Both sides will discuss various issues concerning 54 common rivers spanning the two countries, according to a top Water Resources Ministry official. \"Since the issue of the Teesta water sharing agreement is now at the prime minister level, we will not discuss it in detail. But obviously, we will touch upon it,\" he said, adding: \"We will place emphasis on other common rivers which are important too.\""

According to local sources, the erosion has taken a serious turn in Ghagha, Mollikpur, Shierbr, and Makrail areas along Madhumati's banks, and at 15 points including Kargati, Soto Kalia, and Suktogram, of Nabaganga banks. People  of the affected areas have accused the local Water Development Board (WDB) of its negligence as water from the rivers poured into houses in Kalia upazila. \"I have never seen Nabaganga rise so much in the last 35 years. My house was destroyed in a matter of seconds,\" said Ilias Ali, a resident of Sukragram. Many, who have lost their houses in river erosion, are living with their relatives, but some like Julmat Sheikh of Kalia upazila's Noragati village, have been staying under the open sky with their families as they have nowhere else to go. Locals accused the administration of doing little to help them. According to the locals, the WDB has failed to prevent recurring erosion because of their lackadaisical attitude.  Babra-Hachla Union Parishad Chairman Mojammel Hossain said the situation will be brought under control soon. The local contractors declined to perform the emergency work at the beginning of monsoon as WDB officials usually demand 10 percent bribe for such projects, alleged contractors. When contacted, WDB Executive Engineer Md Zulfikar Ali declined to comment over the issue. Meanwhile locals formed a human chain in the district yesterday protesting the  negligence of WDB. Among others, Monisha Ghosh, Profullo Barman, Liton Kumar Ghosh, Kalyani Barman, and Modon Ghosh of the affected areas spoke at the gathering. They urged the administration to take immediate steps to save the people from becoming victims of river erosion."

State Minister for Water Resources Zahid Faruk, attending as chief guest, said the Delta Plan will improvise Bangladesh's GDP and make it two digits, impacting economical-social development, said a press release. The discussion topics covered a wide range of water-related areas such as flood control, flood forecasting, irrigation and drainage, river morphology, salinity and sediment transport, coastal hydraulics, port, coast, and estuary management, environmental impact assessment, bridge hydraulics, and related infrastructure. According to Prof M Monowar Hossain, executive director of IWM, their mathematical model has played a significant role in solving various complex water problems in the country and abroad. \"IWM can play a significant role in implementing the Delta plan 2100 by using these methods,\" he suggested. Many government institutions including the Water Development Board, LGED, etc partners with IWM to verify the feasibility of many projects, he added. Within the coming 100 years, Bangladesh needs to fight against challenges such as temperature rising, heavy rainfall, flood, disintegration of river, drought, rising sea level caused by climate change. To combat these challenges; a long-term Delta Plan-2100 in Water Management and Flood Control is prepared for implementation by using limited resources all together in area-based planning will develop the economic state of Bangladesh."

The minister's original plans were to travel by rail, but the prevailing conditions forced the change. Railways Minister Nurul Islam Sujon was set to visit a stretch of the rail tracks along the Kurigram-Teesta route after a bridge near Tagraihat rail station partially sank into the soil after a flood in 2017. Kurigram Deputy Commissioner Sultana Parveen confirmed the visit. While Kurigram has experienced great strides in development under the Awami League government over the past 10 years, the negligence in the rail sector has caused consternation among locals. According to sources at the Kurigram rail station, only one train operates in the district under two separate names. Due to the shortage of trains and the poor state of tracks, commuting has become a tedious endeavour for locals. A 33km route takes nearly two hours by train now, a staggering example of the breakdown in infrastructure. The dependence on rail is mostly because of the low cost. The bus fare from Kurigram to Rangpur is Tk80, while it costs only Tk15 by rail. Hence, countless people from low-income groups opt for the train despite its many deficiencies. The local railway officials are also concerned about operating on the hazardous route, fully aware than an accident could befall any day. Advocate Pradip Kumar Roy, spokesperson of a Kurigram-based concerned citizens' group, said the people demand extensive overhaul of railway infrastructure and introduction of an intercity train between Chilmari and Dhaka popularly referred to as \"Bhawaiya Express.\""

Sheikh Russel Nagar Park is a nice change of pace where people come to enjoy the natural scenic beauty filled with vegetation and to open their lungs to the clean and fresh air free of all the pollution.The park also known as the Gymkhana Lake is bordered on its south side by the Morgan School in Deobhog, from where it stretches till the Mobarak Shah Road. With the implementation of vegetation projects and other conservational efforts around the previously abandoned waterbody, the Sheikh Russel Nagar Park has now transformed into a modern eco-park, befitting of a popular recreational spot. The park resembles Hatirjheel, the mid-town drainage and sanitation project of Dhaka. There are walkways, plants along the paths, street lights, and foot lights throughout the area.  There is a meeting pavilion for visitors in the park, a viewing deck, and a walking bridge. There are three beautiful docks surrounding the 410 metre long and 150 metre wide lake. The park also has an open theatre for social events and gatherings. A few other things like toilets for men and women, a swimming pool, a fountain, and a bicycle lane are now being made.  Narayanganj City Corporation began the construction work of this place in November, 2016. Even though construction is not yet complete, it has become popular among people. On Friday evenings, the park is packed with nature lovers and their families and friends.  According to the Local Government Engineering Department of Narayanganj, the area allocated for the Gymkhana Park is 38.5 acre. In July of 2016, Narayanganj City Corporation awarded Ratna Enterprise the tender for building the park on a budget of Tk7.74 Crore.  According to Narayanganj City Corporation, Tk19.14 crore has already been spent to complete the second phase of construction. A third phase of construction worth Tk16.96 crore will be initiated shortly. Locals have welcomed the park and said that people are at last being able to get some fresh air. They do not want the space to be turned into a trade centre or a space for the homeless. Abdur Rahman, general secretary of the Citizens Committee told Dhaka Tribune: \"The park is a blessing for the public. This place was once abandoned and became a hub for various shady activities. This conservation of the lake has made the area beautiful.\" Considering Narayanganj's polluted atmosphere this park will help keep the ecological balance, said AB Siddique, District secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA).  He said: \"There is no space for children to play and no space for plants and trees either in Narayanganj. This park will give the kids a place to spend their time and ensure a fresh environment for people.\" Considering all this, Narayanganj City Corporation has welcomed this new addition to the city."

Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal announced that the strike was called off around 1am on Thursday, after a four-hour-long meeting among the representatives of the Bangladesh Truck-covered-van Goods Transport Owner-Worker Unity Council, Bangladesh Road Transport Owners Association and Bangladesh Bus-Truck Owners Association at his residence in Dhanmondi. Despite the minister's assurance, bus owners and workers continued the strike in several parts of the country on Thursday. In Jamalpur, normal transportation has not yet resumed on every route till filing of this report around 6pm. The workers of the Dhanbari area were restricting the movement of vehicles on the Jamalpur-Dhaka route in the evening. On condition of anonymity, one of the Jamalpur Bus-Minibus Workers Union leaders said they had discussed the issue with the transport workers, and plying of passengers on the route would soon return to normal. In Dinajpur, normal transportation services have resumed on the Hili-Bogra route since Thursday morning after the workers were assured that their demands would be met. Confirming the resumption of transportation services, Public Relations Officer Sohrab Hossain of the Hili Land Port said transporting of goods was hampered for the last five days, but normalcy returned as soon as the workers pull out their strike. In Jhenaidah, commuters were forced to use banned three wheelers as hundreds of buses were left in a frozen state at the Kaliganj central bus terminal as the strike was still in force. In Khulna, the same situation prevailed as no inter-district buses left the terminal.  Khulna Motor Workers Union General Secretary Md Ziaur Rahman Mithu said the Bus Owners-Workers Federation presented a draft proposal to the Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges for amending the newly enacted Road Transport Act. In Chuadanga, no passenger buses and goods-carriers left the city on Thursday.  Local vegetable farmers and businessmen expressed fear of huge financial losses as they could not dispatch their goods to different parts of the country. In Naogaon, transport workers have continued their strike for the fourth successive day. When asked why they were continuing the strike, local bus driver Sumon said: \"We did not enforce the strike after consultation with the central leaders. The problem is ours, so we will not call off the strike based on their decision.\" In Narail, commuters had to suffer a lot as no buses left the station. Moreover, they had to count extra money and time for commuting in three wheelers. In Satkhira, although bus services remained suspended, a limited number of trucks were seen plying on the roads. Businessmen of the Bhomra port had to pay twice the usual amount to ship their goods due to the scarcity of trucks. In Tangail, transportation services remained suspended for the second consecutive day on the Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway. Three wheelers were charging extra and long route commuters were opting for trains due to the scarcity of buses. In Kurigram, commuters had to face distress due to the continued strike. Even the transport workers assaulted the drivers of the three wheelers near the central bus terminal.  One of the workers said they will not allow the plying of any transport from the terminal. Later, a police team went to the spot to handle the situation, said Kurigram sadar police station Officer-in-Charge Mahfujur Rahman. In Benapole, government and businessmen of the area had to face huge losses due to the halt in transportation. Benapole Sonali Bank Manager Rakibul Islam said the Benapole Customs was deprived of collecting almost Tk100 crore revenue as the import of goods came to a halt due to the strike and the amount will increase if the strike continues. In Sherpur, transport workers stayed off the road for the fourth consecutive day, causing immense sufferings to commuters. No long route buses and goods-laden vehicles were seen plying on the roads since morning. In Faridpur, activities at the river port came to a halt as the district's truck workers refrained from transporting goods in accordance with the strike. The strike has left several thousand porters and labourers at the port without work while causing suffering to passengers and businessmen.

      "authors": "Md Rashed Chowdhury",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-23 00:00:00      \nClimate vulnerability depends not only on climate change, but also on how we develop Recently, the country experienced several major cyclones (eg Sidr and Aila), indicating that climate change is already impacting Bangladesh, and future effects would further aggravate this already bleak situation. Although there will be stronger tropical cyclones (TCs) observed in the Bay of Bengal, the total number is not expected to vary much. The stronger TCs will have particularly serious impacts on our nation's forestry. The country's coastal forests, such as mangroves and coastal plantations -- including charland plantations -- will be at the forefront of climate change. Sea rise due to high temperatures may submerge coastal forests and settlements, resulting in climate refugees. In the winter, high evapotranspiration combined with low water flow will increase the salinity of the forest soil and coastal waters. These conditions adversely affect freshwater-dependent flora and fauna, in particular, and forest productivity and biodiversity in general. This will eventually shift the character of forest boundaries and vegetation as the species that provide dense canopy cover will be replaced by non-woody shrubs and bushes.    Climate change projections Climate change may affect the country's forest eco-systems, which may result in negative consequences for forest-dependent communities. However, like any other natural systems, forest eco-systems are generally able to tolerate some level of climate change and so will continue to persist in the short term.  In the long term, whether their resilience will be sufficient enough to tolerate future anthropogenic climate change, is not known. Using climate change, including adaptation, as a driver to undertake activities with multiple benefits can catalyze progress in achieving a country's sustainable development goals. Many countries are starting to take action towards adapting to climate change. Such actions need to be expanded and integrated into national and sectoral planning to ensure that sustainable development and adaptation are mutually enhanced. Climate change-based information has the following advantages on a longer time-scale adaptation planning:   * Enhancing the scientific basis for decision-making for adaptations  * Strengthening methods and tools for the assessment of adaptation  * Education, training, and public awareness on adaptation, including for young people  * Individual and institutional capacity-building  * Technology development and transfer; and promotion of local coping strategies  * Appropriate legislation and regulatory frameworks, which promote adaptive-friendly action  * An adaptive planning process that covers different time-scales and levels (eg national, regional) and sectors  We have also experienced the impacts of inter-annual time-scale climate variability El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). From our review, we are fairly confident that ENSO variations will continue to occur and influence global climate in the coming decades and centuries. Therefore, climate change projection combined with a future ENSO event may provide improved perspective for capacity-building efforts in the forestry sector of Bangladesh. Also, future vulnerability depends not only on climate change, but also on development pathways. The implementation of adaptation needs to be integrated into national and international sustainable development priorities, as well as into national and sectoral development plans in Bangladesh. Bangladesh has already started to take concrete action towards adaptation to climate change. However, such action needs to be expanded and integrated into national and sectoral planning to ensure that sustainable development and adaptation are mutually enhanced. Recommendations for improvement Future trends are becoming clear, insofar as there is a need for more quantified spatial specific information, especially on future changes in extremes. This information is needed for improved flood and drought risk analyses. Therefore, we propose a climate change micro-level downscaling analysis of the future climate scenarios for Bangladesh. The output of this downscaling exercise is necessary for future water availability, food security, flood risk analyses, and forest eco-systems. The other major issue that needs to be seriously addressed is the inter-annual variability ENSO. One of the biggest El Nino related threats is forest fire. Forest fires threaten many ecologically-important areas, including habitats for rare species like tigers, and the smoke they give off is a serious threat to local people's health. Improved longer-term projection based on El Nino variability is essential for adapting to forest hazards in Bangladesh. It is also important to improve our understanding of emissions from fires in the region, which would ultimately help improve climate models. It will also contribute to initiatives like the United Nations Collaborative Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation program.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-12-23 00:00:00      \nThe prime minister is in the process of evaluating the first year of her running cabinet  A reshuffle in Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's cabinet is likely to take place as soon as January, government high-ups have said.  The prime minister is now assessing the performances of all the cabinet members during the first year of the current government to this end, they added. \"Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already discussed this issue with President Abdul Hamid,\" a top official from the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) told Dhaka Tribune, requesting not to be named. \"The cabinet reshuffle was scheduled a day or two before the Awami League National Council, but was put on hold. It is most likely to take place during the first week of January.\" Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader, who just got re-elected as the general secretary of the ruling Awami League, has also hinted at the possibility of a reshuffle in the cabinet at the beginning of the new year.  \"There may be changes in the cabinet in the coming year,\" he told the media on Sunday. \"The ministers who did not perform as they were expected to in their respective offices may be reshuffled. Those who failed to do their job will be removed.\" Quader, party chief Sheikh Hasina's second-in-command, further said the prime minister is aiming at separating the roles of Awami League leaders within the party and the government.  That is the reason why seven influential leaders of the party, who are also members of the cabinet, are not a part of the new, partially announced Central Working Committee of the ruling party.  If the prime minister is adamant about separating the party from the government, then some ministers, who are also central leaders of the Awami League, may be gradually dropped from the cabinet.  When contacted on Monday, Abdur Rahman, a newly-elected presidium member of Awami League, told Dhaka Tribune: \"Awami League President Sheikh Hasina is the only authorized person who can tell why some of the ministers are dropped and some retained in the new central committee. I strongly believe that her decision will strengthen our party as well as our government.\"    According to speculations by some government high-ups, cabinet members like State Minister for Shipping Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Enamur Rahman, Deputy Minister for Water Resources AKM Enamul Hoque Shameem, and Deputy Minister for Education Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury Nowfel may get promoted during the reshuffle. Khalid, Enamul Hoque and Nowfel, who were organizing secretaries in the previous central committee of the Awami League, were dropped from the new committee.  The government sources further said some cabinet members' portfolios might be changed in the upcoming reshuffle, but the chances of cabinet members losing office is very slim as they have had only a year to work.  Requesting anonymity, a cabinet member recently told Dhaka Tribune that the Prime Minister's Office sought information on the cabinet members' performance over the past one year. \"The PMO issued a letter asking us how many days each of the cabinet members had spent abroad last year,\" the cabinet member said. \"We think the PMO is working on our ACR as January 7 is this cabinet's first anniversary.\" Winning the December 30 general election last year, the new, 46-member strong cabinet, led by Awami League President Sheikh Hasina, was sworn in on January 7 this year, with Hasina as the prime minister for the third consecutive term.  Five months later, on May 19, State Minister Murad Hassan was moved to the Ministry of Information from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The prime minister also shuffled personnel at the Ministries of Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives, and the Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology. On July 13, the prime minister promoted State Minister for Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment Imran Ahmad to the rank of minister. On the same day, she appointed Fazilatun Nessa Indira as the state minister for women and children affairs. "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-17 00:00:00      \nThe government's market interventions have been largely ineffective Bangladesh's resilient farmers recouped the 2017 devastating flood-induced crop damages by growing more rice over the last few growing seasons including the current Boro. This high rice output brings much relief to the government that spent millions of Taka importing a record four million tons of rice in 2017-18 through public and private channels. But much to the misery of growers, the prices that they are being offered for their produces in the current marketing season is non-commensurate to their production costs.   For the past one week - news and pictures of aggrieved farmers taking to the streets demanding fair price for rice and different socio-cultural and student groups rallying supports for the same cause hogged the media attention big time and deservedly so.   Yesterday too, farmers blocked a highway in rice-rich northern region of Rangpur - spreading paddy grains on the road - demanding the government to purchase paddy directly from farms, and ensure a fair price.   Production projection Bangladesh's rice production is expected to increase for the second straight year in a row, thanks to good weather and increased yield due to continuing cultivation of hybrid and high-yielding varieties (HYV). Following the crop loss in 2017 due to Haor zone's flood and crop diseases, the country's rice growers bounced back with a higher production - nearly 35 million tons in 2018-19 making the country self reliant in staple production again.    According to the Ministry of Food, country's current stock of rice in public granaries is over one million tons, well above the comfortable food safety threshold level.   Farmers getting poor price  Polash Kanti Nath heads a farmers' organization goes by the name - Krishak Sangram Parishad (KSP).   He said, \"It costs around Tk700-Tk 800 to produce a maund of paddy but we can only sell it for Tk400. Even buyers are few in number.\" Another farmer Momtaj Uddin said: \"The government has promised to buy paddy directly from farmers, but we do not see that happening here. We are not getting a fair price for the paddy, so we are protesting.\"  And in Tangail, some college students came forward to help a local paddy farmer Abdul Malek harvest his crops after he set some of it on fire, protesting the steep fall in paddy prices and after not being able to afford the high labour costs for harvesting the paddy. Shahidul Islam runs a rice mill in Kushtia's Khwajanagar, one of the largest wholesale rice markets in the country. Talking to this correspondent over phone yesterday, Shahidul acknowledged that millers and traders are offering Boro farmers much lower a price this year compared to last year's prices. He said millers have already enough carryover rice in their stock and that's why there is no urgency to buy rice from the growers.  Lukewarm public procurement  On March 31 this year the government decided to procure over a million tons of paddy and rice from the farmers at a good price offers of Tk. 26 and Tk. 36 a kg respectively. Government's food department was supposed to provide the farmers with this price support from April 25 but eventually the public grain procurement process kicked start much later only in mid-May. Dr Akhter Ahmed of the Washington-based food policy think-tank International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) told Dhaka Tribune that government's late entry into the market and buying rice from traders and millers instead of farmers would not help offset the situation. He wondered if the government in West Bengal, India can buy paddy directly from the farmers why can't be it possible in Bangladesh.  Anwar Faruque, who served the agriculture ministry in Bangladesh for many years prior retiring as the ministry secretary, told this correspondent that with a paltry volume of public procurement the food department would not be able to make much impact on rice pricing in the market. \"Why shouldn't government procure three million tons of rice from farmers and give them the price support? If the public granaries suffer from space constraint, the government can always keep the procured rice in hired private godowns.\" Unwise tariff regime    Market is glutted with cheaper imported rice because of zero tariff still in place on rice import, said Faruque adding that \"Government said we lost 1.9 million tons of rice in Haor flood in 2017 and import tariff was cut from a whopping 28 percent to zero.\"  But after periodic reviews, he thinks, the government should have re-imposed tariffs on rice import thereby, giving much required protection to domestic rice growers.  Will exporting rice ease the solution? Agriculture Minister Dr Abdur Razzque told reporters yesterday that government would export rice to ease the situation. He said government is now in a position to even export over a million tons of rice. Dr Akhter considers entering into the rice export market is not that easy and such an intervention even if is conceived now its benefit would not trickle down to the farmers rather, it would only benefit the big millers and traders - who had purchased rice from farmers at a cheap rate and hoarded that for quite some time to make a windfall.  \"Countries like Thailand and Vietnam developed a place for them in a very competitive rice export market over a period of time. It'll not be so easy for Bangladesh to make a sudden inroad into that global rice market,\" explained Dr Akhter. If in tobacco, why not in rice? An expert, who has been following increasing instability in rice pricing in disfavor of paddy growers in Bangladesh, told Dhaka Tribune each year government facilitates fixing procurement price of tobacco from farmers for private tobacco companies.  \"Why can't it do it for the rice growers? It's understandable government will not be able to buy all 35 million tons of rice that Bangladeshi farmers grow a year but the least government can do is dictate the market by fixing floor price for rice for private buyers and sellers,\" said the expert, who works for an organization where he is not authorized to speak to the press on record. All the other experts that t Dhaka Tribune talked to were also of the view that the government needs to streamline its paddy procurement process so that farmers and not traders are benefited and it has to reign in the profit-mongering middlemen, millers who made most of the paddy profits depriving the principal stakeholder - the farmers."

Two fishermen were also rescued alive from the vessel. \"We were informed that a fishing boat has washed up ashore after capsizing on early hours of Wednesday. A Tourist Police team went to the scene immediately and began a rescue operation. Six dead bodies were recovered and two persons were rescued alive from the boat,\" Tourist Police Cox's Bazar Superintendent Zillur Rahman said while confirming the incident on Wednesday morning. He also said the dead bodies were recovered in a decomposed state and had no marks of injuries. \"We believe that the boat and the fishermen had drifted into Bangladesh territory from Myanmar. As there is currently a fishing ban on our territorial waters and Signal 5 was hoisted at maritime ports for the last five days, it can be assumed that the boat did not capsize in our waters,\" he added. The dead bodies have been sent to Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital for autopsy.  \"The two rescued alive are receiving treatment at Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital. We are working to get more details regarding the incident,\" Cox's Bazar Sadar Model Police Station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Md Farid Uddin Khandaker told Dhaka Tribune.  "

State Minister of Foreign Affairs M Shahriar Alam informed of Bangladesh's decision to Japanese State Minister for Foreign Affairs Toshiko Abe during a meeting held on the sidelines of the 4th Indian Ocean Conference, at Male in Maldives, on Wednesday. Toshiko Abe expressed her country's gratitude to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for meeting all the family members of the Japanese victims of the terror attack. Shahriar thanked Japan for facilitating the very fruitful visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina earlier in May this year.  Referring to the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed last month in Tokyo, he expressed gratitude to the Japanese government for listing Bangladesh as a country for skilled migration.  It was highlighted that both governments will work closely to deliver on the MoU as per the agreement.  Shahriar Alam updated his Japanese counterpart on the latest status of over 1.1 million Rohingyas sheltered by Bangladesh, including Bangladesh's concerns about security at the camps. He underscored that Bangladesh needs the support of Japan for the repatriation of the Rohingyas safely and with dignity to Myanmar, and for their settlement at Bhashan Char. Toshiko Abe mentioned that Japan is particularly happy that Bangladesh has decided to name metro rail stations after the names of the Holey Artisan victims.  Both sides agreed on timely implementation of ODA, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here. Shahriar called for Japanese support for building a new railway bridge over the Jamuna River. The Japanese side reassured their support and cooperation to build the railway bridge.  The State Minister led the Bangladesh delegation to the 4th Indian Ocean Conference organized by India Foundation in association with the government of the Maldives and S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Singapore from 3-4 September. He is also a member of the IOC Organizing Committee.  The theme of IOC 2019 is \"Securing the Indian Ocean Region: Traditional and Non-Traditional Challenges.\""

The ambassador made the request when he made a courtesy call on the premier at Ganabhaban in Dhaka on Wednesday, said PM's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim, reports BSS. Recalling the long history and close relations between the two countries, Malikzad said his country is keen to promote trade and business relations with Bangladesh. Afghanistan was one of the first countries that recognized Bangladesh after its independence, he said, appreciating Bangladesh's economic progress and graduation from the LDC to the status of developing countries. Welcoming the newly appointed Afghan Ambassador in Dhaka, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina stressed strengthening the trade relations between Dhaka and Kabul, saying that Bangladesh gives value to relations with its neighbours. Bangladesh imports a huge amount of dry foods from Afghanistan every year and Afghanistan can import high quality medicine from Bangladesh, she said. Congratulating Sheikh Hasina for her party's victory in the last general election, the Afghan envoy underscored the need for strengthening cooperation between the two countries, especially between its chambers of commerce. Sheikh Hasina said people voted for her party as they benefit when the Awami League comes to power. She said her government is running the country with commitment to meet the basic needs of people, as dreamt by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. In this regard, the prime minister highlighted her government's social safety net program for the marginalized people, saying financial support is being provided for promotion of education of poor families and distressed people under the program. Sheikh Hasina also drew a line between the economic progress of Bangladesh and Pakistan after the independence.  \"After the independence, the exchange rate of Bangladeshi Taka and Pakistani Rupee was 1.56 and 1.00. Now the rate is 1.00 and 1.66,\" she said. The Afghan envoy informed the prime minister that the two countries are waiting to sign five memorandums of understanding (MoU). He also informed the prime minister that democracy in his country is progressing and expressed his willingness to import more pharmaceutical items from Bangladesh. Principal Secretary Md Nojibur Rahman and PMO Secretary Sajjadul Hasan were also present."

As part of the demonstration, the Uber riders also staged a sit-in procession in the afternoon. The agitating riders alleged that the ride-sharing company suddenly decided to trim its base fare from Tk 30 to Tk 25 and per kilometer fare from Tk 12 to Tk 10. During the demonstration, which continued for around two hours from 11am in front of the Uber office, the aggrieved riders chanted slogans against the fare-cut and asked the authorities concerned to withdraw the decision. Md Russel, an Uber rider, told the Dhaka Tribune that the Uber authorities suddenly reduced the base fare by Tk 5 and kilometre fare by Tk 2. \"When we approached the local office about the reduction, they said that they have nothing to do as it was decided centrally,\" said the Uber rider. Threatening to go on tougher movement if the decision is not repelled, the riders said they would boycott the ride-sharing platform, if necessary.   The Uber riders announced to stage demonstrations in the Agrabad area on Wednesday.      At present, around 15,000 Uber riders are operating the port city."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-07-18 00:00:00      \nErshad's political genius was unquestionable This is not an homage to late President Ershad, nor an appraisal of him, but a paean to his political genius that kept Bangladesh enchanted for the last four decades. His politics was of a kind that distilled the best of Kautilya in personal dealings and Machiavelli in politics. His politics, which was a potpourri of wheeling and dealing, bargaining, brinkmanship, and dumbfounding somersaults, kept all entertained. But above all, these essential Ershadian qualities also were reasons for his survival, politically that is, until the last day of his life. He survived his nine years as president, and years of political high-rolling thereafter, despite charges of criminal conduct including political killing, and imprisonment due to his unparalleled swashbuckling as a politician. No stigma would stick to him because he wore a Teflon suit all along.   I knew late General HM Ershad a little more than most other Bangladeshis, because of my job with the government as a deputy commissioner in the mid-70s. Not because my job required to work with him -- he was second to the strongman at that time, General Ziaur Rahman. But Ershad did not interject himself in the life of a civilian administrator such as me because the role he was given by General Zia. As chief of general staff in the early period of martial law in Bangladesh (1975-77), General Ershad was also made chairman of National Security Cell -- an agency that was entrusted with the task of prosecuting people under martial law (among other tasks).  My interaction with General Ershad that time was as head of the district coordination committee of martial law cases in Noakhali, which included the local police chief, an army representative with the rank of a major, and myself as deputy commissioner. Our job was to review cases filed under martial law and recommend those for prosecution to the National Security Cell. In my years of heading this district body, I never had to meet Ershad, nor had I any conversation with him.  I only received memos and letters signed by him in his capacity as NSC chief. In fact, I did not even know how Ershad looked. We knew of him, but never knew him. I never received even a phone call from him.  My first person-to-person contact with him was for a completely unexpected reason, over phone in Chittagong. The reason was installation of flood lights in Chittagong stadium, a fancy project that time that General Zia had asked me to undertake. The project was a pet issue with General Zia, who had this obsession with keeping people busy at night with sports, after lighting up Dhaka stadium at a huge cost. (Rumour had it at that time that flood lighting of Dhaka Stadium was spearheaded by General Ershad, who was also head of the National Sports Authority). When President Zia had asked me (as deputy commissioner I was the president of District Sports Association) that I initiate a project to similarly install flood lights in Chittagong Stadium, I initially demurred by saying that the cost would be prohibitive, and unlike Dhaka there were very few sporting clubs in Chittagong which could draw spectators for nightly sports. But General Zia was adamant. The project was drawn mainly to please President Zia with little hope of it ever getting funded because Chittagong Sports Association was a financially indigent entity. There was also no way I could ask for government funds for such a luxury project which the engineers estimated would cost around Tk5 crore (1979-80).   I did not move with the project anywhere when I received a phone call from General Ershad. I first thought the call was related to his visits to Chittagong Hill Tracts. But I was surprised. After his usual polite greetings, he broke into the subject. \"I understand you are going to install flood lights in Chittagong stadium.\"  Before I could proceed with my query as to how he came to know about this, Ershad said that he knew of a very well-qualified engineering company which had installed flood lights in Dhaka stadium, and he would be pleased if I could consider the firm for the Chittagong project.  He also added that the firm people would like to meet with me. My surprise knew no bounds. Here I was with what I considered to be a dead-on arrival project with nary the sign of a taka, Ershad was asking me to award the project to his nominee!   After I recovered myself from the shock, I replied to Ershad that I was glad he was showing some interest in the project because I could then rely on him to lobby the president for some funds. It was now Ershad's turn to be surprised. \"What, you have no funds and you are going with the project?\" he asked. I replied politely that we had not invited tenders for the project for that reason. To my astonishment, Ershad did not pursue the subject anymore. He ended his conversation then and there. But my surprise did not end there. Immediately after the phone conversation had ended, my assistant told me that a party from Dhaka was waiting outside to see me with a message from General Ershad. I immediately knew which party it could be, but what surprised me was the timing. Was the party waiting on queue?  The party consisted of three people. Two were contractors who had installed the floodlighting in Dhaka. Third was a banker who was rumoured to be a go-between. I received the party politely, but again had to shock them with the news of no funds. They left disappointed. General Ershad never took up the subject with me again. But the actual floodlighting of Chittagong Stadium did happen, much after Zia's death when Ershad became president. He knew when to stop, and when to start again.  My second person-to-person interaction with Ershad was a couple of years later, in May 1981, three weeks before Zia's assassination. The occasion was the so-called annual air-sea battle among the three branches of armed forces. Even though the event was strictly military, President Zia had chosen to invite a gaggle of his cabinet members including then Prime Minister Shah Azizur Rahman to the event causing a housing nightmare for the administration.  The local administration had to find lodging for about a dozen ministers and the prime minister in short notice in whatever rest houses and motels that were available since the prime accommodations including the Circuit House were taken over by the army for the president, chief of staff, and other military top brasses. It was the morning after I had my second person to person conversation with General Ershad when I went to the Circuit House to escort the president to the airport (as protocol required). While I was waiting in the lounge for the president, General Ershad presented himself there and took me aside. He told me that he had heard that the PM was rather upset by the lodging arrangement as though it was a surprise to him.  I was not sure if Ershad was mocking or really serious. \"Yes of course,\" I replied adding that the PM expected to be accommodated in the Circuit House. I wanted to further add the fact of Shah Aziz not being invited to the dinner hosted by Ershad last night, but I did not. Ershad was unruffled. He smiled and said in his suave manner: \"Please handle it, DC sahib. I know you can do it.\" He said in a way that the problem was mine and not his.  It was a district administration issue. He left immediately thereafter with his army colleagues, giving me another \"you can do it\" wink. He treated the subject like it had never happened.  I did not have to do anything to placate Shah Aziz because I knew that Shah Aziz knew the administration had nothing to do with the affront meted out to him and his colleagues. The only person he could complain to was the president himself, and Shah Aziz knew that it would be to no avail. Ershad also knew well that President Zia valued his relationship with the top brasses of the armed forces more than his kitchen cabinet.  General Ershad had perfected the art of concealing his true feelings on a topic or a person to a degree that his interlocutor could never guess his mind. He could be very angry, yet never show it. He could be totally equivocating and yet appear to be honest or even naive. That is why he could survive politically for years. Ziauddin Choudhury has worked in the higher civil service of Bangladesh early in his career, and later for the World Bank in the US."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-25 00:00:00      \n'So, the students who were trapped used the windows to escape with help from locals and fire service officials'  A fire which broke out at a campus of the Daffodil Polytechnic Institute in Dhaka's Kalabagan has exposed the building's lack of fire safety protocols which put hundreds of its students' lives at risk. The small scale fire that caused no casualties forced the students use windows to climb down from the second and third floor of the building with the help of outsiders who extended their helping hands with bamboos. Later, firefighters joined the locals and rescued the rest of the students trapped inside. The students could have suffocated from toxic fumes if the help had not come on time as there were no fire escapes in the building except for a narrow staircase. The fire originated from an electric short circuit around 11am and the flames were doused after one and a half hours, said Fire Service and Civil Defence officials. Abdullah Al Mamun, a fireman of the Mohammadpur Fire Station, said Daffodil Polytechnic Institute never conducted any fire drills to create awareness in case of a fire emergency. Seeking anonymity, a student of the Daffodil Polytechnic Institute, said: \"There aren't any emergency exits in our campus. As the fire originated from the main switch board installed beside the main staircase on the ground flood, the smoke quickly travelled up and prevented students from getting down. So, the students who were trapped used the windows to escape with help from locals and fire service officials.\"   \"We had found only one fire extinguisher for each floor, but when we tried to use them, we found them to be defective.\"  \"If a bigger fire breaks out in the future, there will be massive casualties and damages. The administration should take necessary fire safety measures as soon as possible,\" he added. According to Arif Miah, an office staff of the campus, the institution uses four floors of this five storey building and every floor is 2,500 square feet. Around 350 students attend classes regularly in this campus. Many students were in their classes when the fire broke out. Arif showed this correspondent five fire extinguishers which were all defective and lying beside the main switch board, where the fire had originated.  According to the Fire Service and Civil Defence, the building safety protocol dictates that at least two fire extinguishers have to be installed for every 1,000 square feet of a floor besides emergency exits and other fire safety equipment. At least one fire drill every month is mandatory for educational establishments, says the Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC). When contacted, the administrative office refused to make any statement regarding this matter."

The idea of moving Indonesia's seat of government from an urban conglomeration of nearly 30 million people with some of the world's worst traffic jams has stretched on for decades. Low-lying Jakarta is also prone to annual flooding and is one of the world's fastest sinking cities due to excessive groundwater extraction. Indonesia wants to move the capital from sinking Jakarta https://t.co/g0ejcImWZL On Monday, urban planning minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said the long-stalled relocation plan won approval from President Joko Widodo who favoured moving the capital away from Indonesia's most populous Java island. Jakarta, which suffers billions of dollars in annual congestion-and-flood linked economic losses, would remain the country's financial hub. \"Widodo decided on the option to relocate the capital,\" Brodjonegoro said after a cabinet meeting.  In a statement before the meeting, Widodo expressed support for the idea, but he did not give an alternate location or a timeline for any move. \"In the future, would Jakarta be able to carry the double burden of being both the centre of government and its business centre?\" he asked in the statement. \"If we prepare well from the very beginning, this great relocation idea could be realised,\" he added. During his re-election campaign, Widodo pledged to spread economic growth more evenly in the nation of 260 million.  He won a second term this month, according to unofficial poll results.  Local media have reported that a possible new capital would be Palangkaraya city on the island of Borneo."

      "authors": "Fahim Reza Shovon",
      "text": "Date Published:2019-10-11 00:00:00      \nVC says sorry for 'lacking' in his role; protest to continue Amid growing protests by students demanding justice for Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology's (Buet) slain student Abrar Fahad, the university authorities have banned student politics on the campus. This apart, Buet also suspended 19 of its students who have been named in the Abrar murder case. Buet Vice Chancellor (VC) Prof Saiful Islam announced the decisions around 5:45pm yesterday, nearly four hours after the 2pm deadline the agitating students set for him to meet them, clarifying his stance on a 10-point demand. The meeting between Buet authorities led by the VC, and the protesters started at Buet auditorium around 5:30pm, on the fifth day of demonstrations that erupted after several now-expelled Buet Chhatra League leaders killed Abrar Fahad in the early hours on Monday. Earlier yesterday, several hundred students of the university gathered in front of Buet Shaheed Minar at 11am with placards, and chanted different slogans demanding capital punishment for Abrar's killers.  On Thursday afternoon, the students placing a charter of 10 demands threatened to lock down all the academic, and administrative buildings of the university, if the VC failed to meet them by 2pm on Friday.   The protesters, at that time, clarified that they demanded the banning of political party-affiliated student organizations on campus, not student politics as a whole. Several hours later, the VC agreed to sit with them to decide on their demands.  Abrar, a second year student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of Buet, was beaten to death at Sher-e-Bangla Hall. The killers-- all Buet students--beat him for his alleged involvement with Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, an unsubstantiated claim which is yet to be proven. VC says sorry for his role  During the meeting, the VC apologized to the students for \"lacking\" in the role he should have played immediately after the incident.  \"I did have some shortcomings. I beg apology,\" said the VC adding: \"I am extremely sorry as I could not appear on time.\" VC Saiful went on saying that the Buet authorities will bear all the expenses needed to run the murder case, as well as to compensate the victim's family.  Promising to take necessary measures to stop ragging by the students, he assured that the university authorities will write to the government seeking speedy trial of the killers.  The VC has been drawing the protesters' wrath since he did not show up on the campus until after 5pm on Tuesday, nearly 40 hours after Abrar was reported dead.  His finally made a public appearance, and issued a statement around 5:30pm that day, after the students set a 5pm deadline.  However, sources at his office claimed that the VC failed to make public appearance due to illness.  Protesters also demanded his resignation.  Criticism over the matter did not just stop there. The Awami League-led 14-party alliance, too, yesterday lashed out at him. The alliance's spokesperson Mohammed Nasim at a meeting in Dhaka said: \"We're hurt over the delay by Buet VC in reaching there (Sher-e-Bangla Hall). This is so unfortunate, something we cannot expect from a VC.\"  Protests to continue as campus still 'unsafe' Despite assurance from the authorities regarding meeting their demands, protesters announced to keep protesting on campus until the entire campus becomes safe for all students.  According to them, leaders and activists of some student fronts including Chhatra League are still residing at different dormitories of Buet.  For this reason, they did not even retreat from their decision of boycotting Buet admission test slated for October 14. The murder sparked protests not only in a number of higher educational institutions in Dhaka, but also in many universities, cities, and divisional headquarters across the country.  Abrar, a second year student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department of the university, was beaten to death by some activists, and leaders of Bangladesh Chhatra League's Buet unit inside the university's Sher-e-Bangla Hall in the early hours of Monday. Abrar's father filed a murder case against 19 people-- all Buet students--with Chawkbazar police station on Monday evening.  Until yesterday evening, 18 accused were arrested. Of them, 17 have been placed on remand for different periods."

RAB said the animals were being used to extort foreign tourists and locals. Shaheen , 25 and Helal 22, were using the elephants to extort money from people. They were each sentenced to two years of imprisonment. Confirming the matter, RAB Executive Magistrate Sarwar Alam said: \"The elephants have been handed over to the Bangladesh National Zoo at Mirpur.\" RAB said Shaheen and Helal were using the animals to block the road in front of Karwan Bazar Hotel Super Star. The duo directed the elephants to put the trunks inside vehicles of foreign tourists in an attempt to scare them into handing over money. \"They were intimidating all the passengers. Passengers of other vehicles in the area were told to keep the money ready for collection beforehand\" the RAB executive magistrate said. At one point the foreign tourists called the police. Sarwar Alam said he and RAB-2 Superintendent of Police Muhammad Mohiuddin Faruqi instructed the elephant riders to leave the road.  However, they refused to cooperate. The elephant riders entered Karwan Bazar on the backs of the elephants; they damaged four private cars. The RAB followed them, instructing them to stop, but they would not heed the warnings and kept proceeding. They were finally detained from the Hatirjheel-Modhubagh area. \"After interrogating them we found out they have been roaming different parts of the capital for a long time extorting money from people,\" Sarwar Alam said."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-10 00:00:00      \nA leader who was always one with the people For our generation who witnessed the birth of Bangladesh, it is a daunting task to express in words the unique role played by the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman in the creation of the new state. It is even more challenging to analyze the political ideas underpinning his life's work. Whenever I think of Bangabandhu I first remember those exciting and memorable days of March 1971.  I consider myself to be very lucky that I was able to witness the events of March 1971 and Bangabandhu's role in creating history. Very few people are fortunate enough to see the making of history. I witnessed the transformation of our movement for autonomy into our struggle for independence. I witnessed how the main actor of this historic transformation, Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman, realized an impossible dream. There have been leaders in other countries who led their nations. But few could create history. Bangabandhu was one such rare grand actor of history. It is unfortunate that even after 48 years of our independence and 43 years after his assassination there is no well-researched comprehensive biography of Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujibur Rahman. Fortunately two recent books, based on his personal diaries, have been published which can serve as original source that help us understand his ideals and political philosophy.  The first book, The Unfinished Memoirs, published in 2012, throws light on his childhood, and early political life. Though The Unfinished Memoirs does not include events after the late 1950s it still illuminates his political thoughts very clearly.    The second book, Karagarer Rojnamcha (prison diaries) which was published in 2017, is based on his diaries when he was in prison after he launched the six point movement in 1966. Here again his political thoughts are made very clear. He discusses at length the different methods of suppression of people's movements pursued by an autocratic state. He highlights the importance of fundamental civil and political rights, particularly the need for ensuring freedom of expressions for sustaining democracy. In this article I quote extensively from his writings so that we can hear his own voice. To understand his political philosophy we should always keep in mind that Bangabandhu spent most of his life as a political player outside state power. He struggled against colonial and undemocratic state power, first against the British and later against the Pakistan state to establish the economic, political, and cultural rights of the Bengalees.  He exercised state power only for a limited period of time -- barely three and a half years after independence. His political discourse, as illustrated in these two books, is that of a leader fighting authoritarian state power, not that of a leader who was using state power to govern a country.  One of the remarkable features of his political life was his transformation from an ordinary rank and file worker of a political party to an unparalleled leader of millions of people. Bangabandhu possessed outstanding organizational capacity; at the same time he was a great orator. Generally we do not find such a combination of qualities in one leader.  In his Unfinished Memoirs Bangabandhu notes that he was more interested in party organizational work than in discussing theoretical and ideological issues. Though he was not a political theoretician, Bangabandhu had a few specific political ideals and goals and he worked consistently to achieve them. His values are best captured in three sentences which Bangabandhu penned on May 3, 1973. He writes: \"As a man, what concerns mankind concerns me. As a Bengalee, I am deeply involved in all that concerns Bengalees. This abiding involvement is born of and nourished by love, enduring love, which gives meaning to my politics and to my very being.\" The above quote makes it clear that Bangabandhu identified himself both as a human being and as a Bengalee.  This self-identification helps us explore the main features of his political philosophy, such as nationalism, secularism, socialism, and people-orientation.  Nationalism Independence, liberation, and democracy  From the beginning of his political life, Bangabandhu was proud of his Bengali national identity. He was involved in the Pakistan movement but he believed that Pakistan should be established on the basis of the Lahore Resolution which envisaged two Muslim majority independent sovereign states.  He perceived the nationalist movement not simply as a struggle to gain independence from the rule of an external colonial power but also as a struggle for the economic and political emancipation of the down-trodden masses from various forms of oppression.  He joined the Pakistan movement in the hope that poor Muslim peasants will be liberated from the exploitation of the landlord classes. He had always viewed the Bengali nationalist movement as a movement for the achievement of democracy as well as liberation of the oppressed people. Thus on March 7, 1971 he called upon the people to launch simultaneously the struggle for independence and liberation.      Prior to the establishment of Pakistan, when as a student in Kolkata, Bangabandhu joined the Muslim League. He belonged to the Shaheed Suhrawardy and Abul Hashem faction of the party which was known as the progressives group. In his Unfinished Memoirs he writes: \"Under Mr Suhrawardy's leadership we wanted to make the Muslim League the party of the people and make it represent middle-class Bengali aspirations. Upto that time Muslim League had not become an organization that was rooted in the people. It used to serve the interests of landlords, moneyed men, and Nawabs and Khan Bahadurs.\" After the creation of Pakistan, Bangabandhu returned to Dhaka and became involved in various progressive movements and organizations which championed the linguistic, cultural, and economic rights of the Bengalis. In 1948 he was imprisoned for participating in the movement demanding recognition of Bengali as one of the state languages of Pakistan.  He was also involved in other social and political protest movements, such as the movement of poor peasants against prohibiting inter-district trade in rice known as the \"cordon\" system. He supported the movement of the fourth class employees of Dhaka university and was again imprisoned in 1949.  Within a relatively short period after the establishment of Pakistan he became convinced about the need for establishing an opposition political party not only for championing the rights of the Bengalis but also to challenge the authoritarian rule of the Muslim League. In his Unfinished Memoirs he explained the rationale for the establishment of the Awami League in the following way: \"There is no point in pursuing the Muslim League any longer. This party has now become the establishment. They can no longer be called a party of the people ... if we did not form an organization that could take on the role of the opposition the country would turn into a dictatorship.\" In 1949, the Awami Muslim League (AML) was founded and Bangabandhu was elected the joint secretary of the party though he was still in prison. In 1953 he became the general secretary of the party. The demand for self-rule gained increasing popular support in East Bengal from the mid-1950s. In 1955 Bangabandhu became a member of the Pakistan National Assembly (NA). In one of his speeches in the NA we already find a strong articulation of various demands of the Bengali nationalists and his strong sense of Bengali identity. He said:  \"They want to place the word 'East Pakistan' instead of 'East Bengal.' We have demanded so many times that you should use Bengal instead of Pakistan. The word Bengal has a history, has a tradition of its own. You can change it only after people have been consulted. If you want to change it then we have to go back to Bengal and ask them whether they accept it ... what about the state language Bengali? What about joint electorate? What about autonomy? ... I appeal to my friends on that side to allow the people to give their verdict in any way, in the form of referendum or in the form of plebiscite.\" In the council session of the party in 1955 the Awami League (AL) dropped the word \"Muslim\" from its name and Bangabandhu again became the general secretary of the party. In February 1966, Bangabandhu presented his historic six points demand which put forward a very radical notion of provincial autonomy leaving only limited powers in the hands of the central government.  In March of that year he became the president of the AL and began a country-wide campaign to popularize the six points which soon became the sole agenda of the party. Six points captured the aspirations of the nation and it was billed as the charter for the liberation of the Bengalis. Following the launch of the six points, Bangabandhu was again imprisoned and he was charged with treason by the Pakistan government in the Agartala conspiracy case.  In 1969, Ayub fell from power in the face of massive students' movement. Bangabandhu was released from prison and the students conferred on him the title of Bangabandhu (friend of Bengal). During the 1970 election campaign Bangabandhu started using nationalist slogans such as \"Bangladesh\" and \"Joy Bangla.\"  Thus, within a relatively short span of four years, between 1966 to 1970, Bangabandhu was able to unite the whole Bengali nation behind his demand for liberation and independence. I do not think any other nationalist leader had been so successful in mobilizing such a huge number of people within such a short period of time.  It is noteworthy that though throughout his life Bangabandhu was involved in movement politics and talked about people's emancipation from exploitation and oppression, he believed in peaceful non-violent political movements. From 1947 till 1970 the Bengali nationalist movement became stronger day-by-day under his leadership but he stayed within the bounds of democratic politics.  Whenever Pakistani rulers gave opportunities for election he participated in them, though the elections were often not free and fair and attempts were made to foil the election results. In Karagarer Rojnamcha he points out repeatedly that by limiting the democratic space an autocratic regime ultimately leads the country towards terrorist politics. He writes:   \"Newspapers arrived. I was alarmed that they [the Pakistani government] are trying to shut down democratic politics ... If anybody criticizes the government there will be cases against them under the proposed secret act ... I myself am facing five cases under article 124, section 7 (3) for making public speeches ... My fear is they are leading Pakistan toward terrorist politics. We do not believe in that politics. But those of us who want to do good for the people through democratic politics, our space is shrinking.\"      Secularism Non-communalism and equal rights for all citizens Though he was a Bengali nationalist, Bangabandhu never tried to create division and hatred between different identity groups. Many nationalist politicians use provocative languages and symbols that encourage violence between different groups. These days we are witnessing the rise of such nationalist leaders even in Western democratic countries who are trying to instigate intolerance and violence towards minority groups. But Bangabandhu's nationalist politics was different. He believed in co-existence and mutual tolerance of different identity groups and talked about equal rights of all citizens. He always stood against communal violence.  Though he was involved in the Pakistan movement he believed that in India, Muslims and in Pakistan, Hindus should enjoy equal rights as citizens and live together in peace and harmony. He talked about equal rights of all groups to practice their respective religions.  He witnessed the communal riots in Kolkata on August 16, 1947. He points out that Suhrawardy asked his supporters to observe the day in a peaceful way so that no blame could fall on the Suhrawardy government. But unfortunately, communal riots did break out in Kolkata and later spread to Noakhali. Bangabandhu saved both Muslims and Hindus from acts of communal violence in Kolkata. Later when Suhrawardy joined Mahatma Gandhi in efforts to bring back communal harmony, Bangabandhu joined them. After returning to Dhaka he joined Gonotantrik Jubo League and took up the cause of building communal harmony as his main mission. He was against all forms of communal violence, not simply between Hindus and Muslims but also between different Muslim sects and between Bengalis and non-Bengalis.  In his Unfinished Memoirs he strongly condemns the anti-Kadiyani riots that took place in Lahore in 1953. In 1954, when riots broke out between Bengali and non-Bengali workers in Adamjee jute mills in Narayanganj, he rushed to the area to calm the situation. In 1964 when Hindu-Muslim riots spread in India he started a civic campaign to prevent communal riots in East Bengal. Even in his March 7, 1971 speech he asked people to remain vigilant against the threat of communal violence. He said: \"Be very careful, keep in mind that the enemy has infiltrated our ranks to engage in the work of provocateurs. Whether Bengalee or non-Bengalee, Hindu or Muslim, all are our brothers and it is our responsibility to ensure their safety.\" In his personal life he followed the preachings of Islam. But Bangabandhu was against the political use of religion. He condemned the Muslim League's practice of using the slogan of Islam and not paying attention to the economic well-being of the people which he argued was the goal for which \"the working class, the peasants, and the labourers had made sacrifice during the movement for independence.\"  Socialism Equality, freedom from exploitation, and oppression   In his Unfinished Memoirs Bangabandhu writes: \"I myself am no communist, but I believe in socialism and not in capitalism. I believe capital is a tool of the oppressor. As long as capitalism is the mainspring of the economic order people all over the world will continue to be oppressed.\" By socialism he meant a system that would free people from exploitation and oppression and remove inequality. He visited China in 1952 which left a deep imprint in his mind. He found great differences in the living conditions of people in Pakistan and China which he attributed to the differences in the two political systems.  Bangabandhu believed that the government has a role to play in removing inequality and freeing people from exploitation. He admired the priorities set by the Chinese government in improving the socio-economic conditions of the people. He writes:  \"Everywhere we could see new schools and colleges coming up. The government has taken charge of education.\" He further writes: \"The communist government had confiscated the land owned by landlords and had distributed it among all farmers. Thus landless peasants had become land owners. China now belonged to peasants and workers and the class that used to dominate and exploit had had their day.\" He did not want to see inequality grow in Bangladesh. In the council session of the AL held during April 7-8, 1972, he reiterated his commitment to promote an exploitation-free socio-economic system and socialism was formally adopted as one of the ideals of the party. In the next council session of the party held in 1974 he, again, pledged to work for freeing the nation of exploitation and oppression. People Orientation People's issues, people's politics   Often we find leaders who lead people towards great goals but they do not become emotionally involved with the people. Bangabandhu was an exception. When I compare the speeches of various leaders of the world with those of Bangabandhu, one of his off-repeated expressions -- \"love for people\" -- stands out as unique. He often talked about his love for people and people's love for him in return.  He always prioritized the issues that are upper-most in ordinary people's lives. His politics was people's politics. During the campaign for Pakistan when famine struck, he worked in feeding centres for the famine victims. He worked to rescue the victims of communal riots in Kolkata. He participated in street rallies demanding food security for the poor in East Bengal. His political philosophy was not centred only around the goal of getting state power: He developed his political ideas by being involved with the concerns of the ordinary masses.  This people's orientation made him a pragmatist. In his diaries he constantly refers to issues that would affect ordinary people's everyday life such as the rise in essential commodity prices or tax increase or flood or famine.    At one level, Bangabandhu was a man of the masses. He learned about people's aspirations from them. At another level he was the leader of the people. He carried forward ordinary people's aspirations. He had faith in people. That is why he could call upon people on March 7, 1971 to join the liberation struggle with \"whatever little they have.\"  Four guiding principles of state We see the reflections of Banganabdhu's political philosophy in the four guiding principles of state adopted by our constitution: Nationalism, democracy, secularism, and socialism. He defended these four principles in various speeches delivered in the parliament, in the party forums, and in addresses to the nation. Bangabandhu used to articulate the goals of his life's work in two simple words. He would either say he wants to build again \"Shonar Bangla\" or he would say he wants to bring \"a smile on the faces of the poor and unhappy people.\" Bangabandhu never talked about GDP growth or other theoretical issues. He knew very well how precious a smile was and his goal was to achieve that priceless objective.   Rounaq Jahan is a Distinguished Fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), Dhaka, Bangladesh."

Hashara highway police outpost in-charge Inspector Md Abdul Based said vehicles were temporarily plying through the single lane on the highway's accident's spot, as another lane was blocked for development work. \"The maximum speed of a vehicle should be no more than 30kmph on that specific road. But, seeing the mangled microbus, we can assume that the bus hit the vehicle at a speed between 70-80kmp,\" he said. \"Besides, the microbus was travelling on the designated side, while the bus driver lost his control over the steering and rammed the microbus,\" the police official added. The Dhaka-bound microbus, which was carrying a groom's party from Louhajang upazila in Munshiganj, met a head-on collision with the bus of Swadhin Paribahan on the Dhaka-Mawa Highway in Shologhar area on Friday afternoon. Nine people, including five women and children, were killed and 13 others were injured in the accident. A case was filed against the bus driver with Sreenagar police station on Friday night. A five-member probe committee led by Additional District Magistrate Asma Shahin was formed to investigate the incident. Inspector Based said: \"Although the case was filed only against the driver, the bus owner will also be brought to book if he is found guilty in our investigation.\" Hashara highway police outpost Sub-Inspector (SI) Md Shahjahan, also the investigation officer of the case, said: \"We are conducting drives to arrest the bus driver.\" Meanwhile, all the nine deceased were buried after their funeral prayers on Saturday. The deceased are  Abdur Rashid Bepari, 70, Liza, 24, Tabassum, 6, Runa, 24, Renu, 12, Tahsan, 4, Keramat Bepari, 70, Mofizul Molla, 65, and the microbus driver Billal, 40. The  deceased were all residents of Louhajang, except for Billal,who hailed from Sreenagar. "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-01-13 00:00:00      \nInvestment proposal of $12b received, employment for 1.5m people Construction work of Mirsarai Economic Zone is going on in full swing in Chittagong. The new economic zone is expected to create employment opportunities for 1.5 million people within the next 15 years and ensure export earnings of $15 billion, a top official at the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA) said. Mirsarai Economic Zone, styled as Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Shilpa Nagar, is being developed on a contiguous 30,000 acres of land stretching to Feni's Sonagazi upazila. These zones have special economic regulations that differ from the rest of Bangladesh. An entrepreneur can enjoy various facilities from authorities for setting up an industrial unit within it.  Paban Chowdhury, Executive Chairman of BEZA told the Dhaka Tribune the development work was going on in full swing at Mirsarai Economic Zone.  \"Currently development work to the tune of Tk 4,000  crore is going on in the largest economic zone of the country. Till now, we have received investment proposal of $ 12 billion dollar from different enterprises of home and abroad for the economic zone,\" added Paban.   When visiting the zone recently, the correspondent found the under-construction industrial enclave abuzz with activity. According to officials of the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA), 16,000 acres of land have already been acquired for the zone, while the acquisition of an additional 7,000 acres of land is underway. Mirsarai Economic Zone, the largest industrial enclave and also Bangladesh's first multi-sector economic zone, will be developed in some 30 phases. Currently, the development work of the site is in progress on 1,950 acres of land, which is the first phase of the economic zone. The first phase started in 2016, and will be completed by 2021. Utility Services Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) is now constructing a coastal embankment (super dyke) and a slope protection embankment to protect the project area from flood, saline intrusion, erosion caused by tidal surge and natural disasters. In addition, the BWDB is constructing eight sluice gates on the rivers and canals passing through the economic zone to Sandwip Channel in the Bay of Bengal. The Roads and Highways Department (RHD) is constructing an 18km-long motorable pavement and a 10km access road to the project area. The Rural Electrification Board (REB) has already installed a power distribution line and a substation. The Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) is now sinking deep tube-wells and a water reservoir.  The Karnaphuli Gas Distribution Company Ltd (KGDCL) is working to upgrade an existing gas distribution network from 350 mmcfd to 500 mmcfd to facilitate adequate gas supply to bulk and industrial customers. On December 4, BEZA has signed a Land Lease Agreement with the Rural Power Company Ltd (RPCL) to establish a power plant with 1800 megawatt power generation capacity to ensure uninterrupted power supply. Local, foreign enterprises eager to invest Many local and foreign companies have already shown interest to invest in the economic zone. Well Group will establish a Composite Textile Mill in the economic zone at a cost of $72.412 million. This project will create employment opportunities for 2,834 people and annual export of $59.283 million. Ananta Group will also set up six new factories in the zone for producing fabrics and yarn. Ananta Group, one of the leading apparel exporters, has been allotted 250 acres land for 50 years. The company will invest Tk3,500 crore and is expected to generate employment for 25,000 people. Kunming Iron & Steel Holding Company Limited, a state-owned Chinese company, is going to invest the amount of $2.13 billion in Bangladesh for establishing the Iron and Steel Industries Park. BEZA has allotted 500 acres of land to Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) for setting up a readymade garment factory park in the economic zone. BGMEA sought the land from BEZA for relocating the factories randomly established at different places in Dhaka.  BGMEA will invest $2 billion for setting up RMG and garment accessories factories at this park to generate employment for 500,000 people. Bangladesh's leading industrial conglomerate Bashundhara Group is also going to set up an industrial park over an area of 500 acres of land in the zone. The group will invest $500 million for setting up an ultra-modern pulp, paper and board mill, where 10,000 people are expected to work. Additionally, BEZA has allotted 1,141 acres of land to the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority (BEPZA) in Mirsarai Economic Zone. BSRM Steel Re-Rolling Mills Ltd has been allotted 165 acres of land in the economic zone. Besides, Asian Paints was allotted 20 acres, Berger Paints 30 acres and Arman Haque Denims Ltd was allotted 10 acres of land.  Ferdous Wahid, assistant engineer (civil) of the Bangladesh Economic Zones Development Project (Phase 1), told the Dhaka Tribune that they have already achieved 50% progress in site development under the first phase. \"Construction is going on at full throttle, and we are hopeful of completing the project within the stipulated time,\" the official said. He said: \"We expect the economic zone to start its complete operation by 2030.\"  Mahbubul Alam, president of the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI), said Bangladesh's economy would get a boost after the completion of the zone. He said: \"A suitable site has been chosen for establishing the zone. The prime goal of setting up an economic zone is to create employment opportunities by accelerating industrial development.\" \"I think the economic zone will definitely attract the investors from home and abroad. With the completion of the economic zone, Chittagong will turn out to be a leading regional business hub, and we will be able to explore the full potential of our demographic dividend. Besides, it will present us with huge employment opportunities,\" the CCCI President said. BEZA has been working to set up 100 economic zones in all potential regions--including backward and underdeveloped regions--by 2030, and to create 10 million new jobs and fetch additional annual exports of $40 billion, BEZA officials said. It has already identified 74 locations across Bangladesh for the setting up of economic zones. On February 28, 2016, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina laid the foundation stones of 10 economic zones, including Mirsarai Economic Zone in Chittagong."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-09-24 00:00:00      \nPointing out that health is an integral part of the development journey, she said it is essential for continued socioeconomic progress Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stressed the need for collective efforts for ensuring universal health coverage (UHC), saying that its benefits are global and fundamental to development. \"Benefits of universal health coverage are global and we need to work collectively,\" she said while delivering the national statement at the plenary session of the High-level meeting on Universal Health Coverage (UHC) at the Trusteeship Council in the UN Headquarters here on Monday afternoon. The premier added: \"Collaboration amongst stakeholders around a common goal like universal health coverage is fundamental to our development ... we should work together to achieve health for all.\" Pointing out that health is an integral part of the development journey, she said it is essential for continued socioeconomic progress. \"Ensuring Universal Health Coverage for all has assumed greater importance. It also helps ensure access to quality health services without adding financial hardship on the disadvantaged people in particular,\" she said. In Bangladesh, the premier mentioned that in the face of all constraints and limitations, the government has developed innovative ways to ensure universal health coverage for all. She said that government's comprehensive support to health sector today includes risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all. \"We had also promised to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases by one third through prevention and treatment as well as to promote mental health and well-being by 2030,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said that when Awami League government assumed office in 1996, she accorded high priority to strengthening local community health services. \"Acknowledging the critical role of health services at the grassroots level, we introduced Community Health Clinics (CHC) in 1998,\" she said. These clinics, she said, are model of public-private partnership where the government provides skilled personnel, medicine and equipment and the local people provide the land for the clinic. In this connection, the prime minister said that the government had planned to construct 14,890 community clinics all over the country, especially in rural areas. \"So far 13,743 community clinics are functioning which provide services to approximately 600,000 individuals daily,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the clinics are accessible to 80% of the population and are located within 30 minutes walking distance of their residences. She said it is estimated that on an average 40 patients receive service from each clinic every day and 90 percent of them are women and children. \"Our efficient health planning and implementation has reduced maternal mortality to 172, infant mortality to 24 and under-5 mortality to 31,\" she said. The prime minister said in Bangladesh full vaccination coverage is now 82.3%, life expectancy is more than 72.8 years while fertility rate per woman has dropped to 2.1. \"We've made commendable success in elimination of tuberculosis and leprosy,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said that the government has already integrated the health-related SDG targets into the long-term development plans. \"Our 'Visions 2021' and 2041' have given top priority to health security. As per our election manifesto 2018, we are planning to expand the universal health coverage even further and make health service free for child under one year and for elders over 65 years,\" she said. Climate Action Summit Later, the prime minister delivered a statement at the Climate Action Summit at the General Assembly Hall in the UN Headquarters. She said the impacts of climate change have been devastating the lives of almost two billion people globally every year. \"Globally, frequency of extreme climate events is increasing. But in Bangladesh, casualties are reduced to almost nil from hundreds of thousands due to efficient early warning system,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. \"We have adopted adaptation and resilience building measures, including an 82-year Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, to deal with issues on climate change, natural disasters and water management,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the government has built 4,291cyclone shelters and 523 flood shelters in the coastal areas to give refuge during disasters. Some 56 thousand volunteers are available to warn and facilitate preparation for danger, she said. The premier said she is delighted to launch today the Risk-informed Early Action Partnership (Reap). It is an ambitious new initiative created by the United Kingdom, Finland and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Sheikh Hasina said she is pleased to announce that over 50 countries and over 20 other organizations are joining this partnership today at its launch. \"Reap aims to make one billion people around the world safer from disasters by 2025 by bringing together the humanitarian, development and climate communities,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh has shown how a strong early warning system and a coordinated approach in disaster management can make a big difference. \"So, we have happily joined this initiative to share our experiences with other vulnerable countries, as well as to learn from others in mitigating the risks of future hazards,\" she said. The prime minister arrived here on Sunday afternoon on an eight-day official visit to the USA to join the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA)."

Beijing has invited Prime Minister Hasina to pay an official visit from July 1-5, a senior official in Dhaka told UNB, saying that both sides are finalizing things for the important visit. The Chinese government also invited the Prime Minister to attend the annual meeting of the \"New Champions\" which is known as \"Summer Davos\" to be held in Dalian, July 1-3. It will be Sheikh Hasina's first bilateral visit to Beijing following her party's victory in the last parliamentary election. She will have meetings with President Xi, and Prime Minister Li Keqiang, and discuss ways to strengthen cooperation in broader areas. A good number of bilateral documents are likely to be signed during the visit. Prime Minister Hasina is expected to have an exclusive meeting, on July 2, with the founder and Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum (WEF) Prof Klaus Schwab in Dalian. She is also expected to be a panelist at a session on Cooperation in the Pacific Rim at the WEF Dalian. Beijing has already placed five specific suggestions for deepening Bangladesh-China strategic partnership of cooperation with an emphasis on strengthening 'strategic mutual trust'. \"First, we need to deepen strategic mutual trust, and then we need to deepen economic integration,\" Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Zhang Zuo said at Cosmos Dialogue recently.  Other suggestions put forward by him were to deepen interaction, have stronger cooperation on security, cultural exchange, and people's connectivity. He said that China wants to join hands with Bangladesh to become good partners with equality, and mutual trust. Summer Davos, themed 'Leadership 4.0: Succeeding in a New Era of Globalization', is bringing together leaders from every sector, and every part of the world to discuss how to cooperate on the challenges ahead. Globalization 4.0 represents fundamental changes in the global economy that are reshaping companies, communities, and countries at an unprecedented scale. These changes are driven by environmental challenges, regional competition, economic disparities, and technological disruption. They, in turn, require different forms of leadership, and collaboration adapted to this new era of globalization. Platform strategies, and systems leadership are key business concepts behind the sweeping technological changes propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Leadership 4.0 requires an understanding of how new champions, that are gaining economic influence, are disrupting. and transforming current industry models. WEF engages leaders who have the vision, and values to shape the future in this new context. The Annual Meeting of the New Champions is designed as the foremost global summit on innovation, and entrepreneurship with more than 1,500 participants, 100 working sessions, and community activities, along with the opportunity to engage in several new forum initiatives."

State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Md Enamur Rahman came up with the information at a roundtable meeting arranged by Brac at Spectra Convention Centre in the capital on Tuesday, reports UNB. The government declared lightning it as a natural disaster in 2015. Enamur said there is no tested model in lighting management in Bangladesh unlike that of cyclone and flood. State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Md Enamur Rahman and other officials present at a roundtable meeting arranged by Brac at Spectra Convention Centre in Dhaka on Tuesday, December 24, 2019 | Courtesy He said to overcome the problem, the government looks for structural and infrastructural solutions, and it gives the highest emphasis on research. \"Because there is a huge misconception at all levels of people about lightning strikes, and only scientific research can help remove that misperception.\"         The state minister, however, said the palm tree plantation drive taken by the government is going on and it will continue to increase forest resources in the country and minimize casualties caused by thunderbolts.    He said the government will carry out a campaign at all levels to create public awareness about lightning strike as it causes huge casualties, not only in Bangladesh but all over the world.    Enamur said some 2,000 to 24,000 people are killed in the world every year in addition to some 50,000 who get injured in lighting strikes. He said 81 people were killed in Bangladesh in just four days in 2016.    At least 246 people were killed and 97 others injured in lightning strikes from February to September this year. According to official statistics, a total of 359 people were killed in thunderbolts in 2018. In 2015, the government declared lightning as a natural disaster."

Dhaka says transporting refugees to Bhashan Char - a Bay of Bengal island hours by boat from the mainland - will ease chronic overcrowding in its camps at Cox's Bazar, which are home to more than 1 million Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority who have fled neighbouring Myanmar. A document drawn up by the World Food Programme (WFP), the UN's food aid arm, shows the agency has supplied the Bangladesh government with detailed plans - including a timeline and budget - of how it could provide for thousands of Rohingya transported to the island within weeks. It stresses that any relocation should be voluntary and done \"in accordance with humanitarian principles and code of conduct.\" The document, labelled as a \"Concept of Operations\" and dated March 12, outlines how the organization and its partners \"may facilitate the identification, staging, forward movement, reception, and sustainment of refugees\" on Bhashan Char, estimating an initial appeal for donor funding of between $8.6 and $19 million. More detailed operational planning would be needed it says, noting the Concept of Operations had been \"developed quickly and without the benefit of any recent on-site assessment.\" Gemma Snowdon, communications officer for WFP in Cox's Bazar, said the organization was part of \"ongoing discussions\" with the government over the future of the refugee response. \"The viability of safely relocating people to Bhashan Char needs to be thoroughly assessed and WFP is investigating the potential operational needs, financial costs, and challenges in several areas that we traditionally support in emergencies: food security, emergency telecommunications and logistics,\" she said. Refugee influx The numbers of refugees in the Cox's Bazar camps have grown dramatically since August 2017, when a Myanmar military-led crackdown that UN investigators have said was conducted with \"genocidal intent\" prompted some 730,000 Rohingya to flee. Myanmar has denied almost all allegations of atrocities made by refugees during what is says was a legitimate counterterrorism operation by its security forces.  Dhaka is struggling to cope with the influx and wants to start relocating thousands of refugees to the island, which it says has been secured with flood defence embankments and cyclone shelters. A senior UN official told reporters in Dhaka on Thursday the organization welcomed the fact the government had \"taken steps to identify alternative settlements.\" \"As you also know if you have been to Kutapalong and the various camps in Cox's Bazar area, it is clear that there is huge congestion,\" said Volker Turk, Assistant High Commissioner for the UN refugee agency. Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque, who is also the chairman of Cabinet Committee on Law and Order, told Reuters in an interview the government planned to start moving refugees next month. A group of Rohingya refugee people walk in the water after crossing the Bangladesh-Myanmar border in Teknaf, Bangladesh  | Reuters \"We are in talks with UN agencies and they have agreed,\" he said. \"Now we are working on other things like how to move them and other strategies. We are the host country. We will decide where to keep them. And we are doing everything to ensure their safety and security.\" The Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, Mohammad Abul Kalam told Reuters preparations were \"still going on\" and the site was not ready. Bhashan Char, a flat and featureless island that emerged from the sea 20 years ago, has never been inhabited. Housing with corrugated iron roofs and concrete floors and walls for about 70,000 people had been built, but there were only enough cyclone shelters for 17,000. In Cox's Bazar, local officials are compiling lists of the first refugees to be moved, District Commissioner Mohammad Kamal Hossain told Reuters."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-19 00:00:00      \nAlternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), a simple technology, can help cut irrigation cost, stop rapid depletion of groundwater table and halve methane emissions  It takes 3,000 litres of water to produce one kilogram of rice. Dry season high yielding rice farming is heavily dependent on irrigation.  And there is a growing concern about irrigated rice fields emitting too much methane, second in importance after carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, responsible for global warming. Adoption of a simple technology called Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD), can cut irrigation water use by a third, and halve the methane emissions from rice fields, experts told Dhaka Tribune.  In the practice of AWD, farmers do not maintain flooded rice fields all the time. Rather they are advised to use water more judiciously in an alternate wetting and drying pattern that helps them cut the cost of irrigation, save precious groundwater, where the water table has been falling at an alarming rate. This ultimately results in less emission of methane, harmful for the ozone layer of the earth's stratosphere that absorbs most of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. It's a pity though, that for the past decade or so, AWD has been widely accepted as a water-saving, climate smart farming technology, but has not been adopted. Recently, an IRRI-led (International Rice Research Institute) initiative, the Northwest Focal Area Network, (otherwise known as FAN), demonstrated AWD to thousands of Bangladeshi farmers.    Success has come in the wake of the demonstration, and many rice growers have started appreciating the value of AWD. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC) has also recently conferred the 'Innovation in Behavioral Change' award to the FAN project for its effort in reducing methane emissions in rice production.   Bangladesh and five other countries - Canada, Ghana, Mexico, Sweden, and the United States - joined forces with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in founding CCAC in 2012. The CCAC aims to catalyze rapid reductions in climate pollutants to protect human health, agriculture, and the environment.  Dr SM Mofijul Islam, a Senior Scientific Officer of the Soil Science Division of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI), has been working on rice field methane emissions for the past seven years.  \"In my study I found some 250 to 350 kilograms of methane being released from each hectare of rice field in a growing season. Our research shows if AWD is practiced, it not only saves water and cuts irrigation costs, but also more importantly, it potentially halves the emission of methane from rice fields,\" Dr Islam told the Dhaka Tribune. IRRI Consultant Dr. Ahmed Salahuddin, who has been spearheading the cause of promoting AWD in Bangladesh, told this correspondent that over the past three years they've demonstrated AWD in over 3,000 hectares of rice lands in the Greater Rangpur-Dinajpur, Rajshahi, and Naogaon regions. \"We found that farmers practicing AWD needed 35 percent less water, thereby cutting their rice production cost by 20 percent. This also helped up to 50 percent reduction in methane emissions. Furthermore, fields where AWD was practiced, were less prone to pest infestations and diseases, and overall output was higher by 10 percent,\" said Dr Salahuddin. IRRI, FAN, and the Gobeshona Network of International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) of Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB), are now jointly spearheading the adoption of climate-smart technologies for agriculture in Bangladesh in a project called \"Mitigation Options to Reduce Methane Emissions in Paddy Rice.\"  In Bangladesh, dry season Boro rice is the biggest contributor to the country's yearly rice output in three rice growing seasons - Aus, Aman, and Boro. And other than Aus, the monsoon rice,    Boro is fully irrigated, and Aman is partly irrigated.  Farmers in Bangladesh use over 1.4 million shallow tube wells (STWs) to draw irrigation water from underground, and due to over-mining of groundwater, the water table has been falling over 0.6 metre a year, exposing the country to an ecological disaster.   According to BRRI-run Bangladesh Rice Knowledge Bank, \"The savings of irrigation water will have impact on the environment because of reduced withdrawal of ground water and a reduction in burning diesel. This may also reduce arsenic contamination in rice grains and straw.\" What is AWD?  Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) is a water-saving technology that farmers can apply to reduce their irrigation water use in rice fields without any yield penalty. In AWD, irrigation water is applied a few days after a well irrigated field dries out. Hence, the field is alternately flooded and non-flooded. The number of days of non-flooded soil between irrigations can vary from 1 day to more than 10 days, depending on a number of factors such as soil type, weather, and crop growth stage. How to implement AWD?  A practical way to implement AWD safely (without yield loss) is to monitor the depth of ponded, standing water in the field, using a perforated 'field water tube' (pani pipe). After irrigation, the water depth will gradually decrease. When the water level  drops to about 15 cm below the surface of the soil, irrigation should be applied to re-flood the field to a ponded water depth of about 5 cm. From a week before flowering to one week after flowering, the field should be kept flooded, topping up to a depth of 5 cm as needed. After flowering, during grain filling and ripening, the water level can be allowed to drop again to 15 cm below the soil surface before re-irrigation. AWD can be started one or two weeks after transplanting.   The Field Water Tube (pani pipe) The field water tube can be made of 30-cm long plastic pipe or bamboo, and should have a diameter of 10- 15 cm so that the water table is easily visible, and it is easy to fit one's hand inside the tube to remove soil. The tube has to be perforated with many holes on all sides, so that water can flow readily in and out of the tube. It has to be hammered into the soil so that 15 cm protrudes above the soil surface. The tube should be placed in a readily accessible part of the field close to a bund, so it is easy to monitor the depth of the ponded water. The location should be representative of the average water depth in the field (i.e. it should not be in a high spot or a low spot). Why is Curbing Methane Emissions So Important? With global temperatures rising due to climate change, the emission of methane - that traps about 25 times more of the sun's heat than carbon dioxide -plays a significant role in global warming. Wetland rice fields have recently been identified as a major source of atmospheric methane. Flooding a rice field cuts off the oxygen supply from the atmosphere to the soil, resulting in anaerobic fermentation of organic soil matter. Methane is a major end product of anaerobic fermentation. It is released from submerged soil to the atmosphere by diffusion and ebullition, and through the roots and stems of rice plants. Global estimates of emission rates from wetland rice fields range from 20 to 100 Tg/yr (teragrams per year), which corresponds to as much as 29 percent of total annual anthropogenic methane emissions."

The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) has recently approved a project titled 'Flood control, addressing water logging and improvement of drainage facilities of Chittagong Metropolis' to this end.  A senior Planning Commission official said: \"Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) under the Ministry of Water Resources will implement the project by June 2022 to be entirely borne from the state exchequer.\" He said that the main objectives of the project are to free the Chittagong metropolis from water logging as well as to protect the port city from tidal surge, high tide and flood by constructing retaining wall and flood wall on the right embankment of the Karnaphuli River. Moreover, steps will be taken to stop intrusion of salty water and speedy drainage of rain water in the city through construction of regulators and pump houses. Commenting on the project, Planning Minister MA Mannan said: \"Once the project is implemented, it would help addressing the water logging of the port city to a great extent.\"   The minister added that this project will protect Chittagong from flood and tidal surge and high tide. Another official at the Water Resources Ministry said that the rivers Karnaphuli and Halda are very important for drainage of water from the Chittagong Metropolitan City though the main industrial areas, Shah Amanat International Airport, railway areas near Pahartali, Kalurghat heavy industrial area are all situated near the Karnaphuli River. It is to be noted that the water flow of 23 city canals merges in the Karnaphuli River and three canals converges into the Halda River while the flow  of the remaining 14 canals go into the Bay of Bengal. Apart from this, excessive rain water and mixed impact of high tide and low tide at the Karnaphuli are one of the main reasons for water logging in the city. During high tide, water from the Karnaphuli River enters the city since there is no flood control embankment on the right side of both rivers Karnaphuli and Halda. Under these circumstances, Bangladesh Water Development Board formed a technical committee in December 2016 following request from the Chittagong City Corporation to address the problem side by side a study was carried out by Chittagong WASA. \"Based on that study and recommendations of the technical committee, the project was drafted and later was approved at the Planning Commission and subsequently at the ECNEC,\" added the Water Resources Ministry official. The main project operations include the construction of 2.7 kilometer retaining wall, 18.965 kilometer flood wall, installation of some 69 pumps, construction of 23 regulators, 1 kilometer slope protection and some 6 hectares of land acquisition. On July 15, 2018, the Pre Evaluation Committee (PEC) meeting on the project was held where the Planning Commission recommended for implementing the project."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-03 00:00:00      \nHundreds of thousands more people in West Bengal state have also been given orders to flee At least two people died Friday as Cyclone Fani, the biggest in years, slammed into eastern India, sending coconut trees flying and cutting off power, water and telecommunications. The monster weather system made landfall at the holy city of Puri in the morning, with winds gusting at up to 200km per hour. In recent days authorities in Odisha state, where 10,000 people perished in a 1999 cyclone, evacuated more than a million people as they worried about a possible 5ft storm surge sweeping far inland. One man died of a heart attack in one of several thousand shelters set up, while another was killed by a falling tree on Friday, authorities said. Media reports put the death toll at up to six, but officials could not confirm this. Authorities in Bangladesh, where Fani was headed, said that 14 villages were inundated as flood dams broke due to a tidal surge.  Disaster management spokesman Mohammad Jahir told AFP that 400,000 people from Bangladeshi coastal villages have been taken to shelters. Hundreds of thousands more people in India's West Bengal state have also been given orders to flee. Local airports have been shut, while train lines and roads were closed. \"It just went dark and then suddenly we could barely see five metres in front of us,\" said one resident in Puri. \"There were the roadside food carts, store signs all flying by in the air,\" the man told AFP from a hotel where he took shelter. \"The wind is deafening.\" Another witness said he saw a small car being blown along a street by the winds and then turned over. After pounding Puri and Odisha state capital Bhubaneswar and heading north-eastwards, losing strength as it goes, authorities were battling to remove fallen trees from roads and to restore phone and internet services. On Saturday Fani was expected in West Bangal's capital Kolkata, a city home to 4.5 million people. \"We are monitoring the situation 24x7 and doing all it takes. Be alert, take care and stay safe for the next two days,\" West Bengal's chief minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted. The winds were felt as far away as Mount Everest, with tents blown away at Camp 2 at 21,000ft and Nepali authorities cautioning helicopters against flying. Meanwhile a baby was born near Bhubaneswar just as the cyclone passed through. \"We are calling her Lady Fani as she was born when the hospital was hit,\" a spokesperson for the hospital told the Press Trust of India. Cyclone Fani makes landfall in eastern India: Met Office https://t.co/XGL0Ldd19a 'Total destruction' Meteorologists have warned of the \"total destruction\" of thatched houses, the uprooting of power and communication poles, the \"flooding of escape routes\" and damage to crops in some areas. Some 3,000 shelters in schools and government buildings were set up to accommodate more than a million people in Odisha, with families including women and babies huddled on the floor. Ports have been closed but the Indian Navy has sent six warships to the region while India's biggest oil and gas producer ONGC evacuated almost 500 workers from offshore rigs. Measures were also being taken to protect the 850-year-old Jagannath temple in Puri, a Hindu holy town normally thronging with pilgrims. AFP correspondents in the resort said it was a near ghost town with trees already torn down and water levels rising even before Fani's awesome arrival. Electricity and water supplies were already cut for much of the city of 200,000 people. Metal shutters covered store fronts and sand blew up the streets from the nearby beach. Only a few police vehicles and tractors trying to pull trees or push aside collapsed walls could be seen. Media reports said hundreds of trees were uprooted at the nearby Chilika Lake just south of Puri in the first violent winds. \"We will just stay for the day until the cyclone has passed. We are not scared but we feel safer here,\" said Krishna Chandra Sahu, 43, sheltering with seven members of his family in a hotel. "

      "text": "Date Published:2019-04-14 00:00:00      \nUSDA says, US-China 'trade war' also comes into play as supply of low-price yarn, fabrics gluts Bangladesh  Backward linkage factories - spinning, weaving, and knitting - in Bangladesh are running their businesses at a loss because of yarn dumping from India, and fabrics from China and Pakistan.  Although apparel industries seem to benefit more from dumping, it makes them more dependent and vulnerable as a supplier of low-priced garments for export, states a just published report by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).    It says, \"Due to the U.S. - China 'trade war,' yarn and fabric from China are exported to Bangladesh at a lower price. Textile industries are facing hard challenges and incurring business losses, as they can't compete with imported yarn and fabric at very low prices.\"  It also states that China is providing direct cash returns to exporters of about 15 to 20% on their export of fabric to Bangladesh.   In March 2019, the price of cotton yarn reduced due to lower cotton prices in the international market, along with ample supply of yarn and fabric from China, India, and Pakistan.  USDA says, the local textile millers are facing uneven competition due to abundant imports of cheap yarn and fabrics. Some of them are about to leave the market and are facing a challenge dealing with a huge stockpile of unsold fabric, it adds.  The phenomena is attributed to low-priced yarn and fabric imports increased through bonded warehouse import \"leakage,\" improper utilization declaration (UD) certification facilities of readymade garment (RMG) manufacturers, false declaration of product specification, and smuggling through the border with India.  Local RMG manufacturers are importing yarn and fabric from China, India, and Pakistan using a bonded warehouse (zero tariffs on import of raw materials for export value-added product) privilege.  \"The imported yarn and fabric with zero tariffs are then illegally sold to the local market which forces down prices in the domestic market and makes local weaving mills and spinners more competitive,\" states USDA report. Bangladesh has import duties of 32.4 percent for man-made fiber, 91.37 percent for fabric, 38.47 percent for yarn, and 32.4 percent for textile chemical dyes.  Export-oriented RMG factories can import yarn and fabric under a duty draw back incentive, which reimburses all customs duties paid on imported yarn, and fabric (but not taxes such as the VAT and Advanced Income tax).  Imports of all textile raw materials, including fabrics, have no quotas.   As a result of yarn oversupply in the domestic market, prices fell nearly 15-20 percent, while some textile millers and spinners suffered as a result, the report says also noting that \"Some millers planned to cut overseas purchases of cotton for yarn and fabric production as they were struggling in the market due to the flood of imported yarn and fabric from China and India.\"  Textile millers have urged the government to take necessary action in order to protect the textile industry.  Of 2.1 million metric tons of Bangladesh's yearly yarn demand, 70 percent is met by local millers, while the rest is imported mainly from India, China, Vietnam and Pakistan.  More foreign buyers of value-added apparel are purchasing from Bangladesh due to cheap labor cost, competitive prices, and an appreciated US dollar versus the Bangladesh Taka.  Reportedly, some high-end millers have increased production capacity to satisfy higher domestic and international demand says USDA report.  Bangladesh currently has 430 spinning mills, 802 weaving mills, 244 dyeing and finishing mills, 32 denim fabric mills, 22 home textile mills, and a total of 6,502 registered and 527 un-registered garment factories.  Sixty-five percent of these factories are located in Dhaka district.  Approximately 4,296 Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) members employ four million workers, of which 80 percent are women.  In first eight months of the current fiscal, ready-made garment (RMG) exports fetched Bangladesh approximately US$23 billion, up nearly 15 percent from last year.  In previous financial year (2017-18), the country earned US$ 31.6 billion from RMG exports, an increase of 8.77 percent compared to 2016-17 FY, and contributed 83 percent of total export earnings.  Ministry of Textile and Jute has projected that the RMG sector earnings would grow to US$35.62 billion and US$38.73 billion in 2019-20 FY and 2020-21 FY respectively.   The export growth was partially contributed to by improved workers' wages, compliance maintenance investment, workers' skill development, diversified value addition, increased domestic and foreign direct investment, and more international brands involved in the trade.  USDA also predicts, Bangladesh's cotton import to rise from 8 million bales (projected for 2018-19) to  8.5 million bales in 2019-20, on expectations of increased export market demand for value-added apparel products, increased capacities of existing mills, stable international prices of cotton, and favorable weather for world production.  Bangladesh imported cotton from 41 countries around the world in 2017-18. Among them, India (25%) and the U.S. (10%) take the largest share of volume, followed by Australia (9%), Mali (9%), Burkina Faso (8%), Benin (8%), Brazil (7%), Uzbekistan (6%), and others.  Nearly 80 percent of garments made in Bangladesh are sourced from cotton; the rest are made from viscose, polyester and other materials.  Local spinners supply 90 percent of raw materials for knitwear and 40 percent for the woven garments sector. "

The Japanese envoy made the assurance when he met the Bangladeshi premier at her official residence Ganabhaban, on Monday, reports UNB. Prime minister's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reporters after the meeting. Ihsanul said the Japanese envoy informed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina that during her upcoming visit to Japan, the 40th Official Development Assistance (ODA) agreement of $2.5 billion will be signed, which is 35% higher than the one made in 2018.  The Japanese ambassador said the next five years will be important for Bangladesh. He then apprised of the progress of the coal-fired 1200MW Matarbari Power Plant project in Maheshkhali upazila of Cox's Bazar. Mentioning that Japan is a great friend of Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina recalled the contributions of Japan in the economic development of the country and construction of  Rupsha Bridge during Bangabandhu's regime, right after Bangladesh's independence.

      "text": "Date Published:2019-06-03 00:00:00      \nThe 57-member bloc says all international legal instruments will be used to hold perpetrators accountable The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has called upon the ad hoc ministerial committee, led by Gambia, to take immediate measures to launch a case of Myanmar's human rights violations against the Rohingyas at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on its behalf. It also affirmed its support for the committee on human rights violations against the Rohingyas in Myanmar, using all international legal instruments to hold accountable the perpetrators of the crimes, according to the final communique issued after the 14th Islamic Summit Conference held in Mecca, Saudi Arabia last Friday, reports UNB. Bangladesh is currently hosting more than 1.1 million Rohingyas in Cox's Bazar -- a vast population which is putting immense economic, environmental and diplomatic pressure on Bangladesh. The OIC's call came after Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina at the conference sought OIC's help in providing justice to the Rohingyas and ensuring their safe repatriation to Myanmar. Some 750,000 Rohingyas had fled brutal military atrocities in Myanmar's Rakhine state since August 25, 2017. Before them, over 300,000 others fled to Bangladesh after several waves of violence. The conference insisted on the importance of conducting international, independent and transparent investigations into the human rights violations in Myanmar -- including sexual violence and aggression against children -- and to hold accountable all those responsible for these brutal acts in order to give justice to the victims. The 57-member bloc also called for ensuring free and unrestricted access to humanitarian assistance by affected persons and communities. They also reiterated deep appreciation for the people of Bangladesh and the Hasina administration for opening their borders and giving shelter to the forcibly displaced Rohingyas, consistently supporting them with the country's scarce resources. The conference called on the member states to come up generously to share the increasing burden of Bangladesh. Myanmar urged to take steps The Myanmar military has been accused of torching Rohingya villages, killing Rohingyas and even raping Rohingya women -- allegations that rights groups say are tantamount to genocide. Even after signing of deals with Bangladesh and UN agencies on repatriation, the Rohingyas say the conditions in Rakhine are not safe enough for them return and there is no guarantee of citizenship and security. Meanwhile, violence in Rakhine is escalating due to fights between the security forces and the Arakan Army in the recent months and further complicating the situation. The OIC summit welcomed various mechanisms established at international level to improve the situation in Rakhine State, and reiterated its support to regional mechanisms -- particularly Asean -- in conducting the necessary needs assessment to identify areas of cooperation in order to create conducive conditions for the Rohingyas' safe, voluntary, and dignified return. The conference also condemned the inhumane situation in which the Rohingya Muslim community lives, and called for urgent action to end acts of violence and all brutal practices targeting this minority. It also urged giving them their rights without any discrimination or racial profiling. It emphasised that the Myanmar government is fully responsible for the protection of its citizens and underscored the need to stop the use of military power in Rakhine immediately. The conference urged Myanmar to take practical, time-bound and concrete steps to restore the citizenship of Rohingya IDPs and forcibly displaced Rohingya Muslims who were deprived of their nationality, with all associated rights, especially the right to full citizenship. It also urged the country to allow and facilitate the return in safety, security and dignity of all Rohingyas internally and externally displaced, including those forced into taking shelter in Bangladesh. It reaffirmed its commitment to the implementation of the resolutions of OIC summits and ministerial conferences."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-11-14 00:00:00      \nThe Hidden Potential of Peatlands for Global Climate Mitigation People across the globe are calling for the protection of the planet's forests, creating hashtags such as #PrayForAmazonas as news of the recent fires were trending on Twitter. While it is true that our forests are an essential resource for carbon sequestration, our world's peatlands are the less known and often forgotten global carbon sinks.  Peatlands are terrestrial wetland ecosystems in which the production of organic matter is faster than its decomposition. This process results in the net accumulation of peat - a type of soil with very high organic matter content (often more than 30% by weight) as opposed to mineral soils which have a very low quantity of organic matter.   Peatlands exist in almost all countries and are a long disregarded ecosystem in the fight against climate change. Peatlands are the most widespread version of wetlands, representing roughly 50 to 70% of the global wetlands. They are invaluable ecosystems as they are the world's largest natural terrestrial carbon store. Worldwide, peatlands only account for around three % of the land surface but may store up to 644 gigatonnes of carbon which represents approximately 21% of the total global soil organic carbon stock. Despite being an essential resource for carbon sequestration, human activities such as artificial drainage for agricultural use, are degrading global peatlands - turning this helpful ecosystem service provider into the opposite - a carbon source, contributing further to climate change! Peatland types Temperate and boreal peatlands can be categorized in several ways. One of the most widespread ways to categorize them is - according to the source of water on which these ecosystems depend. The term \"Fens\" refer to peatlands which rely both on rainfall and groundwater while \"Bogs\" refer to peatlands which depend solely on rainfall. As a result of the vegetation which grows in such ecosystems, these ecosystems differ from one type to another. However, tropical peatlands lack much attention and have not been studied as well as non-tropical peatlands have been, and as a result, they have not been systematically categorised. As recent as 2017, the world's largest tropical peatland was discovered in the Congo Basin, meaning large areas that have been storing carbon for millennia may still be undiscovered.    How do peatlands lock away carbon? Peatlands are formed in areas where year-round waterlogged conditions exist. This waterlogging slows the natural process of plant decomposition, and the organic matter they are composed of do not fully degrade due to lack of oxygen and \"pile-up\", thereby locking away carbon. This process, over millennia, builds up to form layers of peat several metres in depth. Generally, 1 meter of peat takes 1000 years to accumulate. What other \"ecosystem services\" do they provide?  Peatlands provide environmental services of economic and social importance including carbon storage, protection against erosion, biodiversity, nutrient cycling and water management. Peat blankets often protect underlying soils from erosion. Peatlands host a broad diversity of species of plants and animals. Plants provide the structural foundation and are the source of organic compounds derived from photosynthesis, required for the sustenance of animals and microorganisms. Peatlands host plant species of high nature conservation value. Other life forms include an associated diverse range of fungi species, microorganisms, protozoan and algae. Furthermore, peatlands serve as migratory resting grounds for a wide range of bird species.  Peatlands provide safe drinking water. It is estimated that ten per cent of the planet's freshwater is stored in peatlands. Highlighting the need for both protecting and maintaining the health of this ecosystem is crucial for water security at present and in the future. Water that is derived from healthy peatlands is generally of high quality - having few pollutants and low nutrient levels, meaning it only requires simple treatment once it reaches a water treatment plant.  Near-natural peatlands can store large amount of water due to the spongy nature of peat. Heavy rainfall is initially absorbed and gradually released over a period of several days, the peatlands thereby act as a form of natural flood management infrastructure often minimising the risk of flood damage downstream. Coastal peatlands may additionally act as a buffer against salinity intrusion. Thus, peatlands are essential in the management of water catchments and when degraded can exacerbate flooding, which in many areas is likely to increase as climate change impacts increase. The protection and restoration of previously degraded peatlands can help to address climate change. Degraded peatlands often contribute significantly as a source of greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change. A recent estimate of the monetary value of inland peatlands stands at around 11 trillion international dollars. Although peatlands are among the most valuable ecosystems on Earth, little is known about tropical peatlands. However, what we do know is that peat in the tropics occurs mostly in sub-coastal lowlands and forms from rainforest trees and other higher plants, but may also occur in swamp forests. As of 2008, tropical peatlands are estimated to be around 182 million ha, spanning South America, Asia and Africa, and account for almost half of global peatlands. These peatlands store about 40 to 90 gigatonnes of carbon and are becoming more responsive to global climate change and human influences.  Peatlands in Bangladesh?  Peatlands can be found in Bangladesh as well, although they are not usually classified as such since other wetland categories are more prominently used in Bangladesh. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) peat occupy around 60,000 ha in Bangladesh, while others have estimated this figure to range from 130,000 ha to 224,700 ha (1.6% of the total area). These peatlands can be found between the Ganges river floodplain and the Ganges tidal floodplain in Gopalgonj, Bagerhat and the adjoining parts of Khulna, Barisal and Jessore districts, in deep depressions in the Sylhet Basin and the Northern and Eastern Hills of Bangladesh. Peatlands as threatened ecosystems? Throughout Europe, over the last decades, peatlands throughout Europe and North America have been drained for agricultural use or forestry land reclamation or degraded through peat extraction. In the tropics degradation of peatlands not only caused by agrarian expansion but also result from infrastructure development, such as the construction of roads and highways for better transport networks. Mineral, oil and gas extraction may also cause substantial loss or degradation to peatlands in the tropics. In Bangladesh, peatlands are mostly converted to agricultural land for cultivating Boro rice, shrimp and vegetables where there is little scope for soil carbon storage.   As peatlands are degraded, they become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. For example, in 2015, Indonesian peat swamp forests had seriously damaging fires, that emitted nearly 16 million tonnes of CO2 a day as they burned. This level of emissions contributed more than the daily emissions from the entire US economy. Emissions from drained peatlands are estimated at 1.3 gigatonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to 6% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Peatland restoration can bring significant emission reduction and have been recognized by leading peatland scientists of the world as an effective, comprehensive climate change mitigation strategy. Conservation and restoration: not one solution for all Restoration measures of drained and degraded Northern Peatlands usually include rewetting and ditch blocking along with several other methods depending on the level of degradation, vegetation type and peatland type. Many near-natural peatlands are also conserved as protected areas, without much human interference. However, we must acknowledge that what works or has been working for high-income countries may not always work for countries of the global south. Cultural perception and societal priorities differ vastly from one country to another, from one continent to the next, while differences in economic growth, population density, dependence on ecosystems for livelihood further complicates the matter; a \"copy and paste\" approach, therefore, is not the way forward. What could be a possible way forward though, is for Governments to realize the importance of peatlands, beyond its monetary value and take necessary steps to understand peatlands as not exclusively as ecosystems but as social-ecological systems, thereby acknowledging the importance of humans as part of nature.  For Bangladesh, the national and local governments must act together with non-governmental organizations (NGOs), as well as relevant research institutes to develop policies to protect and restore peatlands in Bangladesh. Such policies should not only be based on sound \"natural\" science but should also be based on a sound understanding of local communities. Bangladesh, being an agricultural economy and a country with very high population density, is a country where it is quite challenging to preserve vast areas of peat-forming ecosystems, without incorporating humans into the picture. Several models of community-based management have been tried and tested in the country, especially for wetlands and forests, which could be further developed for peatland management. However, given the lack of research on peatlands in Bangladesh, the first step would be to identify and locate peatlands all over the country, followed by different but inclusive restoration and management measures.    Under the Paris Agreement countries are encouraged to include peatland restoration in their commitments to global international agreements. The inclusion of peatland emissions from degraded peatlands and on the flip side carbon saving from peatland restoration are both eligible for consideration within Nationally Determined Contributions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Therefore countries must begin to include peatland restoration and re-wetting in their national climate action plans.

In Manikganj, ferry and launch services between Paturia, and Daulatdia have remained disrupted due to persistent heavy current on the Padma River. Swades Prasad, executive engineer of floating workshop at Paturia terminal, said: \"Of the 16 ferries, two are completely inoperable. Of the remaining 14, only four utility ferries, and two Ro-Ro ferries are in operation at present.\" Zillur Rahman, acting deputy general manager of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (Aricha), said: \"We were forced to suspend the operation of most of the ferries following the heavy current in the river.\" Visiting the area, this correspondent found around 500 vehicles stuck at the Paturia terminal waiting to cross the river. In Rajbari, a similar situation prevailed at the Daulatdia terminal, as terminal number 1, and 2 have remained shut due to strong current of the Padma River.  Rajbari Water Development Board (WDB) Engineer Arifur Rahman said: \"Debgram and Daulatdia area are at risk of erosion. If they are affected by the erosion the ferry terminals will be affected as well. In order to prevent erosion sand bags are being dumped in the banks of the river there.\" In Madaripur, as the water level of the Padma River started to recede, erosion on its banks has been taking an alarming shape in Shibchar upazila. Kathalbari Primary School was swallowed by the Padma River yesterday, and in the past week, a bridge, along with roads, shops, and numerous homes fell victim to the erosion. Shibchar UNO Md Asaduzzaman said: \"Relief materials will promptly be supplied to the affected, and alternative measures will be arranged for the students who have lost their schools.\"  WDB Executive Engineer Partho Pritom Saha said: \"To prevent erosion at Bandarkhola, Kathalbari, and Char Janajat unions sandbags are being dumped on the banks of Padma.\" In Narail, ever since the opening of Farakka Gates, the water level of the Modhumoti, and Noboganga rivers rose alarmingly, and new regions are being affected, waterlogging thousands of locals. Water levels of Padma, Mohananda recede in Chapainawabganj The water levels of Padma, and Mohananda rivers started receding in the district Saturday morning, reports UNB. According to the district WDB, the Padma water level fell by at least 5cm, and Mohananda by 2cm in the last 24 hours till yesterday morning. Padma was flowing 38cm, and Mohananda 16cm below the danger level. Abdur Rajib Raju, Durlabhpur UP chairman of Shibganj, said a large number of houses, and roads in ward 4 of his union are still under water. The water started receding two days ago, and if it continues the situation will improve soon, he added. Around 58,000 people in 16 unions of the district were stranded when Mohananda, and Punorbhaba rivers breached their banks. \"Some 11,300 hectares of cropland have been flooded,\" said Manjurul Huda, deputy-director of the Department of Agriculture Extension."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-02-13 00:00:00      \nExperts are hopeful, but cannot attest the long term effects of the project Bangladesh and India will both benefit from the opening of the Farakka barrage, as it will be favorable for ilish fish in general, said sector experts. India has redesigned a navigation lock at the Farakka barrage on the Ganges to ensure the smooth and safe migration of ilish during their three-month spawning season. This lock has now been redesigned to ensure the smooth and safe migration of ilish shoals during their mating season. A navigation lock is a device used to raise and lower boats and ships between stretches of water on a river. Inland Waterway Authority of India Vice-Chairman Pravir Pandey said the barrage gates will remain open for only eight metres between 1am and 5am each day, the preferred time when the ilish seek passage. The tentative completion date of the project is in June. Professor Monirul Islam of the Department of Fisheries at University of Dhaka said: \"It is important to note at which season India is going to open the barrage. In mating season it is forbidden to catch ilish in Bangladesh. If India opens the barrage at that time, then Bangladesh will suffer the consequences.\" \"It seems to me that India is doing this project experimentally. If this works out and India gets more ilish, then perhaps they will realize the value of cooperating with Bangladesh, and that it is wrong to block river flow,\" he added. Also Read- India to open Farakka for illish migration He said there is still a possibility that India might block the barrage after the ilish are on their side, but it would not do them much good. Ilish is a fish of the sea; after releasing eggs in the river, they will return to the sea. If that is blocked, the fish will not release any more eggs. Sector experts have said factors such as pollution, unplanned river islands and water politics may contribute to lessening the ilish population. However, not all experts are skeptical. Dr Md Niamul Naser, an ilish researcher from Department of Zoology at University of Dhaka, is viewing this as a positive turn of events. He said: \"The illish need the flow of water. If there is proper current in the river, the fish will be able to go as far as Rajshahi.\" \"Meghna has enough flow right now. If there is enough flow in Teesta, Surma and Kushiyara rivers, then there will be no issues. It is not as if it will be bad for Bangladesh if India gets ilish,\" he said. Department of Fisheries Deputy Director Dr Zillur, who is in charge of the Aquaculture Branch, said: \"We do not think Bangladesh will face any problems from this project. If the fish traverse the water bodies, then both countries will benefit from it.\" \"However, I cannot attest to the long-term effects of this project. Ilish is a natural resource; no single country owns them. They should be able to migrate in the way that is natural for them.\" When asked about the potential effects of India's project on Bangladesh, Department of Fisheries Director (Scientific Research and Fisheries Survey) Dr Monowar Hossain said: \"If the water flow is improved, then both countries will benefit from the project. Bangladesh will have no issues regarding ilish breeding.\""

The explosion occurred in the ground floor of a four-storied building, where the hotel was situated, around 2:30am on Sunday. Among the injured, 13 were taken to the burn unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) for treatment and the remaining were provided first-aid at Tairunnessa Memorial Medical College and Hospital, Gazipur Fire Service and Civil Defence Deputy Assistant Director Abdullah Al Mamun told Dhaka Tribune. Being informed of the blast, three units of Tongi Fire Service arrived at the scene. However, before their arrival, locals rescued the injured and took them to the hospital. Mamun said the explosion destroyed parts of the Banglar Radhuni Hotel and its adjoining Tripti Hotel, injuring at least 17 people at the restaurants. The nearby IFIC Bank suffered the most damage from the blast. Gazipur Deputy Commissioner SM Tarikul Islam told reporters that a five-member probe committee, including members from fire service, district police and administration, was formed to investigate the cause of the blast and to assess the damages caused. Officials also confirmed that the injured are mostly staff and a few customers of the restaurants. However, it was unclear what triggered the explosion, Deputy Assistant Director Abdullah Al Mamun added."

Monsoon flooding in Myanmar forces thousands from their homeshttps://t.co/fLOP3ewyGM pic.twitter.com/PTK5EnfZ4I Heavy downpours hit the tropical Southeast Asian country during the May-October rainy season, often triggering flooding. The northern state of Kachin was the worst affected, with 14,000 people forced from their homes near the banks of the Ayeyarwady river. Media published photographs showing submerged houses, vehicles and roads in Myitkyina, the state's capital. Flooding also forced 3,000 people in the western Rakhine state to relocate, the disaster management department said. They included some of the thousands displaced by fighting between the military and the Arakan Army insurgent group since late last year, according to Tun Aung Kyaw, secretary of the Arakan National Party, who visited a camp for several hundred displaced people near the ancient city of Mrauk-U. \"The whole camp is flooded and people are desperately in need of immediate shelter and food,\" he told Reuters by telephone. Myanmar has restricted access to the conflict zone for most international aid agencies. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a Facebook post it was helping the government respond to the flooding, while the Myanmar Red Cross, aid groups and private donors were also aiding the victims. \"We are working closely with authorities and stand ready to support the government's response,\" Knut Ostby, the UN resident and humanitarian coordinator, said on Twitter."

The river has already devoured at least 28 dwellings, in areas under the union, in the last two days. According to villagers, the disaster occurred due to continuous sand lifting by unscrupulous traders.  The authorities dumped geo-bags but failed to prevent the erosion that left at least 28 families homeless. Although law prohibits sand lifting within a six-kilometre radius of a bridge, a syndicate of influential traders, having political connections, continued lifting sand near the bridge with powerful dredgers, the villagers said. Over 20,000 people in the union are under the threat of erosion, and are passing their days in panic. When Gorilabari village was visited yesterday, the villagers expressed grave concerns. \"Our tin-shed building, toilet, and tube-well were devoured by the river,\" said Fatema Begum adding that they are now living in somebody else's house. Not only Fatema but also Akbar Ali Akanda, Chand Miah Haji, Abdul Ali Mondol, Abdus Salam, Janab Ali Talukder, Abul Hossain, Korban Ali, Akbar Shikder, Ashraf Ali, Solaiman, Shafiq Uddin, Jahurul Islam, and Khaled Mondol of Gorilabari, and Beltia villages have lost their dwellings due to erosion. They have taken shelter in open spaces, and relatives' houses. \"Many people of the village have lost their houses in the erosion. I have lost my house,\" said Akbar Ali Akanda of the village. During the last rainy season, erosion by the river devoured at least 50 houses, and a 200-metre embankment in the village within a few days. This year, erosion started in Gorilabari village on May 30, and it devoured over a dozen dwellings so far, said Rashida Begum, an erosion victim of the village. Tangail-4 (Kalihati upazila) constituency MP  Hasan Imam Khan Sohel said work  for a permanent embankment in the area, to save the people from erosion, will start in December. \"Each erosion victim will get Tk, 6000, and two bundles of corrugated tins,\" he also said."

Local sources said erosion by Padma River has intensified in Rajbari, and is gradually receding in Shariatpur, causing immense sufferings to the people. A large number of houses, structures, trees, and crops on vast tracts of land were washed away by floodwaters, and strong river currents in different flood-hit areas. In Rajbari, erosion in the Padma River has taken an alarming turn, it already forced thousands of families, under the Sadar, Goalanda, and Kalukhali upazila, to leave their houses, due to rise in water levels, villages within the district are becoming more vulnerable. According to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), they are dumping sand bags in the river to prevent erosion in the area. But locals claimed that BWDB's efforts aren't enough as forceful current, and rising water level is washing the sand bags away. They hoped the authority would take more effective measures to prevent erosion, which eroded at least 19 points of the district. Goalanda's Bhakla Union Parishad Chairman Md Amjad Hossain said: \"Not only the houses, but acres of croplands are underwater. BWDB initiatives are praiseworthy, but not enough to avert the erosion.\"  Arifur Rahman Angkur, Sub-Divisional Engineer BWDB's Rajbari office, said: \"We are dumping Geo bags to lessen the casualties. We will take more measures if needed.\" In Shariatpur, at least 20 establishments, including a mosque, 5 business centres, and houses were devoured by the Padma River, and it is threatening more areas in Naria upazila of Shariatpur district due to a wild rise in water level, causing severe river erosion in the past couple of days. Around 200 meters of the river protection dam has collapsed in the district on Thursday, making hundreds of residents, around the riverbank, to shift from the spot instantly. Locals said, the water level of the Padma was increasing since Thursday but has receded on Sunday.  Member of Parliament (MP), Deputy Minister for Water Resources AKM Enamul Haque Shamim, State Minister Zahid Faruque, and Director General of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) Mahfuzur Rahman, visited the area Sunday. They said there was no negligence with the construction of the protection dam. The damage was a result of increased current, and rise of water level in the river. It is to be noted that last year, more than 6,000 houses, around 1,000 business centres, and many other establishments were washed away due to devastating erosion of the Padma River in Naria upazila."

The arrests were made by Chandpai range officials around 4am on Tuesday. The suspects are residents of Gaurambha area under Rampal upazila of Bagerhat district. A huge numbers of deer-hunting snares were recovered from the spot after the arrests, said the officials. Sundarbans East Forest Zone Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Md Mahmudul Hasan confirmed the matter to Dhaka Tribune.  He said: \"The forest department officials keep a watchful eye on Ras Mela bound pilgrims each year. \"On Tuesday, as the alleged deer-poaching team was approaching the area on three trawlers, officials of the Chandpai range caught them and recovered the deer snares.\" Ras Mela, a religious festival of the Hindu community, takes place on the full-moon night of the Bangla months of Karthik or Agrahayan every year. In the Sundarbans, it is celebrated each year at Dublar Char."

      "text": "Date Published:2019-05-14 00:00:00      \nThe US is among Bangladesh's top trading partners The economic and commercial ties between Bangladesh and the US will continue to grow rapidly if issues related to the investment climate, intellectual property, and the workforce are addressed. \"I am confident [about the growth of ties],\" said Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Director General of the US and Foreign Commercial Service, Ian Steff.  He visited Dhaka from May 11-13 to participate in a 2019 Trade Winds Indo-Pacific Forum and Mission -- plus to promote US-Bangladesh trade and investment, reports UNB.  He encouraged Bangladesh to realise the full potential of the bilateral commercial relationship by removing remaining trade barriers and improving the ease of doing business.   Trade between the US and Bangladesh has doubled to more than $8 billion over the past decade, the US Embassy said on May 7, 2019. During his first visit to Dhaka, Steff met government officials and discussed intellectual property rights as well as other investment climate issues.  \"US and Bangladeshi business leaders are increasingly expanding their commercial ties and partnerships -- as evidenced by growing trade between our two nations and the strong participation of companies in our trade mission,\" he said.  On May 13, he met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Private Industry and Investment Advisor Salman F Rahman and Energy Advisor Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury--as well as Commerce Secretary Mofizul Islam--to discuss ways to expand economic ties.  Bangladesh, with its population and economic growth, offers US companies a market of incredible potential with tens of millions of increasingly affluent consumers.   Trade Winds Indo-Pacific is the US Department of Commerce's first major trade mission to Bangladesh in recent history. The trade mission began on May 6 in New Delhi and concluded on May 13 in Dhaka.   The Trade Winds event facilitated meetings between 12 representatives of US companies and more than 40 business-to-business meetings with Bangladeshi companies.   Trade Winds, now in its 11th year, has directly supported more than $3.4 billion in US exports in over 40 countries; in 2018, US exports of goods and services to the Indo-Pacific region were more than $476 billion.   In 2017, the mission brought 100 companies to Southeast Europe and accounted for more than $3 billion in US exports.   Trade Winds has helped US companies conduct over 4,000 pre-vetted, business-to-business meetings and over 6,000 government-to-business meetings around the world."

On Tuesday, at Karwanbazar wholesale market, five kg of local onion sold at Tk190 and the imported one at Tk170, while three days ago they were Tk220 and Tk180 respectively. At wholesale rate, per kg local onion costs Tk38 while the imported one Tk34.  But in retail market, per kg local onion was selling at Tk60 and the imported onion at Tk45 to Tk50, Dhaka Tribune found while visiting different kitchen markets in the capital.  Md Masud, a trader at Karwanbazar, said: \"There is no sign of the price going down as Eid-ul-Azha is drawing near. Besides, flood is another reason for high price of onion.\"  Another importer and trader of the market Abdul Karim claimed that in the last three days, the price remained stable and feared that it would increase as the transportation cost would be high because of inclement weather.  Meanwhile, prices of garlic and ginger have fallen by Tk10 to Tk15 per kg in the wholesale market. But in the retail market per kg garlic is selling at Tk230 to Tk250 which is Tk180 to Tk130 in the wholesale market. Similarly, per kg ginger is selling at Tk200 to Tk220 in retail market which is sold at Tk140 to Tk180 in the wholesale market.  Asked about price gap between retail and wholesale market, Md Matin, a trader at Panthapath, said: \"We cannot preserve onion because of bad weather. So, to minimize our loss, we have to sell at higher prices.\"  He also blamed short supply for the price hike. Government plans to sell onion through TCB The government is considering measures to rein in the price spiral of onion. \"Prices of onion increased due to supply shortage as imports from India slowed down. In addition, rain has had negative impact on the supply chain,\" said Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi. The minister made the comment while briefing journalists at his secretariat on export performance of the just concluded fiscal year yesterday. To monitor prices, especially those of onion and garlic, ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the government already directed the deputy commissioners, said Tipu. \"We have come to know that the Indian government has withdrawn incentives against export of onion, which may be a reason for the price hike. I have already asked the commerce secretary to check it and take necessary steps,\" said the minister. \"We are closely monitoring the prices of essentials and if needed, onion will be sold at open market through Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB),\" said Tipu.

The second severe storm in a week to hit Britain brought high winds of more than 140km an hour and more than a month's worth of rain in 48 hours in some places, leading officials to issue rare \"danger to life\" warnings. The storm also pummelled much of France, with some 20,000 people still without electricity on Monday after suffering power cuts in the northwest of the country and rail traffic disrupted. \"This is not yet over,\" warned James Bevan, chief executive of the Environment Agency, which is responsible for flood protection in England. \"We still have many flood warnings in force and we may still see significant flooding in the middle of this week from larger rivers,\" he told BBC radio. Bevan said more than 400 homes in England had been flooded while at least 1,000 agency staff were working around the clock alongside emergency officials \"to protect and support those communities which have been hit.\" Major incidents declared More than 600 warnings and alerts - a record number - were issued on Sunday, extending from the River Tweed on the border of England and Scotland, to Cornwall in southwest England. After a day of torrential rain, major flooding incidents were later declared in south Wales and parts of western England. Some five \"severe\" warnings - denoting lives could be endangered by the flooding - remained active Monday on two rivers in Worcestershire and Herefordshire in west central England. Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue service on Sunday airlifted to hospital one man pulled from the River Teme, who was in a stable condition on Monday. But emergency responders suspended the search overnight for a missing woman also swept away by the floodwater near the town of flood-prone town of Tenbury, according to police. \"The search has continued this morning, including the use of the police helicopter,\" said Chief Superintendent Tom Harding, from West Mercia Police. \"Sadly, however, due to the circumstances of the length of time in the water and other conditions we believe that this will now be a recovery rather than rescue operation.\" Two rivers in south Wales burst their banks, prompting rescue workers to launch operations in several places to evacuate people and their pets trapped in their homes. Police said a man in his 60s died after entering the River Tawe, north of the Welsh city of Swansea but later clarified that the death was not \"linked to the adverse weather.\" On Saturday, the coastguard said the bodies of two men were pulled from rough seas off the south coast of England as the storm barrelled in. One is thought to have been the subject of a search triggered when a tanker reported that one of its crew was unaccounted for. 'More extreme' In northern England, the defence ministry deployed troops in West Yorkshire, which suffered badly from flooding caused by last weekend's Storm Ciara. There are fears rivers there could burst their banks later on Monday. Newly appointed environment secretary George Eustice said the government had done \"everything that we can do with a significant sum of money\" to combat increased flooding. \"We'll never be able to protect every single household just because of the nature of climate change and the fact that these weather events are becoming more extreme.\" France was also affected by the storm, especially northwestern Brittany where the Finistere and Morbihan regions were temporarily placed on orange alert for rain and flooding, according to the national weather service Meteo-France. Electricity provider Enedis said it had deployed 450 staff to restore power to 30,000 homes in Brittany. Power cuts also hit parts of northern and central France. The storm interrupted two high-speed TGV train services, one stopped by a fallen tree and the other by a power failure, the national rail company SNCF said."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-10 00:00:00      \nDespite the coronavirus precautions, voters were enthusiastic Early voting in South Korea's parliamentary election began on Friday with coronavirus patients casting ballots at disinfected polling stations and candidates bumping fists instead of pressing the flesh as they appeal for support. The election could decide the control of parliament and shape President Moon Jae-in's ability to implement his agenda in the final two years of his administration, including looser fiscal policy aimed at creating jobs, raising the minimum wage, and continued re-engagement with North Korea. The National Election Commission set up eight polling stations for more than 3,000 coronavirus patients receiving treatment as well as 900 medical staff at treatment centres in hard-hit areas, including the capital, Seoul, and Daegu city. The election is on April 15 but officials are hoping that people will take advantage of early voting to reduce the numbers crowding polling locations that day. Polling stations were disinfected on Thursday and all voters were required to wear a mask, use sanitizers and wear plastic gloves. Officials checked temperatures and anyone higher than 37.5 Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit) was directed to special booths. Despite the coronavirus precautions, voters were enthusiastic. \"It was a little uncomfortable since I had to put on plastic,\" said Kim Ju-yeon, 22, who voted at a polling station at Seoul Station, referring to the gloves she had to wear. \"But because voting is a must, the experience was reassuring.\" There are 3,500 stations for voters to cast their ballots during two days of early voting starting on Friday. Moon cast his ballot at a polling station near the presidential office, known as the Blue House. \"There might be a long line of voters on the election day. I hope the early voting distributes that number,\" Moon said after voting. The government is also considering how some 46,500 people who have not tested positive but are in self-quarantine - most of them returnees from abroad - can cast their ballots. \"We are in consultation with related ministries on how to ensure the right to vote for those in self-quarantine on April 15,\" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters on Friday. Kim said the people in self-isolation could not take part in the early voting because of the risk they might be infected. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 new coronavirus cases on Friday, bringing the national tally to 10,450. The national death toll rose by four to 208. Candidates who began campaigning early this month have been wearing masks and exchanging fist bumps with voters in small meetings, shunning handshakes and big rallies. \"We're refraining from large rallies as much as possible and also limiting personal contact,\" said Lee Nak-yon, a former prime minister running for the parliament. The head of the main opposition United Future Party, Hwang Kyo-ahn, was spotted disinfecting residential areas. "

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-26 00:00:00      \nAt the same time, political parties aside from the ruling Awami League party have been clamouring against the use of EVMs, claiming it is not secure and is even 'unconstitutional.' In the face of immense public pressure, authorities deferred the Dhaka city corporation polls, but political pressure has failed to remove Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) from the election. Election day was scheduled for January 30 - a holiday for Saraswati Puja - which prompted an outcry from rights groups which called it discriminatory. The Election Commission refused to change the date initially, offering a tottering defence, but later rescheduled elections for February 1. At the same time, political parties aside from the ruling Awami League party have been clamouring against the use of EVMs, claiming it is not secure and is even \"unconstitutional.\" Chief Election Commissioner KM Nurul Huda said on December 25 that EVMs would not be used if there were objections, but later said they would be used.  EVMs were deployed in limited fashion in the 2018 General Elections, and saw only half the votes cast with them in six constituencies. Voter reactions were mixed, with complaints about the machines showing technical glitches. Though the EC said on January 21 that the army will not be deployed for the polls, Colonel Kamal Uddin, director of the project implementing EVMs, said army personnel familiar with the EVM technology will be present at every centre to help the presiding officers. The EC has deployed 35,000 EVMs in 2,468 polling centres for use in the Dhaka polls.  File Photo: Voters cast their votes via EVMs | Syed Zakir Hossain/Dhaka Tribune Twice the machines Colonel Kamal said that each centre will have double the machines. \"We are doubling the EVMs at each centre to instantly move from any machine that shows problems.\" Authorities declined to reveal the cost of the EVMs being used. The machines were purchased from Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory (BMTF). In September 2018, it was reported that the government has approved Tk3,825 crore for the procurement of 150,000 machines at a cost of Tk2 lakh each. In 2011, the EC purchased EVMs from the BMTF at Tk46,501 apiece, which were considered more vulnerable and were subsequently destroyed. Colonel Kamal said returning officers and presiding officers are already being trained to use the EVMs. A demonstration is set for January 27 and the EC has scheduled a mock vote for January 30 to familiarize voters with the technology. Hack-proof EVMs? Colonel Kamal confidently said: \"The EVMs are very secure. As for hackers, if they have guts and are tech savvy, they can try hacking the EVMs. EVMs are not even connected to the internet.\" However, hacking is not limited to the internet. Experts have pointed out that EVMs are still vulnerable to manual tampering. Components can be compromised, but the complexity of the process makes wide scale tampering unfeasible. He also said the EC's decision to widely use EVMs stemmed from responses to  city corporation elections in other districts.  Brig Gen Mohammad Sidul Islam, director general of the EC's NID Wing, said: \"Voters can only cast ballots in their own constituency. No other EVM will accept his ballot. On election day, the presiding officer inserts an SD card into the EVM, with voter data of that particular constituency . Anyone not on the list will be unable to vote and anyone listed in one constituency will not be able to vote in another. The EC said around 70 staff are working round the clock to tweak and upgrade the EVM system in whatever minute way possible, before the machines are rolled out."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-29 00:00:00      \nAt least 42 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim violence this week Days after the violence in Delhi's northeast, many families are still searching for relatives who went missing during the riot. Some located their relatives' bodies in hospitals, which have reported 42 deaths till Friday, the Times of India (TOI) reports. Shami Ahmed, like most people TOI spoke to at the morgue in the past few days, hesitated to reveal full names of the deceased. \"My nephew Babbu said he would take his auto and not ply in the locality to avoid the violence.\" Two hours later, they had learned Babbu had been found in a pool of blood, and taken to hospital, where upon reaching he died, Shami said.  A distressed woman was yet to locate her missing husband. \"Dilshad is nowhere to be found,\" a frantic Farha said. \"He left home Tuesday morning and there has been no contact with him since. We have five children. I am at my wit's end.\" Most families have already checked hospitals, the emergency block and the morgue, assuming they would find their relatives, but to no avail. Authorities say situation calmer The situation in northeast Delhi after days of clashes over the controversial citizenship law is relatively peaceful on Saturday, sources told NDTV. The ban on large gatherings, however, is still on in neighbourhoods where mobs clashed.  The Indian Home Ministry has said the North Delhi Municipal Corporation has cleared most of the debris from public places. The authorities said traffic is normal at most northeast Delhi areas and people have started going to work. A few shop-owners have pulled up their shutters amid the scorched urban landscape scarred by petrol bombs and damaged by bricks. The worst affected areas, however, have fallen silent as most of the residents have left. The authorities said these areas will take some time to return to normal. People should \"not believe in rumours and fall prey to evil designs of miscreants and groups interested in precipitating communal tension,\" the Indian Home Ministry said. What happened Indian police said on Friday they had detained 512 people and were keeping a heavy presence in northeast New Delhi, days after the worst bout of sectarian violence in the capital in decades, reports Reuters. At least 42 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim violence this week, police said, amid mounting international criticism that authorities failed to protect minority Muslims."

The Earth-sized exoplanet orbits around its star's habitable zone, meaning that the temperature is mild enough to allow a rocky planet to support liquid water. The distant world was discovered when scientists were picking through old observations that came from the Kepler space telescope, which stopped its work in 2018 but provided a vast trove of data from the stars before it did. The planet had previously been discarded by a computer algorithm that misidentified it. But as part of new research, scientists were able to have another look at the information in the Kepler data and see that it really was a previously undiscovered planet. In fact, it is the most similar to Earth of any planet discovered by the Kepler space telescope, in terms of its size and estimated temperature. While other exoplanets may be more similar in size or temperature, no world has been discovered that has quite such a combination of those two qualities, as well as lying in the habitable zone. The planet is 300 light-years from us, just a little larger than our Earth and receives about 75% of the light that we get from our own Sun. That means the temperature could be similar, too, allowing for the conditions required for life. Scientists are concerned, however, that its star is a red dwarf, unlike our own more stable Sun. Such stars are known for throwing out stellar flare-ups that could destroy any potential life before it takes hold on the planet. Scientists now hope to learn more about the planet, including any information about its atmosphere and to get more specific knowledge of its size and conditions."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-07 00:00:00      \nOver a lakh people living in the upazilas fear that if an erosion occurs again in the locality, it will be difficult for them to settle and earn their livelihood Thousands of people in Shariatpur are living in constant fear of an upcoming erosion even as they struggle to cope with the ongoing lockdown in light of the deadly Covid-19 outbreak that challenges their livelihood. The flood control embankment construction project on the Padma river, flowing through Naria and Zajira upazilas of the district, has come to a halt with the recent outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic that has led to a nationwide lockdown. Over a lakh people living in the upazilas fear that if an erosion occurs again in the locality --which is highly likely as it happens every year-- it will be difficult for them to settle and earn their livelihood. The poverty-stricken locality had hardly any respite from the damage caused by the last erosion and yet there is now a threat of another. Over six thousand people --who lost their homestead and belongings in the last erosion-- settling in on others' land either through pity or rent are in a huge crisis. Roksana Begum, a resident of Naria upazila, lost everything to the river last year and now, when she and her husband both are jobless, the pandemic is making each day of their lives harder as the days go by. She said: \"We made a shed on a neighbour's land temporarily. We were hoping to get back to our normal life after the flood control embankment project was completed. But now erosion is coming towards us in one way and coronavirus has come in another. \"We have no money or anyone to help us. Either we will die of the disease or of poverty. It does not make much difference to us,\" Roksana added in sheer despair. Thousands of working class people, who lost everything in the regular erosion in the area like Roksana are facing the same difficulties. They are without work, income, food and scope for treatment.  Despite government-allocated ration goods, said another resident of the area seeking anonymity, people have been sleeping on hungry stomachs as they are not getting help or it would be correct to say that their goods are being looted by local representatives and political activists.  Mohadeb Das, a kitchen shopkeeper of Hindupara, said he used to own a large store. However, after the river devoured it, he was managing well with his single-shed kitchen shop by the riverside.  He said: \"I was waiting to see the embankment project completed. But now no one comes to my shop because of the disease and the river is closing in every day to consume my shop, my only means of livelihood again.\" Rashida Begum, who rented her neighbour's house after losing her home in the erosion, said: \"We were well off, with our daily jobs and income. It was not much but enough for a couple like us. \"But due to the coronavirus, we lost our jobs and did not have any help or rations from the authority. We do not know what will we do,\" said Rashida, who has been suffering from acute poverty due to the outbreak of the pandemic. Denying the allegations, Kazi Abu Taher, Deputy Commissioner of Shariatpur, told Dhaka Tribune that there was not a single house in his locality which had not been given proper help and not a single person was there who was hungry or had been deprived of rations. According to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), the flood control embankment project, stretching for 8.9 kilometres, was initiated in 2018 and was expected to be completed in 2021 at a cost of Tk1,097 crore. However, 33% of work remaining for the project has now come to a halt as workers have left for their homes with the outbreak of the pandemic. Stating that the project would be completed in due time, BWDB Executive Engineer Ahsan Habib said: \"The project is still ongoing in fractionally. Even if it gets halted overall, we will speed up the construction work later to complete it in due time.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-29 00:00:00      \nShuvo told the visiting journalists that he immersed himself in robotics related subjects from an early age dreaming of making robot one day Shuvo Karmakar is a tenth-grader from Kalupara village in Agoiljhara upazila of Barisal, attending Gaila Secondary High School. He spent about Tk 25,000 to make an artificial intelligence (AI) robot named \"Robin\", that can communicate in both English and Bangla.  The thought of creating Robin came after Shuvo saw robot Sofia.  He made sure the robot could speak Bangla unlike Sophia. The cost of making Robin was much less than Sophia, said Shuvo to local journalists. Shuvo told the visiting journalists that he immersed himself in robotics related subjects from an early age dreaming of making robot one day. So he gathered knowledge about robotics and programming from the internet. He learned that the word 'robot' derived from the Czech word 'robota,' that means forced labour, slave of man, or the machine that can work continuously and spontaneously and would be an alternative for various human activities.    When his friends played outside, he remained home in front of the computer, going from one website to another to learn robotics and programming.  He started to make Robin on May 25, 2018, and it took him about eight months to complete in January 2019, spending around Tk 25,000. The robot was named Robin after a superhero of a cartoon show in the USA.  To make Robin locally and affordably, Shuvo managed to acquire hardware from local shops in Dhaka and Barisal, and from online. After completion, he enriched Robin with several useful features like self-learning and using machine-learning algorithms to process information. It can also tell the names of its maker, and top leaders and officials of the country. A sensor in Robin can detect fire emergencies and send location information to the nearest fire service office via Google Maps. Robin is also a treasure of information for interacting with children to teach them the basics of different subjects. It can also  provide valuable insight to farmers about producing and caring for crops. Shuvo is now working on improving Robin by giving eyesight and movement on legs instead of working on wheels.   \"If I get enough support, I can improve Robin more to reach further heights in the field of robotics, by making a robot even better than Sofia,\" said Shuvo. Shuvo received an award from Dr Dipu Moni on July 5, 2019, and at the National Children's Prize held in 2018.  He was also honoured with an award from Science and Technology Affairs Minister Yeafesh Osman at The National Science and Technology Fair on June 26, 2018, and different prizes from upazila, district, and divisional shows and competitions. Businessman Santosh Karmakar and Dipti Karmakar, father and mother of Shuvo, said he is the older of their two children, and family members are happy and proud of Shuvo. His parents say they will continue to support him to follow his passion."

Addressing an online press briefing from his office at the secretariat in Dhaka, Dr Enamur Rahman said: \"There are 120 cyclone shelters in Bhashan Char. However, all the Rohingya people currently living in the char have been taken to one of them.\" Bangladesh Navy personnel are taking care of them, he said, adding that all necessary facilities were being provided to the refugees. Some 308 Rohingyas were sent to live in Bhashan Char, an island off the coast of Noakhali, earlier this month after they were rescued from boats in the sea during their failed illegal attempt to travel to Malaysia on different occasions. The government plans to keep the refugees, who were among the 1.1 million living in the sprawling and cramped camps outside the town of Cox's Bazar, there permanently. Meanwhile, different quarters have expressed concern over the authorities moving the Rohingyas on the \"flood-prone island\" to storm shelters as cyclone Amphan, the strongest recorded in the region, is set to make landfall on Bangladesh coast on Wednesday evening. The eastern edge of the storm headed for Bangladesh and neighbouring India is also expected to batter Bhashan Char island. \"Each block has a cyclone centre and they have been moved to the centre,\" Bimal Chakma, a senior official of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission, told Reuters. The United Nations has called for the refugees to be moved to the camps in Cox's Bazar. Although the Cox's Bazar settlement, the world's largest refugee camp, is expected to escape the worst of the storm, the danger level has been raised to nine from six, signifying a severe threat. Heavy rain and high winds lashed the flimsy shelters, built on hills prone to landslides, and red flags were raised to warn refugees to stay inside. Aid workers say the cyclone could hamper efforts to control the novel coronavirus outbreak in the camps, which reported their first infections last week. \"It is already a huge challenge to contain the spread of coronavirus amongst the Rohingya refugees living in over-crowded camps, sharing water and toilet facilities,\" said Dipankar Datta, the country director of charity Oxfam in Bangladesh. Water-borne and other infections were also a threat, he added in a statement. Bangladeshis and Rohingya are among thousands of volunteers trained in emergency response measures who received life-jackets and torches. \"We are using megaphones and the mosque microphones to warn people,\" said Sabbir Ahmed, a 24-year-old Rohingya volunteer.

Addressing the discussion, Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, said: \"We must not recall  his contributions only annually. And I hope his role will not be lost sight of in the shadows of formal events recalling everything that he did for us.  \"If someone fails to understand Sir Abed, he or she will never understand what Bangladesh is,\" said the noted economist, adding, \"Sir Abed kept in touch with almost everyone he knew.\"  \"Since its inception, Brac has discovered itself in many ways and also encouraged the formation of many other organisations of such kind. \"Writing a book can never depict Sir Abed's works. To truly portray his professional life, a study centre can be established so that Abed lives in the hearts of the generations to come,\" Yunus stated.

In her remarks, educationist Rasheda K Choudhury recalled that Sir Abed not only used to dream of a prosperous future for all but also tirelessly worked towards attaining it. \"He fought radicals all his life in order to empower women in society. There was even a time when a school run by Brac was set afire, but Sir Abed was relaxed about that.  \"I hope those groomed by Sir Abed will take the responsibility of taking his vision ahead and implement it fully,\" she added.  Chandra Shekhar Saha, executive member of National Crafts Council, said: \"Sir Abed never wanted any children to be deprived of schooling. He dreamt of making education an enjoyable exercise.\"  Sukhendra Kumar Sarkar, former treasurer of Brac University, noted that Sir Abed was a visionary who used to plan the future in advance. He added, \"Other than fighting poverty, education and health for all were the other two top priorities of his.\"  Among others, former cultural affairs minister and eminent media personality Asaduzzaman Noor, Martha Chen of Harvard University, Erum Mariam of Brac University, Majeda Khanam of Brac, and Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman, Brac's incumbent chairperson, were present at the event."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-03 00:00:00      \nScientists say it will take several months to get results from trials testing the BCG vaccine to fight Covid-19 There is no vaccine against the novel coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, that is spreading rapidly around the world. But scientists in several countries are testing a century-old tuberculosis (TB) vaccine to see if it might boost the immune system to reduce respiratory symptoms in people who get new coronavirus infections. Researchers in Australia and Europe are testing whether the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, introduced in the 1920s to fight tuberculosis, might be deployed to combat Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.  Clinical trials are focused on two groups at high-risk for Covid-19: health care workers and the elderly. Here is what scientists know, and what they are trying to find out: How can a TB vaccine help with other infections? The BCG vaccine contains a live but weakened strain of tuberculosis bacteria that provokes the body to develop antibodies to attack TB bacteria. This is called an adaptive immune response, because the body develops a defence against a specific disease-causing microorganism, or pathogen, after encountering it. Most vaccines create an adaptive immune response to a single pathogen. Unlike other vaccines, the BCG vaccine may also boost the innate immune system, first-line defences that keep a variety of pathogens from entering the body or from establishing an infection. One study in Guinea-Bissau found 50% lower mortality rates in children vaccinated with BCG than in kids who did not get this vaccine. That is a much bigger drop in deaths than could be explained by a reduction in TB cases. Some studies have found similar reductions in respiratory infections among teens and the elderly.  What scientists do not know Scientists do not have data yet on the effect of BCG vaccination on coronaviruses in general or SARS-CoV-2 in particular. There are also many BCG vaccines, with different capacities to protect against various TB strains. Scientists need to determine which BCG vaccines might have the best ability to boost the innate immune system to fight Covid-19. Who should get the BCG vaccine right now? Scientists say it will take several months to get results from trials testing the BCG vaccine to fight Covid-19.  In the meantime, people should not rush to get it because it has not been widely tested in adults and might be harmful. Also, a run on the BCG vaccine to fight Covid-19 might cause shortages for children who need it to prevent TB. "

The equipment, including a helicopter and a rover craft, will add a new dimension in terms of disaster management, he said.  The minister said there is no alternative to drill to reduce losses and risks of disaster. It can play an important role to create awareness among the public.  Last year, the number of causalities was limited at Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital just because of drill before the fire incident, he said.    He said they have decided to tour risky hospitals, markets and buildings across Bangladesh so that people can be aware of disasters like fire and earthquake.

Subhankar Sarkar, an Indian citizen, asked if the prime minister possessed citizenship documents under Right to Information Act, on February 17. In response to his question, Under Secretary of the Indian Prime Minister's Office, Praveen Kumar wrote: \"Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi is a citizen of India by birth in terms of Section 3 of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and as such the question of his having a citizenship certificate which is for citizenship by registration does not arise.\"  Amid ongoing turmoil over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across India, the statement has created quite a stir. Ever since the right wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government passed the CAA, protests against the controversial citizenship law have continued across India, with every citizen worrying over how to prove citizenship. Even Modi fails to show the citizenship certificate.  At least 42 people were killed in Hindu-Muslim violence in northeast New Delhi, amid mounting international criticism that authorities failed to protect minority Muslims. The clashes began over a citizenship law that Modi's Hindu nationalist government introduced in December providing a path to Indian citizenship for six religious groups from neighbouring countries - but not Muslims. Critics say the law is discriminatory and comes on top of other measures such as withdrawal of autonomy for Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir, that has deepened disquiet about the future of India's 200 million Muslims. Critics of the government however blamed this week's violence on members of Modi's BJP, which was trounced in local Delhi elections at the beginning of the month.  The violence morphed into street battles between Hindu and Muslim groups, with the police largely ineffective in ending the violence."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-06 00:00:00      \nHe proposed a three-point plan for India's current economic slowdown and social unrest Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has spoken out against the recent predicaments unravelling in India including the economic slowdown, social unrest, and global coronavirus epidemic. Over the past few weeks, Delhi has been subjected to extreme violence over religious disputes following the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which provides access to citizenship for religiously persecuted minorities, excluding Muslims.  Singh, in an op-ed in The Hindu, even criticized people who use past instances of such violence in India's history to justify the present violence in the country, adding that: \"Every act of sectarian violence is a blemish on Mahatma Gandhi's India.\" Singh suggested that the Indian government implement a three-point plan which includes taking measures to contain the coronavirus threat, withdrawing or amending the Citizenship Act, and creating a holistic fiscal stimulus plan to boost consumption demand.  By removing religious stipulations from the Citizenship Act, India would be ending the toxic social climate and foster national unity, as well as reviving the economy. India's economy is currently facing an economic slowdown due to a lack of new private investment, since investors are unwilling to take on new projects over the looming uncertainty of volatile social tensions.  The lack of investment translates to a lack of jobs and incomes, which in turn means a lack of consumption and demand in the economy. This lack of demand further suppresses private investments, leading to a vicious cycle.  Singh, a renowned economist, stated that no amount of tweaking of tax rates, showering of corporate incentives, or goading will propel Indian or foreign businesses to invest, when the risk of eruption of sudden violence in one's neighbourhood looms large. Furthermore, the fear of the coronavirus epidemic reaching India threatens to dampen economic growth, further exacerbating the dire situation of the Indian economy. Despite the ambiguity of the situation, Singh proposes that India launch a full-scale, mission-mode operation to counter the threat immediately. Moreover, Singh has said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi must convince the nation that he is cognizant of the dangers and reassure the nation that he can help tide over this period of violence and uncertainty as smoothly as possible. He must also provide details of a contingency plan for the threat of the coronavirus scare. He adds that the virus contagion and the slowing down of China can potentially open up an opportunity for India to unleash reforms to become a larger player in the global economy and vastly improve prosperity levels for millions of Indians. \"It is time to confront the harsh reality of the grave risks we face as a nation and address them squarely and sufficiently.\" "

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-13 00:00:00      \nBeing able to separate coronavirus from other common sicknesses such as cold or allergies may save people from unnecessary anxiety The coronavirus (Covid-19) has become an epidemic, infecting more than 100,000 people worldwide. While the chances of any individual person catching the virus are still low, it is natural that people may feel worried every time they get a sore throat or the beginnings of a bad cough. Therefore, being able to separate coronavirus from other common sicknesses such as cold or allergies may save people from unnecessary (or otherwise) anxiety.   If you have itchy eyes or runny nose you probably have allergies or a specific kind of cold \"The issue with seasonal allergies is that they affect the nose and eye,\" says Dr. Greg Poland, a professor of medicine and Infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic and director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. \"They tend to be nasal, and most symptoms are localized to the head, unless you also experience a rash.\" Coronavirus and flu symptoms tend to be more systemic \"The flu and the novel coronavirus, these affect other systems and the lower respiratory tract,\" Poland says.  He adds \"You probably won't have a runny nose, but what you might have is a sore throat, a cough, a fever or shortness of breath. So, it's a subtly different clinical diagnosis.\" He says it's very unlikely that allergies would lead to a fever. They generally don't cause shortness of breath either, unless the person has a preexisting condition like asthma. Allergy symptoms occur frequently, and are usually mild Dr. Greg Poland says that if you have similar symptoms around the same time each year then you probably have seasonal allergies. Over the counter medication and other regular health precautions may help you feel better in that case, reports CNN. Coronavirus and flu symptoms can retire you to bed rest \"If you have an acute case of coronavirus or flu, you will feel so tired, so achy, you'd basically be driven to bed. Everybody would see the difference,\" Poland says. \"Allergies may make you feel tired, but they're not going to cause severe muscle or joint ache.\" Mild flu and cold symptoms usually sort themselves out Proper rest and care will usually heal you from normal illness within a few days.  Coronavirus and severe flu symptoms could get worse over time If you have the flu or coronavirus you may get worse when you expect to get better. \"What would increase the suspicion of coronavirus would be if you were short of breath,\" says Poland. \"People can also develop pneumonia from the flu, which has a similar presentation, so either way you're going to want to seek medical attention.\" Allergies, cold, flu and coronavirus could have similar early symptoms Dr. Greg Poland says that initial stages of cold, allergies, flue and coronavirus can look very similar. That is why it is important to notice if the symptoms persist, especially if you are in an at-risk group, reports CNN. \"We're worried about older people, people with asthma or other lung diseases, people with heart disease or diabetes, and also pregnant women,\" he says. Coronavirus cases are usually situational Poland says if you think you have coronavirus any doctor is bound to ask you some contextual questions such as: \"You're like a detective, trying to accept and put together pieces of data,\" he says. \"If someone who hasn't left the middle of Kansas thinks they have the coronavirus, I would say take a Tylenol, have plenty of fluids and rest.\" Just because it isn't the coronavirus, doesn't mean it isn't serious The influenza virus has killed several times more people than the coronavirus during the same time period. And yet it is often dismissed as something far less dangerous. Analyzing data on the impact of these diseases may provide better understanding of their seriousness.  Conclusion While unnecessary anxiety of having the coronavirus is best avoided, it is a good idea to stay cautious, take preventive measures, be mindful of your medical history, and routinely check for symptoms."

A Dhaka court on December 2, 2019 issued the warrant against them in a case filed by Arab Bangladesh (AB) Bank. Following the court order, police on Wednesday conducted a drive at their residence in Gulshan 1 in the capital. Gulshan police station officer-in-charge (OC) MdKamruzzaman said they were trying to arrest them. According to banking sources, Latif Siddique's family members formed two companies - Dhaleshwari Limited and Majestica Holdings Ltd -- for printing press and real estate business. Laila Siddque, wife of Latif Siddique, is the chairman of the two companies, Anik Siddiqui, their son, is the managing director of those companies while Raina Farzin, their daughter, is the director of those companies, as per the sources. They took Tk55.62 crore from AB Bank, Tk56 crore from state-owned Janata Bank and Tk31 crore from Padma Bank. Majestica Holdings Ltd is among the top 300 defaulters' list, which was disclosed in parliament last year. Latif Siddique, the former MP from Tangail-4 seat, was in charge of the textiles and jute ministry in the Awami League's 2009-13 term. Dhaka Tribune reporter was trying to reach Anik Siddiqui over phone but he did not receive the phone. Talking to Dhaka Tribune, Tarique Afzal managing director of AB Bank, said: \"Now we are strict against all defaulters.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-18 00:00:00      \nNear about 500,000 to 1,000,000cft (Cubic Feet) topsoils are being used to make 3 to 4 million bricks every year Large-scale use of topsoil from vast areas of farmlands for brick manufacturing in Panchagarh has been inflicting catastrophic damage on agriculture as well the environment. Vast agricultural lands have been losing fertility as well as crop yield capacity for over decades due to the loss of topsoil--which is the outermost layer of soil with the highest concentration of organic matter. Farmers in the district have long been victims of exploitation and have been manipulated by local brokers to sell their fertile-most soil to brick kiln owners. In this way, around 52 brick kilns have been set up around the farmlands of Debiganj, Boda, and Atwari upazila, which are using fertile topsoil of thousand hectares of arable land to make millions of bricks every year. Collection of topsoil from farmlands surrounding brick kilns begins after the Aman harvest and continues for the next one and a half months, locals say. As most nutrients and organic properties along with beneficial microorganisms reside on the top part of the soil when removed, the soil becomes infertile; the bare chemical-infested soil residue washes into the adjacent water bodies, resulting in scores of environmental and health hazards. On a field visit, this correspondent saw numerous trucks filled with the soil, and the farmlands dug 10ft to 15ft under.  Near about 500,000 to 1,000,000cft (Cubic Feet) topsoils are being used to make 3 to 4 million bricks every year. Even though removing topsoil is a punishable offence, locals say neither the brick kiln owners nor the authorities abide by the law. They allege local political influencers are behind these atrocities. Dhananjay Rai, a resident of Debiganj's Nayanpara village, said he sold per bigha of topsoil from his land at Tk26,000. Jagadish Chandra Rai, manager of MML Bricks Kiln in Boda upazila, said they need 250,000 to 500,000cft soil each season to make 500,000 to 800,000 bricks. He said: \"We never face any objection from anyone regarding the use of topsoil. We never force farmers, in fact, they are willing to sell soil from their lands for the profits.\" Md Shamim Iqbal, upazila agriculture officer (UAO) of Debiganj, said: \"Due to this trend of diminishing topsoil at such a rapid rate, farmable lands and crop yields will decline in future as well as having devastating environmental impacts.\" Boda UAO Al Mamun Or-Rashid said the brick kiln owners are using a syndicate of brokers to manipulate the farmers to sell their lands. Touhidul Bari Babu, head of the Geography and Environmental Science department of Panchagarh Govt Women's College, said: \"The situation is truly alarming as fertilizers can longer make the soil fertile without putting a stop to the damage of nutrients in the soil.\" Md Abu Hanif, deputy director of the district's Department of Agricultural Extension, said: \"We can only build awareness among farmers so they stop selling topsoil. But, we are unable to take legal action against the brick kilns.\" Sabina Yasmin, deputy commissioner of Panchagarh, was unwilling to comment on the matter, while Debiganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer Prottoy Hasan said they will take measures to ensure proper awareness among farmers and legal actions against the offenders."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-12 00:00:00      \nInstead of being termed as a punishment house, the jail seems more like a skill development centre with all kinds of skills being taught to the inmates It is a common perception that jails are punishment centres where criminals are tortured and beaten up to change their criminal activities and bring change in them. However, the Kushtia Jail presents a different picture. Instead of being termed as a punishment house, the jail seems more like a skill development centre with all kinds of skills being taught to the inmates. The jail authorities here focus on making the prisoners self-reliant and help them channel their time and energy towards positive contribution to the society.  Established in 1968, the Kushtia Jail has the capacity to house 600 inmates. However, the jail currently houses 950 inmates, including 40 females. The initiative - which was started on June, 2017, by the Superintendent of Jail Md Zaker Hossain - is solely funded by the jail and works as a self-sufficient project where each inmate teaches another, said officials from Kushtia jail. The prisoners are engaged in many skillful activities including fabrication unit, weaving, handicrafts, dressmaking, power-loom, electrical and music training. In the fabrication unit, inmates make various items like Sari (a local garment worn by Bangladeshi women), Lungi (A garment worn by local Bangladeshi men), and monochords (one chord musical instrument) which are sold at the sales centre of the jail. Similarly, prisoners at the weaving unit manufacture handloom items like blankets, bedsheets, pillow covers, towels, fabric pieces, and hand-crafted products. Moreover, the prisoners take music and Arabic lessons every morning lessons from the districts' most esteemed teachers. They get to pursue their inner passion, organize regular cultural programs and even perform in front of guests visiting the prison. Prison authorities say, they identify the illiterate inmates as soon as they arrive at the prison, make a list, assess and enlist them to different groups to make the learning experience better and coherent, in order to help them achieve their goals in line with their interests. At the same time, a library has been set up inside the jail. The initiative has been taken to give prisoners a chance to read books. However, there is a lot of work left to be done in the library due to lack of funds. Sohel Rana, a prisoner who is sentenced to life at Kushtia Jail, is said to have helped 900 illiterate inmates so far to learn the basics. From 2017 to till date, 3,288 people have been taught to sign their names by him. Nahid Hasan, Nasim, Channu Miah, Fazle Rabbi, Nur Mohammad, who served at the jail in different times, said they were trained in electronics and now, as free citizens they are working as professional electricians and earning good money to support their families. Nur Mohammad, a resident of Chourhash area of Kushtia municipality, said that he too, like his other inmates, he feels dignified and empowered after getting back to his normal life. He said: \"I am a professional electrician and earn Tk600 each day. It feels good to be self reliant.\" Rubel Hossain of Sadar upazila said he is grateful to the jail authorities for his new life and said: \"I now work at a telecom shop and earn Tk10000 each month.  My life has changed.\" Parul's husband, Ismail, serves at the prison, and she said that he was previously  illiterate but can now can read and write. When contacted, Superintendent of Jail Md Zaker Hossain said their focus is on making the jail a correctional centre, rather than punishing them for which they are already convicted. \"We are working day and night to make the prisoners self-reliant so that they can live their lives as responsible citizens after finishing their terms here.\" \"The prisoners are getting half the amount of what their manufactured products are sold for and that can help them to re-initiate their learning when they get out,\" he added. Deputy Commissioner Md Aslam Hossain said: \"We are discussing with the concerned authorities to see if the prisoners can be helped  with loans that can help to kickstart their business after leaving the prison.\""

On the real-time rankings, Dhaka showed an average AQI score of 99 at 10:02am on Wednesday, according to IQAir, which monitors global air quality. Dhaka's air quality was classified as \"moderate.\" Residential areas like Bashundhara and Gulshan showed AQI scores of 118 and 88 respectively. India's Delhi, China's Chengdu, and Vietnam's Hanoi occupied the first, second, and third spots in the list of cities with the worst air quality with AQI scores of 191, 168, and 163 respectively. A numerical value between 151 and 200 indicates that everyone may begin to experience health effects. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. Air quality between 201 and 300 is classified as \"very unhealthy.\" If the score is between 301 and 500, then it is classified as \"hazardous.\"  The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants -- Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh has been struggling with air pollution for a long time. Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Brick kilns, vehicles run on fuel containing higher levels of sulphur, as well as construction work, have all been identified as major sources of air pollution. Air quality further declines during the dry months -- from October to April -- but improves during the monsoon."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-09 00:00:00      \nA slapstick comedy about a ten-year-old boy fervently idolizing Hitler? Jojo Rabbit is indeed a nod to the remarkable power of humour Rainer Maria Rilke, one of the most gifted German poets who is frequently quoted in Jojo Rabbit, appealed to his readers to \"let everything happen\" to them, to delight in the humbling embrace of all beauty and terror. And Taika Waititi's coming-of-age drama Jojo Rabbit is the rare convergence of these two profound, albeit opposite truths of life. Jojo Rabbit is a World War II satire revolving around a German boy named Jojo who joins a Hitler Youth camp and starts having qualms about the Third Reich afterwards when he discovers his mother has hidden a Jewish girl named Elsa in the crawlspace of their house.  A slapstick comedy about a ten-year-old boy fervently idolizing Hitler? Jojo Rabbit is indeed a nod to the remarkable power of humour.  What this miracle of a film does so effectively is that it attempts to take the power away from the fascist narrative and exposes its idiocy through comedy. It sheds light on the buffoonish petulance of the likes of Hitler, but does not reduce the horrors of the Holocaust, rather emasculates its perpetrators with the help of a stellar cast and a balanced script.    Thomasin McKenzie plays a Jewish girl named Elsa in Jojo Rabbit, following her acclaimed performance in 2018's Leave No Trace| IMDb Jojo is a lonely young boy whose father has gone to war, never to come back. He has in turn filled the absence of his father with blind fanaticism. Hitler heils has certainly helped him drown out the noise within his troubled mind. However, upon finding Elsa, constrained by his innate nobility and ostensible cowardice, Jojo slowly begins to question the Nazi juggernaut. Telling this story from a child's perspective is arguably what makes the film work.     Thomasin McKenzie, who plays Elsa, has delivered another brilliantly understated performance following her acclaimed role in Leave no Trace. Elsa - a creative Jewish girl - does not give in to rage; her resilience rises above the oppression inflicted upon her people. She is caged, yet appears to be the embodiment of the strength that keeps the spirit of resistance alive.  On the other hand, Scarlett Johansson, in the vibrant role of Jojo's single mother, manages to pull off one of her career-best performances to this date, by playing an elegantly witty character who is unafraid to go beyond the mere aesthetics of resistance and the good old convenient life for a just cause.   Scarlett Johansson has earned her first two Oscar nominations - Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress - the latter for Jojo Rabbit| IMDb The depiction of Nazis as good people is bound to make certain critics blast this film, much like the fate in store for the Oscar-winning German film The Lives of Others. In light of the current political divide, there is merit to this discussion.   In August, 2017, neo-Nazis paraded the streets of Charlottesville, chanting anti-Semitic slogans. The US President Trump later famously addressed \"the very fine people\" on both sides, pandering to some of his white supremacist base. Consequently, he established a moral equivalence that in all objectivity does not exist.  Thankfully, Taika Waititi is more tactful than that. He succeeds at finding the tricky balance between the evils of fascism and the allures of resistance. There is an astonishing poignancy beneath the surface of humour, and whenever it swells into a crescendo, the transition feels seamless.  As World War II approaches its end in the latter half of Jojo Rabbit, we as audience members find ourselves not laughing along with Hitler. Rather, we are laughing at him, chipping away at his racial hatred. Therein lies the brilliance of Jojo Rabbit. "

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-08 00:00:00      \nLocals fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands The Kopotakkho River embankment suddenly collapsed Tuesday night, flooding 1,000 bighas of farmlands and fish enclosures in three low-lying villages in Assasuni upazila of Satkhira. Moreover, around 50 families have also become waterlogged in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishti Nandan villages under Pratapnagar union. Locals say the 100-ft dam was already in a risky state, so it naturally could not sustain the strong pressure of tidal current and collapsed into the bottom of the Kopotakkho River. Many local residents have started volunteering to repair the embankment with whatever materials currently available. They fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands. Contacted, Pratapnagar Union Parishad Chairman Jakir Hossain held the water development board responsible in this regard, saying it was their negligence that led to the collapse of the embankment every year. \"Despite repeated complaints and appeals seeking sustainable protection of the embankment, the water development board failed to acknowledge the urgency of the issue. \"Now, due to this recklessness, farmlands and fish enclosures on around 1,000 bighas of lands have been flooded in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishtinandan villages. Moreover, almost 50 families have become waterlogged.\" Contacted, Md Arifuzzaman, of the local water development board, after visiting the site said he had arranged sandbags for the temporary emergency repair of the damaged embankment to minimize the extent of damage and protect remaining lands. \"The higher authorities will be notified promptly so that the necessary steps may be taken to permanently repair embankment.\""

      "headline": "Asia cracks down on Covid-19 'fake news'",
      "authors": "AFP",
      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-10 00:00:00      \nAt least 266 people have been arrested for posting coronavirus-related information in 10 Asian countries Hundreds of people have been arrested across Asia for posting purported false coronavirus information, according to an AFP investigation, deepening concerns that growing government efforts to combat \"fake news\" will target the wrong people and silence dissent. From teenagers to a TV star, people have been wrongly detained under vaguely worded cybercrime laws or broad state-of-emergency powers ushered in since the outbreak began, rights groups say. \"Governments are using the 'fake news' label to dress up their rights-abusing efforts to censor views and statements that are at odds with whatever strategy they have taken to deal with the Covid-19 crisis,\" said Phil Robertson, Asia deputy director for Human Rights Watch (HRW). \"It's insane frankly. In many cases it's people being dragged out of their homes to the lock-up, put in pre-trial detention, in crowded spaces where they're more likely to get Covid-19.\" At least 266 people have been arrested for posting coronavirus-related information in 10 Asian countries, from Thailand to India and Mongolia, according to an AFP tally based on police reports. They include a local politician in India who claimed on Facebook that the government was downplaying virus fatalities, and a Malaysian TV personality made to pay a fine of several thousand US dollars after he posted a YouTube video criticising a hospital's handling of the pandemic. Authorities say criminalisation is needed to curb the online flood of dangerous fake cures and conspiracy theories that the World Health Organization (WHO) has called an \"infodemic.\" But HRW and other campaigners point to cases where opposition figures or journalists have been targeted - as well as questioning the fairness of arresting ordinary people who may not even realize they are spreading misinformation. A middle-aged woman in Sri Lanka spent three days in custody this week after posting a prank message on Facebook saying the president had tested positive for Covid-19, police said. In Cambodia, a Facebook pundit who posted a quote from Prime Minister Hun Sen was charged with incitement to commit felony and is facing up to two years in jail, according to a court warrant seen by AFP. Officials say Hun Sen was joking when he told motorbike taxi drivers to sell their vehicles if they cannot make money in the pandemic. 'Rumour mongering' Cambodian authorities have also detained four opposition politicians, according to HRW, while a local rights group and police sources said a 14-year-old girl was among more than a dozen people arrested. She was released soon after questioning with no charges. The surge in arrests in Asia focused on coronoavirus misinformation has come after various countries toughened laws or introduced new ones on so-called fake news. \"Regulating misinformation by either introducing new legislation or by expanding the scope of existing laws has been the trend in Asia for the last few years,\" said Masato Kajimoto, a journalism researcher at the University of Hong Kong. The pandemic has accelerated this because a crackdown can be perceived as protecting public health, rather than infringing on freedom of speech, he said. In Thailand, a state-of-emergency decree passed in late March criminalised sharing misinformation online about Covid-19 that could \"instigate fear.\" This is on top of the Computer Crimes Act, which has a five-year maximum jail penalty and is often used to stifle dissent online. The Philippines also recently adopted an emergency law giving it more powers to combat the pandemic, including arresting people who share false information about the disease. Nearly 100 people in India have been arrested for spreading virus misinformation under existing penal laws and the disaster management act - with punishments including up to one year in prison. \"While India lacks any specific fake news law, there do exist provisions of laws that can be used for 'rumour mongering,'\" said Apar Gupta, director of the Delhi-based Internet Freedom Foundation. \"It is fair to state that these laws are broadly phrased and can result in arbitrary action, given India's slow judicial system that also generally displays a prosecutorial bias,\" he said. Karuna Nandy, an Indian Supreme Court lawyer, told AFP that such arrests were particularly alarming in a lockdown, when courts are mostly shut."

      "authors": "Reuters",
      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-11 00:00:00      \nIn Ankara, talks between Turkey and Russian ended without agreement on stopping clashes in which 13 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Syria in one week Government forces seized control of a highway in northwest Syria for the first time since 2012 on Tuesday as they pressed their campaign to eradicate the last rebel strongholds in Idlib province and the Aleppo countryside, a war monitor said. In Ankara, talks between Turkey and Russian ended without agreement on stopping clashes in which 13 Turkish soldiers have been killed in Syria in one week. Relief agencies meanwhile said an exodus of hundreds of thousands of civilians from the afflicted areas was the largest such movement in nine years of war and a new humanitarian crisis was unfolding. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government forces had seized the entire length of the M5 highway after driving rebels from their last foothold on the road. The M5 runs from Aleppo in the north to the capital Damascus then on to southern Deraa. They took control of the highway after capturing a western suburb of Aleppo from insurgents. The latest advances by President Bashar al-Assad's Russian and Iranian-backed troops came after 13 Turkish soldiers were killed in the Idlib region in the past week, prompting some of the most serious confrontations between Ankara and Damascus of the war. Ankara deployed thousands of soldiers to stem the Syrian offensive. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels downed a helicopter believed to belong to the Syrian government in the town of Nairab, Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber reported on Tuesday. Since the new push began, government forces have recaptured more than 600 square km of territory and in recent days have taken control of dozens of towns and villages. Last week they recaptured the crossroads town of Saraqeb, on the M5. Turkey has several military personnel stationed there to prevent further Syrian advances after eight of its soldiers were killed by Syrian shelling. A Russian delegation arrived in Ankara on Saturday days after the attack to hold talks aimed at stopping clashes. On their final day of talks, a second Syrian attack on Turkish troops in the Taftanaz area killed five more troops. Ankara has said that it retaliated to both attacks, destroying several Syrian targets. It said would drive back Assad's forces unless they withdraw by the end of the month. It also told the Russian team that attacks against Turkish posts must stop immediately. The Russians left Turkey after talks ended on Monday, a Turkish diplomatic source said, with no apparent agreement. The Kremlin said on Tuesday all attacks on Russian and Syrian forces in Idlib had to stop.  Air raids Rescue teams in the region said Russian and Syrian war planes bombed several towns in Idlib, with most air raids on towns in western Aleppo, including a residential area in the city of Daraat Izza. At least 13 civilians were killed overnight in the air strikes, they said. The rapid advances by Assad's forces in Idlib have driven nearly 700,000 people from their homes towards the closed-off Turkish border in the past 10 weeks. Most of those displaced are women and children. \"This is, from our initial analysis, the largest number of people in a single period since the Syrian crisis began almost nine years ago,\" Jens Laerke, spokesman for the United Nations' OCHA humanitarian agency, told reporters in Geneva. \"So it's the fastest growing displacement we have ever seen in the country. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Andrej Mahecic said the harsh winter weather was making their suffering worse and shelter was hard to find. \"Even finding a place in an unfinished building is becoming nearly impossible,\" he said, adding that mosques were full. Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot absorb any more. It said it will halt new migrant waves from Idlib and its military will remain there. One Turkish politician urged President Tayyip Erdogan to go further. \"There will be no peace in Turkey until Assad is brought down from his throne. Turkey must start plans to enter Damascus now, and annihilate the cruel ones,\" said Devlet Bahceli, chairman of Erdogan's nationalist partner party. Witnesses and rebels said on Tuesday a new column of Turkish reinforcements, including tanks, rocket launchers and armoured vehicles, crossed the border into Idlib overnight. Turkish-backed Syrian rebels have also begun an new offensive against the government forces near army-controlled Saraqeb and Nairab to push troops away from Idlib city, where more than one million people live. The battle for Idlib is a crucial stage of a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of combatants and civilians, made millions refugees in their own country or overseas, and fractured the wider Middle East since it broke out amid the Arab Spring in 2011. Forces arrayed against Assad, Syria's ruler for nearly 20 years, have failed to dislodge him but he now presides over a devastated country. Moscow's military intervention in 2015 helped swing the war decisively in Assad's favour. Despite being on opposing sides, Turkey and Russia collaborate for a political solution to the conflict."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-22 00:00:00      \nWe must remain united in tackling the coronavirus The Covid-19 is wreaking havoc on the world. Bangladesh is yet to be hit hard, but if the rest of the world provides any indication, the threat of the coronavirus is serious, real, and exponential.  And an exponential crisis deserves an exponential response. The number of calls coming into the national information hotline 333 and Shastho Batayon 16263 has gone up tenfold in the last few days, crossing 100,00 per day. How do we handle such volume with a few call centre agents and a few doctors who used to handle these calls? Enter an uber-doctor model where the calls will be routed to hundreds of doctors who have registered their availability to take calls. This will not only calm a lot of panicked callers but also will reduce pressure on our healthcare system. This is the beginning of Bangladesh's exponential response to dealing with the coronavirus challenge. As calamitous as coronavirus is, it is forcing us to rethink how we live, work, and learn. Beyond the imminent healthcare challenge, as we face the possibility of small and large lockdowns -- both self-imposed and state-imposed -- for indefinite periods of time, like many megacities and advanced countries are going through now, citizens are asking important questions. How do my children continue their education during the outbreak? How does food get transported to cities? How do medicines get delivered across the country? How do we make payments for goods and services? How do we make goods? Bangladesh's quest for digitization is well-documented. It has been a cornerstone of the government's transformation drive since 2009, and remarkable achievements have been made. Sometimes, breaking the status quo, and bringing true change, requires a crisis. While this crisis may not be in any way welcome, it forces us to adopt an alternative, often at breakneck efficiency. Innovations during World War II occurred at an astonishing pace for the two opposing sides. With the added competition, the need to rebuild and retaliate brought out incredible innovations such as nuclear power, penicillin, jet engines, radar, and the first computer. All these have changed our lives for the better. The coronavirus threat is accelerating our adoption of a digital lifestyle. It is also greatly increasing the speed with which certain initiatives are getting done. The coronavirus has naturally increased the necessity to have trained medical professionals to test and combat it. As I write this, there are 2,000 doctors who are being certified to fight the coronavirus using the government's e-learning platform MuktoPaath. Under normal circumstances, this would have taken weeks of correspondence, the formation of committees to approve content, delivery of most of the content through old-style physical classrooms, and procurement of a fraction of the content in audiovisual format for e-learning. A process spanning 9-12 months. Optimistically! Compare that with the two days that it took in the time of coronavirus. All digital with no cost to the exchequer. Simultaneously, the government's information 333 hotline was made \"corona-ready\" in one day and is now being used as a mass initial triage tool for high-risk cases. Call the number, and you immediately get asked a series of questions about whether you are high risk or not. This has been possible for two reasons. One, we are using tools and technologies that already exist by just integrating and repurposing them. Two, all types of public agencies, private companies, civil society organizations, academia, startups, student groups have come together to fight together.  Bangladesh is probably unique in the way a crisis unites the entire society. It happened in 1971 and it happens during every flood and every Rana Plaza-like incident. Over 30 healthcare organizations have immediately responded to the government's call to action to find healthcare response. Tens of education companies are working with the government to scale up e-learning. Over 50 innovative logistics and e-commerce companies are coming up with how food, medicines, and other necessities will move across the country.  The telecom industry is doing its part by working very closely with the government to identify high-risk cases. Suddenly, Bangladesh, a country notorious for its lack of speed and initiative, is being forced to be effective and efficient, and each sector is working parallelly to fight the coronavirus. On March 20, the country saw its first digital press conference. In an unprecedented event, 100 participants including tens of journalists came together, not physically, but over video conference, with the session conducted by the ICT Minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak. Certainly a model in the time of social distancing. All of these initiatives are being made possible because of the great leaps Bangladesh has made in digitization, where the technological and human building blocks -- much like those of a child's lego set -- are coming together to create an avalanche effect.  I am confident that this avalanche effect will continue to grow, and Bangladesh will successfully navigate the threat of the coronavirus and come away as a better, more impactful nation.

      "authors": "Julian Francis",
      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-14 00:00:00      \nMany hospitals have been turning away patients for fear of Covid-19, with tragic consequences It was shocking to read, a few days ago, that a doctor was not able to manage to get her father, a senior government official with kidney complications, admitted in hospital unless he had been tested for Covid-19 and had a certificate.  According to the reports which I read, she tried to get him admitted to as many as a dozen hospitals, government and private. Without the appropriate ICU treatment, he died. It would appear that these hospitals, collectively, caused the patient's death.  If the country was not in the middle of a pandemic, I would have suggested that this sort of case -- many others similar to this have been reported in the media -- should be investigated by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council as it is empowered by a 1980 act of parliament to \"look after public interest by maintaining proper medical and dental standards.\"  In any case, some way should be found to reprimand the various hospital authorities concerned and the individual doctors who were responsible for hastening the unfortunate death of this man. In addition, it has been reported that dialysis patients who go to hospitals once or twice a week for dialysis are being turned away if they do not have a certificate to say that they are not infected by coronavirus.  Doctors in Bangladesh, on qualification, sign up to a Bangladesh version of the 1948 World Medical Association's \"Declaration of Geneva.\" This is a modern version of what is known as the Hippocratic Oath, which is the promise that doctors make to keep to the principles of the medical profession.  This appalling attitude of doctors reminds me of the many government doctors who refuse to be posted in rural areas at the beginning of their careers. They fail to see that rural experience could broaden their education, including widening their knowledge of medicinal herbs and plants. On another medically related matter, it is good to learn that finally the low cost rapid test kits for coronavirus, developed by Gonoshasthaya Kendra (GK), have been handed over to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) for performance trial. It is understood that progress has only been possible by intervention at the highest level.   There are many in the medical and pharmaceutical fields who have not forgiven Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury, the founder of GK, for his role in the formulation of the National Drug Policy in 1982 which then banned the importation of over 1,700 locally and internationally produced drugs which were either dangerous, or combinations of similar or incompatible ingredients, or because they could be produced by local companies instead of being imported.  A list of essential drugs, in their generic forms, was drawn up for use in all systems of the health care system. This action was met with howls of protest from the transnational drug companies, who feared a serious loss of profits if more countries followed Bangladesh's example. Later on in 1994, the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade liberalized international trade and therefore made such \"restraints on trade\" illegal, thus favouring the interests of large transnational companies. They then became free to flood the Bangladesh market with non-essential pharmaceutical products. A contributory factor to the demise of the drugs policy in Bangladesh was the failure of the Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA) to support it. Many doctors opposed the legislation from the outset, seeing it as a threat to their professional freedom; those who owned a pharmacy had a financial interest in prescribing lavishly. Fast forward to 2020, Covid-19 and the promotion of Remdesivir for treatment of coronavirus. Not yet approved, as far as I am aware, anywhere in the world, clinical trials are reported to have shown that on acutely ill patients, recovery time of 15 days has come down to 11 days. Many companies, including in Bangladesh, are surging ahead to produce the drug, but at what cost?  Figures per treatment have been reported to vary between $390 and $4,500. This is both confusing and mind-boggling, to say the least. I am lost for more words!  Julian Francis has been associated with relief and development activities of Bangladesh since the War of Liberation. In 2012, the government of Bangladesh awarded him the 'Friends of Liberation War Honour' in recognition of his work among the refugees in India in 1971, and in 2018 honoured him with full Bangladesh citizenship."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-02 00:00:00      \nTeesta deal remains uncertain; Indian foreign secretary says NRC, CAA will have no impact on Bangladesh; Modi's Dhaka visit would fully exemplify India's strong sentiment of goodwill  Visiting Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla has said within 2020, New Delhi expects to finalize deals with Bangladesh regarding water sharing of seven common rivers, except the Teesta River. He said both the countries need to expedite harmonization the data of water flow of the rivers so that water sharing can be finalized as early as possible. Shringla made the statement while addressing a seminar on Bangladesh-India relations as the keynote speaker at a Dhaka hotel on Monday, reports BSS. Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS) and Indian High Commission in Dhaka jointly organized the seminar titled \"Bangladesh and India: A Promising Future.\" The Indian foreign secretary, however, appeared to be uncertain about the deal on Teesta River saying an agreement on water sharing of this particular stream could only be finalized on the basis of consensus of all the stakeholders, an apparent reference to India's West Bengal state. Prime Minister's International Affairs Adviser Dr Gowher Rizvi attended the program as the chief guest. Shringla, who previously served as Indian High Commissioner in Dhaka, however, said the Indian side was working on concluding the process of the agreement as early as possible. \"We know this is an emotive issue on both side of the border but there is no diminution of the commitment of our government,\" he told the seminar. In August last, Bangladesh and Indian agreed on preparing a framework on interim water-sharing agreements on seven rivers -- Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla, Feni and Dudhkumar. Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Riva Ganguly Das and BIISS Chairman Fazlul Karim also spoke at the program, among others. The Indian foreign secretary said India and Bangladesh recognize there is ample room for progress on each of the rivers that both the neighbours share while serious dialogue has resumed between the officials responsible for water sharing matter since August 2019. \"Let me assure our friends here that we remain committed to finding the best possible solutions to sharing scarcities and hardships fairly during the dry season,\" he said. He said good arrangements to share waters of the 54 transboundary rivers in fair and environmentally sustainable manner lies in broader national interests of the two nations. India sees no NRC, CAA impact The visiting Indian secretary said the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will have no impact on Bangladesh, reports UNB. \"These are purely internal to India,\" Shringla said. \"Let me clearly state here what our leadership has repeatedly confirmed at the highest level to the government of Bangladesh: this is a process that is entirely internal to India. Therefore, there'll be no implications for the government and the people of Bangladesh. You've our assurance on that count,\" he explained. Modi's visit India's top foreign ministry bureaucrat said Narendra Modi's Dhaka visit later this month would fully exemplify \"India's strong sentiment of goodwill, trust and respect for Bangladesh\". Indian Prime Minister Modi has been specially invited to participate in the inaugural ceremony of Mujib Year later this month. \"We are looking forward to this visit ... because Bangabandhu is just so iconic - as a globally-recognized statesman and iconic symbol of liberation for Bangladesh and for our subcontinent,\" he said. In India, he said: \"There is a special resonance to his name. He is as revered and as remembered in India, as he is here in Bangladesh.\" Rohingya issue The Indian foreign secretary said there is also often interest and sometimes \"uninformed speculation\" about their position on the humanitarian crisis in Rakhine State of Myanmar, and its impact upon Bangladesh. \"Let me clearly say that India is deeply appreciative of the spirit of humanism that motivated Bangladesh to offer shelter to nearly one million displaced people. And we fully recognize and sympathize with the enormous burden that you're facing. \"As the only country that's an actual neighbour of both Bangladesh and Myanmar, we're committed to offering the fullest support for any mutually-acceptable solution that'll enable the earliest possible return of displaced persons to their homes in Rakhine State and to a life of dignity,\" he said adding that this should be done in a manner that is \"safe, secure and sustainable\". Border killing Responding a question why border killings still took place after both border guards agreed to use non-lethal weapons the Indian foreign secretary attributed the incidents to cross-border criminal activities.  He claimed that the casualty figures of Indians was equal to that of Bangladeshis but acknowledged that the border killing issue was consistently coming up in Bangladesh-India relationship. \"It is the responsibility of border forces on both sides to ensure that the border is respected and the place is kept safe stopping criminal activities,\" Shringla said adding that \"every death on the border was something that was a problematic issue. Shringla suggested improving security, creating zero criminal activities, more cooperation, more joint patrolling and common border management plan, and bringing deaths zero level along the frontier. Trade issues Shringla said they are also working more closely to simplify and expand trade as easier and simpler trading systems offer them scope to generate wealth and create jobs on both sides. He said there is enormous untapped potential for businesses to establish footholds in each other's market. \"And we, as governments, must make extra efforts facilitate our businesspersons and entrepreneurs doing business in each other's country.\" Shringla arrived in Dhaka on a two-day visit on Monday morning and upon arrival at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, he was received by his Bangladesh counterpart Masud Bin Momen."

Momen was talking to reporters at International Mother Language Institute after a meeting of sub-committee of celebration of the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Tuesday, reports UNB. Chief coordinator of the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Birth Centenary Celebration National Implementation Committee Dr Kamal Abdul Naser Chowdhury and former foreign minister AH Mahmood Ali were present at the meeting, among others. The minister said Bangladesh has adopted a \"balanced policy\" without any deviation from the path shown by father of the Nation - \"friendship to all and malice towards none\". \"We have good relations with everybody,\" he told reporters mentioning countries like India, China and the USA.   When asked about escalating tensions between Iran and the USA and any possibility of third world war, the foreign minister said: \"Hope not, I do not think there will be a third world war.\"  Momen hoped that Bangladesh nationals in Iraq will remain safe since there are some targeted attacks. In this globalized world, he said peace and stability are must and there will be negative impacts if the peace and stability are hampered in any part of the world. He said they are in touch with Bangladesh Mission in Iraq and Bangladeshis so far remain safe. Earlier, Bangladesh Ambassador in Baghdad Abu Maksud M Forhad assured Bangladesh nationals living in Iraq of providing all sorts of support and urged them not to get worried and lose their mental strength. In a video message, he said Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is in touch and enquiring about their condition round the clock. He said they will remain available round the clock for any support that may be required. The video message was issued for Bangladesh nationals amid escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran following the killing of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani near Baghdad airport on January 3. Over 200,000 Bangladesh nationals are believed to be living in Iraq. On Friday, the Bangladesh Embassy in Baghdad requested Bangladeshi expatriates in Iraq to stay alert and maintain caution considering the current security situation in the Middle-Eastern country. The embassy will remain open 24/7 to extend consular services to the expatriates. Everyone has been requested to extend cooperation. Between 2009 and November last year, 75,748 Bangladeshis went to Iraq for work, according to the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training."

European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic has said the Rohingya crisis is in its third year and it is more important than ever to maintain their support and not forget those that remain dependent on humanitarian aid to survive, reports UNB. The European commissioner said: \"We are committed to supporting both refugees and host communities in Cox's Bazar, as well as to the vulnerable Rohingya in Myanmar.\" \"It will ensure that those most in need continue to receive life-saving assistance, while being protected from the effects of flood and other hazards.\" Out of the funding announced on Wednesday, EUR18.5 million will help the most vulnerable groups among refugees and host communities in Bangladesh, according to the European Commission. This will be done by providing critical health care, food assistance and education in emergencies. Another EUR3.5 million will go towards building the local communities' capacities to prepare for and manage natural disasters.

Protection is also at the core of this support, with a specific focus on registration and documentation. Another EUR2.5 million will boost the local preparedness system in case of conflict or natural disasters. Humanitarian aid  In 2019 alone, the European Union provided close to EUR27 million in humanitarian aid for vulnerable Rohingya refugees and Bangladeshis in Cox's Bazar and other parts of the country, as well as EUR9 million to address the immediate needs of displaced and conflict-affected communities in Myanmar. September 2019 marked two years since the massive influx of over 700,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar to Bangladesh, following violence in Northern Rakhine. In total, almost one million refugees are living in camps in the Cox's Bazar district and are fully reliant on humanitarian assistance. Since 2017, the European Union has provided over EUR150 million in humanitarian aid to respond to the Rohingya crisis both in Myanmar and in Bangladesh. File photo: Rohingya refugees stretch their hands to receive aid distributed by local organisations at Balukhali makeshift refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, September 14, 2017 | Reuters This includes basic humanitarian assistance for Rohingya populations, both for those who have been living in displacement in Bangladesh for many years and for the newly arrived, and host communities living close to the refugee settlements. The EU provides shelters, health care, water and sanitation support, nutrition assistance, education, and protection services. Approximately 600,000 remaining Rohingya people in Myanmar's Rakhine continue to suffer from a protracted human right crisis, with very limited access to basic services and viable livelihood opportunities due to strict movement restrictions and denied citizenship and rights. In 2019, a new conflict between the Burmese army and the Arakan Army, an ethnic Rakhine armed group, has caused new displacement of ethnic Rakhine population. The total number of new internally displaced persons in Rakhine State has risen to 70,000 spread over 106 sites."

The holy fasting month of Ramadan begins next week. Saudi Arabia in mid-March stopped people performing their five daily prayers and the weekly Friday prayer inside mosques as part of efforts to limit the spread of the coronavirus. On Thursday, the Prophet's Mosque in the holy city of Medina said it was banning events which dispense evening meals in the mosque to those in need during Ramadan to break their daily fast. The kingdom has reported 6,380 cases of Covid-19, the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, and 83 deaths so far."

The daily tally of new cases stood at 3,493, down from a previous 3,786, with both deaths and infections extending the broadly stable situation in place over the last 12 days. This plateau is considerably lower than the peaks reached around the end of March, but the downtrend has not proceeded as was widely hoped in a country that has been in lockdown for almost six weeks. \"Probably most of the infections that have occurred since the lockdown have occurred within families,\" Giovanni Rezza, a director of Italy's top health body, the Superior Health Institute (ISS), told a news conference. Nuclear physicist Paolo Branchini, who has been focusing on the trend of cases and deaths in Italy, told daily Corriere della Sera on Friday that the lockdown initially put a lid on infections but had now \"exhausted its beneficial effect\". Branchini said that because the main source of infections was now within families, the only way to reduce deaths and cases further was to put all people who tested positive in dedicated centres away from their relatives. The official death toll since the outbreak came to light on February 21, has risen to 22,745, the Civil Protection Agency said, the second highest in the world after that of the United States. However, the Italian authorities acknowledge that the true number of fatalities is much higher. The Superior Health Institute said a survey on a sample of nursing homes suggested more than 40% of residents who died from February 1 to April 15 had either tested positive for the new coronavirus or had symptoms consistent with the disease. Restive regions The government has said its tough restrictions on movement and the closure of most businesses will continue at least until May 3, but there is not yet any clear plan over to what extent, or how gradually, it will then be lifted. In the meantime, some of Italy's 20 regions are threatening to take autonomous action. Luca Zaia, the head of the northern Veneto region which has made particular progress in bringing the outbreak under control, said on Friday he wanted to relax restrictions before May 3. \"The lockdown doesn't exist anymore,\" Zaia told reporters, in reference to the government having allowed a few types of business to reopen over the last week. In response, the chief of the southern Campania region around Naples, Vincenzo De Luca, said if northern regions did not respect all the curbs in place, Campania would \"close its borders\" and refuse entry to non-residents for any reason. The outbreak remains heavily concentrated in the northern regions of Lombardy, around the financial capital Milan, and neighbouring Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna. The number of officially confirmed cases in Italy on Friday totalled 172,434, the third highest global tally behind those of the United States and Spain."

Last month, 13 people were killed in Quetta when blast ripped through a mosque during evening prayers. Mineral-rich Balochistan province is at the centre of the $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is part of Beijing's massive Belt and Road infrastructure project.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-10 00:00:00      \nThe patient, who revealed his identity this week as Adam Castillejo, 40, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003  A second patient has been cured of HIV after undergoing stem cell transplant treatment, doctors said Tuesday, after finding no trace of infection 30 months after he stopped traditional treatment. The so-called \"London Patient\", a cancer sufferer originally from Venezuela, made headlines last year when researchers at the University of Cambridge reported they had found no trace of the AIDS-causing virus in his blood for 18 months. Ravindra Gupta, lead author of the study published in The Lancet HIV, said the new test results were \"even more remarkable\" and likely demonstrated the patient was cured. \"We've tested a sizeable set of sites that HIV likes to hide in and they are all pretty much negative for an active virus,\" Gupta told AFP. The patient, who revealed his identity this week as Adam Castillejo, 40, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and had been on medication to keep the disease in check since 2012. Later that year, he was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a deadly cancer. In 2016 he underwent a bone marrow transplant to treat blood cancer, receiving stem cells from donors with a genetic mutation present in less than one percent of Europeans that prevents HIV from taking hold. He becomes only the second person to be cured of HIV after American Timothy Brown, known as the \"Berlin Patient\", recovered from HIV in 2011 following similar treatment. Viral tests of Castillejo's cerebral fluid, intestinal tissue and lymphoid tissue more than two years after stopping antiretroviral treatment showed no active infection. Gupta said the tests uncovered HIV \"fossils\" -- fragments of the virus that were now incapable of reproducing, and were therefore safe. \"We'd expect that,\" he said. \"It's quite hard to imagine that all trace of a virus that infects billions of cells was eliminated from the body.\" Ethical dilemma  Researchers cautioned that the breakthrough did not constitute a generalised cure for HIV, which leads to nearly one million deaths every year. Castillejo's treatment was a \"last resort\" as his blood cancer would likely have killed him without intervention, according to Gupta. The Cambridge doctor said that there were \"several other\" patients who had undergone similar treatment but who were less far along in their remission. \"There will probably be more but they will take time,\" he said. Researchers are currently weighing up whether or not patients suffering from drug-resistant forms of HIV might be eligible for stem cell transplants in future, something Gupta said would require careful ethical consideration. \"You'd have to weigh up the fact that there's a 10-percent mortality rate from doing a stem-cell transplant against what the risk of death would be if we did nothing,\" he said. Commenting on The Lancet study, Sharon Lewin, an infectious disease expert at the University of Melbourne, said the findings could provide comfort to patients. But she advised caution. \"Given the large number of cells sampled here and the absence of any intact virus, is the London patient cured?\" she said. \"Unfortunately in the end, only time will tell.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-18 00:00:00      \nA spat between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic escalated when United States President Donald Trump angered China by referring to the pathogen as the 'Chinese Virus' Coronavirus disease or Covid-19 is an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus. It is now an officially declared global pandemic. The number of coronavirus cases globally stood at 202,270 with 8,212 deaths, across 167 countries and territories at 5pm Wednesday, according to a tally compiled by Dhaka Tribune from official sources. A lot of explanations have been advanced regarding the source of the coronavirus. Understandably, public-health officials want to pin down the virus's source so that they can prevent new outbreaks.  A lot of conspiracy theories are also making the rounds. The question essentially boils down to one point: was Covid-19 developed in a laboratory, and is it being used as a biological weapon? A related question is whether the virus was made in the laboratory purposefully, or did the virus made in the laboratory accidentally escape the laboratory.  The lab-escape theory is so far the more widely accepted conspiracy theory.  Chinese authorities maintain that Covid-19 likely originated at a market in Wuhan where people were selling wild animals. But Iranian, Russian, and some Chinese media outlets claim that the emerging public health crisis comes from US biological weapons.  A spat between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic escalated when United States President Donald Trump angered China by referring to the pathogen as the \"Chinese Virus.\" The two countries have sparred over the origin of the virus for days, with a Chinese official promoting theories claiming it was brought to China by the US army and Washington officials using terms seen as stigmatizing a nation.  \"The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus,\" Trump tweeted on Monday night. Some skepticals including politicians in the US and China have both suggested that the Covid-19 may actually be a bioweapon that was manufactured in a lab.  The only difference between their conspiracy theories is who's being accused of doing the manufacturing. On the one corner are some people in the US who are hinting or in some cases openly claiming that China put together this virus.  Steve Mosher, a social scientist, wrote on February 22 an opinion piece for the New York Post entitled, \"Don't buy China's story: The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab.\"  In the piece, Mosher summarises why he believes Covid-19 may have been accidentally spread by China's National Biosafety Laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where researchers have studied bat coronaviruses.  Mosher says that the lab is less than 10 miles away from the seafood market where a clustre of Covid-19 cases was first discovered. Mosher believes that the said lab is located in the Institute of Virology in Wuhan, where the dangerous pathogens were purportedly kept and looked at as potential bioweapons.  There were reports that in the 2003 SARS outbreak, the SARS-CoV virus escaped from virology labs in China. He says Chinese virologist and bioweapons expert Major General Chen Wei's visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology with military scientists in January was an exercise in damage control. But not only in China, there are at least six same kind of facilities in the US in Georgia, Maryland, Texas and Montana.  According to the Federation of American Scientists website, seven others may be planned, under construction, or possibly finished in various cities such as Massachusetts, and Virginia. These labs also study and house a range of dangerous pathogens.  Not to be outdone, some in China have made similar suggestions, except that it's the US that built the virus and released it in China.  One of the most popular topics on the Chinese microblog Weibo was a one-minute clip of a US congressional hearing this week on how the country was dealing with the coronavirus. In the video posted by the People's Daily, Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is asked whether there may have been deaths attributed to influenza that could actually have been the result of Covid-19.  Redfield responds in the affirmative: \"Some cases have been actually diagnosed that way in the United States today.\" Redfield's answer was enough to add fuel to a conspiracy theory that has been gaining traction over the past two weeks in China - that the coronavirus did not originate in China but may have come from the US instead. \"The US has finally acknowledged that among those who had died of the influenza previously were cases of the coronavirus. The true source of the virus was the US!\" one commentator said.  \"The US owes the world, especially China, an apology,\" another said. \"American coronavirus,\" one wrote. The theory has gained traction over the past few weeks, after a respected epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, said in a passing remark at a press conference on February 27 that although the virus first appeared in China \"it may not have originated in China.\" Zhong later clarified his statement, saying that the first place where a disease is discovered does not \"equate to it being the source.\"  China's ambassador to South Africa said last week on Twitter that the virus was not necessarily \"made in China.\" So till now it looks like conspiracy theorists on both sides haven't really provided any compelling evidence that SARS-CoV2 was produced in a lab, whether in the US, in China, in Iran or in the other world."

The students started their demonstration in front of the university's academic building A around 11am to press home their four-point demand. The demands are: resignation of the current student adviser Md Omar Faruk, appointment of the next student adviser from a list of names prepared by students, cease of involvement by the Physics department head Dr Shamsun Nahar and the student adviser Md Omar Faruk in any academic activities of the victim student's batch, and an appropriate explanation from the department head as to why she failed to take actions during the incident being present at the scene. Earlier on February 29, during the golden jubilee celebration at the university, a local college teacher threatened a physics department student. At the time both the department head and student adviser were present but failed take any action. Later on March 2, when the students of the department presented their four point demand before the department head, an altercation broke between the two party. As a result on March 4, the department head issued a notice suspending all exams sine die.  Regarding the matter, School of Physical Sciences Dean Dr Md Sajedul Karim said: \"I have had discussions with the students who are protesting. I have conveyed their demands to the teachers concerned. The situation may be resolved with everyone's cooperation.\" However, physics department head Prof Dr Shamsun Nanhar Begum could not be reached for a quote on this matter. "

With them were the remains of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of Iraq's powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary umbrella group, who was also killed in the US strike. Soleimani's remains arrived in Mashhad in the afternoon and are due to be flown to Tehran for more tributes on on Sunday evening. Today, Khamenei is expected to pray over Soleimani's remains at Tehran University before a procession to Azadi Square. His remains are then due to be taken to the holy city of Qom for a ceremony at Masumeh shrine, ahead of a funeral tomorrow in his hometown Kerman. 'Death to America' \"Death to America,\" mourners chanted as they packed Ahvaz's streets and a long bridge spanning a river in the southwestern city to receive the casket containing Soleimani's remains. As Shia chants resonated in the air, people held portraits of the man seen as a hero of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war and for spearheading Iran's Middle East operations as commander of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force. In the northeastern city of Mashhad, scores took to streets around the Imam Reza shrine and, addressing the US, chanted \"Be afraid of your own shadow.\" Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike on Friday near Baghdad airport, shocking the Islamic republic. He was 62. The attack was ordered by President Donald Trump, who said the Quds commander had been planning an \"imminent\" attack on US diplomats and forces in Iraq.  Soleimani's assassination ratcheted up tensions between arch-enemies Tehran and Washington and sparked fears of a new Middle East war. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed \"severe revenge\" and declared three days of mourning. 'Terrorist in a suit'  Iran's top diplomat Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted that \"targeting cultural sites is a WAR CRIME.\" For Iran's army chief, Trump's threat was an attempt to distract the world from Soleimani's \"unjustifiable\" assassination. \"I doubt they have the courage to initiate\" a conflict, said Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi. Iran's communications minister, Mohammad Javad Jahromi, branded Trump a \"terrorist in a suit\" and said in a tweet that he is \"like IS, like Hitler, like Genghis (Khan)! They all hate cultures.\" US-Iran tensions escalated in 2018 when Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark accord that gave Tehran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear program. A year on, Iran began hitting back by reducing its nuclear commitments with a series of steps every 60 days, the most recent deadline passing on Saturday. Cyber attack  In possible act of retaliation, hackers claiming to be from Iran breached the website of a little-known US government agency and threatened more cyber attacks. The website of the Federal Depository Library Program was replaced with a page titled \"Iranian Hackers!\" that displayed images of Khamenei and the Islamic republic's flag."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-22 00:00:00      \nChild protection professionals have real worries about the risks with families locked up 24/7 together for an indefinite period \"I've put the kids in the freezer, so everything's cool now.\" Parents may be joking on social media about their childcare hell as more and more countries go into lockdown with the coronavirus.  But child protection professionals are not laughing. They have real worries about the risks with families locked up 24/7 together for an indefinite period. \"You will no doubt want to throw your children out the window at some point. That's normal,\" psychologist Moira Mikolajczak told AFP. \"What isn't normal, is to do that,\" she warned, as she urged parents to give themselves a break and \"not try to be Superman or Superwoman\". While governments across Europe from Ireland to Greece have been having schools send lessons and activity ideas by email to occupy bored children, social media is full of testimony from parents frazzled at having to be both teacher and playmate to their kids. Grassroots groups, however, are trying to step into the gap with the French feminist collective #NousToutes (\"All of Us\"), which campaigns against domestic violence, mobilizing with WhatsApp support groups and practical tips on how \"not to blow your top.\"  \"Being locked down gives us the chance to spend lots and lots of time with our children,\" the group said, tongue ever so slightly in cheek. But when \"we have to work from home and we are all stuck together in a small space, tensions can escalate.\" 'Step away!' Its WhatsApp groups already have 4,000 members dispensing support and tips on how to stay zen. First among them is \"step away when you feel the tension mount (even if that means locking the toilet door).\" Parents should also watch funny videos with their children, \"and program in 'off' times when you can be on your own... while someone else looks after the children.\"  The main thing is to try to avoid \"words or gestures... that can hurt and wound... because we can behave in ways that we will regret immediately.\" Mother-of-three Sarah, whose kids range in age from seven to just two months, is \"staying relaxed\" so far. \"Yesterday I took an hour for myself in my room, without a child hanging from me, and I did a meditation session via Instagram,\" the Parisian told AFP.  \"It's going OK, but it's worrying for the long haul,\" she said as France neared the end of its first week in total lockdown. If it is tough for the parents, it's no walk in the park for the children either - they too have been ordered home across large swathes of Europe and now in parts of the US. \"When we got into the living room when Mummy is working, there can be arguments,\" said 10-year-old Estheban. \"I am having to be a mother, a teacher, a cook, a cleaner and do my job as an executive in a bank from home at the same time,\" said Virginie, who has two sons aged 11 and six. While most parents will cope, said Mikolajczak, Professor of Emotion and Health Psychology at the University of Louvain in Belgium, some will not. \"We can predict increases in parental burnout,\" she said, and sometimes there could even be \"neglect and violence.\" 'Relax the rules' Governments have the same worry, with the French children's ministry warning of a \"higher risk of mistreatment... and since it will be happening at home, it will be hard to spot.\" \"Stay at home parents are more vulnerable to burnout,\" Mikolajczak said, an effect likely to be exacerbated by the fact they are there against their will. \"Western families are also not used to living on top of each other,\" she added. Added to which families can no longer turn \"to grandparents for help nor go out\" somewhere to blow off steam. Mikolajczak said structuring the children's day can really help with moments when they will play or work on their own.  And she urged parents to \"be flexible and not afraid to relax some rules\". \"Let it go,\" said Etienne, the father of two girls aged 10 and six, who has adopted the refrain from Disney's film \"Frozen\" to get him through the crisis. In these exceptional times you cannot juggle everything, he said. \"At the beginning when the schools closed, I put myself under pressure. I didn't know what to do. I had no time for myself nor the kids. \"Then the penny dropped. I stopped working and since then it's going a lot better,\" he said."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-08 00:00:00      \n40% of expatriate employees stuck in China; Robots to be used in Padma bridge works  Chinese companies working in Bangladesh are worried about not being able to meet deadlines of the development projects, including several mega projects, that they are implementing in Bangladesh. Many of the projects are at risk of failing to maintain respective deadlines as around 40% of Chinese staff working in Bangladeshi projects have been stuck in China for more than a month. This includes staff who are currently at the coronavirus epidemic centre in China, none of whom are allowed to leave. According to the Chinese Enterprises Association in Bangladesh (CEAB), more than 15,000 Chinese staff members, under 400 companies, are involved in development programs in Bangladesh. CEAB Vice President Ke Changliang told the Dhaka Tribune that around 6000 Chinese staff could not return to Bangladesh because of the outbreak, resulting in slow progress in the development works. On February 2, Bangladesh suspended visa on arrival for Chinese citizens indefinitely amidst the coronavirus epidemic. The China government now wants the suspension to be withdrawn as the situation has almost been brought under control in China. Otherwise, meeting the deadlines for completion of development projects will be a challenge, suspects Chinese officials. Chinese Ambassador to Bangladesh Li Jiming on Wednesday urged Bangladesh to withdraw the suspension as soon as possible. During a press briefing held at Padma Bridge Rail Link Project office in Dhaka's Keraniganj, Li said around 95% of the spreading of the virus is now happening from other countries as China has almost controlled the outbreak of the disease. \"Up to now, no Chinese national here and no Bangladesh national here or in China have been infected by the coronavirus,\" he added. According to CEAB, the total amount of investment in Bangladesh contributed by China is nearly $10 billion which created job opportunities for more than 100,000 people in Bangladesh. But these efforts have been negatively impacted due to the COVID-19 epidemic, a global health emergency. Bangladesh government may soon adopt stricter health and quarantine measures on equipment and materials imported from China. Moreover, the application of more rigorous public health regulations on Chinese employees working in Bangladesh, such as medical examination, will make it harder for them to obtain work permits. Ke Changliang said: \"All of these issues have caused certain distress to normal production speed and operation of Chinese enterprises in Bangladesh.\" \"Despite the internal and external challenges, all Chinese companies, especially contractors like CREC, Power China, CCCC, and CCECC, are doing their best to maintain workflow to avoid the suspension of the projects,\" he said at the press briefing. Importing robots for Padma Bridge construction work Although 86% of the construction work is already done, completion of the Padma Bridge project by June 2021 has become a challenge as importing the materials from China remains almost closed since the coronavirus outbreak began. Despite the outbreak currently being under control,  business entities are not in full operation in China yet, creating a shortage of material. China Major Bridge Engineering Company (CMBE) executing Padma Bridge project and China Railway Group Limited (CREC) implementing Padma Bridge Rail Link Project are looking for alternative ways to tackle this situation. These include importing four robots from China and training the local people for specialized tasks. Liu Jianhua, director of Padma Bridge project said: \"We are trying to import four robots for strengthening the execution and to deal with the shortage of manpower.\" Wang Kun, director of Padma Bridge Rail Link Project said: \"To ensure continuity of work, we are trying our best to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-04 00:00:00      \nFive, including a BGB official, died in the confrontation Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has filed cases against 19 individuals, including four deceased and 70 unidentified persons, in connection with Tuesday's clash over the transporting of timber in Khagrachhari's Matiranga upazila. 40 BGB East Khedachhara Checkpost Havildar Ishak Ali filed the case with Matiranga police station as the plaintiff under charges of obstruction of public service and murder. Matiranga police OC Shamsuddin Bhuiyan confirmed the matter after accepting the case. Legal action will be taken after police investigation, he said. Locals are worried about the case filed against 70 unnamed individualsye Mostafa Kamal of Ichachhara village in Matiranga, said locals are tense about the matter. \"We have no idea how and when we face harassment.\" Another local, Hanif Miah, said the BGB dispute was between deceased Shahab Miah and Mofiz Miah's relatives. \"There was no involvement of the villagers. BGB is doing this [filing case] to harass locals.\" Meanwhile, Bangladesh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Md Javed Patwari visiting Khagrachhari on Thursday, asked the public to trust the police. \"Cases have been filed and an investigation will be launched,\" he said. \"The perpetrators will be brought to justice through proper investigation no matter which party filed the case,\" the IGP said, afte ran inauguration program of the Police Officers' Mess. On Tuesday, five people, including a BGB member, were killed in Gazinagar of Matiranga, when a clash erupted between the BGB men and some villagers over transporting timber. The deceased are BGB Palashpur zone soldier Md Shaon, villagers Shahab Miah and his sons Ahmed Ali and Ali Akbar, and Mofiz Miah. According to witnesses, Ahmed Ali was carrying timber cut down for power lines in a trolley around 11.30 am on Thursday, when a BGB patrol team stopped and questioned him. This led to an altercation between the villagers and BGB. At one point, the BGB started firing their guns, killing Shaon, Shahab, Ahmed, and Akbar on the spot, while bullet-stricken Mofiz died on his way to the hospital. The BGB, in a press statement issued the same day, claimed that the villagers had surrounded a BGB patrol team when they tried to stop timber trafficking, prompting the border troops to fire a blank round. They also claimed that the villagers snatched weapons from the BGB men and started firing indiscriminately, killing five. However, locals who witnessed the incident rejected all such claims. BGB said Mofiz Miah killed Shaon while locals claim that he was killed by another BGB personnel for protesting the incident. Meanwhile, a three member committee has been formed by the Deputy Commissioner's Office to investigate the incident. The committee is scheduled to file a report by Sunday."

To transform these plans into reality Green Delta Insurance Company Limited and its distribution channel partner OXFAM Bangladesh and local associate Sancred Welfare Foundation (SWF) have insured 316 Farmers of Tahirpur, Sunamganj area under Index-Based Crop Insurance recently as a pilot basis, says a press release. Several integrated plans and activities have been going on for a while now, at the direction of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina under the supervision of the Financial Institutions Department of the Ministry of Finance to stand by the farmers who are at risk of financial loss in flood-prone Haor areas. To mitigate the risks of the farmers of the Haor area arising from excessive rainfall and river flood Green Delta will provide this insurance service to the farmers from April 28 to May 28 while converting the crop losses into fatal financial risks for them. In case of crop damage under this insurance, the insured farmers can get the insurance claim depending on the extent of excess rainfall and the height and stability of the floodwater causing by river flood. In the case of river flood, if the water level if above 6.8 meters and in case of excess rainfall if it rains 125 millimeters in 3 consecutive days the insured farmers will receive maximum Tk12,000 depending on total loss and duration of the flood. In August last year, Green Delta Insurance Company, with the support of Oxfam and SKS Foundation, provided index-based crop insurance to 650 farmers in Fulchhari and Saghata areas of Gaibandha."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-21 00:00:00      \nIt expects correction on his narrative, understanding about Bangladesh The Embassy of Bangladesh in Washington, DC has categorically rejected the remarks on Bangladesh made by US Senator Chuck Grassley, saying what the senator said was farthest from the truth. \"The Embassy clearly states that the remarks made by Senator Grassley are not only biased and motivated but also absolutely contradictory to the 2019 Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF),\" the Bangladesh embassy said in a statement, strongly protesting his remarks. It said the embassy is surprised to see that Senator Grassley had stated in his op-ed that citizens of Bangladesh live under an authoritarian regime and face persecution for faith and religious beliefs, reports UNB. Bangladesh is a secular democracy, where people from all faiths live in peace and harmony, the embassy said. The statement further said the embassy is extremely disappointed to see that instead of appreciating the democratic government of Bangladesh for sheltering more than 1.1 million Rohingyas from Myanmar, who were persecuted in their own country for their religion and ethnicity, Senator Grassley has opted for complete subjectivity to criticize the government [of Bangladesh] that actually saved their lives. An op-ed, titled \"Religious freedom under attack - US can promote and protect liberty globally,\" by Chuck Grassley, senator for Iowa, appeared on his official website (https://www.grassley.senate.gov/) on Tuesday. The embassy said it expects that Senator Grassley would correct his narrative and his understanding about Bangladesh based on facts and realities on the ground. A few examples of religious freedom and harmony in Bangladesh were also shared. These are as follows: Bangladesh is a country where festivals of major religious communities (Muslims, Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists) are public holidays, the president of Bangladesh hosts reception for members of each religious community on the day of these festivals and prime minister of Bangladesh promotes a national slogan \"Religion unto individual, festivals unto all.\" People from all faiths celebrate the festivals together, which is truly reflective of the spirit of secularism and non-communalism, added the embassy. Verses from the holy books of all major faiths are recited at the beginning of all important official programs, it said. The embassy said that Senator Grassley is welcome to visit Bangladesh and see for himself the values of democracy, freedom, openness, inclusiveness, and religious harmony that exists in Bangladesh."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-17 00:00:00      \nFurther east, Iran has the third highest case load after China and Italy, with nearly 13,000 confirmed cases, according to WHO data The World Health Organization will start testing for coronavirus in rebel-held northwest Syria later this week, the agency's regional head said on Monday, adding that he was \"very concerned\" about the spread of the pandemic to a region where the health system has been wrecked by a long civil war. Only about half of medical facilities in the wedge of rebel-held Syria are operational. Nearly a million people recently displaced by violence are living in make-shift housing or crowded camps. \"We are hoping ... to have the machinery and the tests sometime this week so we can start testing,\" said Dr Rick Brennan, emergency director for the region, told Reuters. \"And we are very concerned. All of the surrounding countries have documented cases.\" Syria's government has started testing in areas in the rest of the country, although has not yet reported a case to the WHO. Turkey to the north confirmed its first case last week and Iraq has at least 93 confirmed cases. Further east, Iran has the third highest case load after China and Italy, with nearly 13,000 confirmed cases, according to WHO data. However, Brennan, who just returned from a mission to Iran last week, said that the number of cases reported could represent only about a fifth of the real numbers. The reason was that testing, as is the case even in some wealthy European countries, was restricted to severe cases. \"We've said the weakest link in their chain is the data,\" he said. \"They are rapidly increasing their ability to test and so the numbers will go up,\" he said. Iran's response to the pandemic has drawn strong criticism, both from government critics, and a UN official last week. However, Brennan was generally upbeat about Tehran's response. \"There's a great commitment and they are taking it seriously from the highest level of government.\" Iranian authorities say they have been especially hard hit by global supply shortages for tests and protective equipment, blaming the impact of US sanctions. Brennan described visiting new centres with dozens of beds where everything from the bed sheets, to the oxygen masks had been made locally. However, he said that some of the locally-produced personal protective equipment was exposing medical workers to risks. He acknowledged that some health care workers had been infected, although the cause of infection was not clear. \"We are impressed that Iranians have acknowledged their weaknesses and are working on them,\" Brennan said.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-21 00:00:00      \nThe monsoon rains will be here soon and the possibility of an early flood is very likely, said the farmers The boro season has come to an end with acres of golden ripe crops in three districts of the country. Farmers in Sunamganj, Brahmanbaria, and Natore are happy with the high yield but the shortage of farm workers is making the final production uncertain. The monsoon rains will be here soon and the possibility of an early flood is very likely, said the farmers. But the deadly Covid-19 pandemic  is forcing the nation into a lock down and agriculture which needs combined effort with a number of inputs can be most affected, say farmers. Despite the Department of Agricultural Extension providing machines and assistance, the vastly agriculture dependent communities of the country are suffering the most. This can be disastrous for the economy if not handled properly.  Early flood predictions worry farmers in Sunamganj This year farmers were expecting a good yield from the 2,19,300 hectares of haor (Backswamp) lands in Sunamganj. The vast paddy fields took on a golden shade this month and are ready to be harvested and threshed. However, a certain turning point of the event jolted the whole scenario as the recent pandemic has almost brought the whole world to a standstill, including agriculture. The farmers of this district are in great peril as they need seasonal migrant farmworkers from other districts  to help them harvest their crops from other districts. This year, helping hands are scarce because they are not able to access the needed workers due to lockdowns across the country meant to curb the spread of the deadly virus. The Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) has predicted the district will experience heavy rains at the end of this month. This might cause  early flooding that can waterlog the entire crop, while farmers need three more weeks to reap their crops, said Judge Miah, a farmer in Sadar upazila's Lalpur village. Ajman Hossain, Jaban Ali, and Shamsur Rahman among other farmers of the area, said thousands of farmworkers used to come to this area in the harvest season but this year they are few and far between. \"It has started to rain already and acres of land are full of ripe paddy. We don't know how we are going to process this huge crop before the rain starts coming down full swing,\" said Shamshur Rahman. Deputy Director of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Md Safar Uddin, said they have provided 126 Combine Harvester Machines and 212 Reaper Machines to assist farmers and facilitate the whole operation with less manpower. Contacted, Md Abdul Ahad, Deputy Commissioner of the district, assured Dhaka Tribune they are strictly maintaining all possible precautions to prevent farmers from being affected by Covid-19, and said: \"We will provide more machines and farm workers if needed. There are 30,000 workers currently assisting the farmers in their fields, and paddy in 18,000 hectares of land is being handled successfully, to the best of my knowledge. Farmworkers scarce, Brahmanbaria farmers using other resources To cope with the scarcity of farmhands, farmers from Brahmanbaria are depending on the unemployed who returned to their village homes before the nationwide lockdown. On a field visit, hundreds of inexperienced hands like garment workers, hotel assistants, chefs, day labourers, fishermen, vendors, and even students, could be seen helping farmers with their harvest. They say this way they can help the farmers and provide for their families with the money they get in return for their work. Md Maharram Bhuiyan, a hawker from Chittagong, who was trying to harvest paddy with a farmer said: \"This field needs tremendous labour which I do not have. But in order to earn my daily meals I have to do it, no matter what.\" According to the DAE's office, around 17,000 farm workers from other districts join the farmers each year. However, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, only 1,500 workers could come this season. Asked about the situation, Brahmanbaria DAE's Deputy Director Md Rabiul Haque Majumdar, said: \"It is a positive endeavour that unemployed youths are joining in to assist the farmers. It serves them both. But if the farmers need more assistance we have to provide additional farm workers from other districts maintaining proper health protocols.\" Brahmanbaria DC, Hayat-Ud-Doula, said around 40 Combine Harvester Machines will be provided to the farmers and all possible steps will be taken to help the farmers.  Natore DAE expects high yield despite scarce manpower Officials from Natore DAE are expecting a good boro yield of around 4 lakh tons, said the district's DAE office. To facilitate the harvest they provided 17 Combine Harvesters and 2 Reaper Machines, confirmed Subrata Kumar, deputy director of the organisation. \"We have a high quality boro paddy yield on 58,000 hectares of land this season. Seasonal migrant farm workers are far less this year but if the farmers ask for it we will certainly arrange hired workers to reap the crops properly,\" he said. He said hundreds of workers are coming from various areas to assist the boro farmers who have asked for 30 more machines to ease the process. UP Chairman Asadujjaman and an Awami League leader of Naldanga upazila, said: \"We have prepared a list of AL activists in every district who will be assisting  farmers in the fields. With the machines and the provided help, we don't think we will face any problems with the crop this season."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-17 00:00:00      \nTo combat this pandemic, we need to work together Bangladesh has already been hit hard with the global pandemic and experts and analysts are saying that management and duration will determine the depth of this crisis. After reading many articles and publications and teaching international business at a private university, outlined are my modest understanding and beliefs. Sadly vagrant or homeless people are part of our society and economy. Daily wage earners account for the chunk of what our economy is all about. This is a densely populated country.  We struggle every day to commute from Dhanmondi to Gulshan and albeit we talk about being digital, the mere effort of conducting an online video chat with co-workers from every nook of the country takes a nerve-wracking toll on the very essence of our souls.  Needless to say, we have our own epidemic -- dengue -- that chases us every monsoon season, and even during other times of the year. Not to mention a couple of days of heavy rain threatens us with a predicted flood.  We have a healthcare facility that is prickly and very much centralized to Dhaka only. Now this pandemic which has no cure yet, couldn't make the matter any worse for us. The West or the \"more sanitized\" countries are already failing in protecting their civilians in spite of having a much better health care system than ours.   Thus what right do we have to overestimate our power in combating this in regard to the public health sector when we have an approximate total of 1200 ICU beds (private and public sectors) for 170 million people according to World Economic Forum and World Bank data.  Like any other system, our policy-makers with sheer optimism are optimizing whatever resources we have to stem out the root cause. But leaving everything up to the policy-makers will be like living in a fool's paradise. We as citizens have a very big role to play. If these crises go beyond our control, there may be emotional, social, and economic unrest that we cannot fathom. The dire economic condition has already been discussed in many forums.  However, the differences in the social class system will be conspicuous. There are people in society who are privileged enough to have the disposable income to showcase how they are passing their leisure time and then there are daily wage earners who look at their empty pockets and stare at those tall buildings and wonder about the indifference.  Such indifference may lead to depression, anger, and in extreme cases civil unrest. Hence the flow of communication should be a continuous process to all levels of society for assurance that all is still not lost.  The official authorities are already doing their part in communicating about Covid-19. However, we as communities have a significant role to play in mitigating the crisis. As a nation, I do not believe we still fully understand its authenticity and implication.  Going for mass gathering for religious or social purposes shows that the significance and consequences of the pandemic have not registered in the minds of the people.   If the literate society has trouble in wrestling the idea of the preventive measures that need to be taken for Covid-19, then booing the underprivileged and illiterate society, when all they are doing is going out to look for work, is nothing but living in a bubble mindset of utter cluelessness. The utmost challenge is to shorten the crisis. The longer the crisis, the more difficult it will be to recover from the damages and scars it will inevitably leave behind in the economy.  According to an article in WEF, 90% workers are working in the informal sector. Due to the pandemic, work has stopped and people are out of work and thus no income. Most importantly, in rural areas, most people live on daily wages, and \"being quarantined\" is an extravagance to them.  There are people who live on remittance too. The pandemic has made many workers go out of work in the domestic market as well as abroad. When their livelihood and survival is at risk, it will take sufficient motivating factors to convince them to stay at home to avoid being infected.  It is essentially required that people are given the food delivery support and cash incentives until the curve is flattened, and the government is taking proper measures to ensure that.  Meanwhile, if we the privileged ones look after our own people who have over the years given their laboured skills for our comfort, then much pressure will be minimized from the economy to bounce back.  We are a small country with a distinctly huge population and a fragile infrastructure, hence we cannot afford a misstep in our policy-making.  To combat this pandemic and manage the foreseeable economic crisis, not only the government but the NGOs, business sectors, and other relevant organizations should work together with cohesion and strong linkages.  Not to mention \"us\" as citizens also have a strong role to play. We can have the intermittent opening of some manufacturing sectors or services, if not all. We have seen how the developed countries are doing it and we can learn and customize according to our needs and resources.  We are a country known for its strongest survival instincts and resilience; there is no doubt in my mind that we can fight this one too. Mahzabeen Faruque is Lecturer at State University. "

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-11 00:00:00      \nThis translation marks the writer's second death anniversary on April 24.  (Translated by Khademul Islam)  Ah, those days, it made no difference to us whether it was night or day--we didn't know, and didn't care to know! The only thing that mattered was spending twenty-four hours of the day at the Coffee House on College Street (in the then Calcutta). Though formally it was supposed to open at 9:00 in the morning, an insistent clamor to open the main gate would commence from 8:30 onward, and by 9:15 it would inevitably begin to loosen and then open. Some of us insiders who knew what to do would then slip in early and grab the seats at our favorite tables. At the entrance, by the foot of the stairs leading up to the cafe, would be Ismail, the man from my own side of Bengal, from whom we would buy ten-plus-ten totaling twenty sticks meaning two packs of Charminar cigarettes, which were our invaluable props as we sought the precious philosopher's stone inside the cafe. As the day wore on, all sorts of people would drop by. Some were stooped from the weight of their learning, while others were wracked by drugs. Everybody from the hangman to the racetrack addict - who would not drop by there? At that time, we were the most senior of the Coffee-House-ians. Until the gates closed at 10:30 at night, who had time for anything else? No sooner would one group depart than the next one would breeze in; all were our devotees and hangers-on. Ah, life then was so light and sublime and so full of promise! The days blew by in a swirl of good times and laughter. If Baruna left our table, the slot would be filled by Namita. Almost five feet tall and shapely and chocolate-colored, Namita had us all buzzing around her like a swarm of bees. We would table-hop incessantly; now this table, then that table, and time would fly by with nobody knowing how or where.  Especially if it was a winter day. When on one such day came our very own Babu Shri Chandan Majumdar, who was good-looking, well-spoken, and a Coffee House regular, because, really, what was one to do with one's life except write poetry? With a broad, beguiling smile he informed us that his kaka (paternal uncle) S... and his mother had been repeatedly pressing him to bring the gang one day over to the family home, and that today was that very day! That both his Mama and mother kept hearing so many tales from him about us, the Coffee House crowd, that everybody in his household, from old to young, felt as if they had come to know us intimately. His mother, listening to these tales, in fact, was quite taken with a certain wretch named Belal Chowdhury, and now harbored a store of affection for this fellow far in excess of what she displayed for her own sons and daughters. And also, he said, it would be quite special if Namita and the Mitras could also come along, though of course he knew that those two had families and duties, people to take care of. Whereas among the rest of us there was one truly free male named Belal--if he could be made to tag along then we were assured of not only a chicken-and-rice dinner being laid out but also the prospect of some extra cash, say, a little twenty-rupee handout.  No way! I took a firm stand against such an idea. That would not be allowed to happen. I would announce to his folks from the very first that I had no need of anything. And even if there was, I would ask for it myself.  The afternoons then were honeyed. And now that there was no way to back out of this outing, it made sense to waste as little time as possible in hitting the road given that it would afford us more time for play and fun. Led by Chandan, by the time we descended from the Bangaon train line at some cow-shit, fly-blown station, the winter afternoon shadows were beginning to darken and deepen. Dense banks of trees lined the path to Chandan's village, as an equally dense, deep blue dusk began to fall. The moment we entered the neighborhood his house was in, however, a deep voice suddenly brought us to an abrupt halt.  Aha, the voice intoned: from which direction has the Sun God risen today? Otherwise how can it be that at this time of the day do we get to see our Chandan Babu in our lowly little village, and that too with his friends and boon companions. Are you fellows feeling all right, your bodies fit to do battle, is that the... It was Chandan himself who stepped forward and introduced the voice to us as his Mama (maternal uncle). Who knew about so much and yet had not the slightest air of affectation about him or a jot of righteousness, talking and mingling with us like some genial lord of the manor: Baba, all of you are very lucky fellows, you have blossomed forth on a very auspicious day. So what if it's a cold Kartik night with its sweet air blowing around us--today it's also a Kartik full moon night. The goddess Parvati's son, the six-faced one who is the commander of the heavenly forces in his abode, will enchant us tonight with his playful frolicking and fancies.  But, Chandan Babu, listen, why don't you hurry on ahead in the meantime to the house and give my didi Audity advance notice of our guests? By the time you get everything ready I will have shown them the moonrise over on the other side of Dudh Sayerer beel, and then bring them around. This did not sit well with me. No matter how dear a Mama he was of Chandan I didn't feel like going even one step forward with this gentleman. But what choice did I have? In the tenth circle of Hell even the gods become ghosts/And we all know who's to blame for it. Even though Chandan and I grumbled a bit about it, I noted that the others were all for experiencing the Kartik moonrise over on the other side of Dudh Sayerer beel. After walking a considerable distance, I felt as if I no longer even had the energy to listen to the howling and barking of distant foxes and jackals. Mama was striding in front of us like Vasco de Gama, while muttering some incantations under his breath. To be perfectly truthful, our collective knowledge of Sanskrit was so meager that the Shiva-like cries of those jackals seemed clearer and more ominous. But Mama was our indisputable leader. Drawing up his dhuti tightly around him and clutching at his sacred paita thread, he was murmuring mantras so obscure and unfathomable that it was impossible for any of us to understand a single word of it. Then, all of a sudden, he stopped at a spot and raising a forefinger at the distant forest line, he said, look, look at this scene. Are you destined in this life to ever see this again? Fill your heart with it. If not over a bamboo grove, the moon has certainly risen over the tops of the mango orchard, and even if Kajala didi is not here to sing this sloka to you all, at least the Mama who is before you will always be with you. And look, look, take a good look across this vast plain to see what a real full moon night can be--oh, what a flood of shimmering light falls down on us! But you know,  all this while there were jackals, now it seems that packs of wild dogs have joined them in the baying and howling. Even then I would urge you to take a last look at the moonlight cascading down over the tree line. It was not for nothing that Abanindranath had written: here is one moon/over there is another moon/O brother the moons twine/the moon over the hinchay bush... The way Chandan's mama that night, in that remote cow-shit, fly-blown sheltered nook, in leading us to see the moonrise, flayed us with the moon that even today after all this time it seems to me that we are still trapped in some charmed circular maze, going round and round in a trance...

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-02 00:00:00      \nEarlier in the day, the Supreme Court rejected Gupta's curative petition A court in Delhi on Monday stayed the execution of the four convicts in the 2012 Delhi gangrape and murder case, ANI reported.  Akshay Thakur, Vinay Sharma, Mukesh Singh and Pawan Gupta were scheduled to be hanged at Tihar Jail in Delhi on Tuesday at 6am. The court deferred the matter after one of the convicts, Pawan Gupta, filed a mercy petition before India's President Ram Nath Kovind earlier in the day. His lawyer had requested the court to stop the execution citing the petition. Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana rapped his lawyer for filing the curative and mercy pleas so late. \"You are playing with fire, you should be cautious,\" said the judge, adding, \"One wrong move by anybody and you know the consequences.\" Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court rejected Gupta's curative petition. He had sought commutation of his death penalty to life imprisonment. The four convicts were given the death penalty - first by a trial court in September 2013, which was upheld by the Delhi High Court six months later and the Supreme Court in May 2017.  The death warrants were first issued for January 22, and then postponed to February 1 because of the mercy pleas filed by two of the convicts.  Gupta was the only one among the four convicts who had not availed of the legal remedies. His counsel had told a sessions court in Delhi earlier this that he could not avail any legal remedy as his earlier lawyer did not meet him during the seven-day period granted by the Delhi High Court. The four men, along with two others, raped and brutally assaulted a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in a moving bus in Delhi on the night of December 16, 2012.  The woman succumbed to her injuries two weeks later at a hospital in Singapore. The gangrape triggered huge protests in the Indian capital and across the country.  One convict died in prison, while a minor convict was sent to a detention home for juveniles and was released in December 2015."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-18 00:00:00      \n'All the dairy farmers in the district will turn paupers if this situation continues' Hundreds of dairy farmers in Satkhira are counting huge losses as they are forced to dump over 50,000 litres milk every day for lack of demand at every level amid the virtual lockdown in the country after the coronavirus breakout. As the dairy farmers have no alternative source of income, particularly after this pandemic, farm owners in the district are even failing to arrange feed for their cattle. President of Tala Milk Production Samity Dibas Chandra Ghosh said around 1,000 dairy farms in the district, including 400 at Jiala Nalta village and 50 farms in Athari village in Tala upazila, produce over 50,000 litres of milk every day. \"All the dairy farmers in the district will turn paupers if this situation continues...the milk dumping must be stopped as soon as possible for their survival,\" he said. Local dairy farm owners said Milk Vita used to collect 8,000 litres milk while Akij Group 600 litres from them and they used to supply the rest of the milk to different sweet-making factories in Satkhira and Khulna. As soon as the pandemic broke out, all the sweetmeat shops and factories were either shut or cut production, forcing the dairy farm owners to sell milk at Tk10 per litres only, they added. Amid the deteriorating scenario, dairy farmers have sought government help just to survive.  Tala Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Iqbal Hossain said they have already brought it to the notice of the higher authorities concerned. Asked about the dire state of the dairy sector in the district, Deputy Commissioner SM Mostafa Kamal said they have decided to purchase milk through Milk Vita from the farm owners with the fund allotted by the Prime Minister for children's food. He also informed that he personally urged the Chairman of Milk Vita to collect milk from the district for producing food for babies and children. Meanwhile, the district administration has decided to keep the sweetmeat shops in the district open by maintaining social distancing, the DC said hoping that it will reduce the loss of the dairy farmers. Fisheries and Livestock Minister SM Rezaul Karim has recently assured that the government would provide all kinds of support to continue the production of fish, meat, milk and eggs during the coronavirus pandemic. He came up with the assurance in a video message prepared by the Ministry's Livestock and Dairy Development Project to create awareness among people. The minister urged all to keep milk, egg, fish and meat in their menu as that help boost the immunity of people."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-04 00:00:00      \nThe three time Grammy winning singer died from heart complications on Friday Bill Withers, a soulful singer best known for the 1970s hits Lean on Me, Lovely Day and Ain't No Sunshine, has died at age 81 from heart complications, his family said on Friday. Withers produced nine albums, most of them written and recorded in the 1970s, starting with Just As I Am, which included Ain't No Sunshine, which won him the first of three Grammy Awards, according to his official website.  His musical career ebbed in the 1980s as he left \"the hype and the hoopla\" of the spotlight for a more private life, it said. \"A solitary man with a heart driven to connect to the world at large, with his poetry and music, he spoke honestly to people and connected them to each other,\" Rolling Stone magazine quoted the family as saying a statement. \"As private a life as he lived close to intimate family and friends, his music forever belongs to the world.\" Withers was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, among his several honors, and made a rare public appearance to accept the tribute.  His death drew a flood of tributes, including one from Democratic U.S. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who said he often played Withers' Lovely Day at events during his now-ended presidential campaign. \"In this time of death and pain, I hold onto him,\" Booker said in a statement. \"He gave us lifetimes of light and that flame will never be extinguished.\" Booker's former campaign rival, Senator Kamala Harris of California, called Withers a legend whose song \"Grandma's Hands\" reminded her of her own grandmother and other mother figures. \"Let's all continue to live by his cherished lyrics during these times and lean on each other,\" Harris said in a statement. William Harrison Withers Jr. was born on July 4, 1938, in Slab Fork, West Virginia, a coal country town of 200, the son of a miner who died when Withers was 13. He joined the Navy at 17 as his \"ticket out,\" according to his website. After his military service, he moved to Los Angeles where he worked in an aircraft parts factory, taught himself to play the guitar and made a demo tape that launched his career."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-16 00:00:00      \nSultana Pervin came under fire after approving a questionable mobile court raid at Ariful Islam's home The government has appointed a new deputy commissioner (DC) in Kurigram district, removing Sultana Pervin. She came under fire following the questionable arrest, incarceration, and torture of Dhaka Tribune journalist Ariful Islam by a mobile court raid she approved. A circular from the Ministry of Public Administration announcing Sultana's removal from the post and attachment to the ministry was issued on Monday. Another circular, issued on Monday, said Mohammad Rezaul Karim, deputy secretary of the ministry, will replace Sultana as the new Kurigram DC and district magistrate. The ministry has also withdrawn three executive magistrates from Kurigram connected to the incident, by issuing another circular. The officials are - Senior Assistant Commissioner Nazim Uddin, and assistant commissioners Rintu Bikash Chakma, and SM Rahatul Islam of Kurigram. All three orders were effective immediately, said the circulars. Meanwhile, State Minister for Public Administration, Farhad Hossain, told Dhaka Tribune: \"There are allegations against them [the four commissioners] and they have been made officers on special duty [OSD]. \"We will initiate divisional inquiry, and punitive action will be taken against them if they are found guilty after investigation,\" he added. However, the High Court on Monday asked state lawyer, Deputy Attorney General Debashis Bhattacharyya, to collect and submit all documents related to Ariful's conviction and bail by March 23. The bench of Justice Md Ashraful Kamal and Justice Sardar Md Rashed Jahangir issued the order on Monday. Supreme Court Bar Association President, advocate AM Amin Uddin, and advocate Ishrat Hasan with Barrister Syed Sayedul Haque Suman, stood for the writ. During the hearing, the court made a comment stating that a single person does not represent the whole country. The state will not take responsibility for someone's mistake. On Sunday, the High Court ordered the state to submit before it a copy of the conviction and one-year imprisonment sentence of the journalist, issued by a mobile court. During the hearing, the bench also asked the state to respond to some questions over the mobile court's judgment. Responding to a question about whether the drive was conducted by a mobile court or a special taskforce, the state lawyer informed the court that it was a special taskforce and there were 13 people including six from police, five from Ansar battalion, one from the department of narcotics, and one executive magistrate. The drive was conducted around 11:45pm of March 13, 2020, and they found 450ml of local liquor and 100gm of cannabis, with a price of approximately TK150 and Tk1,000 respectively, the DAG informed the court. The DAG told the court that everything was done by law. Advocate Amin Uddin said to the court that a mobile court cannot hand out punishment this way. Mobile courts are appreciated and operations of all mobile courts are not being questioned, he said. Drawing an example of an abuse of power, he said a mobile court had punished a teacher earlier by asking him to \"perform squats holding his ears\" at an examination hall for using a mobile phone. Over the Kurigram incident, the lawyer mentioned that this too was an abuse of power. The way the mobile court operated has proven a mala fide intent. \"One can hand out punishment if a journalist commits an offence, but not in this way.\" The senior lawyer also appraised the role of the media in the country. The court asked the lawyer to bring in journalist Ariful as petitioner if possible and told the state lawyer that there is a gray area regarding how bail was granted to the journalist. Earlier on Sunday, advocate Ishrat Hasan filed the petition on behalf of online news portal Bangla Tribune's Executive Editor, Harun-Ur-Rashid. On March 14, Ariful Islam, Kurigram district correspondent of Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune , was sent to one-year in jail, soon after the mobile court, set up at the Kurigram DC's office, ended the trial proceedings. The mobile court in the dead of night jailed the journalist for a year, after law enforcement led by magistrates picked him up from his home in Kurigram town. The mobile court brought an allegation against the journalist that drugs and alcohol were recovered from his possession, which his family termed absurd. DC's comments contradictory with documents The Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sultana Parvin on March 14 told Dhaka Tribune that a task force was set up to apprehend the journalist as a routine drive against narcotics.  However, her comments in the documents, placed before the court by the state lawyer, contradict that statement. In the witness record, one of the witnesses, Md Arif, stated that Ariful was apprehended by mobile court and the task force while he was drinking liquor and smoking cannabis. Meanwhile countrywide processions were organized by journalists and civil society to seek justice and protest the abuse of power and torture of journalists. They were held in Comilla, Khulna, Natore, Nilphamari, Jhalakati, Joypurhat, Naogaon, Narsingdi, Thakurgaon, Rangpur, Netrokona, Sirajganj and Tangail, according to our correspondents. Our district correspondents Masud Alam, Comilla, Hedait Hossain Molla, Khulna, contributed to this report."

We have therefore made the assessment that Covid-19 can be characterised as a pandemic,\" he told a news conference. The coronavirus, which emerged in China in December, has spread around the world, halting industry, bringing flights to a standstill, closing schools and forcing the postponement of sporting events and concerts. The WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, its \"highest level of alarm,\" on January 30 when there were fewer than 100 cases of Covid-19 outside China and eight cases of human-to-human transmission of the disease.  BREAKING \"We have therefore made the assessment that #COVID19 can be characterized as a pandemic\"-@DrTedros #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/JqdsM2051A Now there are more than 121,000 cases in 121 countries and territories, while over 4,400 people have died, with the numbers expected to climb. China remains the hardest-hit overall with more than 80,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths. The WHO no longer has a category for declaring a pandemic, except for influenza. WHO officials have signalled for weeks that they may use the word \"pandemic\" as a descriptive term, but stressed that it does not carry legal significance. The novel coronavirus is not the flu. Under its previous system, the Geneva-based agency declared the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak a pandemic. It turned out to be mild, leading to some criticism after pharmaceutical companies rushed development of vaccines and drugs."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-13 00:00:00      \nLocals fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands An embankment of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) has collapsed in Kola village of Satkhira's Assasuni upazila, flooding over 1,500 bighas of land, fish enclosures on Friday. Four villages of Pratapnagar and Shriula unions went underwater as the 120 ft BWDB embankment of Zone-2 suddenly collapsed, locals said. Many local residents have started volunteering to repair the embankment with whatever materials currently available. They fear that if the dam is not promptly repaired, the next tidal current is going to cause more damage and flood new lands. On a field visit, thousands of villagers were seen to have volunteered to construct a temporary embankment while the district administration is said to have been busy controlling the coronavirus outbreak in the area. Moreover, the Kopotakkho River embankment collapsed earlier on April 8, flooding 1,000 bighas of farmlands and fish enclosures in three low-lying villages of the same area, waterlogging around 50 families in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishti Nandan villages under Pratapnagar union.  Locals say the 100-ft dam was already in a risky state, so it naturally could not sustain the strong pressure of tidal current and collapsed into the bottom of the Kopotakkho River. Contacted,  Pratapnagar Union Parishad Chairman Jakir Hossain held the water development board responsible in this regard, saying it was their negligence that led to the collapse of the embankment every year. \"Despite repeated complaints and appeals seeking sustainable protection of the embankment, the water development board failed to acknowledge the urgency of the issue.  \"Now, due to this recklessness, farmlands and fish enclosures on around 2,500 bigha of land have been flooded in Kurikaunia, Sreepur, and Brishtinandan villages. Moreover, almost 50 families have become waterlogged after two back-to-back incidents of flooding.\"  Md Arifuzzaman, of the local water development board, after visiting the site said he had arranged sandbags for the temporary emergency repair of the damaged embankment to minimize the extent of damage and protect the remaining lands.  \"The higher authorities will be notified promptly so that the necessary steps may be taken to permanently repair embankment.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-10 00:00:00      \nNusrat's family to this day remain under police protection as they continue to receive threats from prime accused Sirajuddaula's cohorts and followers A year had passed since the murder of Nusrat Jahan Rafi, an alim examinee of Sonagazi Islamia Senior Fazil Madrasa in Feni. But her family still awaits implementation of the verdict against the accused in her murder case. On April 6 last, the 18-year-old was set on fire in broad daylight on the roof of the madrasa by people loyal to principal Sirajuddaula, when she refused to withdraw a sexual harassment case her family filed against Sirajuddaula.  After battling for life for four days, she succumbed to her critical burn injuries at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital on April 10, which sparked nationwide outrage and public demand for swift justice against the perpetrators.  On October 24, following a trial all 16 accused were proven guilty, and a Feni court awarded them death sentence under Section 4(1)/30 of the Woman and Children Repression Prevention Act 2000. However, Nusrat's family till this day remain under police protection as they continue to receive threats from Sirajuddaula's cohorts and followers. \"I cannot sleep, thinking of the pain Nusrat had gone through when she was burnt alive,\" said Nusrat's mother, Shirin Akhter. \"We were happy with the verdict and we know the whole country is with us, still I don't understand why the sentence is not being carried out yet?\" she asks with agony. Nusrat's brother Mahmudul Hasan said they constantly receive threats and also have been targeted in social media by the wellwishers of the convicts ever since the murder took place. He said: \"My sister gave her life to fight for her honour and it seems like it has no end.\" The Public Prosecutor of the court Adv Hafez Ahmed said the prompt prosecution of the case could not have been possible without Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's direct involvement and her assurance of providing proper justice to the girl. \"We are satisfied with the verdict. But the ongoing trial should soon be addressed and justice should be given to the family as they are waiting for long,\" the lawyer added. The convicts are prime accused SM Sirajuddaula, who orchestrated Nusrat's murder, Nur Uddin, Shahdat Hossain Shamim, Maksud Alam, Saifur Rahman Md Zobayer, Sakhawat Hossain Jabed, Abdul Kader, Absar Uddin, Kamrun Nahar Moni, Umme Sultana Popy, Abdur Rahim Sharif, Eftekhar Uddin Rana, Imran Hossain Mamun, Mohammad Shamim, Ruhul Amin, and Mohiuddin Shakil."

Last year (2019 calendar year) fishermen netted 5,240 tons of Ilish, a 61.72% rise from 3,240 tons in 2015, according to the local office of the Department of Fisheries (DoF). The amount was 3,448 tons in 2016, 3972 tons in 2017 and 5,080 tons in 2018, it said. Shariatpur Fisheries Officer Abdur Rouf said that they worked hard for protecting the brood and mother Ilish during the reproductive season following the instruction of the prime minister and the ministry concerned. The district administration helped them a lot, he said. This increase is the outcome of the government plan, he said and added that the procurement of Ilish there was increasing every year.  Local fishery officials said the drive against netting mother Ilish was the main reason behind the success. Last year 1,366 people were panelized in 293 such drives, they informed. According to the DoF, fishermen catch Ilish in  a 69-kilometre area (covering 15,840 hectares of land) of the Padma and the Meghna rivers in Shariatpur.  About 16,355 people are directly involved with Ilish catching, said the DoF. Sirajul Islam, 45, catches Ilish fish in the Padma river. He said that the increased catch of Ilish brought smiles to the fishermen there. \"I experienced huge catches of Ilish in the region when I was young. But the availability of the fish was declining gradually with the passage of time,\" Shirazul said. \"However, the decline in production saw a u-turn and started to rise in the last couple of years,\" he said and added that it became possible due to the strict policy of the government. The fisherman said that they were getting good prices in the market for their catches.  Manik Hossain, an Ilish trader, said the increased production of Ilish raised the income of traders and fishermen and helped them overcome existing financial crisis. The Ilish netting season starts from July and continues until October. The authorities oversee and protect netting of brood Ilish between November to June.  March and April are the banned months for catching any kind of fishes in  20 kilometres of Shariatpur region, as it is the reproductive period for the Ilish.  During the banned period, the government helps the fishermen by providing 20-30 kg of rice to each of them."

While talking to reporters, Tabith said: \"Use of technology has increased everywhere. I want to make Dhaka an 'intelligent city' which is a new trend around the world.  \"I want to use modern technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), to make DNCC a smart city.\"  Mentioning BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's present situation, he said: \"Please assist me, support me and stand beside me. I want your empathy. I promise you, I will never betray you. I promise that my thoughts and plans will be modern and for the future, not something backdated.\"  Responding to a question on whether he would, if elected, be able to implement his pledges while representing BNP, Tabith said that he would, as he would have the support of the city dwellers on his side. Tabith said that he would also focus on tackling the mosquito menace, curbing air pollution and working on better traffic management, among other things. In his manifesto, he also highlighted the importance of improving the public transport and the waste management system of DNCC, adding that he will reset the running holding taxes by mass hearing.

Tabith, in his manifesto, also promised to build at least ten public toilets in every ward of DNCC.  He said that, if elected, he will build three toilets at every main bus stop in Dhaka North for all, including physically challenged people. \"If I get elected as mayor, I will firstly take 60 days work plan for DNCC,\" he added.  Among others, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal President ASM Abdur Rab, Nagarik Oikya Convener Mahmudur Rahman Manna and Gonoshasthaya Kendra founder Dr Zafrullah Chowdhury, were also present during Tabith's manifesto unveiling."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-09 00:00:00      \nThe choi plants are used predominantly in Khulna, Bagerhat, Jessore, and Satkhira Although the use of Chilli (Pepper) in sub-continental food was not noticeable until the Portuguese came to India in the 15th century, yet, the conquest of the hot spice in our palates is persistent and actually thriving till date. The Bangladeshi culinary tapestry, which stemmed from the coalescence of distinctive cultures adapted throughout the establishment and influence of different colonies in India, is famous for its distinctive taste, be it pungent, savoury or sweet. Given the enclosures, with abundant crops and fish, Bengalis adapted a unique spice called Choi Jhal (Piper Chaba), which enabled them to complement their curries with hot, vinegary and aromatic taste, all at once. Choi Jhal, an exquisite spice Choi Jhal, is one of the most popular and unique spices in the south-western region of Bangladesh. The chopped stems, roots and skin of the plant are used while cooking food, especially meat and fish. The choi plants are used predominantly in Khulna, Bagerhat, Jessore, and Satkhira. Choi is a creeper which grows around larger trees. Leaves and stems of the Choi look like betel leaves. Betel and Choi are two species of the same family, Piperaceae. It is a relatively expensive spice in Bangladesh, and the roots are usually more expensive than the stems because of their stronger aroma. How it is used in curries Choi Jhal is mainly used as a taste enhancer. It makes the food hotter and spicier. In Bangladesh the use of Choi Jhal is unique, because the twigs, stems or roots of it, not the fruit, are used as spice.  Curries of beef, mutton and fish can be prepared with Choi Jhal but it is not much popular with vegetables. Commonly a little amount of the dried up Choi Jhal twigs, stems or roots are thrown into the boiling curries, ten to fifteen minutes before the cooking process ends. The softened roots enrich the aroma and flavour of the curry. Though it highly prescribed to use it with garlic and fenugreek, it is suggested by some esteemed cooks not to use it with ginger. Economic prospect of Choi Jhal in Khulna Over the course of time, Choi Jhal became almost extinct from other areas but farmers of the south-western region, Khulna, the third largest city of Bangladesh are cultivating the exquisite spice and earning much with their implicit imports and exports. Nabadip Mollik, a farmer from Dumuria, made it possible to easily commercialise the spice with its original qualities intact, by producing ground Choi Jhal. He said: \"The spice is exquisite and costly but the raw products lose its qualities. With our ground spices it is far easier to use.\" Additional Deputy Director, Md Nazrul Islam at Khulna Agricultural Extension Office(KAEO) said demand for the spice is increasing exponentially. \"Not only curry but pickles made of Choi Jhal is delicious as well,\" he said. Choi Jhal has been treating different kinds of diseases and it has a number of herbal uses, specially the antimicrobial and antioxidant active ingredients, the results of this kind of compounds exhibited good to excellent applications, said KAEO Deputy Director Pankaj Kanti Majumdar."

They are all from Ukhiya and Teknaf refugee camps, said Sub-Inspector SM Atik Ullah, the in-charge of Himchari police outpost. Police also detained three people in connection with the human trafficking from the spot. However, police did not disclose the identities of the Rohingyas and the detained human traffickers. SI Atik said: \"On a tip off, we conducted a drive in the Reju canal area where the human traffickers rounded up a group of Rohingyas early in the morning in order to send them to Malaysia illegally by sea.\" Later, police rescued the Rohingyas from the spot, he said.  \"Of the Rohingyas, four are children, 17 women and 16 men. A case was filed against the three human traffickers with Ramu police station.\" Earlier on February 11, a total of 20 Rohingyas died and several others were rescued after a trawler, carrying around 100 Rohingyas, capsized near Saint Martin's Island in the Bay of Bengal.  They were heading to Malaysia by sea illegally, according to law enforcement agencies.  The camps at Ukhiya and Teknaf in Cox's Bazar currently shelters more than 1.1 million Rohingyas who fled persecution in Myanmar.  Taking advantage on the desperation of these Rohingya people, several gangs of national and international human traffickers often lure them into making dangerous journey to aboard by sea illegally for better lives.

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-07 00:00:00      \nThe draft amendment has made several additions to the list of diseases, disorders, conditions covered in the Act The Indian government's health ministry has introduced a bill in parliament which cracks down on misleading fairness cream ads, among others, and the punishment can be up to five years in jail, and a hefty fine of Rs50 lakh. The Indian Health and Family Welfare Ministry has proposed the draft amendment to the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements Act, 1954), for magic remedies and drugs promoting fair skin, enhancing sexual performance, treating stammering, infertility in women, premature ageing and greying of hair among others, reports NDTV. The draft amendment has made several additions to the list of diseases, disorders, conditions covered in the Act. The Act already states that medicines, \"magic remedies\" and products to cure any of these 78 diseases, disorders, conditions named should not be advertised. The new additions include ads for drugs for improving sexual performance and skin tone and treating premature aging, AIDS, greying of hair, stammering, sterility in women, among others.  Under the Act, the first conviction is punishable with imprisonment of up to six months or fine or both; and a subsequent conviction can result in imprisonment of up to a year or fine, or both. The amendment proposes to increase the penalties. For the first conviction, the proposed punishment is imprisonment of up to two years and fine up to Rs10 lakh. For subsequent conviction, the imprisonment may extend to five years with a fine of up to Rs50 lakh. The ministry said the amendment is being made in order to keep pace with changing time and technology. It has been decided that suggestions, comments and objections from the public and stakeholders will be sought. They may be forwarded within 45 days from the date of issue of this notice. The draft bill also proposes an expansion of definition of an advertisement. It says: \"Any audio or visual publicity, representation, endorsement or pronouncement made by means of light, sound, smoke, gas, print, electronic media, internet or website and includes any notice, circular, label, wrapper, invoice, banner, poster or such other documents.\"  "

On the occasion, Meherpur Deputy Commissioner (DC) Mohammad Ataul Gani started the day's activities by hoisting the national flag atop the Mujibnagar Memorial Museum in the morning. DC Ataul urged everyone to stay at home to combat the Covid-19 pandemic to continue the economic growth of the country. On behalf of the Public Administration Ministry, State Minister for Public Administration Farhad Hossain and Meherpur district administration, Ataul Gani later placed a wreath at the Mujibnagar Memorial. Meherpur-2 MP Shahiduzzaman Khokon, Meherpur district police, district freedom fighters' unit, Meherpur district Awami League and other socio-political organisations also placed wreaths at the memorial. They also paid homage to the four national leaders there. The day was observed remembering the oath taking of the Bangladesh government-in-exile during the Liberation War in 1971 at Baidyanathtala of Meherpur in Kushtia on April 17, 1971. The then government formally announced the proclamation of independence at the program."

This is not unique for Bangladesh,\" a spokesperson at the US Embassy in Dhaka said on Sunday, reports UNB. The spokesperson said this is a temporary measure and the US citizens will return to Bangladesh again once the situation improves globally.  The spokesperson also said the US Embassy in Dhaka will remain open.  The US Department of State and US Embassy in Dhaka have arranged a special chartered flight for US citizens who wish to return and their families.  The special flight will be departing from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport on Monday. The spokesperson said the aircraft will be full, but did not specify the exact number of returnees. The size of the commercial aircraft was also not disclosed.  The special flight will include a Dhaka to Doha, Qatar leg followed by a connecting flight to Dulles International Airport, Washington, DC, said the US Embassy in Dhaka. Passengers will remain on the aircraft in Doha.  All passengers must agree to reimburse the US government for the flight by signing a promissory note for approximately the amount of a full-fare economy flight, or comparable alternate transportation, to the designated destination that would have been charged immediately prior to this crisis, said the Embassy.  The note must be signed and presented before boarding. No cash or credit card payments will be accepted at the airport.    \"You will be responsible for any arrangements or costs (lodging, onward destination or local transportation, etc) beyond Washington, DC.  The US Embassy is unable to book any onward travel for you. The exact departure time and routing of this chartered flight are subject to change,\" said the Embassy.  Asked why US is shifting its citizens to the US despite the risky situation there, the Embassy spokesperson said it is true that the US has been hit very hard but everybody takes their own decision. In the US, over 120,000 cases of Covid-19 and more than 2,000 deaths due to the viral infection had been recorded as of Sunday evening. "

Between February and April, authorities swooped on labs in the lawless Kutkai area of Shan State, seizing nearly 200 million meth tablets, 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of crystal meth, some 300 kgs of heroin, and 3,750 litres of methyl fentanyl. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime described the haul as one of the largest and most successful counter-narcotics operations in the history of the region. \"What has been unearthed through this operation is truly off-the-charts,\" UNODC Southeast Asia and Pacific representative Jeremy Douglas said in a statement. The production network could only have been possible with the backing of serious transnational criminal groups, he added. The raids unearthed \"unprecedented\" methyl fentanyl, the sign of a new trend of synthetic opioid production emerging \"on a scale nobody anticipated\", said Douglas. Fifty times stronger than heroin and up to 100 times more potent than morphine, fentanyl can be lethal from as little as two milligrams -- the equivalent of a few grains of sand. It has fueled an opioid crisis in the US which killed 32,000 people in 2018.  Myanmar is under pressure to stem the deluge of drugs from its freewheeling border regions. Shan State is part of the \"Golden Triangle\" -- a wedge of land cutting into Myanmar, Laos, China and Thailand and virtually untroubled by authorities despite its multi-billion-dollar trade. Myanmar is the world's second-biggest producer of heroin after Afghanistan, and is now widely thought to be the largest global source of meth, fueled by the flood of pre-cursor chemicals from China. Cheap, caffeine-cut \"yaba\" pills -- Southeast Asia's favorite high -- are pushed regionally, prices tripling as they cross borders into Thailand and Malaysia. The more addictive crystal meth, or \"ice\", is smuggled to Tokyo, Seoul or Sydney, where it sells for around $150,000 a kilo on the streets. \"Made-in-Myanmar\" drugs are trafficked south through Thailand, north into China and west towards Bangladesh -- a cascade of stimulants overwhelming regional policing efforts and seeding a crisis of addiction, corruption and money laundering. Thirty-three people were arrested in the operations with authorities vowing to bring to justice criminal groups, traffickers and accomplices. Colonel Zaw Lin from Myanmar's anti-drugs police acknowledged the challenges ahead, but said the traffickers' \"days of operating... are numbered.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-08 00:00:00      \nThe government is very serious about recovering rivers from illegal occupation The government has taken a massive plan to recover canals, wetlands and small rivers across the country and re-excavate those to increase their navigability and water reservation capacity, groundwater recharge and thus preserve the biodiversity. These activities will be done under a project titled \"Re-excavation of small rivers, canals and wetlands inside 64 districts project (1st Phase),\" reports UNB. According to an official document, some 4,086.622km of 88 small rivers, 352 canals and eight wetlands will be re-excavated under 561 packages in 375 upazilas and two city corporations. The amount of excavated soil will be 15.15 crore cubic metres, 62.32 square metres of turfing while that of plantable tress 13.41 lakh. The objective of implementing this project is to ensure removing water-logging from 5.20 hectares of areas and securing those from flood and climate-change onslaught, boosting food production of 3.50 lakh metric tonnes through irrigation in 1.30 lakh hectares of land, fish farming in 15,000 hectares, preservation of bio-diversity in 25,000 hectares, flood control in 3.65 lakh hectares, improving roads and communication in 4100 kilometres and easing river communications through 1,800 kilometres of waterways. Meanwhile, the government started removing illegal structures from the banks of small rivers, canals and wetlands on December 12 last year. So far, it has removed 5,574 illegal structures and recovered 593.12 acres of land from illegal occupants. \"If the project is implemented, it will be possible to maintain the normal flow in small rivers and canals besides saving water reservoirs,\" the document states. It further mentions that the formulation of another project titled, \"Re-excavation of small rivers, canals and wetlands inside 64 districts project (2nd Phase),\" is underway. Under this project, the government will re-excavate five rivers, canals and wetlands in each upazila. Through this project, it will be possible to re-excavate 13,885.363km of rivers, canals, and wetlands, according to the document. A senior official at the Water Resources Ministry said the government is very serious about recovering rivers from illegal occupation. As the government is emphasizing the plying of passengers and transportation of goods through waterways, there is no way to increase the navigability of the rivers -- small or big -- across the country. \"The government has already taken various projects to improve passengers and goods' transportation through the waterways within the country,\" he said. He also mentioned by the \"Re-excavation of small rivers, canals and wetlands inside 64 districts project (1st Phase and 2nd Phase),\" will be very much helpful in preserving water during monsoon for the dry season. \"With this, we will also be able to recharge the groundwater which is very much essential for preserving the biodiversity for the future generation,\" the official added. Bangladesh is a riverine country with waterways crisscrossing much of its landscape.  According to experts, re-excavation is very important as business and internal movement of people are largely dependent on waterways, particularly during monsoon. "

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-08 00:00:00      \nGender equality is a core principle of EU, though it is still not a reality, speakers say European Union (EU) Ambassador to Bangladesh Rensje Teerink  has praised Bangladesh for performing better than The Netherlands and Luxembourg in terms of Global Gender Gap Index. She made the comment while attending an International Women's Day program arranged by European Union at a city hotel in Dhaka on Sunday, reports BSS. Teerink said not only in Bangladesh but in many countries of the world, women are facing different types of social and economic challenges. \"There are so many taboos in The Netherlands. Only 34% women are actually financially independent there. If a married woman does any job, she has to face different types of criticism, including not spending time with their children and sending their kids to daycare centres\", she said. The ambassador said Bangladesh is doing well in the field of women empowerment. As women still face a lot of challenges here, these should be addressed, besides making the people aware about gender equality, she added. At the function speakers said gender equality is a core principle of the European Union, though it is still not a reality. While sharing the views, they said in business, politics and society, to reach full potential the use of talent and diversity is a must. They said women face too many hurdles and barriers on their way and added in Europe and beyond, women continue to be targets of gender-based violence, stereotypes and hate speech. Even if Europe is a good address for women, one in three women in the EU are subject to physical and sexual violence, they said. The speakers said even though more women graduate from universities, they earn on average 16% less than men do. Only 8% of CEO's of the EU's largest companies are women, they mentioned. The function was told that this is not what EU stands for. Everyone, regardless of his or her gender, should be able to live free from violence and pursue his or her chosen path in life. A change is needed and the moment is now. Everyone needs to remember: progress towards equality between women and men is neither inevitable nor irreversible, speakers at the program said. The EU adopted the EU's Gender Equality Strategy, setting out concrete actions for the next five years, including on pay transparency. The strategy is also the EU's contribution to the \"Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action\" - the first universal commitment and action plan to advance on equality between women and men. The EU will continue to support, promote and protect women's rights and women empowerment, while tackling gender-based violence, including in fragile, conflict and emergency situations."

Now the district is becoming quite popular for Bamboo Chicken, a rich and healthy dish native to the region. The mouth watering dish is traditionally known as Huro Chumo (Chakma dialect) to the indigenous people of the area. Now it has turned the heads of many people in and outside Rangamati for its unique taste and flavour.  What one needs to cook Bamboo Chicken To prepare this delicious dish one needs one or half a kg medium sized chicken(sliced), onion, ginger, garlic, and green chilli paste. Add turmeric, cumin seed,  coriander powder with oil and salt  to your taste. You also need banana leaves. Finally, the most important thing. You need to cook all this in a hollow and sturdy fresh bamboo stem, large enough to hold all of the above.  Hence the name Bamboo Chicken.  Cooking the dish  First, one needs to mix the chicken and spices with oil and salt to taste. Then all this is put into the bamboo pipe and the mouth of the bamboo pipe needs to be closed securely with banana leaves. Next, the now full bamboo pipe is cooked in an open charcoal oven. Every few minutes, the pipe needs to be turned so the chicken is tender and cooked evenly. Finally, when the green bamboo stem turns white, the dish is finally cooked, says chef Debobrota in Rangamati. Debobrota added that bamboo chicken is generally eaten with rice, and bread made of wheat flour. Teenager Uchingcha Rakhaine of Rangamati town, said: \" Bamboo Chicken is the traditional food of the hills. We often eat this delicious dish.\" Yasin, a tourist, currently in Rangamati, said: \" I just tastes Bamboo Chicken for the first time, and it is really very tasty!\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-17 00:00:00      \nThe move followed highly publicized complaints from some governments and hospitals that they received PPE from China that they considered faulty The United States has asked China to revise new export quality control rules for protective equipment needed during the coronavirus pandemic so they are not an obstacle to timely supplies, a spokesman for the US State Department said on Thursday. China tightened restrictions on exports of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) last Friday, calling for shipments of the items to be subjected to a mandatory customs inspection. It was a bid by China to balance the global demand for PPE to help treat the rising number of cases of the new coronavirus, while ensuring that manufacturers and sellers do not flood the market with uncertified or shoddy products. The move followed highly publicized complaints from some governments and hospitals that they received PPE from China that they considered faulty. \"We appreciate the efforts to ensure quality control. But we do not want this to serve as an obstacle for the timely export of important supplies,\" a State Department spokesman said. \"The US Government has raised these concerns with (China). We have requested that China revise its new requirements to allow the expeditious export of vital PPE to the United States,\" he said. The United States is heavily reliant on medical supplies produced in China, a major strategic and trade rival, something that has been highlighted in the pandemic, in which the United States has been the worst-affected country. Earlier on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal cited US businesses and diplomatic memos as saying that China's export restrictions had left US-bound face masks, test kits and other medical equipment stranded. It cited suppliers and brokers as saying that large quantities were sitting in warehouses across China unable to receive necessary clearances. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke by phone with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and stressed the \"high importance\" Washington attached to China's facilitation of medical supply exports to meet critical demand in the United States. The US-China Business Council trade lobby group president Craig Allen told reporters on Thursday it had \"had a very good set of discussions with a relatively high level of the Chinese government over the last few days ... and the Chinese government is making allowances and working with our companies to ensure that they're able to ship out.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-22 00:00:00      \nKuwait's cabinet also decided to extend a suspension of government and private agencies for two weeks The government of Kuwait imposed a nationwide curfew on Sunday starting from 14:00 GMT and running until 1:00 GMT to fight the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, state news agency KUNA said, citing the cabinet. Kuwait, which went into virtual lockdown on Thursday, has taken some of the most drastic steps in the region to curb the virus' spread. The Gulf Arab country, which has reported 176 cases of the virus, said violators of the curfew could face up to three years in jail or fines of up to $32,157. The Kuwait National Guard will aid police in imposing the curfew. The decision was made due to \"some manifestations of non-compliance with precautionary measures,\" Deputy Prime Minister Anas al-Saleh said, according to KUNA. Kuwait's cabinet also decided to extend a suspension of government and private agencies for two weeks. It had already announced on Thursday an extension to a suspension of schools and universities until Aug. 4 - the first among its neighbours to impose such lengthy education closures to limit the spread of the sometimes deadly disease. After a late-night cabinet meeting on Saturday, the minister of trade and industry said the country's strategic food reserves were \"secure and plentiful\", KUNA said. He urged people not to stockpile food and said there was no need to panic. Last week, the cabinet approved a bill to increase the budget of ministries and governmental departments by 500 million dinars for the 2020/21 fiscal year due to the coronavirus outbreak. It also established a temporary fund for receiving financial contributions from institutions, companies, and individuals to support the government's efforts to fight the virus. The country's stock market has been battered by the virus outbreak as well as a historic plunge in oil prices. Its main index has lost nearly 30% of its value since the start of the year."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-29 00:00:00      \nIn an exclusive interview with Dhaka Tribune's Humayun Kabir Bhuiyan,  Danish Ambassador to Bangladesh Winnie Estrup Petersen discussed a wide range of bilateral issues with particular emphasis on cooperation to help enable green growth How do you describe the current bilateral relations between Bangladesh and Denmark? How could it be further enhanced? In one word, I would describe it as excellent. Our partnership has been growing over the years. Yes, I am proud that we have a good partnership. We cooperate with each other in a wide range of sectors, especially climate change and agriculture. The existing strategic cooperation between the labour ministries of the two countries is aimed at improving occupational, health and safety conditions for Bangladeshi workers through exchange of knowledge and experience. A number of Danish companies, businesses and NGOs are present in Bangladesh. Denmark also works closely with Bangladesh in several international forums. For instance, both countries are members of the Human Rights Council and look forward to opportunities to work together. Our relations are wide and deep and I am a proud Ambassador of Denmark in Bangladesh. With continued cooperation on the issues of mutual interest, the relationship will transform and only deepen as Denmark shifts its bilateral focus from aid to trade, which will result in increased emphasis on green growth and issue of sustainability in Bangladesh.  I reckon in every relation, there are areas for dialogues. As our bilateral ties are rooted in strong foundations any issues can be addressed through dialogue and consensus. What are the new areas of cooperation by which both countries can be benefited? I think we are looking to explore green growth in several sectors, especially the readymade garments industry. By green growth, I mean each company will manufacture its products organically, resulting in the use of less water and thus less pollution. To simply put it into words, Danish companies are coming to Bangladesh to offer green solutions for local manufacturers. Dhaka is a densely populated business hub of the country. Unprecedented fire hazards over the past several years have drawn quite a bit of attention. Hence, Danish firms are collaborating with Bangladeshi organizations to set up small fire fighting stations equipped with easy-to-use fire fighting devices. There is another option for efficient fire fighting we are considering --e.g., motorbikes equipped with fire fighting instruments, for quick responses to fire incidents. It is a flexible and good technology.  We are also looking forward to cooperating with Bangladesh with respect to wind energy.  Denmark has expertise in developing cities that are more liveable, green, energy efficient and adaptable to traffic regulations.  We are identifying Danish expertise, technologies and innovations that may benefit both countries. Are you satisfied with the current trade volume between Dhaka and Copenhagen? How can this be increased? I am pleased with the present-day trade volume between the two countries and yet more can be done. Trade between the two countries is clearly in favour of Bangladesh. We would like to see increased Danish trade with Bangladesh. Is Danish investment in Bangladesh satisfactory? What does Bangladesh need to do more to attract higher Danish investment? There are about 40 Danish companies engaged one way or another in Bangladesh, which is  rather an impressive figure from a small country like Denmark. Bangladesh is a good market with an impressive growth trend. The Bangladesh economy needs more foreign investment in strategic areas to continue its growth momentum in the coming years. There are opportunities to bring Danish investment and businesses to Bangladeshi market. However, Danish companies face steep challenges mostly related to predictability of policies and legislation. Danish companies work best in a rule-based business environment. Business climate has to be well-regulated. Danish companies are not accustomed to dealing with bureaucratic red tape and they have a zero tolerance to corruption. Do you think the international community is doing enough to solve the Rohingya crisis? What do you think the solution is to this protracted crisis? As long as the crisis is not resolved, we have not done enough. As things stalled in the United Nations Security Council, the international community, including Denmark, is exploring alternative routes, which include proceedings at the Human Rights Council, International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court.  Denmark, a big contributor in terms of providing humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya people in Cox's Bazar, is working with the Bangladesh government and other global partners to provide the necessary support in addressing current and emerging challenges centering on the crisis."

In a post on Bernie Sanders official Facebook page on Wednesday, an image showed \"healthcare is a human right\" written in Bengali.  This is not the first time that the Sanders campaign made an effort to reach out to the Asian American communities, which were long ignored by most presidential candidates in the past.    Earlier, the Sanders campaign uploaded a video showing the plight of low-income earning Bangladeshi American families living in a community building run by a corrupt rental agency in Jamaica, a middle-class neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. New York remains a state where the majority of America's Bangladeshi community calls home. The Bangladeshi American community is also well-represented in neighbouring New Jersey, Maryland, DC, Florida, and, of course, California. It has a formidable presence in Michigan (especially in cities like Detroit and Hamtramck)."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-05-01 00:00:00      \nEnd-of-life vessel, carrying 1500 tons of toxic waste from oil extraction process, heading to Chittagong Environmental rights activists have urged Bangladesh to stop the import of a toxic ship for scrapping at breaking yards the Chittagong. Floating storage and offloading tanker J. Nat, which was used by offshore oil and gas companies, left Indonesian water on April 18 even though local activists warned Indonesian authorities about the toxicity of the vessel, says the NGO Shipbreaking Platform. \"Official documents indicate that the tanker has more than 1500 tons of hazardous waste from the oil extraction process onboard, including 1000 tons of slop oil, 500 tons of oily water and 60 tons of sludge oil contaminated with high concentration of mercury,\" reads a statement by the Platform released on Apr 29.  The vessel likely also contains high amounts of mercury in its structures as well as in ballast waters, it added. As most of the shipbreaking yards use the blow torch method to cut vessels, the high concentration of mercury in the steel hull of J. Nat risks the inhalation of mercury vapour, says the Platform. Exposure to it, even at low levels, has been linked to central nervous system damage, kidney and liver impairment, reproductive and developmental disorders, defects in foetuses and learning deficits, according to the statement.  \"Mercury is a naturally occurring element present in virtually all oil and gas fields. Concentrations are especially high in the South American and East Asian regions,\" it quoted Ingvild Jenssen, executive director and founder of NGO Shipbreaking Platform. Citing a recent court judgement on the illegal import of another oil and gas unit -- North Sea Producer, the rights body said the Bangladesh Supreme Court denounced the fraudulent documents claiming the vessel was toxic-free, when it was contaminated by radioactive substances. The court had then called for full transparency on toxic material in end-of-life vessels brought in to the country.   \"In light of the recent judgment on the North Sea Producer, there is no scope to give any authorization for import, beaching, and breaking of the J. NAT. It is public knowledge that Bangladesh will not be able to deal with the hazardous waste flow downstream. The vessel will simply flood our shores with toxic substances and expose our workers to deadly risks,\" the statement quoted Syeda Rizwana Hasan, director of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association. With many units to be decommissioned in the next few years, it is high time that the oil and gas industry collectively seeks sustainable solutions for the recycling of its floating units, said the Platform's founder Jenssen.  \"All actors involved in the oil and gas supply chain, directly or indirectly, have the responsibility to not cause harm to workers and the environment in developing countries.\""

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-12 00:00:00      \nDevotees suffer due to inadequate vehicles, 2021 Ijtema schedule fixed Participated by hundreds of thousands of Muslim devotees, including 2,000 foreigners, the opening phase of the 55th Biswa Ijtema concluded with the Akheri Munajat along the banks of Turag River in Tongi. Maulana Zubair Hassan, the imam of Kakrail mosque in Dhaka, conducted the Akheri Munajat at 11am, praying for the country's welfare and continued growth, and peace for the Muslim Ummah in their worldly life and thereafter. The Munajat, offered both in Bangla and Urdu, lasted for nearly 45 minutes amid heightened security measures. Women participate in Akheri Munajat of Bishwa Ijtema on the banks of the Turag River, in Tongi, on Sunday, January 12, 2020 | Rajib Dhar/Dhaka TribunePakistani alem Maulana Ziaul Haq delivered a sermon after Fajr prayers, followed by a special speech by Indian Islamic scholar Ibrahim Dewla on different aspects, including Imaan and Akhlaq, in the light of the holy Quran and the Hadiths.  The first phase of the annual congregation -- the second largest of its kind after Hajj -- on the outskirts of Dhaka, was mainly participated by the followers of Maulana Zubair, the head of Tabligh Jamaat in Bangladesh.  The second phase of the Ijtema, spanning three days is scheduled to begin on January 17 at the same venue, after a four-day break. Followers of Indian alem Maulana Saad Kandhalvi will participate in the closing phase of the annual congregation, where he will conduct the Akheri Munajat.  Muslim devotees from different walks of life, in great numbers, started thronging the Ijtema venue from the dawn, in order to attend the Munajat. Failing to board a vehicle on the way to the Ijtema grounds, many opted to commute on foot.  The venue was brimming soon after the Fajr prayers, with roads and lanes leading to the grounds packed with crowds of devotees despite the cold weather. Even parts of the Dhaka-Mymensingh Highway were occupied by devotees joining the Munajat.   Train passengers participate in Akheri Munajat of Bishwa Ijtema on the banks of the Turag River, in Tongi, on Sunday, January 12, 2020 | Rajib Dhar/Dhaka TribuneMoreover, the rooftops of residential and industrial buildings around the venue were also packed.  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, accompanied by her younger sister Sheikh Rehana, also joined the Akheri Munajat from her official residence Ganabhaban in Dhaka, in the presence of  State Minister for Religious Affairs, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah. Educational institutions, factories, kitchen markets, shopping malls and offices located in Uttara, Tongi and Gazipur were closed due to the huge rush of people centering the Akheri Munajat.     In order to manage the growing number of devotees coming from home and abroad, the holy congregation is being held in two phases since 2011. Devotees outnumbering transportation vehicles, causing misery Traffic from Airport Road in the capital to Joydevpur Chowrasta, Mirer Bazar of Gazipur Sadar upazila to Tongi, Abdullahpur up until the Bypass Road were suspended for nearly six hours since the Fajr prayers. However, the movement of vehicles started around 12 noon, after the Munajat ended, causing a large number of crowds to pour into nearby roads and highways.   Very few vehicles operated in proportion to the huge crowd leaving the Ijtema premises for their destinations outside Tongi, leading to immense suffering for the devotees. They were left walking towards their destined locations. Cashing in on the situation, transport workers charged exorbitant fares from the devotees.    They were charging up to Tk100 from Azampur, Uttara to Motijheel, Sayedabad, Gulistan, Sadarghat, Azimpur, New Market and Gabtoli. Similar fares were being charged by the driver's assistant of a BRTC bus, for the same distance.   In addition, a large number of motorbikes added to the troubles of devotees leaving the Ijtema premises.  Meanwhile, Bangladesh Railway arranged a special rail service engaging 16 trains to carry passengers to and from Tongi, on the occasion, as it does every year. Plus, every inter-city train crossing Tongi Railway Station stopped there for five minutes.    Schedule set for next year's Bishwa Ijtema The faction of Tabligh Jamaat, led by Maulana Zubair, has fixed the dates for the two phases of Ijtema to be held in January 2021.  Md Mejbah Uddin, a leader of the faction, informed reporters that the first phase of the three-day-long congregation will start on January 8, while the second and last one will be held from January 15. Prior to that, a five-day Jor Ijtema, a gathering organized ahead of the two-phase Bishwa Ijtema, will be held from November 27 this year.  Dowry-free mass marriage  Unlike last year, this year's first phase of Ijtema ended with a dowry-free mass marriage ceremony. On Saturday, the second day of the three-day phase, 101 couples were married without dowry.  The brides and grooms were listed for the event on Thursday, upon their consent.   The second mass marriage is scheduled for the second day of the closing phase of the annual gathering.  A mass marriage is held on the second day of each phase of the Ijtema every year, but it did not take place in 2019 following a Tabligh Jamaat factional feud. "

On the real-time rankings, Dhaka showed an average AQI score of 161 at 10:09am on Sunday, according to AirVisual, which monitors global air quality. Dhaka's air quality was classified as \"unhealthy.\" Residential areas like Bashundhara, Baridhara DOHS, and Gulshan 2 showed AQI scores of 168, 157, and 158 respectively. Thailand's Chang Mai, China's Shenyang, and India's Delhi occupied the first, second, and third spots in the list of cities with the worst air quality with AQI scores of 194, 191, and 174 respectively. A numerical value between 151 and 200 indicates that everyone may begin to experience health effects. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects. Air quality between 201 and 300 is classified as \"very unhealthy.\" If the score is between 301 and 500, then it is classified as \"hazardous.\" The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants -- Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh has been struggling with air pollution for a long time. Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Brick kilns, vehicles run on fuel containing higher levels of sulphur, as well as construction work, have all been identified as major sources of air pollution. Air quality further declines during the dry months -- from October to April -- but improves during the monsoon."

Indian Prime Minister Modi was scheduled to visit Bangladesh on March 17 to attend the birth centenary celebrations, but postponed it due to the coronavirus outbreak. Following the detection of coronavirus cases for the first time in Bangladesh, the year-long programs chalked out to celebrate the birth centenary of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during the \"Mujib Borsho\" have been rescheduled in consideration of public health. The grand inaugural ceremony of the birth centenary celebrations scheduled for March 17 at the National Parade Ground has been put on hold due to the prevailing situation across the world caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The ceremony will be held later. In the video message, the Indian prime minister will also announce some advancement in bilateral relations between Bangladesh and India, sources at the Indian External Affairs Ministry have confirmed. In the video message, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also showcase Bangabandhu's life, they added.  Indian Foreign Secretary Vardhan Shringla at the Hyderabad House in Delhi on Wednesday, March 11, 2020 | Courtesy Bangladesh to get defence supply from India soon  For the first time in the country's history, the Bangladesh Armed Forces will get the first installment of defence supplies from India soon, according to a top level source at the Indian External Affairs Ministry.  As part of the first phase of the defence pact, the Indian prime minister will officially announce the handing over of some sports utility vehicles (Tata Hexa) to the Bangladesh Army. The $500million pact was signed between the two neighbours when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina paid a four-day visit to Delhi in July 2018.  Traditionally India supplies defence equipment to Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar and of late to Afghanistan. India has also extended $600million defence related Line of Credit (LoC) to Vietnam and another LoC to Mauritius in the past.  Defence diplomacy is emerging as a key element in India's foreign policy, with Delhi eyeing a supply of defence equipment to friendly countries in Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, according to experts. Indian to give 150 ambulances As a token of friendship, India will provide 150 ambulances to Bangladesh, 100 for the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujib and 50 others representing the 50 years of relationship between India and Bangladesh, Shringla said. On the donation of ambulances, Shringla said they were a gift from Modi who would make the formal announcement. He said these were not ordinary ambulances but had systems in place so that victims facing trauma could access a nearby ambulance by calling a designated number immediately."

At least 38 people have so far been rescued from the rubble of the 80-room Xinjia hotel in coastal Quanzhou city, said the local government. Footage circulating on microblogging platform Weibo showed rescue workers combing through the building's wreckage in the dark and reassuring a woman trapped under heavy debris as other wounded victims were carried into ambulances. The hotel's facade appeared to have crumbled into the ground, exposing the building's steel frame, and a crowd had gathered around the area as the evening wore on. Officials have yet to confirm whether anyone died in the accident. Quanzhou authorities said over 700 rescue workers had been deployed to the scene along with ambulances, excavators and cranes.  Representatives from Beijing are also en route to Quanzhou to assist in relief efforts, Xinhua news agency reported. Quanzhou has recorded 47 cases of the COVID-19 infection and the hotel, which opened just two years ago, was recently repurposed to house people who had been in recent contact with confirmed patients, the People's Daily state newspaper reported. China is no stranger to building collapses and deadly construction accidents, which are typically blamed on the country's rapid growth leading to corner-cutting by builders and the widespread flouting of safety rules. At least 20 people died in 2016 when a series of crudely-constructed multi-storey buildings packed with migrant workers collapsed in the eastern city of Wenzhou. Another 10 were killed last year in Shanghai after the collapse of a commercial building during renovations."

A group of hackers named Team Donz claimed responsibility for hacking the website between late Friday and early Saturday. On Friday, a photograph of Manirampur Executive Magistrate and Assistant Commissioner (Land) Sayeema Hasan, taking a photograph of the elderly men holding their ears as punishment for not wearing masks, surfaced on Facebook that generated the criticism of netizens. News of the hacking surfaced on Facebook early Saturday when many users shared a screenshot of the webpage where the photograph of the incident was featured on the website. The hackers replaced the cover photo of the domain page with a photograph of Sayeema punishing the senior citizens. The hackers also added a notice on the noticeboard that read: \"In spite of being a literate person, the assistant commissioner of land acted like an illiterate person,\" which was later removed around 12:20am. Confirming the matter on Saturday afternoon, Jessore district's Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Shafiul Arif said: \"The webpage was hacked and our IT team fixed it at midnight.\" The domain page is run under the National Web Portal of Bangladesh (Jatiya Tatthya Batayan). Contacted, Sayeema was not available for comment, despite repeated attempts over the phone. Earlier on Saturday, Sayeema was withdrawn from her workplace after widespread criticism on social media, confirmed Public Administration Secretary Sheikh Yusuf Harun. Punishment gone wrong Following the government's directive for people to stay inside their houses to curb the spread of coronavirus, many government officials and law enforcement agencies have been conducting drives in different areas of the country. A mobile court, led by then executive magistrate Sayeema Hasan, conducted drives in different areas of Manirampur on Friday afternoon. During the drive, she asked the three elderly men, including a van driver and a vegetable vendor, at Chinatola Bazar, to hold their ears in public as punishment. She also captured photographs of the punishment. Her photograph capturing moments with the humiliated elderly individuals later went viral on social media and drew significant criticism."

Shirin Begum, Shariyat's wife alleged they are living in fear of security, while the police failed to pay heed to their concerns. \"We have been shunned-off by the village arbiters for 15 days. They are also influencing the locals so they do not interact with us.\" \"My children were forced to stop going to school as we receive death threats every day,\" she added. Nayan Miah, Shariyat's uncle, hoped the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina would soon intervene to ensure the safety of their family members as well as Shariyat's. \"The Matbar (Village Arbitration Chief) held a meeting at the local mosque premises on Saturday, and declared us as outcasts.\" Mirzapur police station OC Syedur Rahman said necessary measures have been taken to ensure the safety of Shariyat's family members. We are watching over their concerns as soon as they arise.\" \"The family is regularly paying visits to Bayati Shariyat,\" he added. Meanwhile, Tangail Qawmi Ulama Parishad on Thursday held a press conference, and demanded death sentence for Shariyat Bayati over his anti-Islamic remarks. They urged the government to pass a blasphemy law that ensures death penalty to Shariyat and other anti-Islamists. They have asked singers, actors, and directors not to endorse anti-Islamic content. Bayati Shariyat Sarker, a folk singer, was arrested on Saturday over his alleged anti-Islamic remarks at a program, and sent to jail on Tuesday after a three day remand. Cultural activists from all over the country, including Dhaka, Manikganj, Rajbari, Rajshahi districts are holding processions, human chains and demonstrations asking for Bayati's prompt release."

Meanwhile, an Awami League leader and an Awami Swecchasebak League leader of local units were suspended from their parties over similar accusations in Bagerhat.  In Joypurhat, police seized 14 sacks (700 kg) of illegally hoarded rice at a house in Gucchogram village of Kalai upazila yesterday.

Seventeen people are also missing, seven injured, and some 3,500 have been forced out of their homes following a series of landslides and building collapses, Civil Defense officials said. Television footage showed images of overflowing rivers, flood neighborhoods and trees and utility poles knocked over by the rushing water. Several highways have also been cut by the flooding, and scores of bridges have been knocked out. Most of the victims were killed in landslides or buried in destroyed homes. At least two children were listed among the dead. The heavy rain and flooding is also hitting the nearby states of Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo. Rainfall in the region has been the heaviest since records were first kept 110 years ago, the National Institute of Meteorology said. In one 24-hour period, the Minas Gerais state capital Belo Horizonte recorded 172 millimeters of rain. Forecasters said the rain is expected to taper off on Sunday, but authorities warn that the danger of landslides remains high, especially in the Belo Horizonte area. The deluge coincided with the first anniversary of the dam collapse in the Minas Gerais town of Brumadinho that killed 270 people. Eleven people are still listed as missing. An accumulation of water and a lack of drainage caused the tailings dam rupture on January 25, 2019, according to a report commissioned by the mining firm Vale."

On the real-time rankings, Dhaka showed an average AQI score of 136 at 10:06am on Wednesday, according to AirVisual, which monitors global air quality. Dhaka's air quality was classified as \"unhealthy for sensitive groups.\" Residential areas like Gulshan and Bashundhara showed AQI scores of 143 and 155 respectively. Pakistan's Lahore, India's Mumbai, and Nepal's Kathmandu occupied the first, second, and third spots in the list of cities with the worst air quality with AQI scores of 228, 177, and 174 respectively. A numerical value between 101 and 150 indicates that sensitive groups may begin to experience health effects.  A value between 151 and 200 indicates that everyone may begin to experience health effects. Members of sensitive groups may experience more serious health effects.  Air quality between 201 and 300 is classified as \"very unhealthy.\" If the score is between 301 and 500, then it is classified as \"hazardous.\" The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is, and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. In Bangladesh, the AQI is based on five criteria pollutants -- Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2, and Ozone (O3). The Department of Environment has also set national ambient air quality standards for these pollutants. These standards aim to protect against adverse human health impacts. As one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh has been struggling with air pollution for a long time. Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Brick kilns, vehicles run on fuel containing higher levels of sulphur, as well as construction work, have all been identified as major sources of air pollution. Air quality further declines during the dry months -- from October to April -- but improves during the monsoon."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-02 00:00:00      \nFarmers are unable to derive enough profits from their regular jhuming while the poppy fields are offering much more to them The cultivation of opium has been surging in Bandarban despite regular drives by joint forces comprising Bangladesh Army, Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) and other law enforcement agencies. Almost 25 acres of the poppy crop  were destroyed in different upazilas of the district. Even so, the reason behind the increased interest in poppy cultivation is somewhat surprising for some locals, as this correspondent found during a visit to the area. Most recently, on February 19, the Bangladesh Army destroyed an acre of poppy field in Ruma. On February 16, BGB destroyed three acres of poppy field in Thanchi's Ko-Ong area and just the previous day, on February 15, the army destroyed another acre in Ruma upazila's Tuikkajhiri area, according to law enforcement sources. Bangladesh Army Ruma zone Commander Lt Col Md Goulam Akbar, psc, explained how poppy plants are being used in making the deadly opium and as the drugs are sold at high prices, he said, locals are getting more interested day by day in investing more in poppy cultivation than in their yearly Jhum yields. \"Despite all the challenges we are patrolling even in the most inaccessible parts of the hill tracts to free the region from drugs and we will continue our drives as long as it is necessary,\" said Commander Akbar. On February 4, the security forces in a joint drive led by East Bengal Regiment (EB) Commander Md Ashiqur Rahman destroyed 12 poppy fields across 10 acres of hilly slopes in Saikot and Khulen Khumi areas. The farmers made good their escape. Shoihlaching Marma, a local journalist in Ruma, said that poppy plants grew more in quantity in winter, and as this year's winter was colder, cultivation reached a peak.   Uhlaching Marma, chairman of Ruma upazila, said the local authorities were taking different measures to discourage the farmers from growing poppy, including arranging meetings to raise awareness about the consequences of the illicit cultivation.  \"Jhuming\", an age-old practice of the indigenous people of the hill tracts, is now facing a challenge because of the flawed transportation system that bars farmers from selling their produce and earn an easy livelihood, said Lu Pru Ong Marma, a Ruma resident. Farmers are unable to derive enough profits from their regular jhuming while the poppy fields are offering much more to them. This factor might be making the farmers inclined to take risks and despite the drives, cultivation is on the rise this year, the local added. Members of the Arakan Liberation Party (ALP), which is a Rakhine political party in Myanmar, and its armed wing, the Arakan Liberation Army (ALA), somehow cross the border near Ruma, Thanchi and Alikadam upazilas and cultivate the illicit plant with help from locals, smuggling it back to Myanmar, said local sources. The profits gained from these drugs are the main source of income for the insurgent militant group, locals say. Md Shamsul Alam, upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) of Ruma, said the authorities had directed the local representatives to warn residents about the aftermath of such illegal cultivation and would arrange regular meetings to raise awareness about the problem. He said: \"Despite our warnings, if anybody tries to break the law, they will face punishment.\""

A statement issued by the Chief Minister Office said the victims had attended the three-day religious congregation and contracted Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The state government said two had died while undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad, one each in Apollo Hospital and Global Hospital. Two other deaths were reported from Nizamabad and Gadwal. It also added that special teams under district collectors have identified those who came in contact with these people, and they were shifted to hospitals.  The authorities also urged people who attended the prayers in Delhi to contact officials. \"Telangana health department requests those who attended the congregation at Markaz to voluntarily report at hospitals,\" it said, adding that the government would conduct tests and offer treatment to them free of cost. Thousands of Indians and hundreds of foreigners had attended the conference that took place on March 9 and 10 in the densely populated Nizamuddin area of Delhi. Ten of the 17 confirmed cases in Tamil Nadu on March 30 were also of people who had participated in the congregation. India has recorded 1,251 cases of the coronavirus, with 32 deaths, but health experts say the country of 1.3 billion people could see a major surge in cases that could overwhelm its weak public health system."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-14 00:00:00      \nTea workers in Moulvibazar suffering in bitter cold At least six children died from pneumonia in Khagrachhari between January 1 and 13, according to local medical professionals.  Due to the cold wave that has been sweeping across Bangladesh for over a week, there has been a rise in pneumonia and cold-induced diarrhoea infection in the hill district,  particularly in the rural areas.  Confirming the death toll, Dr Rajendra Tripura, paediatric specialist at Khagrachhari Sadar Hospital, said the hospital had received many patients whose health had deteriorated because of primary treatment being neglected.  Newborns and children are the worst sufferers of cold-related diseases - pneumonia and diarrhoea - in the district, hospital sources said. Most of these children are aged between 6 and 18 months.  Children with severe cases of pneumonia have been getting admitted to the hospital. Many of them are in critical condition.  The hospital staff are overwhelmed with the growing number of patients coming in, sources have said.  Dr Nayanmoy Tripura, resident doctor at Khagrachhari Sadar Hospital, said at least 1,200 people had been treated for pneumonia and diarrhoea in the hospital since the advent of winter.  Medical professionals have advised local citizens, especially guardians of children, not to panic and instead arrange proper medical care in time.  Moulvibazar tea workers suffer in bitter cold A bitterly cold weather has gripped the seven upazilas of Moulvibazar, making life miserable for tea workers, especially the elderly and children. Due to dense fog, the sun remains invisible for most of the day in Sreemangal and Kamalganj.  \"The bitter cold leaves us shivering even inside the house,\" said Koloti Ghatuar, an elderly woman working at Kurma tea garden, beside the Dhalai River. The temperature was recorded at 11 degrees Celsius in Sreemangal on Tuesday, said Anisur Rahman, assistant meteorologist at the local met office. Dr Zakir Hosain, resident medical officer at Kulaura Upazila Health Complex, said the number of patients suffering from cold-related diseases had increased in the last few days.  Workers of Harincherra tea garden went to the local union parishad office for warm clothes, but did not get any help, said Swapan Nayek, a Sreemangal resident. The impoverished people of the tea garden areas are the worst sufferers as they can hardly afford any warm clothes, according to Rajghat Union Parishad Chairman Bijoy Benarjee. Around 400,000 workers of 92 tea gardens in the district are suffering, yet they have not received any help from the tea garden owners, complained Makhon Lal Karmakar, president of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union.  But Bangladesh Cha Sangsad Vice-Chairman Shafwan Chowdhury said tea garden owners had provided support to tea workers this winter, though on a limited scale. District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Ashraf Ali said the authorities had distributed Tk10 lakh and 43,200 blankets among cold-stricken people in the district, and allotted Tk2 lakh to help the poor buy winter clothes for children."

The populous Indian state of West Bengal took the brunt of Cyclone Amphan, which barrelled out of the Bay of Bengal with gusting winds of up to 185 km per hour (115 mph) and a storm surge of around five metres. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said at least 10 people had died in the state, and two districts been completely battered by one of the strongest storms to hit the region in several years. \"Area after area has been devastated. Communications are disrupted,\" Banerjee said, adding that although 500,000 people had been evacuated, state authorities had not entirely anticipated the ferocity of the storm. With rains continuing, she said the hardest hits areas were not immediately accessible. Federal authorities said they could only make a proper assessment of the destruction on Thursday morning. \"We are facing greater damage and devastation than the Covid-19,\" Banerjee said, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has so far killed 250 people in the state. In West Bengal's capital city, Kolkata, strong winds upturned cars and felled trees and electricity poles. Parts of the city were plunged into darkness. An official in the adjoining Hooghly district said thousands of mud homes were damaged by raging winds. In neighbouring Bangladesh, at least four people were killed, officials said, with power supplies cut off in some districts. Authorities there had shifted around 2.4 million people to more than 15,000 storm shelters this week. Bangladeshi officials also said they had moved hundreds of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, living on a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, to shelter. But officials said they feared that standing crops could be damaged and large tracts of fertile land in the densely-populated country washed away.  \"Fortunately, the harvesting of the rice crop has almost been completed. Still it could leave a trail of destruction,\" said Mizanur Rahman Khan, a senior official in the Bangladesh agriculture ministry. Cyclones frequently batter parts of eastern India and Bangladesh between April and December, often forcing the evacuations of tens of thousands and causing widespread damage. Surge and high tide Surging waters broke through embankments surrounding an island in Bangladesh's Noakhali district, destroying more than 500 homes, local official Rezaul Karim said. \"We could avoid casualties as people were moved to cyclone centres earlier,\" Karim said. Embankments were also breached in West Bengal's Sundarban delta, where weather authorities had said the surge whipped up by the cyclone could inundate up to 15 km inland. The ecologically-fragile region straddling the Indian-Bangladesh border is best known for thick mangrove forests that are a critical tiger habitat, and is home to around 4 million people in India. On the Sundarbans' Ghoramara island, resident Sanjib Sagar said several embankments surrounding settlements had been damaged, and some flooding had started. \"A lot of houses have been damaged,\" he told Reuters by phone. Anamitra Anurag Danda, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation think-tank who has extensively studied the Sundarbans, said that embankments across the area may have been breached. \"The cyclone surge coincided with the new moon high tides. It is devastation in the coastal belt,\" he said."

The video of his merciles beatingin Gachhpara market in Pabna Sadar upazila went viral when went to meet the police to discuss his cooperation in the case. Abdul Alim, 36, of Nurpur area in the upazila is now under treatment for severe bone fractures in Pabna General Hospital, this correspondent found upon a visit.   Abdul Alim, while on the hospital bed, told Dhaka Tribune: \"Ariful Islam, Helal, Ashraf, who are accused in the rape case attacked me. Inspector Khairul sought my help to find witnesses of the rape case. The law enforcers were with me during the assault; my sorrow is, while I tried to help them no one came to my rescue when I was attacked.\" Police on Tuesday arrested Ashraf Hossain, 45, and Tofazzol Hossain, 42, in connection with the incident after a case was filed against 10 people by the victim's wife Ruma Khatun on Monday night. On Friday, the rape case investigation in-charge, Inspector Khairul Islam and a constable met Alim at the Gachhpara market. Just after the police officials left him, local men attacked him with blunt weapons that left him severely injured. Inspector Khairul Islam said: \"The assault took place after we left him and had already gone too far. As we saw people running from the distance, we informed the higher officials and requested backup. Locals took him to hospital after the incident.\" Pabna Acting Superintendent of Police (SP) Gautam Kumar Biswas said that a three-member probe committee was formed to investigate the incident. \"The probe committee will look if there was any negligence from police members. The committee headed by Additional SP Shamima Akhter has been guided to submit the report within seven days,\" added SP Gautam. On December 20, a woman was reportedly raped in Gopalpur village of the Pabna Sadar upazila. Two days after the woman's family filed a case against the prime accused Ariful Islam, younger brother of Maligachha Union Parishad Chairman Shariful Islam, and seven others."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-02 00:00:00      \nIs this unprecedented or is history repeating itself? \"War is Peace/Freedom is Slavery/Ignorance is Strength\" runs the slogan of the \"Party\" ruling fictional Oceania in George Orwell's dystopian novel, 1984. The motto illustrates the seductive appeal of Doublethink -- the ability to juxtapose mutually contradictory themes or ideas simultaneously. Seven decades after its initial publication, Orwell's grim vision of a dystopia envisages a society run by a repressive totalitarian state through intrusive surveillance and coercive censorship; the stamping out of even the mildest form of disagreement or dissent; relentless barrage of counter-factual propaganda; promotion of perpetual war and unabashedly eulogizing and extolling the cult of personality. Orwell partially based his work on the nightmarish horrors of Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Terms such as thoughtcrime, unperson, Ministry of Truth, and Big Brother have entered the popular lexicon and become emblematic of oppressive societal control by the state through bureaucratic, technological, and economic means.  The wave of populism that seems to have swept the world is often pointed out to be the beginning of dystopia. Populism rests on the twin pillars of disconnect and discontent of the masses with the extant political, economic and social system, and the polarization and fragmentation of the body politic of the nation.  The populist movement basks on a binary, exclusionary principle of the righteous versus the damned; us versus them; hard working patriotic populace versus the corrupt elite; the son of the soil versus the foreigner. The perception of an imminent threat or danger captures the public's imagination. The populist leader, like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, plays upon these fears and magnifies them. By whipping the crowd to a feverish frenzy, through nonstop agitprop, he consolidates their support, and converts it to favourable tangible electoral outcome, which in turn helps him to acquire the reins of power of the state. Once in power, he chips away at the old system and shows scant regard for convention and long-established tradition, in a bid to centralize power and shore up his authority. Sooner rather than later, key components of a functioning democracy such as transparency, accountability, stakeholder consultation, and engagement, are diluted or are dispensed with, on the spurious plea of efficacious governance or averting a national catastrophe.  The media is coaxed, cajoled, or coerced into pliant submission; segments of the intelligentsia and civil society are brought on board by the lure of lucre and plush appointments; the independence of the judiciary is diluted and compromised. Dissenting voices and conscientious objectors are singled out, vilified and ostracized by a baying mob which supports the populist leader to the hilt. The progressive dumbing down of the populace is accompanied by an exponential decay in the civil and democratic rights of the citizens and the journey to dystopia has started in earnest. Look no farther than the Third Reich, under Adolf Hitler, for corroboration of this denouement. At the dawn of the twenty-first century, Orwell's dark musings of an undesirable future appears eerily prophetic in an era of nihilism, anarchism, sectarianism, racism, casteism, ethnocentrism, bigotism, religious radicalism, corporatism, majoritarianism, populism, nativism, protectionism, hyper nationalism, and unilateralism. The prevalent mood of cynicism stands in stark contrast to the brief period of heady optimism following the end of the Cold War, courtesy of the implosion and spectacular collapse of the mighty monolith called the Soviet Union. A false dawn It was erroneously believed that the \"benign\" forces of free market capitalism, rules-based free trade-centric globalization, western style liberal democracy, and technological advancement, under the aegis of Pax Americana, would usher in an era of unrivaled peace and prosperity for all humanity and make the world a truly global village. Yet, within a brief span of three decades, it increasingly seems to be a false dawn. The global hegemon, instead of displaying robust leadership, has been assailed by self-inflicted contradictions. The lone superpower of the world, the United States of America, rallies to the chant of \"Make America Great Again\" which in itself is problematic as it shows a loss of confidence and serious self-doubt in its manifest destiny. The locomotive of global growth in the world seems unduly perturbed by the rise of China, which in essence is an upper-middle-income country, whose per capita income is still only about a quarter of that of high-income countries. The country that invented the global trade order, WTO, and championed free trade, now is trigger-happy at lashing punitive tariffs and starting bruising trade wars with trusted partners and allies; not to mention, renegotiating trade agreements and distancing itself from multilateral institutions and initiatives.  A country founded by immigrants wanting to escape the ravages of a sectarian, war-weary old world now talks of fencing its borders; a country possessing the mightiest military in recorded history wastes time, energy, and resources picking up a fight with Iran, which by all accounts is a regional power at best in the Middle East (ranking way behind Israel and Turkey); a country which boasts of technological behemoths like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, and is still a magnet for the best and brightest in the world, worries about losing its competitive edge to rivals; a country which has a proud and long-running democratic tradition loudly champions petty dictators and autocrats.  The United States of America was supposed to be a shining beacon of hope for the rest of the world to admire and emulate. Yet, it has become subsumed with angst, torpor, and inherent self contradictions. The only country limiting the US's boundless potential is the US itself. A lot has been written and speculated about the most powerful man in the world by virtue of being the elected leader of the lone superpower. President Donald Trump basically exhibits the traits of a dyed-in-the-wool third-world demagogic populist leader which includes his penchant for indulging in diplomacy by Twitter; reliance on transactional diplomacy; belittling heads of states of allies; intolerance towards criticism (a genuine South Asian trait); dismissing unflattering reports and coverage as fake news; engaging in perilous brinkmanship with puny regional rivals; a constant showman's urge to steal the thunder and be in the spotlight; the desire to be surrounded by \"yes men\" and sycophants; the overt reliance on immediate family members for state-related affairs; the politically incorrect statements and lack of diplomatic finesse; the penchant for vitriolic statements and stoking of sectarian divide; the impatience with nuanced, multifaceted arguments and complex reasoning; the tendency to run roughshod over bipartisanship and common consensus. Yet, it is an incontrovertible fact that he retains the fervent support of large swathes of decent, ordinary Americans who feel cheated by the system at Capitol Hill and are disenchanted with the status quo; who are struggling to make ends meet; whose livelihoods are threatened by outsourcing, rash of cheap imports, and automation and lopsided trade agreements; flood of unskilled and semi-skilled immigrant workers who take up the bulk of blue collar jobs; ballooning cost of health care and education; tired with America's never-ending engagement in military conflicts in remote corners of the globe and the funds that flow out of taxpayers' money to shore up tottering regimes.  It would be a disservice to dismiss Trump as merely a populist leader. He has, by the perfect sleight of hand (despite being a privileged insider), posed as an outsider, to arrive at the epicentre of power -- skillfully playing to the anxiety and fears of the ordinary Caucasian American. Lessons from Ancient Rome America has been long compared to the other superpower of yesteryears, Ancient Rome. Indeed, the Founding Fathers had been keen students of the Roman Republic and drew inspiration from it to devise a host of checks and balances and separation of power between the executive, legislative, and the judiciary.  The decline and fall of the Roman Empire is keenly studied by American scholars and strategists to draw lessons from, in order to avert a similar fate for American global hegemony. Hence, it is not surprising that Trump's ascent to power and mannerisms have often been compared to eccentric and notorious Roman emperors.  Case in point, he has been compared to the infamous second emperor of Rome, Caligula, who loved to put on a spectacle, reveled in insulting and humiliating people, and treated the then elites, the senatorial class, like dirt. He despised traditional Roman values and practices and wanted to mold Rome in his own image. Yet he was wildly popular with the ordinary Romans, who were grateful for the games and circuses that Caligula lavishly funded at his own expense. Caligula had the unstinting support of the Roman mob till his last day before his assassination.   On the other hand, supporters of Trump could compare him to the legendary Gracchi brothers, during the Roman Republic era, who, despite being born in a wealthy aristocratic family, went into collision course with the elites who ruled Rome. By taking on the side of the urban poor masses of Rome -- the plebeians -- they swept to power and enacted sweeping land and other economic reforms (which in today's parlance could be called pro-poor).  Both brothers ended up being killed by a vengeful elite, resentful at its loss of power. However, that set in a chain of instability and violence, which sounded the death knell of the Republic and paved the way for autocratic control. Which emperor Trump resembles is a matter of debate amongst classicists and historians. However, one thing is certain: America will not be the same after Trump. Trump joins a spate of maverick leaders who have had a brush with populism, who draw strength from polarization and divisiveness and are considered as a threat to the established political order, yet cannot be beaten outright in elections -- Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Narendra Modi of India, Rodrigo Duterte of Philippines, Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom and, to a certain extent, Vladimir Putin of Russia (who is more of a nationalist leader, emulating the footsteps of past Russian Tsars and Tsarinas such as Peter the Great and Catherine the Great). All of these leaders can be considered as Novus Homo in the political arena who have upset the apple cart and jettisoned the existing power brokers, and are seen as an embodiment of the voices of the overlooked, neglected, and marginalized stratum of the population. In a desire to get rid of sheer lawlessness, endemic corruption, and weak  governance, they have reposed their trust in these leaders.  Often, religious revivalism has gone hand in hand with populism to raise these leaders to the crest of popularity and mass adulation. The common man has derived vicarious pleasure as these leaders have proceeded to displace the effete elite and the chattering classes to ignominious oblivion. Populism thus can be seen as the revenge of the masses against the elite and the intelligentsia and is often viewed as an anti-intellectual, revisionist movement.  Inevitably, there have been accusations of derailment and displacement of democratic practices and concomitant increase in authoritarianism. Europe, too, is brimming with populist leaders such as Marine Le Pen of France, Viktor Orban of Poland, Matteo Salvini of Italy, and Geert Wilders of Netherlands, to name a few. It is feared that the wave of populism may have a cascading effect on other countries with dysfunctional democracies and weak institutions.  A long history However, contrary to popular perception, populism and its inherent dangers is not a new phenomenon. It too has a long history. Ancient Athens has been hailed as the birthplace of western democracy. In fact, the very word democracy is derived from the Greek demokratia (popular government) combining demos (common people) and kratos (rule or strength). The Ancient Athenians were among the handful few, who pioneered directly representative government based on free male citizen suffrage, two and a half millennia back.  However, the system was not truly democratic as it excluded women and slaves. It was also vulnerable to the threat of demagogues (yet another Greek term) who adroitly manipulated the emotions of the mob. Socrates, the father of Western philosophy was highly skeptical of the benefits of democracy and wary of the danger of demagogues usurping power through popular support.  Socrates asserted that voting in an election required skill, rational thinking, and prior education and should not be based on intuition and emotion. He routinely attacked the democratic government of the day and eventually paid a steep price for it as he was sentenced to death in 399 BCE for disturbing the peace and corrupting the impressionable youth of the city state.  No wonder, that his most famous disciple, Plato, looked down on democracy with barely concealed contempt and envisaged an ideal state as run by a philosopher king who would be aided by a select handful of elites. Athenian experiment with democracy soon petered out due to bitter infighting and foreign Macedonian occupation. Republican Rome was determined to resist the rule of autocratic tyrants and kings. Yet the late republic's history was a violent and chequered one as it was marked by increasing conflict between different factions vying for control of the most powerful city in the world, with mob support. Populist leaders like Tiberius Gracchus and Gaius Gracchus (the Gracchi brothers), Clodius Pulcher, Lucius Cataline, and even the great Julius Caesar all chose to entice the Roman mob with promises of land redistribution, the waiving off of debt, and provision of free bread, circus, and games.  Wave after wave of populist leaders bred conflict and civil war and irreparably damaged the republican institutions of Rome. It was with weary resignation that Republican Rome voluntarily transitioned to Imperial Rome, under the rule of Augustus in 27 BCE. The intellectual raison d'etre behind the enduring appeal of populism, despite the inherent dangers of chaos and dystopia, can partially be found in the works of Thomas Carlyle, Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, and Max Weber. Carlyle, a nineteenth century British polymath, in his collection of lectures, later published as On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and The Heroic in History, he famously stated that the world's history is nothing more than a collection of biographies belonging to great men.  He posited that great leaders throughout history were destined to lead and deserved to do so because of their inherent abilities. This in effect reduced the surrounding institutions and structures to little or no import. Great leaders arose at a time of great need, when the society or nation was facing a grave existential crisis. This laid the modern foundation for the Cult of Personality and the Messiah Complex.  Then there is the German philosopher, Nietzsche, who had the most outsized influence in history with his concept of the Ubermensch or Overman/Superman that he introduced and fleshed upon in his seminal work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra. An Overman is one who is able to influence and affect history indefinitely. He is one who is willing to risk all for the sake of upliftment and enhancement of humanity. An Overman does not shy away from creating and propagating his own values, independent from the rest of humanity who are prone to follow herd-instinct.  One of Nietzsche's claim to infamy is that his works influenced later day Anarchist movement and Nazism. (Hitler greatly admired his work and fancied himself as an Ubermensch). Max Weber, a German sociologist and political economist, introduced his concept of charismatic authority in the Essay, \"The Three Types of Legitimate Rule.\" The charismatic leadership style relies on the charm and persuasiveness of the leader. Charismatic leaders are driven by their convictions and commitment to their cause. Charismatic leadership, according to Weber, is found in a leader with extraordinary characteristics of individual, whose mission and vision inspire others. All the three theories have a common thread running through them -- that of a larger than life figure, who is capable of exerting great influence on the society and reshaping history. Despite the criticisms, these theories are able to explain somewhat the hypnotic appeal of populist leaders in a post-modern age of mechanization, standardization, regulation, automation, virtual reality, and low sense of self-worth and absence of clear direction.  In a time of uncertainty and confusion, people flock to leaders with firm opinions and explicitly stated convictions who do not shy away from being politically incorrect or scapegoating a minority for the ills that afflict them. The peril of dystopia is ignored for the warm comfort of firm, decisive leadership.  Ibn Khaldun, the brilliant medieval Arab scholar, believed that history repeated itself in a cyclical manner. If so then the experiment with Western style liberal democracy may have run out of steam and the age of populist dystopia may have begun. Only time will tell.

In Noakhali, a Chhatra League leader died of bullet wounds,  injured in an ambush by suspected Islami Chhatra Shibir activists at Palwaner Pool market in Begumganj upazila. The deceased Rakib Hossain was a joint secretary of Chhatra League's Amanullapur union unit. He died under treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). Police conducted a drive on Sunday night shortly after the incident and detained four people, said Begumganj police station OC Harun-Or-Rashid Chowdhury. The detained Faruk Ahmmad, 42, Masud Alam, 30,  Akram Hossain, 24, and Ibrahim, 30, were produced in court on Monday afternoon.  Police are trying to arrest the others involved and a case will be filed soon, said OC Harun. \"Some Chhatra League men were staying at a tea stall when Shibir activists shot and hacked at them indiscriminately. Rakib and Habib were transferred to hospitals in Dhaka when their condition deteriorated after the incident. Rakib had to undergo surgery as bullets penetrated his kidney, liver, and stomach. Habib is currently receiving treatment at a private hospital in Dhaka,\" said Union Parishad Chairman Arifur Rahman, also president of Awami League's Amanullahpur unit.  Three other Chhatra League members were also injured, hacked with sharp weapons. In Khulna, another injured Chhatra League leader died after being severely beaten by a rival group over establishing supremacy.  The deceased Hadiuzzaman Russel, 28, was general secretary of Chhatra League's Koyra Upazila unit. Koyra police station OC Robiul Islam said: \"A dispute arose between Russel and his cousins on Sunday afternoon, over the positioning of an under construction bridge across Batikata canal. Russel was mercilessly beaten by his cousins following the altercation. The incident left him seriously injured.\" Russel succumbed to his injuries on the way to Dhaka while being transferred from Khulna Medical College Hospital, added the OC. Locals said there was a long standing feud between Russel and his cousins over establishing supremacy in the area."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-29 00:00:00      \nThe deal has been signed by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar The United States signed a deal with Taliban insurgents on Saturday that could pave the way toward a full withdrawal of foreign soldiers from Afghanistan and represent a step toward ending the 18-year-war in the nation. But while the agreement creates a path for the United States to gradually pull out of its longest war, many expect the talks to come between the Afghan sides may be much more complicated. The deal was signed in the Qatari capital Doha by US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on hand to witness the ceremony. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper called the accord a good step but just the beginning. \"Achieving lasting peace in Afghanistan will require patience and compromise among all parties,\" said Esper, who met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in Kabul where they announced a joint declaration in parallel to the US-Taliban accord. The United States said it is committed to reducing the number of its troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 - from the current 13,000 - within 135 days of signing the deal, and working with its allies to proportionally reduce the number of coalition forces in Afghanistan over that period, if the Taliban adhere to their commitments. A full withdrawal of all US and coalition forces would occur within 14 months of the deal getting signed, if the Taliban hold up their end of the deal, the joint statement said. \"We are working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home,\" said US President Donald Trump in a White House statement. The accord represents a chance to make good on a longstanding promise to get troops out, as he seeks re-election in November. But security experts have also called it a foreign policy gamble that would give the Taliban international legitimacy. Ghani said he hoped the Doha deal paves the way towards lasting peace, telling a news conference in Kabul: \"The nation is looking forward to a full ceasefire.\"  The Afghan government said it stood ready to negotiate and conclude a ceasefire with the Taliban, and it affirmed its support for the phased withdrawal of US and coalition forces subject to the Taliban's fulfilment of its commitments. It also said that it remained committed to preventing militant groups from using its soil to threaten the security of the United States, its allies and other countries. Separately, Nato pledged to adjust the coalition troop levels in the first phase too, bringing down Nato's numbers to about 12,000 from roughly 16,000 troops at present. \"We went in together in 2001, we are going to adjust (troop levels) together and when the time is right, we are going to leave together, but we are only going to leave when conditions are right,\" Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who was in Kabul on Saturday, told reporters. Today is a monumental day for Afghanistan. \".. it is about making peace & crafting a common brighter future.\" We stand with #Afghanistan. #AfghanPeaceProcess https://t.co/eoP0xftZaa Hope for an end to bloodshed Hours before the deal, the Taliban ordered all its fighters in Afghanistan \"to refrain from any kind of attack for the happiness of the nation.\" \"The biggest thing is that we hope the US remain committed to their promises during the negotiation and peace deal,\" said Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline Islamist group. For millions of Afghans, the deal represents some hope for an end to years of bloodshed. \"Peace is extremely simple and my country deserves it. Today is the day when maybe we will see a positive change,\" said Javed Hassan, 38, a school teacher living on the outskirts of Afghan capital, Kabul. Hassan's children were killed in a bomb blast carried out by the Taliban in 2018. Since then, he has been writing letters to world leaders urging them to end the Afghan war."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-18 00:00:00      \nHundreds of thousands of Muslim devotees braved a cold spell to take part in the final prayers on the banks of the Turag in Gazipur's Tongi on Saturday The 55th edition of Bishwa Ijtema is expected to end with the second phase's Akheri Munajat or final prayer on Sunday on the banks of the river Turag at Tongi. Hundreds of thousands of Muslim devotees braved a cold spell to take part in the final prayers on the banks of the Turag in Gazipur's Tongi on Saturday, amid heightened security measures. On the second day of the first phase's Ijtema, the second largest congregation of the Muslim community after Hajj, Islamic scholars delivered sermons on different aspects of Islam in the light of the holy Quran and Hadith on Sunday. The Muslim devotees have thronged the Ijtema ground under the open sky while more than 1,500 foreign devotees from 35 countries, including from Jordan, Libya, Africa, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Palestine, the USA, Turkey, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, India, Pakistan, England, joined the Ijtema from the first day of the second phase. People from all corners of the country started streaming into Tongi since Saturday evening to join the Akheri Munajat. Many made the journey to the venue on foot as a large part of Dhaka Mymensingh Highway was closed to traffic. Md Anwar Hossain, commissioner of Gazipur Metropolitan Police, said the plying buses will remain closed on Dhaka-Mymensingh highway from Gazipur Chowrasta intersection to Mohakhali in the capital from 4am for smooth movement of the devotees. Buses from northern districts will remain halted at Konabari in Gazipur while all link roads towards Tongi will be closed during the Akheri Munajat, he added. Besides, around 8,500 members of law enforcement agencies have been deployed for ensuring security in and around the Ijtema ground. Four more Muslim devotees have died at the Bishaw Ijtema venue in Friday, January 17. The total death tolls of the devotees in the 55th Bishwa Ijtema stood at 5 so far, , including 13 in the first phase. They passed away in their respective tents between Friday morning and Saturday evening, said Md Manjur Rahman, deputy commissioner of Gazipur Metropolitan Police. Bangladesh Railway (BR) has scheduled special trains for easy transportation of devotees on the occasion of the first and second phase of 55th Biswa Ijtema. Earlier, the first phase of the Ijtema was held on January 10 to 12 at the same venue. Followers of Moulana Zubair joined the first phase of Ijtema while the second phase is alloted to the disciples of Moulana Mohammed Saad Kandhalvi, a Delhi-based member of the Tabligh Jamaat Supreme Council. Tablig Jamaat has been organizing the Biswa Ijtema on the bank of Turag river since 1967. Now, Ijtema is being held in two phases since 2011 to ease the accommodation problem."

Acres of low-lying areas of several villages, fish enclosures, and streets became waterlogged as the flood embankments were destroyed by the storm on Wednesday night, said Sharankhola UNO Sarder Mostafa Shahin.  More than 500 fish enclosures were submerged, locals said, and they fear an untimely flood through the damaged embankments due to the high tidal waves.   The villagers are seeking prompt action from the authority and in this situation, they demanded its immediate mending. Contacted, Md Nahiduzzaman Khan, executive engineer of Bagerhat Water Development Board, said, \"We are preparing to install ring dams where the embankment was harmed,\"  The upazila administration has already been directed to assess the losses following Amphan and it will soon be notified, said Bagerhat District Administrator Mamunur Rashid."

Weinstein, 68, is already in prison in New York state after being sentenced to 23 years in jail for rape and sexual assault. The new charge of \"sexual battery by restraint\" will form part of a separate trial he faces in Los Angeles over allegations he assaulted multiple women in local hotels, with extradition proceedings under way. \"We are continuing to build and strengthen our case,\" said Los Angeles prosecutor Jackie Lacey. \"If we find new evidence of a previously unreported crime, as we did here, we will investigate and determine whether additional criminal charges should be filed,\" she added. The new charge alleges Weinstein sexually assaulted an unnamed woman in Beverly Hills in May 2010 -- just within the 10-year statute of limitations.  He has already been charged with the rape and sexual assault of two other women on consecutive nights in 2013.  Two additional Los Angeles cases against Weinstein are no longer being pursued as those accusers did not want to testify. It is not known when the trial will begin, but Los Angeles prosecutors confirmed Friday they have initiated a request for Weinstein's transfer. \"Upon his arrival, he will be arraigned on the amended complaint. Once a court date is set, the public will be notified,\" a statement read. If convicted in all the California cases, Weinstein could face an additional 29-year prison sentence. For decades a towering figure in Hollywood whom Meryl Streep famously called \"God,\" the \"Pulp Fiction\" producer was expelled from the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences that awarded his films several Oscars after a flood of accusations broke. Tinseltown A-listers Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek were among nearly 90 women to have come forward alleging decades of vile predatory behaviour by Weinstein. Weinstein has repeatedly denied wrongdoing."

The girl was abducted to a tea garden and raped by three men Friday night. Police arrested Koilash Doshad, 25, and Jaharlal Mridha, 29, who are guards at the Bharaura Tea Garden in the upazila. A case was filed in this regard and the girl was admitted to Moulvibazar Sadar Hospital for medical attention, said Sreemangal police station Inspector Md Sohel Rana. According to the case statement, an auto-rickshaw driver along with two accomplices abducted the girl from near a mass burial site located at Sreemangal town. They took her the Bharaura Tea Garden and raped her there before releasing her.  The prime accused auto-rickshaw driver is on the run, said the inspector. Girl held captive, raped for 18 months A 19-year-old girl was held captive for 18 months in Bishwanath upazila of Sylhet, during which she was raped by a village doctor (Kabiraj) with help of his wife, police say. Police arrested Md Komruddin, 50, and his wife Sumi Begum, 38, being accused in a case filed by the girl's mother. Bishwanath police station OC Shamim Musa said they will seek a five-day remand from court today in order to interrogate the couple. According to the girl's parents, the girl was handed over to the care of Md Komruddin in August, 2018 so that he may treat her various illnesses. They paid him Tk10,000 for his services.  However, according to the agreement Komruddin did not return their daughter after six months and threatened their parents to stay silent on the matter. On Thursday, they decided to file a case with the Bishwanath police station."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-04 00:00:00      \nThe crisis is so severe that the government has declared a nationwide emergency and urgently appealed for help from the international community Pakistan's farmers are struggling to combat the worst locust plague in nearly three decades as insect swarms decimate entire harvests in the country's agricultural heartlands and send food prices soaring. Heavy rains and cyclones sparked \"unprecedented\" breeding and the explosive growth of locust populations on the Arabian peninsula early last year, according to the United Nations. The insects have since fanned out and wreaked havoc on farms from East Africa to India before making their way into Pakistan from the desert on the country's southwestern border with Iran.  The crisis is so severe that the government has declared a nationwide emergency and urgently appealed for help from the international community.  Officials in southern Sindh province fear the infestation will devastate the supply of cotton, the local cash crop, ahead of its harvest in the coming months.  Local surveys of the damage are continuing, but the Sindh Chamber of Agriculture says nearly half of all crops have been destroyed near the port city of Karachi. \"I have not seen an infestation like this one in my career,\" said Shehbaz Akhtar, an agricultural official charged with locust eradication efforts in the village of Pipli Pahar in central Punjab province. 'Combat operation' Local authorities had \"launched a combat operation\" to clear the area of infestation with pesticide sprays, he said.  Clouds of the noxious gas envelop the nearby fields each morning, where villagers gather the husks of dead insects for an official bounty of Rs20 rupees per kg bag. \"We spray twice a day here,\" says Fayyaz Azeem, clad in a face mask and thick industrial gloves on top of a tractor discharging pesticide into rows of crops. But the process is slow and time-consuming, and by the time locusts are killed off in one field they have often already destroyed the next. The pesticides used by officials are also dangerous for consumption, so even when the locusts are dead the remaining crops have to be discarded. Some farmers have been forced to opt for more desperate solutions while waiting for their fields to be sprayed and have attempted to scare off the swarms by shouting and banging pots.  A team of Chinese experts has arrived in Pakistan to survey the crisis, food security ministry chief Muhammad Hashim Popalzai told AFP. Beijing could also offer aerial spraying - a much faster and more efficient method of pest control - and Pakistan may also import pesticides from China. Earlier reports circulating online suggested China was planning to send thousands of ducks to Pakistan to devour the scourge. Pakistani officials said no such plans were being considered. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has also set up meetings between India and Pakistan to prevent the swarms from spreading, Popalzai said. 'What can I do?' Agriculture accounts for 20% of Pakistan's GDP but the sector has already struggled for years in the face of drought and dwindling water supplies. The country is also experiencing 12-year inflation highs, with the cost of sugar nearly doubling and flour prices jumping 15% in the past year. Years without a locust attack meant the government \"had become complacent\" about the risks of a new infestation, said Pakistan Farmers Bureau president Zafar Hayyat. Though he applauded the steps being taken to fight the plague, Hayyat warned of the risk that swarms would return mid-year after the next locust breeding season.  For many farmers in Pipli Pahar, the extermination campaign has already come too late.  Sitting in the corner of a wheat field with her cow, Rafiya Bibi watches the flurry of pesticide spraying around her.  The locusts have already destroyed her crops of canola, sunflower, chili and tobacco, which she had bought after borrowing 45,000 rupees from the government. With no harvest, she has no way to repay the loan."

      "authors": "AFP",
      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-28 00:00:00      \nDozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment At least 33 Turkish soldiers were killed as violence escalates in Syria's Idlib province after an air strike blamed on Damascus, with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemning \"indiscriminate\" attacks by the Assad regime and Russia. Dozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment, Rahmi Dogan, governor of Turkish Hatay -- bordering Syria -- said Friday. The heavy losses in northwestern Idlib come after weeks of growing tensions between rebel supporter Ankara and Damascus ally Moscow. Stoltenberg \"urged all parties to de-escalate this dangerous situation and avoid further worsening of the horrendous humanitarian situation in the region\", his spokesman said Friday. In a phone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the NATO secretary general \"condemned the continued indiscriminate air strikes by the Syrian regime and its backer Russia in Idlib province\", according to the spokesman. Turkey has urged the Syrian regime to withdraw from Turkish observation posts in Idlib, while Moscow has accused Ankara of aiding \"terrorists\" in Syria. Under a 2018 deal with Russia meant to bring calm to Idlib, Turkey has 12 observation posts in the region -- but several have come under fire from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hastily convened an emergency meeting in Ankara after the Idlib attack. Erdogan's top press aide, Fahrettin Altun, said Turkey's military retaliated against all known positions of the regime after the air strike. In a statement, Altun called on the international community to fulfil its responsibilities to end the violence in Idlib and the regime's \"crimes against humanity\". The latest attack means 53 Turkish security personnel have been killed in the province this month. There was a flurry of diplomatic activity as Turkey's presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin spoke with US national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, state news agency Anadolu reported without giving detail. More civilians killed  Jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels on Thursday re-entered Saraqeb, a key Idlib crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government's devastating offensive. The counteroffensive could, however, be short-lived as Russian-backed Syrian troops continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities. Seven civilians, including three children, were killed in regime and Russian bombardment of Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December. The UN Security Council, where Moscow has systematically vetoed truce initiatives, met again Thursday amid growing concern Idlib is witnessing the nine-year-old war's worst humanitarian emergency. State news agency SANA acknowledged there were \"fierce clashes\" between the army and \"terrorist groups on the Saraqeb front\".  An AFP correspondent accompanied the rebels into Saraqeb, where he found a ghost town of bombed out buildings. The counterattack temporarily reverses one of the key gains of the government since its offensive against the country's last rebel enclave in December. Refugee fears  The cash-strapped government had been keen to fully secure the M5, a highway that connects Syria's four main cities and passes through Saraqeb. The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes were carried out by Assad government ally Russia, heavily criticised by the West for the high civilian death toll from its bombing campaign. State media accused the \"terrorists\" of launching car bombings and other suicide attacks against government forces attempting to retake the town. It said the army had inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, despite the military support it said they had received from Turkey. Some 950,0000 civilians have fled the government offensive, raising fears in Ankara of a new influx of refugees. Turkey already hosts the world's largest number of Syrian refugees -- around 3.6 million people -- placing an increasingly unpopular burden on public services. The country's ruling party spokesman Omer Celik told CNN Turk broadcaster Friday Ankara was not in a position to \"hold\" refugees any longer and called on the European Union to do more. More than half a million of those displaced since December are children, tens of thousands of whom are sleeping rough in northern Syria's harsh winter. UN powerlessness The Turkish president vowed Wednesday Ankara would not take the \"smallest step back\" in the standoff with Damascus and Moscow over Idlib. Erdogan warned the Syrian government to \"stop its attacks as soon as possible\" and to pull back by the end of the month. The UN has repeatedly warned the fighting in Idlib could potentially create the most serious humanitarian crisis since the civil war's start in 2011. Nine out of 15 members of the Security Council on Wednesday urged Secretary General Antonio Guterres to step up his involvement in efforts to restore peace in Idlib. Russian vetoes, often backed by China, have chronically crippled UN action in Syria."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-01-18 00:00:00      \nHe knew the value of a peaceful environment Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was released from his internment in Pakistan in the first week of January 1972 and eventually returned to Dhaka, the capital of independent Bangladesh, amidst a rapturous welcome on January 10, 1972. On the way he stopped over in London and New Delhi. It was his commitment and his vision that enabled him to safely guide our ship through troubled waters amidst a devastated post-war scenario. It was his significant contribution that facilitated our growth towards democracy and institution building. Bangabandhu's magnanimity and belief in the people of Bangladesh was reflected in his optimism. It was also this spirit that would inspire him to face up to the many difficulties that he would have to overcome in the coming months -- arranging relief and rehabilitation for the more than 10 million Bangladeshis who had sought refuge in India during the war in 1971, restoring economic activity, infrastructural connectivity, agricultural process, educational institutional facilities and health care. It was a daunting task but handled efficiently by Bangabandhu and his team in cooperation with the United Nations. A statesman and gifted orator, Bangabandhu in his speech on January 10, 1972 at Suhrawardy Uddyan was masterly in his advice for the victorious people of Bangladesh. At this first opportunity, he warned that none should \"raise\" their \"hands to strike against non-Bangalis.\" At the same time, he displayed his concern for the safety of the \"four hundred thousand Bangalis stranded in Pakistan.\"  There was a nuanced connotation in his approach to the problem. This eventually assisted in the safe repatriation to Bangladesh of the unfortunate Bangalis who were stranded in different internment camps in Pakistan. While re-affirming that he harboured no \"ill-will\" for the Pakistanis, he also pointed out that \"those who have unjustly killed our people and assisted in this crime will surely be tried.\" Later, on April 17, 1973, after the completion of investigations into the crimes committed by the Pakistan occupation forces and their auxiliaries, it was decided to try 195 persons for serious crimes, which included genocide, war crimes, breach of Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, murder, rape, and arson.  It was also decided that the trials of such persons and others associated in planning and executing such crimes would be held in accordance with universally recognized judicial norms. This argument and the related judicial process were to be central till his murder in August 1975. Unfortunately, his death also resulted in the setting aside of the entire judicial process. Fortunately, under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the trial process has been activated and is being completed. Subsequently, Bangabandhu did not hesitate to exhibit his and Bangladesh's closeness and support for Islam, Arab countries, and the OIC during the 1973 war between Egypt and Israel. His personal initiative resulted in the dispatch of a Bangladeshi Army Medical team and cartons of Bangladeshi tea for Egypt and Syria.  This was greatly appreciated by members of the OIC and resulted in Bangladesh being invited to be a member of the OIC during its Summit meeting in Lahore in February, 1974. Bangabandhu believed in the sovereign equality of all nations and laid particular stress on the promotion of close cooperation with India in the fields of development and trade \"on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.\" He also believed in development and utilization of resources \"for the benefit of the people of the region.\"  It was this approach that led him eventually to persuade India to agree to the establishment of a Joint Rivers Commission comprising of experts from both countries \"to carry out a comprehensive survey of the rivers systems shared by the two countries and to formulate projects concerning both the countries in the fields of flood control and then to implement them.\" Consistent with this principle of brotherly relations, Bangabandhu signed the historic \"Land Boundary Agreement (LBA)\" with the then Indian Premier Indira Gandhi on May 16 in 1974 to settle the land boundary dispute between the neighbours. Bangladesh quickly ratified the agreement that year but India failed to do so. Indian Parliament however took 41 years to subsequently unanimously pass the LBA on May 7, 2015 -- thanks to the persuasion of Sheikh Hasina. Bangabandhu's persistent interest in foreign policy eventually led to Bangladesh being recognized as an independent state by nearly 120 countries within three and half years. In addition, Bangladesh also secured the membership of the UN, the Commonwealth, OIC, the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and some other international bodies. Like Bangabandhu, who was conferred with the \"Joliot Curie Award\" in 1973, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has also received recognition through numerous awards bestowed on her by international agencies for her government's socio-economic achievements that has helped to reduce poverty, create higher functional literacy, better health care, induce gender empowerment and facilitate accountability -- so important for good governance. We are now also on the way towards meeting the requirements pertaining to SDG goals. Through these achievements, during this important year of 2020, when we are observing the special centennial anniversary of the birth of Bangabandhu, Sheikh Hasina has proven that Bangabandhu was correct when he stated: \"Only a peaceful environment can enable us to enjoy the fruits of the hard-earned national independence and gather all our strength and resources to fight poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, and unemployment.\" Muhammad Zamir is a former ambassador and an analyst specialized in foreign affairs, right to information and good governance.

Badargonj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Nabirul Islam confirmed the matter to Dhaka Tribune around 8: 30pm on Wednesday. The 30-year old man, who returned from Malaysia to the upazila recently, went to Narayanganj where he stayed for one month. Few days ago, he came back from Narayanganj and started suffering from fever, cough, and respiratory problems, prompting health authorities to collect samples. They were later sent to Rangpur Medical College Hospital for testing.  On Wednesday, his reports came back positive, said UNO Nabirul Islam. The UNO also added that 10 houses around the patient's residence and a residential quarter of Badargonj Upazila Health Complex, where his brother lives, were put under lockdown. With this, Rangpur reported three Covid-19 cases so far, according to health authorities. "

Carrying placards demanding stoppage of the illegal tree felling and hill razing, students formed the human chain in front of the Shahid Minar. Later, they brought out a rally and paraded around the campus. Protesting students said Chittagong University is known for its panoramic beauty surrounded by hills and forests. But some unethical businessmen are cutting down trees and razing hills for transportation. \"From now, students will intercept the vehicles laden with felled trees,\" said Ritu Roy of Institute of Forestry and Environmental Science. The students gave an ultimatum of a month to the university authority and if their demands are not met within, they will increase their movement to save the campus, they said. The students also submitted a memorandum with a seven-point demand to the Proctor of the university demanding punishment for the responsible people who are behind this crime. Meanwhile, a two-member team from Department of Environment (DoE) visited the campus and found evidence of felling trees. Based on the evidence, the DoE served a show-cause notice to the Estate Department and Security Department of the university, timber traders Md Hanif and Md Bazlu. According to a media report, more 7,000 trees have been felled in the last four years on the campus. "

It lashed the West Bengal-Bangladesh coastline on Wednesday evening and prevailed till the early hours of Thursday. Hundreds and thousands have been displaced, homes destroyed, trees uprooted, embankments smashed, electricity and telephone lines, dykes and croplands damaged, and numerous villages inundated by the cyclone's tidal surges. The government has estimated the damage from cyclone Amphan is to the tune of Tk1,100 crore with some 26 districts hit, said State Minister for Disaster Management, Enamur Rahman.  Some 1,100 kilometres of roads, and 200 bridges and culverts under local government have been damaged, said official sources. The Water Development Board reported that 150 kilometres of embankments were seriously damaged while another 84 dams developed cracks,\" state minister said. 3,000 electric poles damaged in south-western regions  Three thousand electric poles of the power division have sustained damage in the southwestern regions of Bangladesh, where cyclone Amphan first made contact, said West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited (WZPDC) Managing Director, Engineer Shafiq Uddin.  \"We will start repair work as soon as possible,\" he added. WZPDC Executive Director Engineer Abu Hasan said: \"Two transformers of the Kushtia power grid short circuited around 10pm on Wednesday, cutting power to the district. The electricity supply remained suspended till Thursday. We are trying to tap into the closest alternative source to supply Kushtia with electricity.\"  Engineer Altaf Hossain, senior general manager of Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board, Khulna, said: \"A total of 316,000 customers lost electricity in eight upazilas of the district. We have 600 workers on the ground who will start repair work as soon as possible.\" 70km embankment damaged in Khulna Seventy kilometres of the 121km embankment that was built to protect Khulna from typhoons and cyclones, have been either completely or partially damaged.  Palash Kumar Banarjee, executive engineer for the water development board, Khulna-2, said: \"10km of the embankment completely collapsed, while 60km of the embankment are partially damaged.\"  As a result, low lying unions are completely submerged in saline water, putting thousands of people in jeopardy, he added. Mostajibul Hoque, an affected local of Koyra upazila, said: \"Since Aila last wreaked havoc on the embankments, the WDB hasn't been able to repair the damage completely in the last decade. Without a sustainable embankment, lives will always be at risk.\"  Khulna 6 MP, Akhtaruzzaman Babu, said: \"Koyra upazila was severely affected and inundated when 10km of the 121km-long embankment collapsed. Another 40km of the embankment were partially damaged as well. Approximately Tk50 crore worth of fish was washed away in the flood.\" Satkhira farmers count crores in losses   Satkhira farmers have suffered huge losses in crops and fish as the cyclone levelled fields and tidal surges flooded fish enclosures. Satkhira Deputy Commissioner SM Mostafa Kamal held a press briefing on the loss to lives and property in the district. He said: \"As many as 12,257 fish enclosures and ponds on 13,477 hectares in 12 unions of seven upazilas have been flooded. Fish, including 1,677 tons of whitefish and 2,531 tons of shrimp, worth over approximately Tk176 crore, was washed away.  Also, approximately Tk137 crore of crops, fruits and vegetables on over 5,000 hectares was also lost in the district, he added. 1,500 shrimp enclosures flooded in Mongla  1500 shrimp enclosures have been flooded by recent tidal surges in Mongla of Bagerhat. Also, 125 homes were completely damaged and 325 homes partially damaged, while numerous trees were uprooted.  Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Rahat Mannan said: \"Risky embankments in Kanainagar, Kalatala, and Sundartala have collapsed, flooding many houses and fish enclosures.\" Magura suffers Tk100crore in damage It is initially estimated that cyclone Amphan has caused a total damage of over Tk100 crore in loss of homes, domestic animals, and crops. Magura Deputy Commissioner Dr Ashraful Alam said: \"Cyclone Amphan has caused huge losses in the district which is yet to be calculated accurately. But we estimate it is over Tk100 crore.\"  "

Men, women and children belonging to the stateless and long-persecuted Muslim minority were among nearly 25,000 prisoners freed last week by a presidential pardon to mark the country's April New Year celebrations. A Navy vessel transported the group from Yangon to western Rakhine state, where most Rohingya live under tight movement restrictions and in conditions Amnesty International has condemned as \"apartheid.\" More than 600 disembarked near state capital Sittwe, while another 200 were taken further north to townships on the border with Bangladesh, state immigration department chief Soe Lwin told AFP. \"They will be quarantined,\" he added, without giving further details. Myanmar's biggest prisoner release in years came as coronavirus fears gripped the country, with calls for low-risk inmates to be released from what Human Rights Watch describes as Myanmar's \"horribly overcrowded and unsanitary\" jails. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that prison populations are particularly vulnerable to the spread of the disease. Myanmar has only 111 confirmed Covid-19 cases but experts fear the real number is many times higher because of the low numbers tested and the country's chronically underfunded healthcare system."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-22 00:00:00      \nFighting climate change plays a key role as rising temperatures create more amenable conditions for diseases to spread The novel coronavirus will not be the last pandemic to wreak havoc on humanity if people continue to ignore links between infectious diseases and destruction of the natural world, environmental experts have warned. \"I'm absolutely sure that there are going to be more diseases like this in future if we continue with our practices of destroying the natural world, deforestation and capturing wild animals as pets or for food and medicine,\" Dr Enric Sala, marine ecologist and part of National Geographic's Campaign For Nature, told The Independent. The World Health Organization has reported 8,778 deaths and 209,839 confirmed cases of COVID-19. The virus is thought to have initially passed from animals to humans at a \"wet market\" selling produce, seafood and live animals in Wuhan, China in December but this is not yet confirmed. Researchers in China have suggested that pangolins, mammals known as 'scaly ant-eaters', are the probable animal source of COVID-19, according to scientific journal Nature. China has since issued a ban on consumption and farming of wild animals, and wildlife markets. However, environmentalists warn of a broader issue: Humanity's voracious destruction of diverse ecosystems which brings us in closer contact with wildlife than ever before. David Quammen, author of 2012 bestseller, Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, became interested in infectious diseases while researching Ebola and has been warning about the risk of pandemics ever since. He told The Independent: \"Our highly diverse ecosystems are filled with many species of wild animals, plants, fungi and bacteria. All of that biological diversity contains unique viruses. \"When we tear down tropical forests to build villages, timber and mining camps, kill or capture wild animals for food, we expose ourselves to those viruses. \"It's like if you demolish an old barn then dust flies. When you demolish a tropical forest, viruses fly. Those moments of destruction represent opportunity for unfamiliar viruses to get into humans and take hold.\" Dr Samuel Myers, principle research scientist at Harvard's Department of Environmental Health and director of the Planetary Health Alliance, told The Independent: \"Human incursions into wildlife habitat bring people into closer proximity with wildlife populations. \"What we know is that other animals are an enormous reservoir of pathogens, many of which we haven't yet been exposed to.\" Vector-borne diseases - those from living organisms that can transmit infectious pathogens between humans, or from animals to humans - account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases and cause more than 700,000 deaths each year, according to WHO. They have increased over time. Around 30 new infectious diseases emerged during the 1950s, according to a study in journal Nature. By the 1980s, that number more than tripled.  We have previously seen the spread of other zoonotic diseases like HIV, Ebola, SARS, MERS and Zika. Dr Myers said: \"The HIV epidemic and Ebola were thought to have emerged from bushmeat hunting. MERS and SARS came out of live animal 'wet markets'.  \"At the live markets in Wuhan, for example, there was an extraordinary number of exotic species alive in cages, all in proximity to each other and to humans in a way that you would never find in the natural world.\" He added: \"It's a combination of the size of the human ecological footprint and globalization. Once a pathogen has made that jump from animals to humans, it has the capacity to spread around the globe very quickly with air travel.\" Regulation and education on the dangers of consuming wildlife plays a part in mitigating the risk. Quammen said: \"There are people all over the world desperate for protein who eat wild animals. It's not something I want to demonize as a Chinese vice. \"There are so many of us hungry for resources that as we reduce the wild down to these tiny remnants, we offer ourselves as a target of opportunity for viruses.\" Dr Sala said: \"When it comes to populations that depend on the exploitation of nature for their day-to-day living, alternatives have to be provided. \"Governments have a key role in setting policies that protect the nature world and regulate or ban wildlife trade. Companies can help. The world already produces enough food for 10 billion people, only we waste a third of it.\" Fighting climate change plays a key role as rising temperatures create more amenable conditions for diseases to spread. Dr Myers said: \"We're aware that malaria is being found in higher latitudes, and higher altitudes, like in the Kenyan Highlands where we never used to see temperatures as warm.\" The decimation of the natural world extends far beyond infectious disease outbreaks, Dr Myers points out. \"We're seeing impacts on the quality and quantity of food we produce; exposure to noncommunicable diseases like heart disease, cancer and respiratory disease along with mental health impacts, population displacement and conflict,\" he said. With biodiversity loss and a growing global population - expected to rise by 2 billion to 9.7 billion by 2050 - seeking food sources, the question of the next pandemic is not if but when, experts warn. \"If we get [COVID-19] under control, then we can be glad that human ingenuity and will managed to control this one. But after we celebrate for five minutes, we should start thinking about the next one,\" David Quammen said. Sweeping change is needed including making the crucial link between human health and conservation of the planet. Dr Sala said: \"They are not disconnected. There is no sustainable human health without a healthy ecosystem. These infectious diseases we have experienced over the last 20 years are best proof of that. \"Keeping the wild places intact, banning the hunting and traffic of wildlife species, many of which are endangered, would not only be practical but beneficial in terms of human health and economics. \"For governments and policy-makers, it is going to be very clear that investment in protecting our natural world is the most cost-effective one they can make.\" "

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-31 00:00:00      \nHabiganj workers demand govt food relief from starvation Workers at 23 tea gardens in Sylhet have been abstaining from work due to the fear of coronavirus transmission for the last five days. Hundreds, among the 10,000 permanent workers and 50,000 temporary workers, demonstrated with a sit-in protest on Tuesday at their respective tea fields, demanding protective gear for work, said Raju Goala, president of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union in Sylhet. Answering a query, he told Dhaka Tribune that the workers are prepared to work as per the premier's directives if Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is provided to them with their salary for the last five days, when they abstained from work. He added that they will go for a large movement if the demands are not fulfilled. Sylhet Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Abul Kalam Azad said Tk12 lakh and 521 tons of rice have so far been allocated for marginal communities in the district to fight the coronavirus crisis so far. However, the allocated resources were not for the district's tea workers. \"Over video conference on Tuesday, the premier instructed to keep all tea gardens of the country operational,\" added the ADC. The tea worker's leader Raju Goala, said: \"People in other occupations in the country are in quarantine, but there were no clear guidelines for tea workers. To avoid risk of virus transmission, workers are abstaining from work. \"Although poor people in the district are receiving government support, none is allocated for tea workers.  \"Most of the workers are hired on a temporary basis. They routinely work at places other than the gardens. They could not work at these other places due to the virus outbreak and the authorities do not have any specific guidelines regarding how workers will not starve, but yet be safe,\" added Raju. In Habiganj, hundreds of tea workers demonstrated in Chunarughat upazila demanding government relief.  During a three hour protest in front of the upazila parishad until 12pm yesterday, they chanted 'Du Mutho Bhat De (give us two fistfuls of rice) as a slogan. Tea worker Koilash Munda said: \"We will die of starvation before catching coronavirus. No one has come to our aid so far.\" Nipen Paul, joint secretary of Bangladesh Tea Workers' Union central committee, said: \"Tea workers were not given leave. We asked workers of some of the gardens to abstain from work. We couldn't arrange government allocations for workers by contacting the upazila administrations. I have heard that workers protested for food in Habiganj.\" Debashish Das, manager of Deundi Tea Garden in the upazila, said: \"We haven't received any instruction from the authorities to allow leave for the tea workers and we haven't put pressure on them to come to work either.\" He added that no worker from his tea garden received any government relief. Chunarughat Upazila Nirbahi Officer Shattyajit Roy couldn't be reached for comment over phone."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-02-13 00:00:00      \nIn Bogra, flower sellers are concerned as flower sales have fallen compared to previous years In a unique turn of events, Bangladesh will celebrate the Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun, the first day of Bangla calendar month Falgun, on the same day -- today -- this year. The exceptional situation, however, is not the bearer of good news for the country's flower merchants, who make huge profits every year on both of these days that generally falls on consecutive days in February. Pohela Falgun used to fall on February 13. But after the Bangla Academy adjusted the Bangla calendar last year, the day will be celebrated on February 14 from this year on, alongside Valentine's Day. With one day of the celebrations gone, the local flower markets in different districts -- from which florists also sell flowers to the traders in capital Dhaka -- have already reported a slump in retail flower sales.  Also, the absence of buyers -- who are mostly students -- because of the ongoing SSC and equivalent examinations will play a role in this, fear the businesses. In Bogra, flower sellers are concerned as flower sales have fallen compared to previous years. Bogra Flower Merchant Association General Secretary Laxman Das Amit said: \"We have received a smaller amount of flowers from the wholesalers as the prices are high.\" \"Also, as both Pohela Falgun and Valentine's Day will be observed on the same day, we are expecting a fall in our business, otherwise these occasions are generally the most profitable days for us every year, now we have only one day for both,\" he told our district correspondent Nazmul Huda Nasim. In Meherpur, flower demand and price have both gone up; however, florists are expecting a one-third drop in their sales target, reports our correspondent Ashraful Islam. Local trader Tutul said: \"This year, the Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun have fallen on the same day, which is also Friday. So, a dip in sales is very likely.\" In Sirajganj, flower sellers are already experiencing a loss in business. Usually, they sell around 70,000 flowers during the Pohela Falgun-Valentine's Day celebrations every year, but there is doubt whether they would sell even one-fourth of that today. Local merchants said they would surely face a slump because most of the schools and coaching centres are also closed due to the SSC exams, reports our district correspondent Aminul Islam Khan Rana. In Comilla, florists have also reported a slump in sales, and a hike in prices, despite a rise in demand. Apart from citing the same reasons, they said the prices have gone up as they could not import flowers due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, reports our correspondent Masud Alam. Still, there is hope Meanwhile, in Chuadanga, florists expect to sell flowers worth of Tk30 lakh between today and the International Mother Language Day, which would be observed on February 21, reports our correspondent Mehedi Hasan. Local flower merchant Akul Hossain said roses, tuberose, marigold, gerbera daisy and gladiola flowers are trending and are on high demand in the market. \"We hope to make a good profit during Valentine's Day and Pohela Falgun. \"Hopefully, the sale will also be high on February 21.\" Demand for flowers along with the cost has also gone up in Nilphamari ahead of Pahela Falgun and Valentine's Day. Local florist Ajgar Ali said he sold flowers worth Tk1.25 lakh since February 1 and expects his sale to go up today, reports our district correspondent Md Taieyb Ali Sarker."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-15 00:00:00      \nThe private and public sectors must work together to pull the country out of this crisis Some regrettable politics is taking place in the name of distribution of relief for the poor. Firstly, the government has not provided a strong and adequate stimulus package to help the poor and the ultra poor to fight the novel coronavirus epidemic. Secondly, even where it has sanctioned relief materials, only those who are well-connected or are known to the powerful local officials are getting the relief; and also, relief materials are getting stolen by the powerful government officials and local leaders of the ruling party. Many of them have already been arrested for this crime as well.  This is a matter of great disgust. Even though the coronavirus is a novel epidemic, we are not observing novel tactics in fighting it from the government's side. All the tools and tactics that are being used are from the olden days. The government is just treating this like any other natural calamity like a flood or a cyclone.  As such, relief distribution, too, has boiled down to photo opportunities for the government officials. One upazila chairman, Mahiuddin Biswas, has even gone so far as hitting a poor person who did not want to take a photo while taking relief. But corona is an ongoing problem, not a cyclone that you can solve merely by giving out some token relief materials after the calamity. The work that is to be done now is not merely damage control, it is situation management.  And without a medium-term strategic approach to fighting this crisis, we have no hope of coming out of it. When the photo session is over, the government officials are leaving, even when hundreds in their relief distribution area are still not taken care of. This is adding insult to injury for the poor people who are calling their local aid centres and hearing that government aid has already been distributed in that area. It is heartening to see that the government has declared that those who steal relief materials will face court cases along with administrative punishment, but we are still to see that in action comprehensively.   We have seen some government officials getting punishment for stealing relief, but this is not enough. If the government can really bring all the wrongdoers to books for stealing relief goods along with those who fail to adequately distribute relief in their area, that would be a great step forward. What we need now is a medium-term national plan for re-emerging from this disaster that has already gotten a grip on much of the country. Both the private and the public sectors must do their part to help the country get out of this disaster.  The relief materials need to be distributed properly, without scope for stealing or wasting otherwise by only distributing to the well-connected.  Even the amount that the government can do at this time of crisis is limited. As such, it is necessary for a comprehensive plan-of-action so that we make proper use of the resources we have. The relief distribution needs to be need-based. Even the middle class and lower middle class people, who are too shy to ask for help in these dire times, need to be paid attention to, and be brought under the social safety net through relief operations that transcend the lower classes and access the middle class.  In these scenarios, the best method for distributing relief materials would be to access the homes of the people, alongside distributing relief on the streets. Some initiatives like this have been taken by the home minister and the mayors of Dhaka City North and Dhaka City South, among others, and I really appreciate their efforts.  This is how it should be done, but there also needs to be a comprehensive plan to tackle this crisis in the medium term, if we are to come out of the crisis any time soon. Without that sort of comprehensive planning, it will be hard for us to spring out of this disaster strong. Anupam Debashis Roy is an editor and organizer of Muktiforum."

According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) of the district, at least 3500 hectares of land have been used for cultivating tobacco in six upazilas . However, a group of people who deal with tobacco in the district said the figure was almost 10,000 hectares. Agricultural officers have said they are discouraging farmers not to grow this crop as it is harmful for both health and soil. However, the farmers are not paying heed to them as tobacco cultivation brings them huge profits every year. They also added several tobacco companies, including multinational companies, were luring tobacco growers with seeds, fertilisers as well as technical support free of cost. This correspondent visited several villages- Itakhola, Kochukata, Tupamari, Panchapakur, Gorgarm , Charcharabari and Kanaikata Bamondanga - of Sadar upazila and observed that farmers, including women and children, were passing busy times in the tobacco fields. Farmer Nazrul Islam of Charcharabari village of Sadar upazila said tobacco companies had set up many purchasing centres and warehouses of tobacco in the district for the advantage of farmers . They are collecting produce from the fields directly. Even supervisors and officials of tobacco companies are regularly assisting them with various facilities. Farmer Arzina Begum of Kanaikata Bamondanga village of Kishoreganj upazila said she had cultivated tobacco on two bighas of land that cost her Tk 8,000. She added, \"Akij company provided me with fertilizer, seeds free of cost.\" Another farmer, Mukta Akhtar, said: \"I have cultivated tobacco on two bighas of land, costing me Tk 10,000. I would sell the crops at Tk30,000-35,000. \"Had we cultivated rice, potatoes and green chillis, we would not be able to make much profit,\" she added. Some farmers of the district alleged that agriculture offices were not sincere in encouraging farmers to grow other crops. Farmers do not get advice from agriculture officials when their seed beds and crops get damaged. Nilphamari Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) Deputy Director Nikhil Chandra Biswas said: \"Profit in cultivating tobacco is more than the cost. For this reason, farmers, disregarding health risks, are cultivating tobacco in huge quantities. As a result, families of tobacco growers are getting exposed to various diseases and cropland is losing fertility gradually.\" \"However, we are trying to create awareness among farmers,\" he added."

India's 1.3 billion people have been ordered to remain indoors for 40 days under a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the virus so that the country's hospitals are not overwhelmed by a flood of infections. Indian authorities have confirmed 18,985 cases of Covid-19, including 603 deaths from the respiratory disease, a relatively low toll compared with Western countries with much smaller populations, though health officials say a lack of widespread testing may mean many more cases have not been reported. The alarm was raised at President Ram Nath Kovind's residence in the centre of Delhi after the daughter-in-law of a sanitation worker living in employee quarters there tested positive for Covid-19, officials said. Neither Kovind, 74, nor his aides were required to self-isolate as they would not have come into contact with lower-level workers on the premises, officials said. But the families of palace workers living in 114 apartments on the grounds were ordered to stay inside, while the seven members of the sanitation worker's family were moved to a quarantine facility. No one on the premises is known to be infected so far.  \"It may be clarified that to date no employee of the President's Secretariat has tested positive for Covid-19 and the Secretariat along with the Local Administration are taking all the preventive measures required under the government guidelines,\" Kovind's office said in a statement. Under India's constitution, the president is a titular head of the republic only with the prime minister and his cabinet holding the executive powers. An employee of India's parliament has also tested positive, but did not come to work, an official said, as the administrative wing of the legislature reopened on Monday as part of a staggered exit from the lockdown. While the total number of confirmed infections is still increasing, Indian health officials said the speed of transmission was slowing thanks to the lockdown, which at the moment is due to be lifted on May 3. The \"doubling rate\" - the number of days it takes infections to multiply by two - had increased to 7.5 days, up from 3.4 days before the lockdown, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said. \"This is an extremely positive trend,\" he said."

      "text": "Date Published:2020-03-15 00:00:00      \nHC wants sentence copy, answers to five questions The government is set to withdraw Kurigram Deputy Commissioner (DC) Sultana Pervin, as evidence on the detention and torture of journalist Ariful Islam was found to be true.  The development came amid widespread criticism from various quarters regarding the detention and sentencing of Ariful in the early hours of Saturday, for reportedly possessing narcotics and alcohol. Ariful's family has called the allegations against him \"absurd.\" The decision on the DC's withdrawal was disclosed on Sunday after Ariful, Kurigram correspondent of  Dhaka Tribune and Bangla Tribune, was freed on bail around 12:30pm. Worryingly, Ariful was beaten so badly that he was taken directly to a local hospital following his release.   In another development on Sunday, the High Court ordered the state to submit to it a copy of Ariful's conviction which was delivered by a mobile court. Briefing the media at the Secretariat in Dhaka, State Minister for Public Administration, Farhad Hossain, said his ministry will soon withdraw DC Sultana, as an investigation into the incident found most of the allegations against her to be true.  \"Departmental action will also be taken against her [Sultana Pervin],\" he said, adding that not only the DC but all those involved with the incident will be brought to book. Earlier in the day, Ariful was granted bail by Additional District Magistrate Sujauddowla, upon giving an undertaking of Tk25,000. The journalist was released to the custody of Kurigram Press Club President Ahsan Habib Nilu.  Immediately after his release, Ariful was taken to Kurigram General Hospital and hospitalised around 1:30pm with numerous bruises on his body.  \"Ariful has injury marks on his body, especially on his hands, legs, back and head,\" confirmed Orthopaedic Senior Consultant Uttam Kumar Roy.  In addition to protests from journalists across the country regarding Ariful's conviction, The Editors' Council  on Sunday expressed grave concern over recent reports of indiscriminate attacks, abuse and torture of journalists.  At the hospital, Ariful told reporters that the authorities concerned had lied to him about his bail petition. \"An employee of the jail came to me on Saturday night and told me to sign a paper as my family had filed a bail petition,\" the journalist said. \"Today [Sunday], I came to know that my family did not do so.\" 'They threatened my life' Arif said several people led by Senior Assistant Commissioner (Tax) Nazim Uddin broke into his home and started beating him.  \"They blindfolded me and tied up my hands and feet before shoving me into a car,\" Ariful said. \"They proceeded to take me to an isolated place and Nazim kept saying 'Say your prayers now, you are about to meet your maker.' \"I begged them to spare my life. I desperately told them that I have two children and my parents have passed away. Don't kill me or my children will become orphans too,\" said Ariful. Writ on Ariful's conviction The bench of Justice Md Ashraful Kamal and Justice Sardar Md Rashed Jahangir has sought a copy of Ariful's conviction upon hearing a writ petition seeking a court order to declare the conviction illegal. The court also fixed today to issue its order in this regard. Advocate Ishrat Hasan and Barrister Syed Sayedul Haque Suman stood for the writ while Deputy Attorney General Debashis Bhattacharyya represented the state. The court also asked the deputy attorney general to phone the Kurigram DC for all the information regarding Saturday's mobile court, to be sent by email before today's hearing. The bench wanted answers to the following queries:  1.   Was the drive conducted by a mobile court or a special taskforce? 2. There are some rules and regulations regarding entering anyone's house at night (from sunset to sunrise). In this case, were these rules followed and what measures were taken? 3. A huge force of 40 people went to the journalist's house to catch him. Did they go there to arrest a wanted terrorist? According to the journalist's wife, 40 to 50 people took part in the raid. Surely, they must have considered the matter to be very important. Why did they consider the matter to be very important? 4. Before conducting any drive, an executive magistrate of a mobile court needs to take notes on the information source. Who informed the mobile court? 5. According to the Mobile Court Act, an incident needs to take place in front of the executive magistrate to warrant action. In this case, what kind of incident took place? Humiliating people nothing new for Nazim Kurigram Senior Assistant Commissioner (Tax) Nazim was accused of humiliating several people in his previous workplaces.   On November 11, 2018, he was transferred from his post as assistant commissioner (land) of Cox's Bazar Sadar upazila to Rangamati's Langadu upazila after a video showing him humiliating an elderly man went viral on social media.  The mobile court raid Around 12:30am on Saturday, a mobile court set up at the Kurigram DC office jailed Ariful Islam for a year, after law enforcement led by two or three magistrates picked him up from his residence. The officials claimed to have recovered drugs and alcohol from the residence. Among the magistrates was Nazim, said Ariful's wife Mostarima Nitu. At least a dozen Ansar members accompanied the magistrates.  \"They did not search the house, nor did they recover any drugs,\" she said, claiming that Ariful is not even a smoker. Journalist Ariful had filed a report about a renovated pond in Kurigram town that was named after the deputy commissioner. He also produced another report recently about irregularities regarding appointments at the DC's office.   Our Lalmonirhat correspondent  contributed to this report"

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-02 00:00:00      \nThe organizations said such measures pose threat to the safety and well-being of the refugees as well as Bangladesh host communities and aid workers Some 50 undersigned organizations have urged the Bangladesh government to lift ongoing mobile internet restrictions and halt the construction of barbed wire fencing around the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar in light of the growing Covid-19 pandemic. In an open joint letter to the Bangladesh prime minister, the organizations said such measures pose threat to the safety and well-being of the refugees as well as Bangladesh host communities and aid workers. Posted on Human Rights Watch website on Wednesday, the letter was signed by Amnesty International, Arakan Rohingya National Organisation, Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, British Rohingya Community UK, Canadian Burmese Rohingya Organization, Harvard Law School International Human Rights Clinic, among others. The letter said that as the Covid-19 pandemic spreads to Bangladesh, unrestricted access to information via mobile and internet communications is crucial for slowing the transmission of the disease and saving the lives of refugees, humanitarian workers, and the general population of Bangladesh. \"Lifting restrictions will not only enable community health workers to quickly share and receive the most reliable and up-to-date guidance during this evolving pandemic but will also help in coordination with community leaders. We urge you to ensure refugees, local communities, and aid workers alike can freely access mobile and internet communications, in the interest of protecting human rights and public health,\" the letter noted. It also mentioned that since September 2019, Bangladesh authorities have prevented Rohingya refugees from obtaining SIM Cards and directed telecommunications operators to restrict internet coverage in Rohingya refugee camps in Cox's Bazar District.  \"These restrictions should be lifted in light of the government's recommendation to those experiencing Covid-19 symptoms to contact the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research, hotline. Without a phone or SIM Card, abiding by this instruction is impossible,\" it added. Furthermore, the signatory organizations mentioned that without access to mobile and internet communications, aid workers and others will be forced to deliver critical health information in person, heightening their risk of exposure to Covid-19 and slowing the effectiveness of the response. Bangladesh government has so far reported 6 deaths and 56 infected by Covid-19.  The fast spreading coronavirus, which was first reported in China's Wuhan, has infected more than 936,100 people and claimed above 47,200 lives across 203 countries and territories and two international conveyances, according to Worldometer. Globally, a total of 194,578 infected people have also recovered from Covid-19, a pandemic announced by the World Health Organization (WHO). Read the full letter here"

      "text": "Date Published:2020-04-17 00:00:00      \nIn light of lockdowns and social distancing measures, most farmworkers are isolated in their homes The sudden outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic is worrying farmers ahead of the Boro paddy harvest season in Jessore, with farmers facing a shortage of workers to bring home their ripe crops in hundreds of acres of land.  In light of lockdowns and social distancing measures, most farmworkers are isolated in their homes, as a result, the upcoming harvesting season is threatened by impediments to harvesting. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) of the district has announced that it will help farmers by providing them with harvester machines at nominal value to harvest crops with less manpower. However, most farmers are unaware of DAE's plan to assist, so they are coming up with awareness campaigns to relieve farmers of their worries, according to district DAE sources. Farmers said the Boro harvest season has begun and they have to begin harvesting their crops in the next 15-20 days. They are facing a manpower shortage and they are not themselves allowed to work due to the lockdowns in place. They fear that their crops will either rot or the annual flood in the upcoming monsoon will ruin their year-long toil. According to the Agricultural Department of the district, over 54,615 hectares of lands are booming with Boro paddy and due to pleasant weather, this year farmers are expecting a good yield. The deputy director of the district DAE, Dr Md Akhtaruzaman, said the authorities had also taken up a scheme to provide 44 harvesters and 18 reapers to the farmers to lessen the need for manpower. He said: \"The Combine Harvester and Reapers will significantly reduce the work and cost of farmers. It can harvest around 1.5 bigha land per hour.\" The official added that the DAE was ready to provide additional farmworkers from other districts if needed, making sure of course that measures were also taken to prevent a spread of the coronavirus virus as well. When asked about the aid promised, most of the farmers said they did not know about the assistance but did appreciate the move. Dr Md Akhtaruzaman said: \"The scheme will only cost Tk250 in every two bigha land. And even if we face a shortage of machines we will employ farmworkers from Satkhira and other districts after consulting medical professionals regarding the necessary safety measures.\""
