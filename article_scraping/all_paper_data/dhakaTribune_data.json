      "text": "Climate-induced flooding is expected to imperil about 300 million worldwide Coastal areas currently home to 42 million Bangladeshis will be vulnerable by 2050 to flooding made worse by climate change, no matter how aggressively humanity curbs carbon emissions, scientists have warned. In the second half of the 21st century and beyond, however, choices made today will determine whether the global coastlines on maps today will remain recognizable to future generations, reported the journal Nature Communications. Destructive storm surges fuelled by increasingly powerful cyclones and rising seas will hit Asia hardest, according to the study, reports AFP. It is estimated that one-fourth of Bangladesh's land will be reclaimed by sea, as per the study. Bangladeshi environment and climate professionals agreed with the study as the knowledge of rising sea level is not new but reiterated the implifloocations of water salinity. \"Bangladesh will face major risk from rising sea level which may impact increase in water salinity. But, we should understand the research methodology. Climate Central did the report based on global context. Results may vary if research is conducted on one specific coastal area of Bangladesh,\" said Prof Syed Hafizur Rahman, of Department of Environmental Science at Jahangirnagar University. \"Considering the history of thousands years of Bangladesh, and the local geo-math, it may not be possible to say such type of impact will hit the coastal areas or southern part of the country by 30 years of 50 years specifically,\" he added. \"The weather patterns have been changing gradually, visible by the change in temperature. The significant rise in sea level could affect the coastal people. But we should not be nervous as we can still deposit sediments in the coastal areas,\" said Prof Kazi Matin Uddin Ahmed, of Geology Department at Dhaka University.  In an article titled \"The future of Bangladesh regarding climate change\" published recently in a Bangladeshi magazine, the author Prof Md Khalequzzaman, of Geology Department of Lock Haven University Pennsylvania, analyzed that the coastal areas have been moving 80km towards the sea in Bangladesh over the last 200 years.   It is happening mainly in the south-eastern part of the country including Bhola, Noakhali and Barisal due to the alluvial sediments deposited by the rivers. Therefore, Bangladesh is surviving against the rising sea level. But, due to continued water-logging in the coastal part, construction of dam to protect the area may increase salinity in fresh water in coastal areas. Over two-third at risk in Asia More than two-thirds of the populations at risk are in China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand, reports AFP. In each of several dozen major cities - including Bangkok, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Taizhou, Surabaya, Dhaka, Mumbai, Ho Chi Minh City and Osaka - millions will find themselves in flood zones. Using a form of artificial intelligence known as neural networks, the new research corrects ground elevation data that has up to now vastly underestimated the extent to which coastal zones are subject to flooding during high tide or major storms. \"Sea-level projections have not changed,\" said co-author Ben Strauss, chief scientist and CEO of Climate Central, a US-based non-profit research group.  \"But when we use our new elevation data, we find far more people living in vulnerable areas than we previously understood,\" Strauss told AFP. With the global population set to increase by two billion by 2050 and another billion by 2100 - mostly in coastal megacities - even greater numbers of people will be forced to adapt or move out of harm's way.

      "text": "Hundreds of thousands of people across Bangladesh have been displaced as many rivers and all four of the country's major basins continued to rise due to incessant downpours and the rush of water from upstream A total of 114 people have died due to excessive flooding in 28 districts across Bangladesh in the past 17 days. Of them, 10 people died in the last 24 hours, according to the Health Emergency Operation Center and the Control Room of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) report. 95 people drowned in the affected  areas during the 17 days. Hundreds of thousands of people across Bangladesh have been displaced as many rivers and all four of the country's major basins continued to rise due to incessant downpours and the rush of water from upstream. Thousands of people have been affected in the districts while rising water levels of the major rivers left people stranded in water-logged areas, putting them at risk of water-borne diseases. According to the control room data, 14,781 people have fallen ill due to flooding, water-borne diseases and other natural disasters between July 10 and July 26.   During the period, a total of 5571 people were infected with diarrhoea, 1,610 infected and one killed from respiratory tract infection (RTI), eight injured and seven killed from lightning strikes, 56 infected and eight killed from snake bites, 23 injured and 95 drowned. Additionally, 1,905 people were infected with skin diseases, 479 with eye inflammation, and 434 sustained injuries relating to the flood. 4,695 were infected and three were killed for other reasons that has not been specifically cited in the report. According to the Control Room data, the flood has affected 28 districts--Shariatpur, Rajbari, Manikganj, Munshiganj, Netrokona, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Khagrachhari, Bandarban, Rangamati, Feni, Bogra, Gaibandha, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Kurigram, Jamalpur, Sherpur, Brahmanbaria, Tangail, Sirajganj, Habiganj, Faridpur, Chandpur, and Madaripur. A total of 325 unions out of 2,117 unions in 74 upazilas in the 28 districts have been affected by the floods. There are 1,324 shelter centres with 2,451 medical teams currently working in the areas."

      "text": "Many people in Chapainawabganj are marooned due to the rise of water which has also destroyed 8000 hectares of cropland At least five districts in the northwestern part of the country are underwater, and has increased in the last few days as the water levels in the Padma and Mahananda have risen, touching danger level, sources said. Flood water has increased in Chapainawabganj due to torrential rains and water level in the Padma has risen by 3cm in the last 12 hours. In the Pankha point of Chapainawabganj, the water level is 27.09 cm which is just 0.41 cm lower than the danger level as recorded by the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) on Tuesday. Many people in Chapainawabganj are marooned due to the rise of water which has also destroyed 8000 hectares of cropland.   The flood situation in Kushtia has worsened stranding around 50000 people. The water level at the Hardinge bridge point had crossed 10.25m yesterday, which is above danger level.  In Natore, around 6000 residents in three unions of Natore's Lalpur upazila have been marooned by the floodwaters.  The floods occurred due to the rise in the water level of the Padma River, where three unions - Bilamaria, Lalpur, and Iswardi, went under water, damaging 22 hectares of cropland, inflicting heavy losses on the farmers. People of the area are currently suffering from lack of drinking water and food. In Rajbari, the water level rose and was flowing 7cm above the danger level causing water to flood the city and stranding many people.  In Rajshahi, the water level is just 41cm below the danger level, according to the BWDB.  In Tangail, the water level in the Dhaleshwari River has risen and crossed the danger level by 7cm causing problems for people and many croplands have gone underwater.  In Pabna, the water level is almost at danger level and many croplands have gone underwater.   Water levels at 74 river stations, monitored by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) have seen a marked rise while 18 stations recorded a drop in levels, reports BSS. Among the 93 monitored stations, the water level at one river station has been registered steady while water levels at three river stations-the Padma at Goalundo, the Padma at Sureswar and Gorai at Kamarkhali- are flowing above the danger level, a bulletin issued by the FFWC said yesterday. All the major rivers are on a rising trend expect the Surma-Kushiyara, the bulletin said, adding that the trend of the Ganges and Padma rivers may continue rising in the next 72 hours. The reason for the floods in Bangladesh and India at the same time occurred due to torrential rains and not because the gates of the Farakka Barrage were opened, a source at the   Indian High Commission in Dhaka told Dhaka Tribune adding that it was a regular practice for India to open the gates during this time of the year. AFP reported on Tuesday that the death toll in eastern India from the torrential late monsoon rains has risen to nearly 140, as hospitals and schools were inundated with dirty rainwater.  The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the current monsoon has been the heaviest since 1994, classifying it \"above normal\", and this year's season has been longer than usual. Over the last four days, 111 people have died in Uttar Pradesh state and a further 28 lost their lives in neighbouring Bihar, government officials told the news agency.  Residents of Patna - the capital of Bihar, home to two million people - used lifeboats to escape heavily water-logged homes. Although the rains have ceased, large swathes of the city remained submerged, with schools and shops closed.

Dhaka wants to move 100,000 refugees to Bhasan Char - a Bay of Bengal island hours by boat from the mainland - to ease overcrowding in its camps at Cox's Bazar, home to more than one million Rohingya Muslims who have fled neighbouring Myanmar. \"We want to start relocation by early next month,\" Mahbub Alam Talukder, the Relief and Repatriation Commission chief based in Cox's Bazar, told Reuters, adding that \"the refugees will be shifted in phases\". Also Read - Inside the Bhashan Char plan for Rohingyas \"Our officials are compiling the lists of the refugees who are willing to move there,\" he said, adding that as many as 7,000 refugees had by Saturday agreed to shift. Some human rights groups have expressed concern over that plan because the island is remote and prone to devastation from cyclones. Many refugees oppose the move, which some human rights experts fear could spark a new crisis.  Densely populated Bangladesh has been grappling with large refugee numbers, with local communities turning hostile towards Rohingya after a second failed bid to send thousands back to Myanmar in August.  The number of refugees in Cox's Bazar has swelled since August 2017, when a Myanmar military-led crackdown that UN investigators have said was conducted with \"genocidal intent\" prompted some 730,000 Rohingya to flee. Also Read - What do Rohingyas think about Bhashan Char? A UN human rights investigator who visited in January said she feared a new crisis if Rohingya were taken to the island. \"There are a number of things that remain unknown to me even following my visit, chief among them being whether the island is truly habitable,\" said Yanghee Lee, the UN special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar. Shah Kamal, secretary of Bangladesh's Disaster Management Ministry, said the government was in talks with U.N. agencies to move the refugees to Bhasan Char, which it has been developing for the past three years. The photo, collected from project official Atikul Islam's Facebook page, shows the housing project for Rohingyas under construction in Bhashan Char, Noakhali, Bangladesh  \"There is no reason to be concerned about floods because we have built storm surge embankment, with all other facilities,\" he said. \"No one will be moved there against their will.\""

The floods worsened in Gaibandha, Kurigram, Jamalpur, Bogra, Sirajganj and Tangail yesterday, while the situation has improved somewhat in Lalmonirhat, Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Habiganj, and Moulvibazar.   In Gaibandha, fresh areas of five upazilas flooded yesterday, following the collapse of an embankment dam near the district town.  The district town was inundated when gushing water breached  city embankments in 20 places. The Brahmaputra River was 150cm above the danger level, and the Ghaghot River rose 94cm above the danger level, said Mokhlesur Rahman, Water Development Board executive engineer. About 4 lakh people still remain waterlogged in the district. The district's rail links to the north, remained suspended for the second consecutive day. At least 94km of the Gaibandha-Balashi road were flooded.  At least 361 schools across the district shut down and eight went under water. Some of them are being used as shelters but they lack food, drinking water, and sanitation facilities. The flood claimed the lives of two people including a child. The deceased were identified as Shohag, 5, of Sadar upazila, and Anwarul Islam, 32, of Sundarganj upazila.  In Bogra three upazilas were flooded, affecting almost 47 villages and more than 14,000 homes in Sariakandi and Sonatola upazilas. 240 houses were damaged partially or completely in Sariakandi, Sonatola and Dhunot upazilas. The Jamuna River is currently 127cm above the danger level. In Jamalpur, the Jamuna River is currently at a recording breaking 166cm above the danger level. With the embankment dam collapse in Madarganj upazila, at least 15 villages flooded. So far, the floods in Jamalpur have claimed the lives of four children. 1,590 homes were damaged partially, and 475 were destroyed completely in 47 unions of 7 upazilas, waterlogging close to 56,900 people. In Kurigram, 4,536 people have been affected, of whom, 3,840 people have taken shelter at 409 storm shelters. A total of 899 hectares of agricultural lands have been flooded.  In Tangail, with the Jamuna River rising 91cm above the danger point, 10 new villages were flooded, when an embankment dam collapsed in Bhuapur upazila yesterday. In Sirajganj, when the newly constructed ring dam collapsed two days ago, the flooding worsened as the Jamuna River rose 91cm above the danger point. In Madaripur, the Padma River rose significantly yesterday, flooding 50 houses in Shibchar upazila. At least eight schools, two upazila health complexes, and the union council building are at risk.

      "text": "Minister Dr Enamur Rahman said preparedness was underway to handle the situation Incessant monsoon rains overnight have triggered flooding in several parts of the country swelling waters in three of Bangladesh's four river basins.  This has marooned thousands of people and disrupting road communications in different areas. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) on Friday warned water levels in rivers could rise further while reports suggests erosion of bank lines in some areas including Manikganj worsened further the deluge situation, reports BSS. \"All the major rivers are in rising trend . . . all the major rivers may (continue to) rise in next 72 hours,\" said the FFWC in its latest bulletin. But the centre predicted a \"rapid rise\" of the water levels in rivers in northeastern Sylhet region, southwestern greater Chittagong ranging from Feni to Hill Tracts and southwestern Barisal region in the next 24 hours. Disaster Management and Relief Minister Dr Enamur Rahman in a media briefing, said preparedness was underway to handle the situation while a central control room at his office kept a constant contact with officials in the affected areas. The minister said gushing waters from upstream region overnight triggered erosion in central Manikganj on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka while effort was underway to save people and infrastructure there. He acknowledged that erosion in Manikganj sent a visible signal that the deluge could engulf more areas but added government machineries including the Health Ministry, armed forces and non-government organizations chalked up coordinated plans to face any situation. Also Read - Heavy rainfall inundates Dhaka, disrupts city life  \"The district and upazila administrations by now started distributing food among the victims while supplies of other required materials including medicines are underway,\" a spokesman of the Disaster Management Ministry said. According to officials and residents, continued rains swelled water level in Bandarban's Sangu River cutting off the district's communication lines with rest of the country and affecting as well its internal communication systems. They said a portion of the Chittagong-Rangamati road near Ghagra's Kalabagan area collapsed due to the torrential downpour; a landslide and culvert collapse halted communication on the Rangamati-Bandarban road. Swelling waters in the Jamuna River affected thousands in the Lalmonirhat and Kurigram districts marooning several thousands and inundating scores of villages and localities. The Water Development Board opened all 44 sluice gates of the Teesta Barrage to avert flood-related casualties as the rise of the Teesta already flooded nearby regions and waterlogged a few thousand people. The inflated water in the Surma and several small rivers submerged settlements and roads in areas of Sunamganj bordering India with officials saying the flash flood breached over 10,000 homes in the district. Numerous primary schools suspended their classes considering the security of the children in view of heavy rainfall and deluge in Sunamganj. A landslide caused by excessive rainfall collapsed a dam in Jamalpur also flooding several villages there while officials said unless repaired immediately, the gushing waters would submerge more areas there. Bangladesh Meteorological Department officials said the shared information they received from their counterparts in the Indian met office suggested that heavy rainfall could lash Bangladesh's northwestern, northeastern and southeastern parts of Bangladesh and their adjoining regions in India's Assam and Meghalaya states in next 24 to 48 hours. \"At places the downpours could be more than heavy,\" a Met office spokesman said."

UNHCR provided tents to the families who were affected by torrential monsoon rains and floods earlier this month. The first batch of the emergency tents was handed over to BDRCS at a ceremony held at UNHCR's warehouse in Cox's Bazar on Thursday. The tents are fire resistant and worth approximately $2million, said a press statement by UNHCR.  Head of UNHCR operations and Cox's Bazar sub-office, Marin Din Kajdomcaj, said: \"We received a plea from BDRCS to help thousands of displaced villagers across Bangladesh, following non-stop heavy rains and rising river levels, earlier in this month.\" \"We had pre-positioned some emergency shelters in Cox's Bazar and Chittagong warehouses, as a part of contingency preparation under Rohingya refugee response program,\" he added. \"UNHCR is ready and feels happy to make this small contribution by extending support to these families in their time of need,\" Kajdomcaj concluded. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief reported that as of now, 2.3 million people were affected in 20 of Bangladesh's 64 districts due to this flood caused by torrential monsoon rains. "

      "text": "Bangladesh government and WFP have activated a forecast-based financing project for the first time to help flood victims  The World Food Program (WFP) has initiated an innovative finance project based on weather forecast to assist flood victims in north west of Bangladesh. The first-ever forecast-based finance scheme will cover more than 275,000 people to mitigate flood impact through early action.  These will include cash transfers along with existing government interventions. Also Read- Flood situation worsens in 3 districts \"Home to more than 700 rivers, Bangladesh is increasingly seeing the impact of climate change. Erratic monsoon and downpours are causing severe floods,\" said Richard Ragan, WFP representative and country director in Bangladesh, in a press release on Thursday.  \"WFP is using a combination of cash and food to urgently meet the basic needs of more than a quarter million people whose homes and agricultural lands have been inundated.\" Around 5,000 households (25,000 people) received Tk4,478 ($53) through mobile money transfers in Kurigram as part of the project. Cash was distributed to the most vulnerable, including families headed by disabled people, the elderly and single women.    Also Read- 300k hectares of cropland damaged in flood The assistance helped people pay for basic needs such as food and other urgently needed goods and services. WFP is supporting more than 250,000 people in three north-western districts with energy-boosting biscuits that will sustain them for three days as an immediate response to the floods. The biscuits are often used in emergencies as they are nutritious, easy to transport and do not need cooking. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief reports that 2.3 million people have been affected in 20 of Bangladesh's 64 districts. WFP is closely monitoring the floods in coordination with the government and we stand ready to assist further, should the situation deteriorate."

Water was flowing about 1769cm above danger levels at no less than 23 stations of 13 rivers yesterday, according to data compiled by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). According to the centre, the situation is said to be a flood if the water flows at or up to 1m above the danger level, while it becomes a severe flood if the water flows more than 1m above. All four of the country's major basins continued to rise due to incessant downpours and the rush of water from upstream, the bulletin says. While the flooding may worsen in Kurigram, Jamalpur, Gaibandha, Bogra, Sirajganj and Tangail districts, the situation may improve in Lalmonirhat, Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Habiganj, and Moulvibazar districts by morning today, it adds. The FFWC usually monitors 93 river stations across Bangladesh. Among those, water levels at 63 river stations rose, while 29 fell, and one remained steady as of yesterday. All the major rivers were  rising except the Surma-Kushiyara it said, adding that the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Ganges-Padma rivers may continue rising this morning and the Atrai river at Baghabari and the Padma river at Goalondo point may cross danger levels by morning today , according to the forecast.

Floods worsen in Moulvibazar, Jamalpur The floods, caused by days of incessant rain across Bangladesh, have worsened in Moulvibazar and Jamalpur while things remain unchanged in Sunamganj district. In Moulvibazar, 70 villages have been flooded as heavy rainfall and rising water levels continue to affect new areas. Moulvibazar Water Development Board (WDB) Executive Engineer Ranendra Shankar Chakrabarty said the Manu river was flowing 35cm-100cm above the danger level, while the Kushiyara river was flowing 54cm above, and the Dhalai river, 26cm above. In Jamalpur, 300,000 people living in 47 unions of three municipalities are currently suffering due to floods caused by the steep rise in the water levels of the Jamuna, Brahmaputra, Jhenai, and Zinziram rivers. Jamalpur WDB Executive Engineer Nabakumar Chowdhury said: \"The Jamuna is currently flowing 135cm above the danger level at Bahadurabad Point. \"The newly flood affected areas of the district are: Madarganj upazila's Gunritala, Adar Bhita union and municipality, Islampur municipality, Melndah upazila's Mahmudpur, Nagla and Kulia areas, and vast areas of Sarishabari upazila's Doail and Kamrabad unions.\" In Sunamganj, the flood situation remains unchanged though heavy rainfall has stopped in the district.

For the past seven days people in low lying areas have been marooned in stagnant waters but are yet to get any relief supplies. Local administrations have distributed 153 MT of rice and Tk 2,50,000, but most people failed to get them. WDB Executive engineer of Dalia Division, Rabiul Islam, said the water has been receding gradually since India recently shut the sluice gates of its Gajoldoba barrage.  In Sirajganj, Ranjit Kumar Sarkar, senior officer of the local Water Development Board, said at least 75,000 people remain marooned in flood waters as water from upstream and incessant rain persistently push up the water level on the Jamuna River.

      "text": "4.7 million people in 18 districts suffering from food, water, and communication crisis The monsoon flood triggered by heavy rainfall, and increased water flow from upstream, has caused extensive damage to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people across the country, displacing many from their homes. Though many flood-hit people are returning to their homestead, inundated roads, and waterborne infectious diseases keep compounding the sufferings of the affected population. At least 4.7 million people have been affected by the flood in 18 districts, with a larger population affected in Kurigram, Tangail, Gaibandha, Bogra, Sirajganj, Sherpur, Sylhet, and Sunamganj districts, according to the disaster situation report prepared by the Emergency Operation Centre of the Department of Disaster Management, published on Monday.  The data includes both partial, and full damages.  A total of about 321,939 hectares of agricultural land are submerged in floodwater, putting farmers in the affected districts in trouble. At least 1,434km of embankments have been damaged as well. About 4,968km of road have been damaged, and in some places, inundated roads are making it extremely difficult for the villagers to commute, especially when they need to travel to the nearby health complexes for treatment. People are also suffering from a crisis of safe drinking water, as 50,430 tube-wells are out of commission due to the flood in these districts. So far, the government has allotted 24,150 tons of rice, Tk3.27 crore in cash, 102,000 packages of dry food, and 8,000 tents as relief materials, in the current fiscal year, which began on July 1. Rivers flowing beyond danger level in 13 districts The latest record shows water flowing about 729 cm above danger levels at no less than 20 stations of 11 rivers in 13 districts, according to data compiled by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) released on Monday. According to the centre, when water swells, and flows into the rivers, under or up to one metre beyond the danger level, it is called a flood; when the river water swells over one metre above the danger level, the situation is categorized as severe flood.  The FFWC usually monitors 93 river stations across Bangladesh. Among those, water levels at 34 river stations rose, while 56 fell, and three remained steady as of Monday. Thousands of people have been affected in the districts, as rising water levels of the major rivers left people stranded in waterlogged areas, putting them at risk of contracting water-borne diseases. Many still marooned The situation is improving in several districts, but a significant number of people are still marooned, and in desperate need of help. In Sunamganj, two floods within two weeks have crippled the district, mostly affecting the rural road infrastructure.   According to the district relief and rehabilitation office, there are 88 unions in the district, where 153,785 people remain marooned. During this disaster, seven people were killed by lightning strikes, and boat capsizes. People of Jamalganj upazila were hit the worst, as 7,950 families were affected.  Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) Executive Engineer Md Iqbal Ahmed said: \"The road infrastructure in the district has been most affected by the flood. Massive potholes were created on major roads, bridges, and culverts of the district.\" As soon as the flood water recedes completely, the renovation work will begin in full-scale, he added. In Tangail, the overall flood situation gradually continue to improve as the three major rivers are receding. But the rivers are still flowing above the danger level. Despite the improvement, a huge number of people continue to remain marooned, and cultivable lands, and roads are still flooded. Rezaul Karim, assistant engineer of Tangail Water Development Board's science department, said: \"The Jamuna River, the Dhaleswari River, and the Jhinai River are all still flowing above the danger level. The Pungli, and Bongshai rivers have risen, but are flowing under the danger level.\"  In Faridpur, 30 primary schools were shut down, as the flood water remains stagnant in 223 villages, in the coastal areas of Faridpur sadar, Charbhadrasan, and Sadarpur upazilas. District Primary Education Officer Tauhidul Islam said: \"The schools had to be closed down as they were completely inundated by the flood water.\" Faridpur Deputy Commissioner Atul Sarkar said: \"The flood affected families are being closely monitored, and are being provided with the necessary relief items. Until now, 280 tons of rice, and Tk2.9 lakh in cash were distributed to people of 15 unions in four upazilas.\" In Gaibandha, devastating floods washed away 70,000 homes in seven upazilas, leaving 145,000 families displaced.  Barely able to meet their own needs, caring for their livestock is proving near impossible. These animals do not have a place to stay while food and land have become scarce. Villagers aren't able to sell their animals and they aren't getting fair prices at the local haats. Abdur Rahman, a local, said: \"I have been here since morning and no one is putting a fair price on my cow. The 200kg cow is worth Tk1 lakh, but the highest offer I got was Tk 80,000\" According to the district Department Of Livestock Services, there are over 400,000 cows, close to 300,000 goats and sheep in the district. Among these, 72,777 cows, 48,823 goats and sheep, and 108,244 ducks and chickens were affected by the flood.

According to the local administration, 143 unions and 10 municipalities under 14 upazilas and four wards of Chittagong City Corporation have been marooned by floodwater. The flood has affected a total of 4,52,325 people directly in the district. Besides, 672 households have been completely damaged and 9,085 partially damaged due to the torrential rains. Chittagong Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Md Delwar Hossain told Dhaka Tribune that they have received 500 metric tons of rice and Tk13 lakh from the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief. \"We have already distributed 456 metric tons of rice and Tk 12.50 lakh among the affected people,\" said the ADC.

      "text": "25 new villages flooded in Naogaon The flood condition remains unchanged, even as the water level of the Jamuna, and Brahmaputra Rivers in Tangail, Kurigram, Gaibandha, and Jamalpur were receding. In Tangail, although water level of Jamuna River fell from the last few days, Dhaleswari. and Jhinai Rivers continued to flow above the danger level causing the flood situation to remain unchanged.  The water level of Jamuna River was at 98cm above the danger level, while Dhaleswari River at Elasin Bridge point was at 140cm, and Jhinai River at Jokarchar point was flowing at 85cm above the danger level yesterday morning. Assistant Deputy Engineer of the science department of the Water Development Board (WDB), Rezaul Karim, confirmed the information.  In Kurigram, the flood situation also remained unchanged, as Brahmaputra, Dharala, Dudhkumar, and other major rivers in the district continue to flow above the danger level for the last 11 days. Local WDB sources said, the water level in the Brahmaputra River at Chilmari point was at 90cm above the danger level, and 57cm above the danger level at Nunkhaoa point, while Dharala River was at 59cm above the danger level at Setu point, reports UNB. District Administration's control room sources said 864 villages of 57 unions were flooded in the district, leaving 800,000 people marooned. Crops of 20,000 hectares were destroyed while 500km road, 40km embankment, and 41 bridges and culverts were damaged in the district. In Gaibandha, overall flood situation in chars, and Brahmaputra river basin under four upazilas in the district was improving since Thursday night as floodwater started receding from affected areas. Local WDB sources said the Ghagot River of the district recorded a fall of 22cm during the period, and was flowing 72 cm above its danger mark at New Bridge Road point of the district town. Assistant Commissioner and acting district relief and rehabilitation officer M Shahidul Islam said, as many as 485,328 people of the district were marooned.  Some 74,104 flood victims took shelter at 180 flood shelter centres of the district, he said. Deputy Commissioner M Abdul Matin said relief distribution activity was intensified to the flood victims of Sundarganj, Sadar, Fulchhari, and Shaghata upazilas to mitigate their sufferings. In Jamalpur, although water level of the Jamuna River was receding slowing, the Brahmaputra River water level remained the same. As a result, flood persists in 61 out of 68 unions in the district, where close to 500,000 people remain marooned, and 983 schools remain shut. Locals and WDB sources said, the water level of the Jamuna River fell by 12cm, and was at 154cm above the danger level at Bahadurabad point. 25 new villages flooded in Naogaon Gushing upstream water collapsed embankments of the Atrai River in Manda upazila, and the Choto Jamuna in Raninagar upazila of Naogaon. At least 25 new villages were flooded after the two embankments collapsed yesterday, and marooned nearly 200,000 people. Gona Union Council Chairman Abul Hasnat said: \"Local WDB had not renovated the dams in over 40 years, due to which it was at a very risky condition. The flood has inundated nearby villages, and washed away all crops, and domestic animals.\" Our correspondents Abdullah Al Numan, Tangail; Tazul Islam Reza, Gaibandha; Bishwajit Deb, Jamalpur; and Abdur Rouf Pavel, Naogaon contributed to this report"

      "text": "Northern, northeastern and southern districts suffer most as two killed, thousands marooned Heavy rainfall for the last couple of days has triggered flooding across the country, particularly affecting northern, northeastern and coastal districts. At least two people were killed on Saturday, while thousands remain marooned by the floods, which have affected crops as well as road communications in different parts, report our correspondents. Moreover, at least 11 people were killed by lightning in three districts on Saturday. Thousands of people in the affected districts have become victims of recurring landslides and rising water levels of the major rivers, making them water-logged and stranded, as well as at risk from water-borne diseases. Water was flowing about 12.84 metres above danger level in at least 23 stations of 15 rivers on Saturday, according to data compiled by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). Three stations each of Surma and Kushiyara rivers, two each of Manu, Sungu, Brahmaputra and Jumuna rivers, and one each of Dhalai, Khowai, Someswari, Kangsha, Halda, Matamuhuri, Dharla, Teesta and Ghagot rivers were flowing above the danger level, the data shows. The FFWC warned that the flood situation in Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Bandarban, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Jamalpur, and Gaibandha may deteriorate further in the next 24 hours. According to the centre, the situation is said to be a flood if the water flows at or up to 1m above the danger level, while it is severe flood if the water flows more than 1m above.  The outlook says that all the major rivers are in rising trend with chances of medium to heavy rainfall in some places and very heavy rainfall in the northern, northeastern and southeastern parts of Bangladesh in the next 24 to 48 hours. It apprehends that all major rivers may continue rising over the next 72 hours.  The Bangladesh Meteorological Department said heavy to very heavy rainfall has been forecast for parts of Rangpur, Mymensingh, Sylhet and Chittagong divisions for the next 24 hours from 10am Saturday to 10am Sunday. In such a situation, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Saturday said the government has taken all necessary preparations to tackle flooding in the country and asked all officials to remain alert so that the floods cannot harm people. State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Enamur Rahman on Friday said 17,500 tons of rice, 50,000 packets of dry food, 500 tents, and Tk2.93 crore in cash have been sent to the flood-affected districts. Two killed, thousands marooned In Rangamati, two people were killed in a landslide triggered by heavy rainfall in Kaptai upazila. The deceased are Atal Barua, 50, and Sujoya Aung Marma, 42, former chairman of Kaptai upazila Dildar Hossain said. According to locals, the landslide killed the pair around 11am on Saturday as they were riding a CNG auto-rickshaw on the Raikhali-Bangalhalia-Bandarban road at Karigarpara under Raikhali union of Kaptai. In Chittagong, a woman and her daughter were pulled out alive from debris following a landslide that occurred around 10:30am at Arefin Nagar in Bayazid area. Shah Noor, 40, and her daughter Marjina, 18, were rushed to Chittagong Medical College Hospital soon after police, army and locals managed to rescue them, said Sub-Inspector Emdadul Haque of Bayazid police station. The civil surgeon office has formed a total of 284 medical teams in the district to tackle any possible disasters that could be triggered by heavy rains. In Bandarban, torrential rain for the last nine days has swelled the rivers Sangu and Matamuhuri, flooding six upazilas and leaving 20,000 families marooned.  Both rivers were flowing above the danger level on Saturday, inundating Armypara, Islampur and Bus station areas under Sadar upazila, and other low-lying areas of Lama, Alikadam, Ruma, Thanchi and Rowangchhari upazilas. Houses have collapsed and croplands destroyed due to the severe flooding, causing immense suffering to the residents of the hilly region. Their daily activities have virtually come to a standstill. Floods have also snapped road links between Bandarban and other parts of the country for the last five days. Due to the disruption in communication, prices of commodities have increased. The district administration has opened 131 shelters and formed special teams to provide health services to the affected people. Different organizations - including the municipality authorities and the upazila administration - are providing food at the shelters. The photo taken on Saturday, July 13, 2019 shows a house is surrounded by flood water in Jamalpur Focus Bangla In Lalmonirhat, water level of the Teesta River has continued to rise due to heavy rain for the last five days and rush of water from upstream, causing severe flooding on both banks of the river. Fourty-four sluice gates of the Teesta Barrage were opened to control the onrush of floodwater, but the water level has continued to rise. BWDB Deputy Assistant Engineer Aminur Rashid said there is a possibility that the water level might continue to rise over the next four to five days. In Sylhet, two people remain missing in Goainghat and Companiganj due to floods. Companiganj police station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Tajul Islam said Helal Uddin, a worker, went missing on Friday when the boat carrying him sank at Bholaganj in the upazila. A drive is underway to trace him. A youth named Hossain Mia has been missing since Wednesday after he drowned in flood water at Nayabasti village in Jaflong, said Goainghat OC (investigation) Hillol Roy. BWDB Executive Engineer in Sylhet Muhammad Shahiduzzaman Sarker said all the rivers in the district were flowing dangerously, compared to Friday. In Sunamganj, the flood situation remains unchanged at Sadar, Bishambharpur, Tahirpur, Jamalganj, and Doarabajar upazilas due to heavy downpour and onrush of upstream water from India. Data compiled by the district administration show that water has entered 14,500 houses, stranding at least 75,000 people. District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer M Fazlul Haque said 1.04 lakh people of 21,000 families have become stranded because of the floods. Some 300 metric tons of rice, 3,765 packets of dry food, and Tk2.5 lakh has been distributed as relief, he added. Tahirpur Upazila Parishad Chairman Koruna Sindhu Chowdhury Babul said at least 5,000 mud houses have been destroyed in his area. In Jamalpur, at least 6,000 people of different areas under Islampur upazila have become stranded because of floods. In Netrokona, hundreds of people under 12 unions of Durgapur and Kolmakanda have been passing a hard time due to the floods. The district and local administrations distributed 20 metric tonnes of rice and 600 packets of dry food among the affected people. In Rangpur, about 50,000 residents of 40 villages under nine unions of three upazilas have largely been affected due to continuous downpour, rise of water level of the Teesta River, coupled with onrush of hilly water from India. In Moulvibazar, 133 hectares of aush paddy have been damaged by the rising waters of Monu and Dholai rivers, as reported by the district agriculture extension department. In Bogra, the Jamuna River was flowing 8cm above the danger level as of 3pm on Saturday, inundating low-lying areas at Kamalpur, Rohodoho, Ghoghudoho, Chandanbaisha, Dholirkandi and Kutubpur in Sariakandi.

      "text": "Hundreds of houses have been swept away as waters flood six districts Days of incessant rain have culminated in severe flooding of several districts, prompting the government to mobilize all available measures to tackle the situation. Heavy rainfall and water from upstream have also seen all major rivers in Sylhet to surge. The Surma and Kushiara are flowing greatly in excess of 100cm above the danger level in Companyganj, Gowainghat, Jaintapur, Kanaighat, Fenchuganj, and Balaganj upazilas. The Dhalai and Sari rivers also swelled, flooding towns and villages and cutting off communications. Authorities expect the condition to further deteriorate. In Kurigram, the Dharala and Brahmaputra are flowing 12cm and 11cm respectively above the danger point. Other lesser rivers in the district are also swelling as the flow from upstream has not shown any sign of relenting. Intermittent landslides have damaged several dams, endangering at least 20,000 local residents, and putting the Dhaka-Rowmari Highway in risk as well. Bandarban remained cut off from the country after seven days of relentless torrent. Landslides have severed the road connecting Bandarban and Rangamati. The roads are expected to recover once the waters recede. The continuous downpour has further inundated the Sangu and Matamuhuri rivers, flooding parts of the town, prompting 1,200 families to take refuge in 131 shelters. Bandarban Mayor Islam Baby said 2,400 municipality residents are being provided with food daily. The Meghna raged in Chandpur, threatening a Tk300 crore river protection dam project. The local upazila authorities are dumping geo-bags in the river to mitigate soil erosion in lieu of the local Water Development Board authorities. The river has already eroded a 158meter stretch of land along the dam, making locals whose houses, businesses, and land are at risk panic. In Nilphamari, the Teesta had been flowing 28cm above the danger level on Thursday. While it decreased to 24cm above the danger level on Friday, severe damage to a dam in the Dimla upazila has been reported. Local authorities have asked residents of 10 unions to evacuate to high land, cautioning that at least 20,000 people are at risk. In Gaibandha, rainwater and water from upstream in the hills have sharply increased water levels in all major rivers. Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) office sources said the Brahmaputra rose by 36cm, the Teesta by 3cm, the Karotoa by 34cm, and the Ghagot by 53cm. The rise of water level has affected the low-lying areas of the chars and the Brahmaputra river basin, with thousands of people growing concerned, reports BSS.  Deputy Commissioner Abdul Matin said an emergency disaster management meeting was convened on Thursday to help mitigate damages. The government offices are being aided by NGOs who are also operating in the district. Jamuna endangers thousands The Jamuna River has raged through Manikganj over two weeks, taking at least 200 houses, a mosque, a madrasa, and a school into its gullet. Hundreds of families suddenly rendered landless are seeking shelter at government offices. Authorities are distributing relief, but the consensus is that only a long-term solution can prevent Shibalaya and Daulatpur upazilas from suffering catastrophic damages, according to UNB. Three villages in Tangail were ravaged by the Jamuna in the Bhuiyapur upazila. As of Friday, at least 200 houses were reported to have been swallowed by the river's widening maw. Another several hundred houses, in addition to schools, mosques, and temples are also at risk. Locals alleged the Water Development Board has done next to nothing in terms of preventive measures, in spite of repeated pleas for assistance. Authorities admitted the erosion is severe, and requires geo-bags to be dumped along at least a 500meter stretch, but only 75meters have been approved. Government measures State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Enamur Rahman said 17,500 tons of rice, 50,000 packets of dry food, 500 tents and Tk2.93 crore in cash have been sent to the flood-affected districts. Medical teams will also reach the affected areas in a couple of days, said State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Enamur Rahman on Friday. Quoting the Met office, he said the situation may worsen. The Ministry of Water Resources has set up a control room in its Secretariat office to monitor and assess the flood situation. The control room can be contacted at 02-9570028. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, which is also working round the clock, can be reached through their toll-free number of 1090, and the extension 5.

      "authors": "Reaz Ahmad",
      "text": "UN FAO hints of price hikes, fall in production; Bangladesh imported $1.1 billion worth of agricultural products from the US in 2018 One of the worst floods in recent history has resulted in record low planting of corn and soybean in the United States in five years, driving the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to recalculate global food production estimates for 2019. The UN agency says its cereal price index rose 1.4% because of a sudden surge in corn price quotations after planting of the crop got off to the slowest pace ever recorded in the United States, due to widespread flooding and rains. The US being one of Bangladesh's key source countries for agricultural imports, market sources cautioned the authorities to keep track of the global food and feed output scenario to avoid future price shocks or scarcity.     By June 2, producers had planted 67% of the US's corn acreage, 29 percentage points behind both last year and the 5-year average, according to the Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin published on June 4 by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA also reports that only 39% of the US's soybean acreage was planted by June 2, 47 percentage points behind last year, and 40 points behind in the 5-year average.   Bangladesh's import of agricultural products from the US was worth $1.1 billion last year. The imports include, among other things, soybeans ($434 million), soybean meal ($34 million) and distiller grains that include feed-grade maize ($35 million), according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR).  Though Bangladesh mostly imports soybean oil from Brazil and Argentina, some refineries also import US soybeans for crushing here in Bangladesh. The United States is the world's number one soybean producing country.  Bangladesh's domestic soybean production is only 0.15 million tons. The country needs to import over 1.1 million tons of soybeans and half a million tons of soymeal to keep pace with the growing needs of the cooking oil and feed industry respectively.  As far as maize or corn is concerned, despite its tremendous success in raising domestic output from next to zero in the 80's to over 3.5 million tons now, Bangladesh still has to import over a million tons of maize/corn, mainly for feed purposes, thanks to a burgeoning poultry industry in the country. Officials told the Dhaka Tribune yesterday that while maize is traditionally imported by Bangladesh from India and Thailand, it is being imported from the US as well since 2016. Market sources said, even if Bangladesh gets alternate import sources for its soybean and maize, less planting and lower production of the two agricultural products in the United States, would have a bearing on overall availability and prices in the global market. The US is the world's number one producer of both maize and soybean.  UN FAO predicts a fall in global maize output due to a minimum 10% shrinkage in US maize production due to a slower pace of planting owing to unfavourable weather conditions.   The UN agency said new estimates for production and utilization suggested world cereal stocks could decline by as much as 3% in the new season, hitting a four-year low of 830 million tons. Any rise in maize and soymeal prices would have a bearing on Bangladesh's fast growing poultry and fish industry.  Increased production of soybean and other cereal grains in Brazil and Argentina, sources said, can still potentially offset any global shortages of key agricultural products.  "

      "text": "India opened the sluice gates of the Farakka Barrage, which aided to the rise of water level in Padma in the last three to four days The Padma river in Kushtia's Daulatpur upazila has swelled, flooding 1000 hectares of cropland of black gram, locally known as Mashkalai, and causing heavy losses to 3000 farmers of this area. India opened the sluice gates of the Farakka Barrage, which aided to the rise of water level in Padma in the last three to four days. Farmers have cultivated 2500 hectares of black gram in the upazila this year, with 1300 hectares alone cultivated in char areas beside the Padma river. At least, 725 hectares of land in char areas have gone under water as the level in the river has been rising for the last three to four days, according to the Upazila Agriculture Extension office. During a visit to the flood affected areas on Monday, our reporter found croplands of Upazila's Ramkrishnapur, Chilmari, Philipnagar and Moricha unions submerged due to the sudden swell of the Padma waters.  This year, I cultivated black gram in 20 bighas of land , but within four to five days, the water level of the Padma rose, inundating my croplands and inflicting me with heavy losses, said  Abdul Jabbar, farmer of the Ramkrishnapur union. Most black gram is cultivated in our char areas. But, the water flow upstream helped in the rise of the water level of the Padma, flooding the croplands of char areas and incurring a heavy losses to farmers, said Saiful Islam, another farmer of this village. Siraj Mondal, chairman of the Ramkrishnapur Union Parishad (UP) said: ''With the swelling of the Padma river, at least 500 hectares of black gram belonging to around 3000 farmers have been inundated. Stating that the farmers suffered heavy losses, he urged the government to provide financial assistance to the affected farmers.'' Sajib Al Maruf, Upazila Agriculture Extension Officer of the Daulatpur Upazila said: ''Water level of the Padma rose as India opened the sluice gate of the Farakka barrage, flooding 500 hectares of black gram of 3000 farmers. We will help them out by providing necessary support after the water recedes.''"

Flood water continued to rise mainly due to the opening of Farakka Barrage gates and torrential rain, according to sources. The waters kept rising in Chapainawabganj touching the danger level. In the last 24 hours (which ended on Wednesday), the level of water in the Padma River had risen by 11cm which is just 0.30cm below the danger level. Water level in the Mohananda River had also risen by 11cm just 0.22cm below the danger level. In Kushtia, water has crossed the danger level and breached the Kuthibari protective dam in Shilaidaha. 30m   of land was under the Padma waters after the breach of the dam. The water level at Bheramara Hardinge Bridge point was flowing 5cm over the danger level and in the last 12 hours the level of water increased by 2cm breaking all the previous records. The floods had caused at least 50,000 people to be stranded. In Tangail, though water in the Jamuna River receded, levels of water in the other rivers increased. Water level in the Dhaleshwari River increased by 5cm causing the water to flow 22cm above the danger level, while the water level of the Jhinai River increased by 1cm resulting the water to flow 62cm over the danger level. The increase in water level had submerged the low lying lands, rendering countless numbers of families homeless.       In Pabna, water level of the Padma at the Paksi Hardinge Bridge point increased by 7cm which caused the water to flow 14.25 cm above the danger level breaking the record of the last 16 years. Considering the flood emergency, leave of public servants of three upazilas including Upazila Nirbahi Officers (UNO) were cancelled, said Deputy Commissioner Kabir Mahmud at a press briefing on Wednesday evening. \"All concerning district officials are on duty due to the sudden upheaval of the water-level in the recent floods, which exceeded the danger mark,\" the commissioner added. In Natore, the water level of the river had increased causing thousands of people to be stranded.

Bihar minister: Farakka Barrage must be dismantled Sanjay Kumar Jha, eastern India's state of Bihar's water resources minister on Tuesday said that Farakka Barrage, which was been built compromising the state's interest, should be dismantled. According to the Times of India, the minister said the state government has been writing to the federal government for the resolution of the problems caused by the dam and will do so again encompassing all issues. The Farakka Barrage was constructed in the early 60s with the main purpose of helping flush out sediment deposition from the Kolkata Port, besides addressing drinking water requirement in West Bengal. The dam became operational in 1975. \"It (Farakka Barrage) must be dismantled in the interest of Bihar...People of Bihar have been suffering every year due to it. It has become 'misery' for all of us,\" Jha told reporters. More than 1,600 die in India's heaviest monsoon season for 25 years The heaviest monsoon rains to lash India in 25 years have killed more than 1,600 people since June, government data showed on Tuesday, as authorities battled floods in two northern states and muddy waters swirled inside a major city, reports Reuters.

      "text": "With the rising waters, the low-lying and char areas of Kurigram, Sunamganj, and Nilphamari, are beset by landslides and floods With heavy rains and water from upstream, the Brahmaputra, Dharala, Surma, and Teesta Rivers are steadily rising close to danger levels. With the rising waters, the low-lying and char areas of Kurigram, Sunamganj, and Nilphamari, are beset by landslides and floods. People in the affected areas, especially near river banks and in char areas are in severe danger if the waters continue to rise, say officials at local water development boards (WDB).  Road communications have been severed as major roads in these districts are flooded.  This is hampering regular day-to-day activities, affecting working people who have to set out to earn their daily bread and, in medical emergencies, patients who are left helpless. Businesses relying on these roads daily are also facing monetary losses. In Kurigram, the Brahmaputra River and the Dharala River are reaching dangerous levels and will continue to do so, says the local WDB. Char areas and low-lying regions close to embankments are inundated. According to WDB sources, in the last 24 hours, the Dharala River at jetty point has risen by 32cm, and the Brahmanbaria River at Nunkhaoa point has risen by 12cm. By comparison, the Teesta River is holding steady. In the last 24 hours, the district recorded  rainfall of 31mm, expected to remain the same for the next few days, said Rajarhat Meteorological Station. People living in char areas and near embankments said the rising waters have flooded jute, maize, and other grain crop fields. The rising water levels quickly flooded char areas, threatening people in riverside areas.  Water development board Executive Engineer Md Ariful Islam said: \"Incessant rainfall and upstream water from India have swollen the Brahmaputra and Dharala Rivers. The water level is likely to keep rising as the weather forecast suggests continuous rainfall for a few more days.  \"We have repaired dams damaged in the 2017 floods. There are some dams which need attention on the banks of the Dharala River.\" In Sunamganj, a portion of the Sunamganj-Tahirpur Highway is once again flooded due to landslides in Anwarpur, disconnecting the Sadar and Tahirpur upazilas since Monday. Commuters are suffering with at least 50 vehicles stuck at both ends of the highway. WDB said the Surma River at Shologhar point has risen by 7.11cm. The district recorded rainfall of 175mm in the last 24 hours. WDB Executive Engineer Abu Bakkar Siddique said: \"Incessant rainfall is slowly giving rise to the Surma River. However, it hasn't crossed the danger level yet, though the rain is expected to continue and the water level will also continue to rise.\" In Nilphamari, the Teesta is steadily rising and is just 10cm below the danger point (52.6cm).  To avert flood-related casualties, the WBD has opened all 44 sluice gates of the Teesta barrage. Local representatives say that due to rising water levels, 8,000 families in the low-lying and char areas of Dimla upazila are flood affected.   Hatibandha and Kaliganj upazila of Lalmonirhat are also at risk of flooding as the rising waters may soon overwhelm low-lying and char areas there."

      "text": "Bangladesh is vulnerable to natural hazards such as earthquake, flooding and tsunamis Over 100 participants from the government, NGOs and UN agencies have gathered in Dhaka for the past three days to build their organizations' disaster preparedness for future earthquakes. The disaster simulation workshop was jointly organized by the Bangladesh Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), and the United Nations Global Logistics Cluster, according to a press release issued by WFP on Thursday. The purpose of the workshop was to place humanitarian workers in a real-life scenario.  By examining supply chain operations in emergencies, including bottlenecks and gaps, participants gained a better understanding of how disasters like earthquakes could impact relief operations. Participants also acquired knowledge onhow best to mitigate this impact, the statement said. State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Dr Md Enamur Rahman said: \"While cyclones, floods and landslides may pose a greater risk to Bangladesh, we must learn from the 2015 earthquake in Nepal and the level of loss felt by Kathmandu, and be prepared for the unexpected.\" Also Reda- State minister: Bangladesh will be an earthquake resilient country  During the workshop, participants were asked to design, fine-tune and present responses for reducing the impact of a future urban earthquake.  According to the press release, each team's operational plan was evaluated by a panel of government officials who oversee and coordinate the country's emergency response. \"Today, the frequency of disasters has increased globally, making emergency preparedness and disaster management one of the most pressing issues worldwide,\" Country Director of WFP Bangladesh Richard Ragan said.  \"I am pleased to see emergency logistics stakeholders from various humanitarian, government, academic and private sector groups come together to participate in this much-needed logistics and supply-chain simulation exercise,\" he added. Bangladesh sits on a three-way junction of major tectonic plates, atop the world's largest river delta and close to sea level.  This makes it vulnerable to natural hazards such as earthquake, flooding and tsunamis. The capital city of Dhaka, one of the most densely populated cities in the world, is particularly vulnerable. An earthquake here could lead to significant damage to infrastructure and a high number of casualties. The complexity of search-and-rescue efforts in a city like this poses further challenges. Therefore, preparednessis key, the statement added."

The flood has also snapped road communications of Bandarban with other parts of the country for the last five days. Due to the lack of connection with the rest of the country, prices of commodities have risen.  Bandarban Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Daudul Islam said 450 tonnes of food grains have been allocated for the flood-affected people. Meanwhile, the district authorities have opened 131 shelters and formed special teams to provide health services to the people. Different organizations - including the municipality authorities and the upazila administration - are providing food at the shelters. Bandarban municipality Mayor, Islam Baby, said they are providing meals to 3,000 people twice a day. "

Hundreds of villages in Tangail and Madaripur are still underwater.  In Tangail, at least 400,000 people are marooned so far in 401 villages of nine upazilas in the district. Three of its major rivers are still on the rise. On Monday, water receded in most areas, but the Jamuna, Dhaleshwari, and Jhinai Rivers were still 54cm, 132cm, and 57cm respectively above the danger mark, and at least a thousand families have lost their homes. Minister of Disaster Management and Relief, Dr Enamur Rahman, and Deputy Minister for Water Resources, AKM Enamul Hoque, distributed relief to flood victims of Kalihati upazila in the district. According to the District Relief and Rehabilitation office, of the marooned 400,000 people, at least 100,000 are still water-bound, a thousand people lost their homes, and hundreds of people moved into 16 flood shelters. 139 educational institutions, 130km of roads, and 5 bridges and embankments are underwater. 420 metric tons of rice, Tk15 lakh in economic help, and 2000 packets of dry food were distributed to flood victims in Gopalpur, Bhuapur, Kalihati, Nagorpur, Sadar, Mirzapur, Ghatail, Basail, and Dhanbari upazila.

In Madaripur, the Padma River rose and flooded at least three unions rendering a thousand villagers homeless. Almost 55 households, roads, schools and local institutions are under water. And in other parts of the district, almost 300 acres of cropland, all of Bandarkhola union parishad, numerous community health complexes, family planning centres, and 80 local shops in three unions are at risk of sinking in the eroding river. According to the District Administration office, the river rose alarmingly causing river banks to erode in Bandarkhola, Charjanat, and Kathalbari union. In one part of the district, people are marooned in standing floodwaters.  Elsewhere, close to rivers, people are at constant risk of sinking into the river with the eroding banks crumbling.  Villagers are moving their homes, taking shelter in government-provided facilities or higher ground above the water level. Domestic animals are being washed away, schools are closed, and hospitals are underwater. Harun Hawladar of Bandarkhola Union, said: \"We are living under the open sky. With no help from the authorities, we are in extreme hunger and uncertainty.\" Visiting the flood-affected areas, Chairman of Shibchar upazila, Samsuddin Khan, said: \"Floods and erosion are a yearly affair in this region. But it hit harder this year and most places are still underwater. We distributed relief to the victims and we are trying to restore the area with the utmost sincerity.\"  Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Asadujjaman Khan confirmed the Chairman's words and said a sufficient number of relief and rehabilitation programs are being launched to help the victims.

The Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) officials said farmers have already completed harvesting Aush rice crop on 43,645 hectares of land producing over 1.37-lakh tonnes of clean rice (2.06-lakh tonnes of paddy) in the region. Before floods in July last, farmers cultivated Aush rice on 55,530 hectares of land, higher by 755 hectares than the fixed farming target on 54,775 heaters of land to produce 1.54-lakh tonnes of clean rice (2.34-lakh tonnes of paddy) in the region. \"Last year, farmers produced 1.23-lakh tonnes of Aush rice from 40,618 hectares of land against the fixed production target of 68,969 tonnes from 26,159 heaters,\" Horticulture Specialist of the DAE at its regional office Khondker Md. Mesbahul Islam said. Despite causing production loss of 28,665 tonnes of Aush rice worth Taka 59.30 crore on 7,754 hectares of land by recent floods, farmers are harvesting the remaining Aush rice crop on 47,776 hectares of land this season in the region. \"After harvesting on 43,645 hectares of land so far, farmers are continuing harvesting Aush rice on reaming more 4,131 hectares of land now,\" Islam said. After completion of Aush rice harvest soon in the region, the total Aush rice output might be around 1.49-lakh tonnes of clean rice this season, higher by 26,000 tonnes of Aush rice than last year. Talking to BSS, Deputy Director of DAE for Rangpur region M Moniruzzaman said farmers exceeded the fixed Aush rice cultivation target this time following various realistic programs taken by the government.  The programs include distribution of special intensives, providing technical support to farmers and conducting motivational campaigns. Under the programs, the government distributed special incentives in terms of Aus rice seed and fertilisers worth Taka 5.75 crore among 34,029 small and marginal farmers of all five districts in Rangpur agriculture region this season. \"Each of the beneficiary farmers got 5 kg high yielding variety Aush rice seed, 15 kg Di-ammonium phosphate and 10 kg Murrieta of Potash fertilisers free of costs to cultivate Aush rice on one bigha of land,\" he said. Additional Director of DAE for Rangpur region Muhammad Ali said the profitable Aush rice cultivation regained popularity among farmers in last ten years as a result of special steps taken by the present government. \"The farmer are reaping more profits through cultivation of Aush rice at lower costs using unused seasonal rain water during May, June and July as an additional crop on the lands those remain fallow during the off season,\" Ali said. \"After harvesting Aush rice by August, farmers can easily cultivate T-Aman rice on the same land to further increase rice production for attaining sustainable national food security,\" Ali added. Talking to BSS, local farmers Hossain Ali and Mofizar Rahman said they had already harvested their Aush rice crop and got excellent yield rate of 3.15 tonnes of clean rice per hectare of land on an average this season. They also expressed satisfaction over the current excellent market price between Taka 650 and 750 per mound (every 40 kilogram) of the newly harvested Aus paddy in local markets."

According to the Meteorological Department of Bangladesh and India, there is no chance heavy rainfall in the highland areas, in the next 24 hours, said a press release issued by Flood Information Centre of the Bangladesh Water Development Board yesterday. Brahmaputra's water level will continue decreasing and Jamuna's water level might fall in the next 24 hours. On the other hand, the water level of Ganges-Padma will rise in the next 48 hours. Within the next 24-hours, old Brahmaputra River, Jamalpur, and Sureshwar point of Padma River might cross the danger limits. In Manikganj, the water level of the Jamuna River is increasing and is flowing 30cm above the danger level at Aricha point. With the rise of tides ferry operation were suspended between Paturia-Daulatdia routes, halting movement of hundreds of vehicles.    At least 200 houses along with schools, vast cultivable lands were washed away by the river in the Daulatpur upazila. Hundreds of people have taken shelter in local schools in the Bachamara union. In Sirajganj, the Jamuna River is flowing 99cm above the danger level. Locals are worried about the city's embankment dam \"Hard Point\", as dams all around the country are collapsing. Md Shafiqul Islam, secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources, visited the dam and examined its condition yesterday. He said: \"A small portion of the dam at \"zero-point\" had sunken on Thursday night, causing locals to panic. We are monitoring the situation at all times.\"  In Tangail, the flood worsened as the embankment dam collapsed yesterday in Tepibari adjacent to the Bhuapur-Tarakandi road in the district. The Jamuna River is at 99cm, the Dhaleswari River at 130cm and the Jhinai River at 79cm above the danger point. District Water Development Board Executive Engineer said the collapsed dam was being repaired. In Kurigram, around 2 lakh people remain waterlogged in nine upazilas of the district. They are suffering from shortage of food, shelter and drinking water. In Gaibandha, flood water is receding in four upazilas while 12 unions in two new upazilas were flooded after a dam collapsed in the Gobindaganj upazila yesterday. In Jamalpur, the overall flood situation in the district deteriorated further affecting about 12,70,000 people in 61 unions and six municipalities in all the seven upazilas in spite of the receding water level. Water Development Board sources said during the last 24 hours the Jamuna dropped by 8 cm and was flowing 158 cm over the red mark at Bahadurabad Ghat point.

      "text": "Locals blamed the floods, which had swept away a 60-metre embankment near the Jamuna River A large number of cattle, of different breeds, was found to be up for sale at a makeshift cattle market at Alampur Chowrasta Bazar area of Kazipur upazila in Sirajganj, ahead of Eid-ul-Azha coming up next week. However, the absence of buyers in comparison to the scores of sellers indicated that the flood situation had adversely affected sales so far. Locals blamed the floods, which had swept away a 60-metre embankment near the Jamuna River. This led to the flooding of the adjacent village of Meghai, and had also flooded the roads between Sirajganj and villages such as Meghai, Paikartali and Kunkunia. The floods had also affected the livestock and cattle in these villages, while their stock of food, such as hay, was also disrupted. In spite of all these problems, the owners have taken good care of their livestock and cattle, in hopes of selling them just before Eid. Locals also said that, many of those who were able to buy cattle last year may not be able to afford doing so this year, thus different people may buy one animal between them and share the same. This is due to the fact that floods have severely affected their livelihoods, and many people are finding it difficult to make ends meet. Rehana Khatun, a victim of the floods at Meghai village, said her husband was not able to find work ahead of Eid, while the floods have also swept away whatever resources they had. \"It will be difficult even to purchase one sacrificial animal in partnership with others,\" she lamented.  Masud Rana, a seller at the makeshift cattle market at Alampur Chowrasta Bazar, had brought his only medium-sized cow in hopes of fetching a good price. \"The lack of buyers is really disheartening,\" he said, \"I am not sure if I will be able to sell the cow at a good price.\" Shahidul Islam, a resident at Alampur Chowrasta Bazar area, said buyers usually start flocking after 3pm, but the prices do not match their expectations, so most of them leave without purchasing any animal. Bangladesh has a total stock of 11.18 million cows, buffaloes, goats, and sheep \"ready for Eid slaughtering\" this year; slightly up from the previous year. In addition to maintaining the stock of animals ready for sacrifice during Eid, preparations have also been taken to supply healthy goats, sheep, buffaloes, and cattle in markets for Eid-ul-Azha. 4.58 million cows and buffaloes, 7.20 million goats and sheep, and a large number of other sacrificial animals will be available this year to be slaughtered, the Department of Livestock . This figure was confirmed by the Department of Livestock Services (DLS)   at a recent meeting.. Earlier,an annual number of 2.4 to 2.5 million Indian cows were known to enter Bangladesh illegally; however, only 92,000 cows  entered Bangladesh in 2018."

      "headline": "Dhaka's water problems",
      "authors": "Tanvir Ahmed",
      "text": "How Dhaka's drainage and natural hydrology can be improved Dhaka is known for water-logging and drainage congestion, losing its past glory of natural khals and wetlands full of fresh water. Wetlands in Dhaka are divided into two categories: Water bodies and lowlands -- which comprises of surrounding rivers, lakes, ponds, khals, and low-lying areas. The surface water area of Dhaka Central Region is about 13% of the total land area. Our drainage has two aspects: Flood protection and storm-water discharge, which are interrelated. The capital's water resources are threatened by both human activity as well as natural causes. Climate change is affecting our city, in particular, in three ways: Increased frequency of floods, drainage congestion, and heat stress. Because of its geographic location, Dhaka suffers from river floods annually. The city also suffers from frequent storm water flooding. The illegal encroachment of rivers, water bodies, lands filling, and indiscriminate dumping of domestic and industrial waste into rivers and canals are accelerating the drainage congestion. As a result, Dhaka faces severe storm water flooding during heavy rainfall. The city corporations and the institutions empowered with various planning and management responsibilities have been nothing but feeble in taking appropriate approaches to tackle these issues. The local surface water hydrology around Dhaka is complex -- the Dhaleswari River, a tributary of the Jamuna River, flows by the south-eastern part of the North Central Region of Bangladesh, close to the confluence of the Padma River and Upper Meghna River. The Lakhya River joins Dhaleswari at 11km downstream of the Buriganga confluence. About 5km below the Dhaleswari-Lakhya confluence, the Dhaleswari meets the Meghna River, which in turn flows into the Padma River, a further 20km downstream. All of this results with the city's drainage system being under the influence of backwater effects from surrounding rivers. The city has been experiencing a gradual increase in water-logging over the last decade, of course. Moderate-to-heavy rain causes serious drainage problems in many parts of the. The process of rapid urbanization is not focusing enough on adequate drainage facilities, which causes water-logging and temporary inundation in parts of Dhaka for several days during monsoon. This has brought the reality that, during the monsoon, the city's drainage depends very much on the water levels of the peripheral river system. The situation worsens when monsoon runoff, generated due to continuous rainfall, coincides with high water level in the river systems. Encroachment of surface water bodies can aggravate the risk of water-logging; micro-drainage system cannot carry out the load and they are not being upgraded, maintained, and managed on a regular basis; and poor, partial, and overloaded sanitation can pose serious health hazard to the dwellers during water-logging particularly in the low lying areas. Needless to say, flood prevention is necessary to avoid damage to property and life.  Over last few decades, development in the flood flow areas within Rajuk jurisdiction has been going on despite planning and legal restrictions. But poor monitoring and lack of enforcement of plans and legal powers have so far failed to put a dent on most of these activities. Once a restricted low land is filled up and inhabited it is almost impossible to reverse the situation from practical point of view. Such activities promote development in these areas but they have adverse impacts in the long run. The authority should build a conservation zone which especially includes flood flow and water retention area that must be preserved for maintaining a sustainable environment of the Dhaka Metropolitan Region. The city authority should adopt legal measures and innovation of economic use to preserve retention ponds. All development in the eastern fringe areas should safeguard the retention pond areas and khals; all private housings within the eastern fringe areas should incorporate flood water management and higher level (Structure Plan and Detailed Area Plan) road proposals.  Policies on drainage and hydrology were provided in the Dhaka Structure Plan in 1995, where policies were set on flood control, flood flow zone, and drainage. A structure plan was followed by Detailed Area Plans (2010) where more detailed proposals were made based on the policy framework of the structure plan. DWASA has been preparing detailed and comprehensive Storm Water Drainage Master Plan for an efficient drainage network for greater Dhaka City, which will be treated as a basic document for storm-water/manmade drainage network plan for DAP, 2016-2035. The important point to note here is to ensure the proper and timely implementation of these policies and plans. Moreover, it is imperative that we develop a comprehensive Watershed/Water Resources Management Action Plan that would account for the impacts of climate change and adaptation measures conforming to future urban development plans.

      "text": "Are we ready for summertime cyclones, storms, and tornadoes? Bangladesh has a long history of natural hazards in summer. The main hazards include tornadoes, Nor'wester, flash floods, and cyclones. These disasters lead to the loss of lives, livelihoods, assets, and properties.     Tornadoes mainly occur in the pre-monsoon (March-May), and post-monsoon (October-November) periods. They form suddenly, are of brief duration, and are extremely localized in nature. It is the pre-monsoon period when most of the abnormal rainfall or droughts occur in different parts of Bangladesh. A tornado occurred in Manikganj on April 26, 1989. It was the deadliest tornado in Bangladesh's history. It killed around 1,300 people. In addition there are severe local seasonal storms, popularly known as Nor'westers (Kalboishakhi). These storms are generally associated with tornadoes. Wind-speeds in Nor'westers usually range from 113km/h to 130km/h, though often their speeds exceed 162km/h.  Since 1971, Bangladesh has experienced several major tornadoes, which have killed an average of more than 100 people in each event, and caused severe damage in their narrow paths.  Cyclones and storm surges  Tropical cyclones from the Bay of Bengal accompanied by storm surges are one of the major disasters in Bangladesh. They occur mainly in April/May and October/November. The country is one of the worst sufferers of all cyclonic casualties in the world.  Cyclones and storm surges are a continuous threat for the coastal population. The average annual frequency of tropical disturbances in the Bay of Bengal is between 12 and 13, of which five attain the cyclonic strength. Most of these cyclones strike land on the Bangladesh coast or the coast of Myanmar and India. On April 29, 1991, a powerful cyclone struck the coastal area of Bangladesh with winds of around 250 km/h. The storm killed at least 138,000 people, and left as many as 10 million homeless.  The cyclonic storm \"Aila\" hit Khulna division on May 25, 2009, killing approximately 190 in Bangladesh. Hundreds of thousands of homes were washed away when wind-driven tidal surges of up to three metres destroyed the coastal belt of Khulna region. The country has experienced an increased frequency of flash floods in the recent years. Flash floods mainly occur in haor areas of the north-eastern part of the country during the period of late March to May. These floods cause quick damage to crops and property, and are followed by relatively rapid recession. Untimely flash floods can cause people to lose their harvest. The following points have been placed by relevant authorities for further improving the emergency and disaster risk reduction performances.  Emergency management  The key tasks for effective emergency management are mentioned below. Readiness for a rapid response includes measures that need to be taken before a disaster event in order to minimize the loss of life and interference to critical services. It also includes the formulation of workable hazard-specific emergency plans, the development of warning systems, the maintenance of inventories, and the training of workforce. It may also include search-and-rescue measures and evacuation plans for communities at risk. Prior to any emergency situation, the contingency plan provides the basis for identifying and further developing response capacity. The contingency plan is the basis of readiness and cover. It includes:  1. Analysis of the context, risk mapping, and identification of likely emergency scenarios.  2. Mapping of capacity, vulnerabilities, constraints, resources, and tangible/intangible assets. 3. Identification of other external organizations' capacity, constraints, and resources in the department, ministry, area, country, or region.    Reduction of risks It is expected that responsible authorities will act appropriately for reducing the disaster risks in line with the disaster management vision of the government of Bangladesh.  The vision is to reduce the risks faced by people, especially the poor and the disadvantaged, from the effects of natural, environmental, and human-induced hazards and to have in place an efficient emergency response system capable of handling large-scale disasters. The major areas of interventions for reducing summer disaster could include the following. Mainstreaming disaster risk reduction in existing development works and future initiatives of different government departments and non-government organizations (NGOs) of the country is very important. Authorities concerned should develop a disaster database to carry out detailed studies and planning.  The government and NGOs need to redesign their development programs to ensure the active participation of the most vulnerable communities. Disaster mitigation potential needs to be maximized, and traditional community coping practices need to be incorporated. Some targeted but tested disaster risk reduction activities could be carried out in consultation with communities at risk, and with relevant organizations. Appropriate feasibility and cost benefit analysis of independent authorities are needed for taking any structural protection initiatives. A public hearing and consultation is important in this regard.  The respective authorities at different levels should strengthen capacity-building initiatives of the local government and communities at risk. A well-organized and coordinated effort is needed to further strengthen local level planning. Proper resources from central government and others should be ensured by authorities and policy-makers. Bangladesh is good at forecasting cyclones and river floods. However, there are a lot of gaps and limitations in forecasting flash floods and tornadoes.  Our flood and flash flood warning information will not be at the desired level without the establishment of a strong regional data-sharing and cooperation framework.  A tornado forecasting system is needed, because tornadoes generate on the land and provide little time for early warning and forecasting. The Bangladesh Meteorological Department needs to play a significant role in this initiative. Reducing the disaster risks of the summer season is imperative to protecting lives, livelihoods, and properties in Bangladesh.

Authorities said the deaths occurred largely due to electrocutions caused by ill-maintained power lines even as large segments of the city suffered hours-long outages that lasted up to a day in some areas. According to the Edhi Foundation -- which oversees a vast rescue services operation in Karachi -- up to 15 people were killed during the recent bout of flooding.  12 killed as flooding paralyses Pakistani city of Karachi https://t.co/BmufW6HdIM However government hospitals in the city said only 12 people had died in recent days in flood-related incidents. Outrage simmered in the city after a video went viral on social media showing two children who had been allegedly electrocuted by a power line that had fallen into a puddle. \"The electricity company must be held responsible for the children's death as safety and security is its responsibility,\" said Faisal Edhi, who heads the Edhi Foundation.  Dr Seemi Jamali -- director of the state-run Jinnah Postgraduate Medical University -- confirmed that nine people were \"brought dead\" to the hospital because of electrocutions. At least 12 people were killed as monsoon rains lashed #Pakistan's port city of #Karachi. https://t.co/wCf0nvnxCv Another three bodies, including the children from the video shared online, were taken to the city's Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, a doctor on duty at the facility confirmed to AFP. The megacity of some 20 million has been inundated with heavy rains since Monday, flooding residential areas and bringing large swathes of Karachi's perennially traffic-congested streets to a halt. \"We are living without electricity and water for the past three days and no official rescue came,\" said 24-year-old resident Qaiser Khan. Hundreds have been killed across South Asia this monsoon season and tens of thousands displaced by the heavy rains.  While the annual rains are crucial to replenishing water supplies in the impoverished region, they often turn deadly."

      "authors": "Reaz Ahmad",
      "text": "The fund will help 300 million smallholder farmers adapt to the impacts of climate change A coalition of donors, aid institutions and philanthropy promised yesterday to invest more than US $650 million to help 300 million smallholder farmers in developing countries including those in Bangladesh adapt to the impacts of climate change. This big investment pledge came at a time when climate change is already eroding crop and livestock production in places like South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The investments from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the European Commission, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany are part of a broader commitment of more than US $790 million to address the impact of climate change on food and agriculture.  The announcement came yesterday at the United Nations Climate Action Summit as a response to a call to action from the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) urging world leaders to mount a massive effort to adapt to conditions that are now inevitable. The GCA is co-chaired by Bill Gates, former United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva. The funding will be funneled through CGIAR (formerly known as consultative group for international agricultural research), which has long been working for the benefits of smallholders across regions including South Asia and Bangladesh.     CGIAR is a global research partnership dedicated to reducing poverty, enhancing food and nutrition security, and improving natural resources for smallholder farmers in the developing world. Investments in CGIAR have proven to be highly cost-effective, generating returns upto $17 for every $1 invested, with significant economic benefits for producers and consumers.  CGIAR's 15 research centers are working as a single unit under its flagship 'Two Degree Initiative for Food and Agriculture'. This 'Two Degree' effort is helping small-scale food producers across the globe adapt their farming systems, livelihoods, and landscapes to weather extremes and embrace production practices that lower emissions. CGIAR's research mandates include readying climate change ready-rice - for instance - new \"scuba rice\" varieties that survive under water for up to 17 days and potentially benefit 18 million farming households and save millions more from hunger.    During floods, farmers in Bangladesh and India lose up to 4 million tons of rice per year--enough to feed 30 million people. Submergence can affect rice crops at any stage of growth, either short-term (flash floods) or long-term (stagnant flooding). The chances of survival are extremely low when completely submerged during the crop's vegetative stage.  Improved varieties incorporated with the SUB1 gene (that withstand flood situation) have shown a yield advantage of 1-3 tons following flooding for 10-15 days. Flood-tolerant varieties that have been released and are now being planted include Swarna Sub1 in India, Samba Mahsuri in Bangladesh, and IR64-Sub1 in the Philippines. CGIAR experts are also developing solar-powered irrigation pumps for large-scale distribution in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The pumps are to be deployed alongside advanced information systems to ensure they can help farmers sustainably adapt to increasingly unreliable rains, but without stressing available water resources. The move comes at a time when government in Bangladesh just charted out a roadmap envisaging plan to replace a third of the countries over 1.3 million diesel-run irrigation pumps by solar pumps.  Elwyn Grainger-Jones, Executive Director of the CGIAR System Organization said: \"The new investments announced today (yesterday) are a recognition that we have just 11 growing seasons between now and 2030 and farmers need a host of new innovations to overcome a growing array of climate threats. This new funding is an important start towards a global effort to substantially increase support for CGIAR activities.\" The investment pledged include, among others: $310 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, $150 million from the World Bank, $110 million from the Netherlands, $100 million from the United Kingdom, $33 million from Switzerland, $35 million from the European Commission, and $16 million from Sweden.

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "'Extreme climatic events such as drought and flashfloods cause severe agricultural losses' A United Nations (UN)report mentioning that climate change threatens child nutrition said that over 19 million children -- a quarter of them under 5 -- spread across Bangladesh are at the front line of climate change disasters. The report says 58.7 million children under 5 were stunted and almost 25.9 million were wasted in South Asia in 2018, adding that more children and young people are surviving, but far too few are thriving, reports UNB. The government of Bangladesh will begin the second phase of its 'Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan' this year, placing greater emphasis on the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable, according to the UN report. The plan will be demanding more attention and resources to ensure that child nutrition, health, education, social protection, and other services are shielded from the effects of climate change. Floods and riverbank erosion are driving families to city slums, where they face overcrowding and a lack of access to adequate health and nutrition services, adequate nutritious food, especially during the first 1,000 days, education, sanitation, hygiene and safe water, according to the Unicef report titled: \"The State of the World's Children (SOWC) 2019: Children, food and nutrition - Growing well in a changing world.\"Villagers look on as a part of an embankment is being washed away by the flood water in Gaibandha |Dhaka Tribune In slums, children must often fend for themselves and are at greater risk of malnutrition, child labour, child marriage, and exposure to pollution, violence and abuse, according to the South Asia section of the global report. Extreme climatic events, such as drought and flash floods, cause severe agricultural losses, it says. In a country where 60 percent of the population counts on agriculture for their livelihood, this means children from the poorest families are most likely to go hungry, according to the report. The reduced production also leads to an increase in food prices, hitting the poorest families the hardest. A rise in communicable and non-communicable diseases, linked to changing climate conditions and unplanned urbanization, also threatens children and their families, Unicef said. These diseases include diarrhea, hepatitis A, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, dengue and chikungunya fever. Ruma, her husband Ali Akbar, and their two children Sunjida, 3, and Shahaun, 9, moved to the Chalantika Slum of Dhaka after their home was repeated flooded by the Meghna River, the report mentioned.  \"At least we can stand on dry ground here even if we struggle with the cost of living,\" she said. \"My husband earns about Tk 7,000 [US$83] a month. By the time we've paid our rent and bought our groceries, there is very little left over. But at least we're able to earn here, which we often weren't able to do when we lived in the village.\" Ruma shares a small kitchen - a few planks of wood atop bamboo poles set in a swamp - with at least 10 other families. While they initially used butane gas, this proved impossible to share equitably. Wood is now preferred, further worsening the slum's air quality. People walking in knee-deep water as flash floods and rainfall inundated low-lying areas in Sunamganj |Dhaka Tribune Her family eats rice and lentils most days, she says, and can occasionally afford meat or fish. Her son, Shahaun, is showing signs of malnourishment. In addition to the arduous challenge of trying to provide her family with healthy food, Ruma describes an unhealthy environment with no access to safe water, basic toilets or adequate hygiene. Electricity in the slum is irregular, and rodents and insects in their single room \"make our lives an absolute misery,\" she says. It is 20 years since the State of the World's Children last examined children's nutrition, and, in that time, much has changed. Unicef's flagship report examines the issue of children, food and nutrition, providing a fresh perspective on a rapidly evolving challenge. Despite progress in the past two decades, one-third of children under age 5 are malnourished - stunted, wasted, or overweight - while two-thirds are at risk of malnutrition and hidden hunger, because of the poor quality of their diets. At the centre of this challenge is a broken food system that fails to provide children with the diet they need to grow healthy. This report also provided new data and analyses of malnutrition in the 21st century and outlines recommendations to put children's rights at the heart of food systems."

      "text": "At least 12 containers of onions are being exported to Bangladesh,\" the official told the daily An English-language Pakistan daily has claimed Bangladesh placed a 300 tons import order to Pakistan, after nearly 15 years of recess as India imposed a ban on export of the kitchen essential. In a report on Friday, The News International said an an official of Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) confirmed that Bangladesh's Tasho Enterprise finalized deals with a Karachi-based Roshan Enterprise in this regard. \"At least 12 containers of onions are being exported to Bangladesh,\" the official told the daily.  Earlier, India slapped a ban on exports of onion to Bangladesh due to its local shortage amid floods, causing a surge in prices to new heights in Bangladesh, as the market was heavily dependent on Indian supply. According to the Pakistani newspaper, the official said Bangladesh is also looking for import options from countries like Turkey, Myanmar, and Egypt to meet the demand in the local market.  The official also said the onion trade was also agreed in government-to-government level talks.  \"This (ban) has created market potential for Pakistan.\"  An exporter believes the export price would be much more viable for Bangladesh considering the current onion price in the market. \"The shipment value from Pakistan would be around $600 a ton,\" Waheed Ahmed, patron-in-chief of All Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exporters, Importers and Merchant Association, said. He said one container carries approximately 28 tons. A TDAP official said Bangladesh is also considering import of dates, grey fabric, and yarn from Pakistani companies. The News International also reports, a government department said trade diplomacy between the two countries generally remained stalled between 2001 and 2006. \"For instance, holding of the Joint Economic Commission (JEC) between Pakistan and Bangladesh is long overdue,\" the commercial wing of Pakistan's High Commission in Dhaka said in a report. The last JEC meeting was held in 2005 in Bangladesh. Moreover, most of the trade diplomacy and major bilateral agreements were made during the previous governments."

      "text": "Skyrocketing onion prices have been brought under control, says minister Industries Minister Nurul Majid Mahmud Humayun has claimed that onion prices, which had skyrocketed, were now under control. \"I believe the onion market which had gone beyond being affordable for the common man, is now under control,\" he said, responding to a supplementary question from BNP MP Jahidur Rahman in Parliament on Tuesday, reports UNB. Humayun answered the question in the absence of Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi.  He said the onion market got overheated due to a supply shortfall caused by India's export ban following flashfloods in the neighbouring country. \"But we have brought the situation under control quickly. We are importing onions from Myanmar and Turkey,\" the minister added. The industries minister said it is a lean season for onions and a crisis usually prevails at this time of the year. \"Our local onions are yet to hit the market. However, they will be available within a few days.\" He also mentioned that the import of onions from India has started again.  The Industries minister added that the government is conducting mobile courts at district and upazila levels to prevent the sale of onions at exorbitant prices.  The Directorate of Consumer Rights Protection and other government agencies are monitoring markets across the country. Replying to a written question from Awami League MP Anwar Khan (Laxmipur 1), he said the annual demand for onions in the country is 2.4m metric tons (MT) against a local production of 23.3m MT. \"Of the produced amount, 30% is damaged during harvesting and improper preservation. That means the total amount stands at 16.31m MT. This deficit is met with imports from India,\" Humayun continued. He said, the onion market suffered seriously due to floods in Maharashtra, India. For that, Indian export prices were raised to US $850 from $250-300. \"Later, they stopped onion exports as prices shot up abnormally. As a result, prices in Bangladesh also saw an upward trend.\" To cool down the market, the minister said, the government has started selling onions in the open market through the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB)."

      "text": "They are rushing to nearby cattle markets ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, but are having to sell their dairy assets off at outrageously low prices to cattle traders Absence of dry space and livestock food has forced several flood victims in Gaibandha to sell off their livestock, namely cows, goats, and lambs, just to make ends meet. They are rushing to nearby cattle markets ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, but are having to sell their dairy assets off at outrageously low prices to cattle traders. This has been due to the devastation left by the floods, as it has also damaged stacks of hays across the district. It led to a shortage of food for the livestock, which is being sold at higher than given price. According to the district's livestock office sources, 4,417 tons of grass has been damaged by the floods over the last two weeks, which is considered to be worth Tk1.42 crore, while 1,320 metric tons of hay has also been damaged. This has put the farmers of Sundarganj, Saghata, Fulchhari, Gobindganj, and Sadar Upazila in jeopardy, as their 72,777 cows, 102 buffaloes, 32,583 goats, and 16,240 lambs now face an acute crisis of food supply. Upon inspecting the Char areas, it was found that several flood victims are living on whatever piece of dry land they have, along with their livestock, all are waiting for buyers to sell them off. In Fulchhari's Balasighat, it was found that several cattle, which were being fattened ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, are deteriorating in health due to lack of food. This has forced their owners to find buyers, and sell them off cheap.  Goats are comparatively more at risk, as the floods are carrying waterborne diseases, which are affecting them quicker than humans, often resulting in deaths. Abdur Rafiq, a resident of Fulchhari's Bhasharpara village, said the hay which he had stored in his courtyard was submerged in water, rendering it unusable as food for his cows. He is now rushing to sell his two cows, and two goats as soon as possible, before they perish. Aminul Miah, a resident of neighbouring Sidhai village, had purchased a calf a year ago for Tk30,000, in hopes of selling it this Eid for a hefty price. But the floods have dashed those hopes, as he is forced to sell it off at whatever price it fetches. Md Faruk Hossain, a lessor of a cattle market in Ratanpur village, said the market has not become as vibrant as expected, due to the floods. But a lot of villagers are swarming in to sell off their livestock, he added. Dr Abdus Samad, Gaibandha livestock officer, said 175 livestock in 17 dairy farms were affected because of the recent floods, with two cows, worth Tk12.60 lakh, reported dead. He said Tk4 lakh has been sent as relief fund from the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, but it is very little compared to the incurred damage."

      "text": "Farmers fear that they will face great losses if the situation persists A Meghna-Dhonagoda irrigation project dyke--a reservoir of water to irrigate rice fields, in Matlab South upazila of Chandpur--has collapsed, flooding nearby rice fields.  Since the collapse of the embankment near Paschim Baishpur union mosque, on Monday afternoon, water has been rapidly pouring into rice fields.  Due to this, many farmers fear that they will incur immense losses, and they are dreading that if the situation persists, around three acres of farmland might become submerged in water. Locals said a large portion of the U1 irrigation dyke--on the east side of the dyke's 6th turnout--collapsed. There embankment began leaking a few days ago, when the canal was full of water. The locals also alleged that they had not seen any officials from the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) take action to repair the leak, which is why the dyke collapsed. They claimed they are in danger of losing their properties and houses-- including their farmland--due to the collapse. As this is the season where the fields will be filled with ripe rice paddies, they will be harmed by this rush of water inflow. However, the upper paddy fields will need water in 10-15days, so if the water reserve dam is not repaired the farmers will face immense losses. An affected farmer, Khokon Mal, 30, from Paschim Baishpur, said: \"About 60% of ripe rice paddies were damaged. When I called the lineman Zahirul Islam of the dyke for that area, he did not appear.\" Another farmer of the area, Nazrul Islam alias Babu, said there was good yield this season, from two of his paddy fields. However, most of the paddies were destroyed when the dyke burst.  Farmer Tofazzel Hossain, 55, said: \"There is excessive water in the dyke, which the rice fields do not need; therefore the dyke broke due to the pressure.\" The Ichhamati Water Management Association--a committee formed by six water management groups--General Secretary and Senior Awami League Vice-President of West Fatehpur Union unit, Khwaja Ahmed, said: \"I arranged the shutdown of the irrigation pump machine after the dam broke. When BWDB Executive Engineer Zakir Hossain and Deputy Assistant Engineer (SO) Salauddin Ahmed were called several times, they did not answer.\" Deputy Assistant Engineer of the Management and Maintenance department in the Meghna-Dhonagoda project, Jamal Hossain, told Dhaka Tribune that this matter was not under his authority. This area is under the authority of our Deputy Assistant Engineer Salauddin.  He said: \"All of us arrived at the spot after getting the news. Water is still entering along the broken portion of the dyke -- a crack around seven-to-eight kilometres-long. We are working on it, and hope that the process of repairing the dyke will be completed in a week. He further said: \"There is no farmland in this area, mostly houses. There is no more crop land, so there was not much harm done. \"Within two days, we hope to remove the excess water from farmland. If that does not work, then we will take other measures. However, this will bring no harm to rice paddies,\" he claimed. Matlab North Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Sharmin Akhter told Dhaka Tribune: \"I arrived at the spot immediately after hearing the news. The repair work will commence at night, therefore, I will be here until the work begins.\" She said: \"Keeping in mind about the possible damage to crops, we are making all out efforts for the repairs.\""

      "authors": "Saqib Sarker",
      "text": "Environmental scientist Jonathan Gilligan talks to Climate Tribune Sea level rise is a concern in all coastal regions in the world. Bangladesh happens to be among the most vulnerable areas. But for all the talk about how vulnerable the country is, the river laden land has evolved to create mechanisms that naturally counter sea level rise. Environmental scientist Jonathan Gilligan says this aspect is often not understood.  This is not to say there is no risk from human induced sea level rise and all the commotion about part of the country submerging underwater deserves less attention. But the geographical area known as Bangladesh has for centuries acted as the big basin that paves the way for the mighty Brahmaputra and Ganges to unite with the sea at the Bay of Bengal. The land has learned how to survive rise of water.  It does so through the fascinating natural mechanism of depositing sediment. That is how it has managed to stay above water for thousands and thousands of years, said Prof Gilligan. But this might change quite soon. An associate professor at Vanderbilt University in the United States, Gilligan studies the interactions between human society and the environment.  His work requires an interdisciplinary approach, and as a result he often works with teams that have social scientists, natural scientists and engineers. The interdisciplinary approach is necessary to understand how the actions of communities affect environment around them and how the changing environment - that is changed both by the actions of the community and also actions from the outside like climate change then affect the livelihood of the community.  \"And by trying to understand the two together, we can then understand better how the environmental change will affect the community and how the community might adapt,\" he said.  Gilligan, who worked in Sri Lanka on how paddy farmers are affected by water scarcity, has carried out a lot of research work in the southwest coastal areas of Bangladesh. \"Climate change has a lot of effects on the ground. My focus primarily is on how the coastal communities are affected by increased flood hazards due to subsidence of the land combined with sea level rise and also how increasing salinity is affecting community,\" he said.  To understand the effects of sea level rise Gilligan looks at how the communities are using their land, how the polders are affecting the changing rivers and how they are affecting the land inside the polder. \"My group is currently studying how the erosion of the river banks and the formation of 'ghashland' is going to affect communities. And how climate change interacts with all the activities along the river; and the combination of the land use and the communities with the sea level rise. You need to understand the combination to understand the effect on the communities.\" Gilligan says the impacts of climate change and sea level rise is going to be very visible in the next 20 to 30 years and they will become increasingly severe through the rest of this century, because the sea level rise is speeding up.  \"But what often doesn't get understood is there's also a tremendous natural resource that Bangladesh has and this is the sediment that is carried in the rivers. Over the last several thousand years there has been natural sea level rise, which is not as severe as the human sea level rise.\" \"But with the natural sea level rise the land has risen at the same rate as the sea level rise, because there is a natural balance between the sea level rise and the sediment that comes  with the rivers and deposit on the land,\" he said.  This will allow Bangladesh to survive natural sea level rise as it has for millenia.  And if the sea level rise does not exceed a certain level the land will simply rise at the same rate as the sea.   \"But if the sea level rise become too rapid or something stops the sediments coming in the river, either of those would mean sea level rise would become much more severe,\" said Gilligan. With the Polar ice melting at unprecedented rates, the worse case scenario is not out of the picture. In fact, as scientists estimate, it is imminent.  \"Some lands can be rescued from the sea level rise, because there's enough sediment to build up the land by several milimetres  per year. The question is how the rivers and the land and the polders are managed to try to get the maximum benefit from that sediment, to raise the land up as much as possible, so that the sea level rise does not drown too much.\" Gilligan is currently studying how the changes from human contribution are affecting migration.  \"There will be migration from places where the rise is too rapid. But migration does not happen just because of environmental stresses. It happens for economic reasons. What becomes very important to understand is that migration can be a valuable response to climate change. But it can also bring economic opportunities to pull people out of poverty,\" he said.  Bangladeshi people have traditionally employed many mechanisms to cope with the natural floods that occur regularly in the delta. Embankments are one of the methods that have been used for many years. A previous study by Gilligan found that embankments across the coastal plain of Bangladesh for preventing tidal inundation of the landscape also caused disruption in sediment flow.  While these embankments were necessary for rice cultivation and to prevent food shortages in Bangladesh, these also cut off Bangladeshi lands from their riverine sediment supply. Consequently, most lands today have subsided far below mean high water levels, making them increasingly susceptible to severe flooding from waterlogging and the impacts of storm surges. The study, where Gilligan was one of the researching scientists, found that embankments constructed since the 1960s are the main reason for lower land elevations along coastal areas in Bangladesh. Within this area, some are experiencing more than twice the rate of the most worrisome sea-level rise projections from the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Disruption to sediment transfer is also likely to happen from river diversion projects by India. The Farakka Barrage has caused significant political tension since the 90s between Bangladesh and its big neighbour. But Farakka actually does not stop sediment flow to any significant level, Gilligan said.  \"The Farakka Barrage has been very controversial. The research by some of my colleagues who I work closely with, they are geologists - that research is suggesting that Farakka Barrage has not been significantly affecting the sediment transport,\" said Gilligan.  However, this will not be the case if India implements its other river diversion projects. \"If India implements the big river diversion project that is being considered, that could have very serious impact. That could divert a lot of sediment out of the river. An it could cause harm to Bangladesh,\" he said.  Jonathan Gilligan is currently developing models to study how the diversion of sediment could affect the adaptive capacity of sea level rise within Bangladesh. "

      "text": "Some residents have already been evacuated after days of monsoon rains lashed the region around the coastal city of Townsville in north Queensland Once-in-a-century flooding in part of the eastern Australian state of Queensland looks set to worsen as the nation's weather bureau on Saturday warned of more heavy rain in the area. Some residents have already been evacuated after days of monsoon rains lashed the region around the coastal city of Townsville in north Queensland, a spokesman for the Bureau of Meteorology said. Adam Blazak, a forecaster with the bureau, did not say how many people had been evacuated, but added that some areas had reached \"major\" flood levels. \"Normally a monsoonal burst might last a few days, but this one's been going on over a week now and is set to continue for a few more days as well,\" he said. Between 150mm and200 mm of rain is expected across Townsville on Saturday - equal to about a month's average rainfall. Local authorities issued a number of flood warnings on Saturday morning and told residents to avoid using roads and consider moving to higher ground if conditions worsen.  North Queensland has significant zinc reserves as well as major deposits of silver, lead, copper and iron ore, with Townsville a major processing centre for the region's base metals. In stark contrast, wildfires in the southern island state of Tasmania have burnt through close to 190,000 hectares of land, fire officials said. Chris Arnold, the chief officer of the Tasmania Fire Service, said on Saturday that nearly 600 personnel were working to contain the fires, some of which have been burning for weeks and have destroyed homes. Arnold told reporters that while the last few days have seen favourable conditions for battling the blazes, communities in part of the state were still under threat as expected hot and dry weather on Sunday could see bushfires escalate again. Australia endured its hottest month on record in January, with sweltering conditions expected to persist through April. That scorching weather triggered power outages in some areas and sent electricity prices soaring."

      "text": "It receives Cabinet Division letter amidst farmers' woes over low paddy prices There seems to be no end in sight to the woes of farmers over low paddy prices. Neither the government nor traders and millers have gone for any big purchase drives.  Though the government has fixed a Tk1,040 support price for each maund (40 kgs) of paddy, farmers across the rice-growing zones in the country are still reporting market prices as low as Tk600.  According to Food Ministry statistics in the first one month of public food grain procurement drives, the government bought less than 2,000 tons of paddy and a little over 100,000 tons of rice up until May 21 this Boro season, where farmers are anticipated to have grown nearly 20 million tons of rice.  Food ministry officials confirmed to the Dhaka Tribune yesterday, that upon receipt of a Cabinet Division letter, the ministry is revisiting the current food procurement system that mostly benefits rice traders and millers, hardly benefiting rice farmers, the primary producers. Amidst a nationwide outcry over farmers getting poor prices for their produce in the current Boro season, the Cabinet Division has sent a letter to the Food Ministry asking them to include a farmer-friendly paddy procurement scheme in the ministry's Annual Performance Agreement (APA) for 2019-20. The 2019-20 APA is scheduled for signing in the presence of the prime minister on July 4, officials confirmed. In the current procurement system, the grassroots level food directorate apparatus is largely buying rice from millers under seasonal agreements, thereby benefiting millers, middlemen, and seasonal rice traders only. Farmers just get a tiny slice of that big support price cake in the form of sales of a few thousand tons of paddy to a few food procurement centres.  Officials said they do not buy paddy from farmers directly mostly because of the high moisture content of paddy, freshly cut from the fields, and they prefer buying the grain from millers after the paddy is dried, husked, and converted to rice. Food Ministry officials told this correspondent that the ministry is now mulling to develop drier facilities and paddy silos across the country so that the food directorate can procure more staple in the form of paddy, directly from farmers, rather than rice from the millers.  \"It's understandable that it will take a year or two to roll out the new plan for direct paddy purchases from farmers, but decisions are being taken in that direction, taking lessons from this year's Boro paddy price fiasco ,\" said a food official on anonymity. Brake on imports With 55% of the country's annual rice output of more than 35 million tons coming from the irrigated Boro rice, farmers are now at the mercy of traders and millers who are not procuring much from them due to a supply glut and carryover stocks, thanks to a liberal import policy long pursued by the government. Only last week, the government finally put a brake on private traders flooding the market with cheaper rice from across the border by imposing a whopping 55% tax on rice imports. Many consider it a late response from the government. Against the officially declared one million ton of crop loss in the 2017 haor floods, the government allowed the import of over four million tons of rice in FY2017-18 and the imported rice was still in the pipeline, until the government finally increased import duties on rice last week. Until there is a paradigm shift in the government's long pursued food procurement policy, there appears to be no respite in sight for farmers in terms of getting a fair price for their produce. This is evident from food statistics procured by the government so far in the current Boro season. Long before farmers started harvesting Boro in late April this year, the government had decided last March that it would buy 1.1 million tons of rice and 150,000 tons of paddy between April 25 and August 31. Interestingly, a month after the official launch date of the food procurement drive, the food directorate purchased less than 2,000 tons of paddy from farmers and a little over 100,000 tons of rice from millers. Farmers across the country, who are projected to have grown 20 million tons of Boro this season, are now going through hard times and suffering a cash crunch amidst very meager government purchases at poor, rock bottom prices from reluctant traders and millers, who already have huge import-fed rice stocks in hand.  In the last financial year (2017-18), the government had announced the purchase of 0.15 million tons of paddy directly from farmers, but ended up buying only 24,000 tons."

      "text": "The Rohingya refugee crisis is putting a great amount of pressure on a country that is already in peril The geographic and socioeconomic characteristics of Bangladesh makes the country particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Around 77% of people in Bangladesh depend on natural resources and the degradation of the natural resources and biodiversity has a direct impact on the livelihood of the people. Further, sea level rise and extreme weather conditions as a result of climate change impacts will be more perilous. Threatening food security, agriculture and affecting the livelihood of the communities, as well as economic impacts would be stronger; Dhaka, the capital, attracting people around the country in search of better work opportunities, would be one of the most climate vulnerable cities in the world.  A combination of factors -- poverty, oppression, safety and better opportunities -- lead to displacement of people and crossing of the national border. Migration of people to a country, which is already climate vulnerable, expands a number of problems, including the environmental concerns that eventually affect the livelihood of people. Rohingya refugees are stateless and one of the most widely persecuted minorities in the world. The violence in Myanmar led one million Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh in 2017. Though, the displacement of people from Myanmar has started since the 1990's. From time to time environmental consequences make the safety and protection of people as well as sustainable use of the resources a massive task. The large influx of Rohingya refugees in the Cox's Bazar District has been putting enormous stress on the local resources and the livelihood, challenging the development, infrastructure, and health care. Crunch and consequences  Rohingya influx in the world's largest and growing refugee camp in the climate vulnerable country has accelerated the pressure on social protection and environmental concerns. Rohingya influx into the Cox's Bazar area has occupied most of the forestland, clearing mostly the hill areas, which is around 6000 acres of forestland in Ukhiya and Teknaf. The camps are accommodating the majority of the population in this particular area. The rapid destruction of forestland for the settlement of people disturbs the overall environment specially the ecological balance. The forest area of Cox's Bazar is also home to protected forest and wildlife habitat. Cutting down of trees for fuel wood and making shelters has been critical. The fuel wood collection was a part of the local community's livelihood survival, but ever since the Rohingya influx, deforestation became rampant. Also, the locals have been affected by the loss of the land and cutting of forest has transformed the hill land. The loss of forest increases the threat of flood, soil erosion, fewer crops, and more importantly, loss of habitat for the variety of species. Aid agencies are struggling to provide assistance to around 1 million Rohingya population and also the needs of host communities to improve poor conditions, provide safety of women and children, and fulfil the basic needs of all. The major issues are regarding social protection, economic assistance for sustenance and health care services. The weather changing conditions, floods, landslides, contamination of water and damages to the shelter do not put the communities in a safe spot. The World Bank announced grant figure of half a million to provide support to Bangladesh for addressing the needs of Rohingya refugees with health, sanitation, disaster risk management, sustainable use of forest, coastal area safety and rural development. Health care of the people due to the conditions of floods, landslides and the following outbreak of waterborne diseases are at a higher risk. Subsequently, the need to educate the vulnerable refugee youth and children is another important factor.   Finding balance amidst the challenges In the climate vulnerable countries with the influx of people it becomes quite challenging to provide social, economic protection and fulfil basic needs at times. In the disaster prone areas where multiple risks are attached, it requires several agencies, both the public and private sector to work together in making the communities climate resilient. Also, monitor changes closely for effective strategies and execution for minimum effect on the livelihood. Making people climate resilient through policy interventions and mainstreaming the major risks is helpful in preparing for the conditions that may arise from time to time. Bangladesh is the first country to have developed a climate resilience program with national level planning and guidelines. The need is to strengthen the institutions with adequate funding arrangements, appropriate execution and fulfilling the human resource requirements for effectiveness.  Policy changes and adjustment in the national level planning, that support the well-being opportunities to support both communities in tourism, salt production and fisheries and promote the sustainable development goals are necessary. Public and private sector's inclusive strategies for development of both communities; from financing for livelihood improvement, education, investment in the various sectors, planning and enhancing the mobility of labour are crucial. Also, conservation management plans for the protection of the environment and continuous improvement of institutional mechanism should be implemented. Improving the economic benefit, as the people are consumers, climate financing for development, provide labour and also skill training etc. The new projects with the climate finance to aim at increasing resilience and also, explore financing opportunities for Green climate fund. International organizations including UNHCR, IMO and UNDP are helping countries to focus on the issue of migration in the national development to enhance community based integration, environmental monitoring, and building capacity at local level. The focus should be equal on the host communities with the refugees for overall mobilizing effort -- handling the tension between the host community and the refugees for the resources, land and opportunities. The need is for multiple stakeholders to collaborate and coordinate for improvement of the social security, in a way the needs of both; the host communities and the Rohingya refugees are considered as well as providing alternative options to put less pressure on the natural resources, which considers both the environment and the people.

      "text": "Importers are importing onions in huge consignments from Egypt and Turkey The Commerce Ministry has said that the overheated onion market is expected to cool down within the next few days, when big consignments of onions from a number of countries will enter the country.  The Commerce Ministry on Monday said some big importers are importing onions in huge consignments from Egypt and Turkey at the ministry's request, reports UNB. Bangladesh has also started importing onions from neighboring Myanmar as an alternative source to keep its price stable in the domestic market with adequate supply, amid India's export ban on the essential kitchen item. Bangladesh is importing onions from Myanmar in two ways - by opening LC and border trade- said the Commerce Ministry, urging businesspeople to increase their import volumes and conduct business while maintaining business ethics. Meanwhile, new onions are expected to hit the domestic market from the third week of November. People buying onion from a truck which is authorized by TCB | Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune Analyzing all the aspects, the Commerce Ministry said, it appears that there is adequate supply of onions in the market. Imported onions are arriving every day. \"Consumers do not need to panic. Onion prices will soon become normal as large consignments will arrive within a couple of days,\" it said.  The Commerce Ministry said it has taken a number of steps to keep the price of onions and its supply normal, as large consignments are coming from alternative sources. Apart from Myanmar, Bangladesh has started importing onions from Egypt and Turkey through opening LCs.  Also Read - OMS onion in Dhaka: Joy for some, disappointment for many The Commerce Ministry said the prices of onions increased recently in Myanmar's market as well, which also had an impact on the Bangladeshi market. On September 29, the Indian government banned the export of onions with immediate effect, till further orders, for what it says is the improvement of domestic availability. On September 13, the minimum export price of $850 per metric tonne was imposed on onion export. The ban on onion export is expected to improve domestic availability and cool prices, said the Indian government.  Bangladesh used to import onions from India mainly due to low price and smooth transportation system. But onion production in India was hampered due to floods in the Indian State Maharashtra and other places, prompting India to impose ban on onion export.   The Commerce Ministry had meetings with onion importers and business people several times, and is in constant touch with importers. Earlier, it was announced that stern action will be taken if any businessperson tries to build stocks of onion illegally, increase price artificially, and hamper the normal supply flow."

      "authors": "A.Z.M. Anas GHIOR, Bangladesh (Thomson Reuters Foundation)",
      "text": "Along the rutted village roads of this sub-district in central Bangladesh, one plant stands out: young palm trees.  Hundreds have been planted since 2017 in an effort to combat one of Bangladesh's fastest-growing disaster threats - a surge in deadly lightning strikes.  In Bangladesh, moist and hot air flowing from the Bay of Bengal and colder, heavier air descending from the Himalayas have long collided in lightning-sparking thunderstorms, said Murad Ahmed Farukh, an environmental scientist at Bangladesh Agricultural University.  But as the atmosphere warms as a result of climate change, and holds more moisture, deadly lightning strikes are happening more frequently than before, turning lightning into one of the South Asian nation's deadliest disasters.  Last year, around 360 people in Bangladesh were killed by lightning strikes - more than by floods or cyclones, according to the nation's disaster ministry. In 2016, 80 people died in a single stormy day.  Ghior is now one of the communities trying to find ways to cut the risks, in part by planting fast-growing palm trees that can divert strikes away from people.  Local authorities began sowing palm seeds in 2017 in response to a call from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who also urged that buildings be constructed with earthing systems, to discharge electricity from lightning strikes to the ground.  Lightning protection measures are now part of the country's national disaster management plan and its National Building Code.  Abdul Baten, an elected official in Ghior, has used $500 from the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief's food-for-work program to grow more than 500 palms, he said.  \"This is a preemptive measure by the government to cut loss of lives to lightning,\" Baten said, standing along a road lined with young palms.  So far, Bangladesh's disaster management department has supported sowing of 4.8 million palms nationwide, exceeding an initial target of 1 million, an agency official said.  RISING FEARS  Still, lightning continues to cause deaths in Ghior sub-district, most recently claiming 55-year-old Mongol Chandra Sarker in August as he walked to a pond to bathe.  Abdul Baten, a 57-year-old farmer, said he now leaves his fields if it begins to rain.  Unlike in the past, \"now we go back home as soon as we see dark clouds in the sky,\" he said.  So does brick kiln worker Abdul Latif, 55, who said he had not heard about climate change but could see the weather getting warmer.  Azad Mia, of nearby Kalia village, blamed the growing lightning menace on the felling of large trees in the area as people created space for new homes or rice fields.  \"Now taller trees such as date palm, betel nut, coconut and fan palm have almost vanished,\" he said, noting that such trees once attracted lightning away from people.  PREVENTING DEATHS  But rising awareness of the risks may have begun to cut the numbers of deaths. As of mid-September, about 180 people had died in lightning strikes this year, down from about 360 last year, according to disaster ministry figures.  Dhaka campaign group Save the Society and Thunderstorm Awareness Forum said by its tally 246 people had died between February and August this year, based on media reports.  In 2017, the death toll was 307, almost double the number in 2015, government data showed.  Mohammad Mohsin, a disaster ministry additional secretary, said as people learned more about the threat they were taking steps to lower their risk.  \"The number one factor is awareness,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, in an interview at his office in downtown Dhaka.  That is playing out in the country's economy, he said. Last year, farmers in Sunamganj, a wetland-dotted northeastern district considered the country's lightning capital, had difficulty finding enough workers at harvest season, he said.  Farukh, the environmental scientist, however, said the introduction of a fast-growing rice in wetland districts - one that can be harvested in April, before the May and June peak lightning season - was likely to save lives.  Besides causing deaths, lightning strikes leave many of their victims permanently impaired with burn scars, hearing loss and neurological difficulties, medical experts say.  Mojibur Rahman, a next-door neighbor of Sarker, the man who died in a lightning strike in August, still suffers hearing loss in his right ear and a burn on his left side after lighting hit him five years ago as he was fishing.  \"I became senseless at the lightning flash,\" said the 35-year old, who now peddles fruit for a living.  \"It was so powerful that the railings of a nearby bridge collapsed,\" the bare-chest man recalled, standing in front of the iron shed where he lives with his wife and three children.  CUTTING RISK  Farukh, who has done lightning mapping in Bangladesh, blames deforestation, worsening air pollution and global warming for the spike in lightning deaths in recent years.  \"Something exceptional is happening in our atmosphere,\" he said.

Abdul Mannan, a meteorologist at the state-run Bangladesh Meteorological Department, said the lightning danger period now extended further through the year, starting as early as February.  He said Bangladesh over decades had managed to bring down once sky-high death tolls from cyclones and flooding, through measures such as better early warning systems and protective structures.  Now the rising death toll from lightning similarly \"has to be prevented\", he said.  Mohsin, of the disaster ministry, noted that Bangladesh's lighting death toll was lower when the country had more large trees, so planting trees could be one step.  Scientists warned, however, that as trees take time to grow, the planting push may not provide protection for many years, and other changes may be needed in the meantime.  Trees are \"a long-term resilience measure. Will you wait for another 25 years?\" asked Farukh. \"Many farmers and fishermen will die by then.\"  He estimated that 80% of lightning victims are farmers and fishermen who need to work outside.  Aware of the planting project's limitations, the government also is pushing other measures, including putting in place lightning diverters - tall poles that can attract strikes and protect people within 90 meters (300 feet) of them.  It also hopes to build concrete lightning shelters in areas prone to strikes, Mohsin said.

      "text": "DUMC begins free dengue identification service for students A total of 13 students among 168 of the university have been marked as dengue positive on the first day of the installation of a dengue detection machine in Dhaka University's Medical Centre (DUMC). The students were provided with a free test to know their platelet count from their blood samples on Wednesday.  \"Both the blood platelet count and dengue identification can be done here for students free of cost. The daily capacity of the device is 150. It is operated by the Bangladesh Association of Clinical Biochemists,\" said DUMC Chief Medical Officer Dr Sarwar Jahan Muttafi.  Acknowledging the lack of sufficient numbers of dengue testing devices at the centre, Dr Sarwar said: \"We will start our service for the students from 8am every day. Students are perhaps unhappy with our services due to excessive pressure in the medical centre.\"  The dengue detection device was brought to the DUMC on Sunday amid growing dengue-panic in the university campus. A draft count by the university students claimed that around 150 students are suffering from dengue staying on campus.  Most of them are first year students and staying in rooms of the dormitories. General students along with leftist student wing Bangladesh Chhatra Union DU chapter demanded that the campus be shut down to prevent the spread of the mosquito-borne disease. Dhaka University Vice Chancellor Prof M Akhtaruzzaman said: \"Dengue and floods has spread across the country. How can we leave our students in such a situation as we are their present guardians?\""

      "text": "On Monday, Indonesia's disaster agency confirmed 29 deaths and said at least 13 more people were missing in Sumatra island's Bengkulu province Floods sparked by torrential rains have killed nearly 40 in Indonesia with a dozen more still missing, officials said Monday, marking the latest calamity for a disaster-prone nation. Landslides and floods are common during the monsoon season between October and April, when rains lash the vast Southeast Asian archipelago. On Monday, Indonesia's disaster agency confirmed 29 deaths and said at least 13 more people were missing in Sumatra island's Bengkulu province. A landslide triggered by heavy rain in neighbouring Lampung province on Saturday also killed a family of six. Meanwhile, flooding in and around parts of the capital Jakarta last week killed at least two people, forced more than 2,000 to evacuate their homes and set 14 pet pythons on the loose. In Bogor, a satellite city of Jakarta, residents had to contend with the prospect of coming face to face with the giant serpents, after they were set loose from a private property due to the high waters. Six of the snakes - which were as long as four metres 13ft - have been found, but eight were still missing, officials said at the weekend. \"If you find them please report it to authorities or volunteers,\" said Indonesian disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. That was not much comfort for some Bogor residents. \"We're terrified to hear this,\" said Samsudin, who goes by one name. \"Apparently they're very big so we want authorities to help us find them or take action.\" Illegal mining In Sumatra, some 12,000 residents have been evacuated from water-logged Bengkulu with hundreds of buildings, bridges and roads damaged.  Authorities have set up temporary shelters and public kitchens for those displaced by the rains. Hardest hit was Bengkulu Tengah district, just outside of the provincial capital, where 22 people were killed along with hundreds of livestock.  Illegal coal mining was partly to blame for deadly landslides, authorities said. \"Apart from natural factors like the heavy rain, (the flooding) was also caused by human activity that destroys the environment,\" disaster agency head Doni Monardo told reporters in Bengkulu on Monday.  Activists have long warned deforestation from rampant mining in the province could trigger a catastrophe.  At least four major rivers in Bengkulu overflow every time it rains due to environmental damage near their banks, activists said. \"The flooding in Bengkulu was made worse by the severe damage caused by coal mining,\" Ali Akbar from local environmental group Kanopi Bengkulu said in a statement. Illegal mining was blamed for killing dozens on the island of Sulawesi in March when a makeshift mine collapsed. Mineral-rich Indonesia has scores of unlicensed mines - many with complete disregard for even the most basic safety procedures.  Also in Sulawesi this year, some 70 people were killed by floods and landslides that wiped entire villages off the map. Nearly 10,000 people were displaced. Last month, some 112 people died and more than 90 remain missing after torrential rains pounded Indonesia's Papua region, triggering landslides and flash floods. Indonesia, a nation of some 17,000 islands, is one of the most disaster-prone nations on Earth. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are a common occurrence."

      "text": "Bangladesh stands as one of the greatest success stories in humanity's history, and its success is no doubt an indication of the resilience of the Bangladeshi people On this day, 48 years ago, through the sacrifice of millions of brave souls, a new country was born.  And since then, Bangladesh -- born of much struggle and a bloody war of independence, but with the flickering hope of the values on which it was founded -- has risen throughout the next five decades, on the precipice of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the most prosperous nations in the world. Having said that, our country's journey throughout these 48 years has been far from easy. It has gone through immense struggle -- be it famines, floods, autocracy, and our ever-present problem of corruption. But no one can deny Bangladesh's place as a nation today, in the world and in the hearts of its people, a country brimming with potential, a nation full of opportunities. Bangladesh stands as one of the greatest success stories in humanity's history, and its success -- be it in providing food and shelter to the people, in reducing the child mortality rate, in providing education to its children, or its immensely successful economy which continues to boom at an unprecedented rate -- is no doubt an indication of the resilience of the Bangladeshi people.  This success would not have been possible if we had not learned our lesson from the oppressive Pakistan Army forces who wished to extinguish our spirit -- and one of the most heinous methods they tried to achieve that goal was perhaps their systematic killings of our intellectuals, the very best of our nation. But through understanding the values upon which Bangladesh was founded -- that of democracy, secularism, equality -- did we manage to rise from the ashes of our martyred brothers and sisters as a nation that is stronger and is now well on its way towards true prosperity. Of course, that is not to say Bangladesh will not face obstacles in the coming years. Corruption continues to be an ugly ever-present force in our governance, and poverty remains all too real for too many in the country. But if we chose to honour the values on which the Father of the Nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman envisioned this nation, our success is nothing if not inevitable. It is through our remembrance that we honour the countless people who gave their lives for this country, and it is through our success that we continue to ensure that they live on in our actions."

      "text": "The project, which is scheduled to be completed this year, is being implemented by the Bangladesh Navy Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh are seemingly in the dark on the benefits, risks, and probable side-effects of relocation to the remote island of Bhashan Char, located in an estuary of the Meghna river. The Bangladesh government assures a comfortable living for the relocated Rohingyas on the island, though the community appears to be unconvinced. By the government's plan, 103,200 Rohingyas out of more than a million currently sheltered in the cramped camps of Cox's Bazar will be moved to Bhashan Char under a project with an estimated cost of over Tk2,312 crore. The project, which is scheduled to be completed this year, is being implemented by the Bangladesh Navy. Bhashan Char, also known as Thengar Char, is located 21 nautical miles from Noakhali, 11 nautical miles from Jahajir Char, 4.2 nautical miles from Sandwip, 28 nautical miles from Patenga, and 13.2 nautical miles from Hatia. The only mode of commute for residents of Bhasan Char, located 30km away from the mainland, will be vessels that take three to three-and-a-half hours to travel from Hatia. Despite the reservations of both the Rohingyas and the international community, the government is still hopeful that the plan will help manage the massive refugee population in a disciplined manner. One of the main concerns raised by Rohingyas against Bhasan Char is that they fear the island can be washed away by tidal surges. The area, declared a forest reserve in 2013, is 10,000 acres at high tide and 15,000 acres at low tide. No one has ever lived on the island before. It was mostly used for cattle grazing until the construction of shelters for the Rohingyas began.   The Rohingya community is also concerned that the relocated members will be cut off from NGOs and the international community currently working in Cox's Bazar camps, providing food, shelter, education, and medical health care. However, authorities say a very healthy and comfortable life, facilitated by the government itself, is waiting for the Rohingyas in Bhashan Char if they relocate.  Noakhali Deputy Commissioner Tanmoy Das said the Rohingyas may harbour these fears because of the separation from Cox's Bazar. As a solution, a small number of refugees will be taken to the island beforehand to see the real scenario, so they can convince others to relocate. Concrete homes and flood defence Government officials are very optimistic about the relocation plan. They believe the Rohingya people would find the place suitable once they start living there. According to the plan approved in November 2017, there will be 120 cluster villages with 1,440 houses to house the displaced Rohingyas. The houses will be built four feet above the ground, in order to protect the refugees from high tidal waves. Each of the houses will have concrete breeze-block rooms measuring 2m x 2.5m with small barred windows, which are more habitable than the camps in Cox's Bazar. In order to protect the site from tidal floods and natural disasters, the island will have a 13km flood defence embankment, with a height of three metres and a width of 37 metres on a layer by layer basis. \"The 14 feet double embankment has been built to deal with tidal surges,\" said Noakhali DC.  There will also be 120 cyclone centres to protect the Rohinygas from cyclones, according to the plan. The ground floor of the cyclone shelters is four feet above the ground and the first floor is 10 feet above the ground floor. Refugees on the first floor of the shelters should be safe from tidal surges up to a height of 14 feet. The shelter houses, whenever required, will also be used as clinics and community centres, said DC Tanmoy Das. There will be modern hospital facilities, educational institutions, playgrounds for Rohingya children, and prayer houses for the community.  Currently, 22 people use one toilet in crowded camps in Cox's Bazar which will stand at one toilet for 11 people in Bhashan Char. To ensure pure drinking water, there will be deep tube wells for the residents. There will be a jetty, a dam, a fire service unit, and a meteorological office on the island. Solar power systems will be installed to ensure 24-hour electricity for residents. There will be perimeter fencing and watch towers will also be built to ensure security for the rehabilitation project. A police camp has already been built there. \"There is also a silo there which will preserve food for the community,\" said Das. 'Bhashan Char will give them economic freedom' Assuring the Rohingya people of a better living compared to the current life they are leading, Noakhali Deputy Commissioner Tanmoy Das said the island has been developed in a way that can not only ensure a comfortable living, but also help Rohingya people develop their lives socially and financially. \"They can choose to work here. We have developed the island in a way that they can work in cottage industries, agricultural work, fish farming, and animal husbandry. They can even set up shops here. It will make them economically independent,\" said Das. Some non-government organisations have already been contacted to purchase products produced by the community on the island, and to sell then outside with proper branding, he added. \"The Rohingyas can generate savings by doing this sort of work, and it will help them when they go back to Myanmar,\" said the Noakhali DC. Mohammad Abul Kalam, refugee relief and repatriation commissioner, said they will first take a delegation of Rohingyas to the island so they can see the development with their own eyes and convince others. Secretary to the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry, Md Shah Kamal, told the Dhaka Tribune that the island will ensure a much better livelihood for the Rohingyas. \"Primarily we aim to take 100,000 people there. They will be able to lead humane lives with all necessary facilities there,\" he said. The secretary said the island is ready to receive new inhabitants, but could not say when the relocation process would begin."

      "headline": "Sylhet division rivers face severe navigability crisis",
      "authors": "Mohammed Serajul Islam, Sylhet",
      "text": "The crisis is exacerbated by a lack of major dredging operations  The navigability of rivers in Sylhet district is at an all-time low, due to the inflow of silt carried by Indian floodwaters. A lack of regular dredging efforts has also contributed significantly to this particular problem. Numerous river islands have appeared in almost all rivers across the district; especially in the Surma, one of the largest rivers in Sylhet division.  This phenomenon has caused the river flow to further decrease in the dry season.  According to information from the Sylhet divisional commissioner's office, Maharam Patla river of Sunamganj's Tahirpur upazila is nearly dead because of the sediment. The biodiversity of Sunamganj's Jadukata, Rakti, Patlai, Boulai, and Maharam rivers is threatened by the illegal and unplanned occupation of river islands and land surrounding the river. Biodiversity of rivers endangered There are 36 rivers in Sylhet division, according to information published on the website of the divisional commissioner. They are the: Surma, Piyain Gange, Sari Gowain, Bagra Gange, Naowa Gange, Shyola, Dhamalia, Monai, Borodal, Juri Monu, Dholai, Longla, Karangi, Khowai, Sutang, Kushiyara, Madhabpur, Mahasing, Khajanchi, Bhottokhal, Kalni, Jamalpur, Boraba river, Lobha, Hari, Bogapani, Dhariyana, Dhoyai, Jadukata, Dhola-Dholai Gange, Gopla-Longol, Mogai-Chalti, Rakti, Poinda, Bhera Mohona, and Dhanu Bolai. Sylhet Additional Divisional Commissioner Mrinal Kanti Deb told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Drives are being conducted in Habiganj, Sunamganj, and Moulvibazar--as well as in Sylhet's Bishwanath upazila--to evict the illegal occupiers from the river islands.\" He said there will be a meeting by the River Protection Commission in Sylhet this month; where they will discuss the steps necessary in order to protect the rivers. National River Protection Commission Chairman Mujibur Rahman Howladar, at one of the commission's meetings a few days ago, said: \"As Bangladesh is geographically lower than its neighbouring country, India, the country faces many natural disasters, including flash floods, due to mudslides from hilly areas.\" Consequently, rivers face navigability issues and their direction flow changes as the depth of the water decreases. This is because river islands emerge as sediment amasses on the river beds, he added. National River Protection Commission General Member Md Alauddin said the rivers' environmental balance is being disrupted by the emergence of these river islands and their illegal acquisition, threatening the biodiversity of those rivers.  Bangladesh Water Development Board's (BWDB) Executive Engineer of Sylhet unit Md Sirajul Islam said: \"I believe that, every year, the navigability of Sylhet's rivers decreases by half a metre due to the inflow of silt from India.\" He furthered that India's Barak river flows into streams through the Surma and Kushiyara at Bangladesh's Amalsid point. As the Surma river's source has filled with silt, most of the water flows through the Kushiyara river, resulting in horrific erosion on the river banks.  River water flow disrupted The BWDB official also said the Piyain river--the trans-boundary river of India and Bangladesh that used to flow down from India's Omghat--has already filled with sediment. Thus, this river is flowing through the Dawki river. At Amalsid point, the Surma river is flowing in the opposite direction and has taken a right turn; and Kushiyara is also flowing in the same alignment. Some 60% of the water inflow from India flows through the Surma river and the remaining 40-35% flows through the Kushiyara river; the inconsistency of water flow is causing the silt deposits and erosion. Huge river islands have started to emerge at the source of the Surma river, almost killing  the upper Surma. Of the 53 kilometres of this river, 26 kilometres flow along the border--which is creating immense pressure on the Kushiyara river--causing river erosion on its banks, the BWDB official added. Sirajul Islam furthered: \"If dredging operations are executed on the upper Surma river-- with the consent of both India and Bangladesh's government--then the navigability crisis, environmental-ecological problems, and other inconveniences might be averted. \"All the silt from landslides, mudslides, or flow from upstream is depositing on Bangladesh's side of the river.\" He said since water flow is higher in the upper Surma channel--than its capacity to uphold the flow--river islands are being created near the piers of all the bridges on the channels, while the velocity of the flow decreases. Due to this, a whole town of Kanaighat was flooded in three hours last year, he added. Describing basin management as the key to the river's condition, the BWDB executive engineer said: \"The river basin is not in my country, so how should I manage that? This problem does not even have a scientific solution.\"  According to information on river research by Sylhet Agricultural University's Soil Science Department Professor, also the Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, Dr Md Abul Kashem, every year 800,000,000 million tonnes of sand and silt are deposited in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is facing frequent floods now, whereas it only used to flood every five to seven years due to the overflowing river bodies. He stated that apart from Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, and Habiganj, silt from India flows through 57 upazilas of seven districts--including Brahmanbaria, Kishoreganj and Netrokona--into the Meghna river, crossing near Brahmanbaria's Titas, old Brahmaputra, and Bhairab. However, the depth of all three points through which silt is carried has decreased, causing frequent flooding every year. He said: \"There have been no major dredging operation on rivers in the eastern region of Bangladesh, because of this, it is difficult to avoid the crisis.\" "

India's monsoon season that begins in June usually starts to retreat by early September, but heavy rains have continued across parts of the country this year, triggering floods. An official said that at least 93 people had died in most populous Uttar Pradesh since Friday after its eastern areas were lashed by intense monsoon showers. Rising water levels forced authorities to shift 900 inmates from a prison in eastern Ballia district, police officer Santosh Verma said. This is the first time since 1960 that the monsoon will remain active till mid-October. https://t.co/EyRY4LBMOk In neighbouring Bihar, an impoverished agrarian region that was hit by floods earlier this year, the death toll from the latest bout of rain had reached 20 on Monday, a state government official said.  Bihar's capital city of Patna, home to around 2 million, has been badly hit, with waist-deep flood waters across many streets, and entering homes, shops, and even the wards of a major hospital. In some parts, authorities deployed boats to rescue residents. At least 100 people have died in northern India over the last three days in unusually heavy late monsoon rains which have submerged streets, hospital wards and houses, officials say.https://t.co/MaCaJU4R4h \"The rains have stopped but there is waterlogging in many areas,\" Bihar's Additional Secretary in the Disaster Relief Department Amod Kumar Sharan said. In its bulletin on Monday, India's Meteorological Department said the intensity of rainfall over Bihar was very likely to reduce. Showers in Uttar Pradesh are also expected to abate this week. Weather department officials said this month that monsoon rains were likely to be above average for the first time in six years."

      "text": "Preventive and curative measures have been recommended to handle the issue Aminul was only nine years old when his family was forced to leave their home on the island of Bhola--at the mouth of the Meghna River--after incessant rains resulted in massive soil erosion and floods. His father left his mother and him with relatives to go in search of a livelihood and Aminul never saw him again. Now 30, Aminul is a drug peddler in the slums of Dhaka. He says he had no choice. He came to the big city when he was 11, in search of his father, and tried to eke out a living at the Sadarghat Launch Terminal, the bustling river port in the city, by being a baggage handler and waste collector. \"It was very harsh. I was beaten and tortured by unknown people...I slept many days without food, and later I became addicted to sniffing glue. The glue helped to control my hunger, as well as numb my body so that I did not feel any pain when I was physically abused,\" he told Dhaka Tribune. Then one day, he found a saviour. A man found him injured and brought him away to the Karwan Bazar slum; a man who introduced him to drugs and gave him a livelihood. \"This man was bad but he took care of me, saved me from those animals who used to beat me brutally or sexually abuse me on the streets,\" he said.  Explaining why he became involved with crime, Aminul said: \"I was physically and sexually abused. I never found my father, and my mother also died. The man who found me was bad. This life is bad, I agree. But, there was no one to protect me except him. I also wanted a decent life.\" A recent Unicef study, published on April 5, found that climate change threatens the lives of 19 million Bangladeshi children. The report said climate change is a key factor in pushing poorer Bangladeshis to abandon their homes and communities to try and rebuild their lives elsewhere. Many head to Dhaka and other major cities, where children risk being pushed into dangerous forms of labour and into early marriages.  Why internal migration happens Bangladesh is located downstream of three large river basins: the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna river basins. Heavy rainfall during the monsoon period is the main cause of flooding which occurs almost every year, with a devastating flood every 5-8 years, according to the country's Flood Forecasting and Warning centre. The river bank erosion and displacement from char land--which is vulnerable--results in the displacement of large amounts of people who migrate to major cities or nearby towns in search of a livelihood.   \"Suddenly they do not know where to go, and many of them move to major cities like Dhaka where they end up in slums,\" said Dr Atiq Rahman, executive director of think-tank Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS). Forced migration is a hugely traumatic event and migrants do not always get to choose how to live. \"Very often, displaced people are extremely responsible; they are making a living. But, because their family structure is under threat, areas are new, there may be some who might be dislodged or might be lured by others into minor criminal activity,\" Dr Atiq said. \"Now, the next issue is climate change-induced displacement. Climate change is a much more recent phenomenon. Some people say climate change has not started in a full-blown way. Some say the beginning of a half-hazard has started,\" he added. A large number of street children come to urban areas from disaster-prone areas, according to Moniruzzaman Mukul, deputy program manager of Manusher Jonno Foundation (MJF), who has worked with them for decades. \"In Sadarghat area, most of the street children come from Barisal division, Chandpur, and other river basin areas. In the Dhaka slum, we have found the same scenario, those who migrate from bitter effects of climate change,\" he said. The slum census of 2014, identified frequent natural calamities and river erosion as the potential reason for rural to urban migration, he added. Children, abuse and crime  According to Bangladesh Shishu Odhikar Foundation, 148 children came under law enforcement supervision in 2018, who were involved in crime like: rape, murder, kidnapping, drug peddling, purse snatching, sexual harassment, and others.   Moniruzzaman said: \"In the slums, children are unaccompanied during the day, as the parents are engaged in work elsewhere. Boys are pushed into work on the streets. The slum census of 2014 reports that around 71% of girls are married-off before the age of 18, and more the 60% of the slum dwellers do not even pass eighth grade.\" According to Department of Narcotics Control (DNC), around 200 drug peddlers were arrested at the Karwan Bazar slum. Khorshid Alam, DNC assistant director, told Dhaka Tribune that the drug business at Karwan Bazar slum usually starts in the evening, till midnight. He added: \"We have also seen abused children become drug carriers. We bring children to our treatment centre or refer them to a social welfare rehabilitation center.\" Assistant Director (Operation) of NDC Md Bazlur Rahman said the number of narcotics cases has increased but there is no data or research done on how many children are involved.  \"Children are never suspected. Hence, slum children or drifting children are an easy choice for drug peddlers to use as carriers,\" said Md Bazlur.  Chief Consultant of Central Drug Addiction Treatment Centre Dr Syed Emamul Hossain emphasized that street and floating children are vulnerable to social protection. \"Street or floating children from slums or city streets, I found here, most do not have a family. Some of their parents left them on the streets. Some parents got divorced. When they do not find any other means to live a decent life, they become easy targets for abuse,\" said Dr Emamul. What can be done? Dr Emamul suggested someone determine from where, and why, these children are coming to city streets or slums, and urged that proper protection measures be taken for them.  MJF Deputy Program Manager Moniruzzaman also suggested that two types of measures--preventive and curative--be used to deal with the future challenge. Preventive measures: *    Strengthen standing committees in the local government system. The members of the Union Parishad know the problems in their communities, so they can help identify vulnerable families to address the problem *    Initiate a mass-awareness raising program *    Improve village economies, for example, by expanding agro loans, developing local entrepreneurship, and improving access for vulnerable groups to public resources, etc. *    Prepare database and rationing services Curative measures: *    Extend services, and create information hub   *    Create rehabilitation centre for street children *    Undertake ward-wise service mapping"

      "text": "The climate crisis is also a human rights issue, the 16-year-old says With every passing year, the number of people suffering due to climate change issues is increasing.  According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the concentration of planet-warming CO2 in the atmosphere has reached levels not seen in three to five million years. The adverse effects of climate change has compelled youth activists like Greta Thunberg and Rebeca Sabnam to voice their concerns about the crisis the world is facing. Greta is known to all because of her speech about climate change, but there are many more activists like her whose stories are yet to be told. Sixteen-year-old Rebeca Sabnam is a Bangladeshi origin US citizen. She is one of the youths trying to raise their voice and contribute to the process of saving the world. The high school student lives in New York with her family, who migrated to America when she was six years old. In September this year, more than 200,000 people marched in Manhattan for an environmental demonstration for climate change action.  Rebecca stood in front of a crowd of thousands during the march and shared her experience of the effects of climate change.   She recalled the times when her uncle had to carry her to school on his back during floods in Dhaka, reports Al Jazeera. Rebecca said: \"I am from Bangladesh, a country that exemplifies how interconnected the climate emergency is to racial justice and poverty.\" Later, while talking to Al Jazeera, Rebecca said she did not expect much response when she mentioned Bangladesh in her speech, but instead she got an overwhelming response from the crowd.  \"The climate crisis is not just an environmental issue, it's an urgent human rights issue,\" she said. The 16-year-old said: \"Bangladeshi women are extremely vulnerable to post displacement trafficking, magnified by the climate crisis. We want Bengali women, as well as the Rohingya people living in Bangladeshi refugee camps, to know that youth around the world are striking for their lives and security.\" Leaders from across the world, including Bangladesh, come together in Madrid, Spain, for the UN Climate Change Conference, COP25.  World leaders will deliberate on the environmental crisis facing humanity in the 12-day conference, which began on Monday. A wide range of issues, including the global tourism industry's work to implement climate-friendly initiatives, tracking progress on the Paris Climate Agreement 2016, will be discussed in COP25. According to a Unicef report published in April, around 19 million Bangladeshi children are at risk due to climate change disasters such as floods and cyclones. Two weeks before the conference began, Rebecca told Al Jazeera: \"We want COP25 to not simply take note of [the] alarming data [on the rise in temperature], but to advocate for the end of the funding, expansion, and use of fossil fuel.\" In the September speech in New York, she stressed on the need to understand how the effects of climate change intersect with some of the most vulnerable communities around the world. Her focus of the journey ahead is to try and figure out a way to use the current momentum and put Bangladeshi women, children, and Rohingya refugees at the forefront of the global climate change debate. Rebecca said she is trying to ensure that Bangladesh is not forgotten along the way after the Climate Strike.

Dr Kaikaus urged journalists to create awareness in people not to believe any rumour about power disruption. However, he added there might be some cases of supply disruption in some areas due to floods as power transformers have gone under water but there is no possibility of a countrywide black out. Unique Group signed a contract with the government on Wednesday to set up a 584MW combined cycle power plant in Meghnaghat in the next three years on a build-own-operate (BOOT) basis.

The premier said this while delivering her speech at a joint meeting of Awami League Advisory Council and the Central Working Committee at her official residence Ganabhaban on Friday, reports UNB.  She said the government's resilience and strength in putting Bangladesh in the current position stems from the people of the country and their support.   \"The way Bangladesh is advancing, I think we need to build up the organizations more strongly,\" she said.   In this connection, she reckons that while Awami League was in the opposition, it developed plans as a political party on how to advance the country.   \"We have to take preparations and move forward gradually. We must put behind memories of difficulties and hardship, in order to consolidate Awami League stronger, we need to build public consensus,\" she said.    The prime minister said development narratives and tested knowledge in promoting better governance in the country need sharing in a coordinated way that will help the country move forward.   Over the past ten years, the prime minister said the government continued its development trends at a considerable pace.   \"We never stumbled on our way to development. This is the most important thing,\" she said.  Criticizing a section of the society, the premier said they always down play the government's achievement in a typical way.   Talking about recent rains and the possibility of floods, Sheikh Hasina said the government is well aware of the situation. \"We are collecting information from different parts of the country,\" she emphasized. Sheikh Hasina also asked party leaders and activists to remain in full preparedness to deal with possible floods in the country."

      "text": "Earlier in 2017, Bangladesh's position was 84th with a score of 2.035 Bangladesh has dropped nine places again in the latest worldwide ranking of independent states and territories with reference to their levels of peacefulness. According to the 2019 Global Peace Index (GPI) released in London yesterday by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), the country has been ranked 101st out of 163 countries with a global score of 2.128. Last year, its position was 93 with a score of 2.084. Earlier in 2017, Bangladesh's position was 84th with a score of 2.035.  Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008. It is joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Austria, Portugal, and Denmark. Afghanistan is now the least peaceful country in the world, replacing Syria, which is now the second least peaceful. South Sudan, Yemen, and Iraq comprise the remaining five least peaceful countries. Peacefulness in the Asia-Pacific region improved by 3 per cent, but the region also experienced a higher number of refugees, terrorism, and higher levels of internal conflict, said the report. Among South Asia countries, Bangladesh remains in fourth place leaving behind India (2.605), Pakistan (3.072) and Afghanistan (3.574), and now sits behind Bhutan (1.506), Sri Lanka (1.986) and Nepal (2.003). It said peacefulness improved in 86 countries while it deteriorated in 76 countries. Billion people facing high exposure to climate change effects Nearly a billion people are facing climate change hazards globally, with the Asia-Pacific region housing twice as many people living in areas with high exposure than all other regions combined.  Discover the state of peace today with our website dedicated to the 2019 Global Peace Index.Read the latest research about climate change, perceptions of leadership, the economic cost of violence and wellbeing here: https://t.co/qEXSicxfLI pic.twitter.com/OPa2mrHhGh As shown in the Global Risk 2019 report, the top nine countries -- Philippines, Japan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, China, Indonesia, India, Vietnam, and Pakistan-- are facing the highest risk of multiple climate hazards. The report said an estimated 971 million people live in areas with high or very high exposure to climate hazards including cyclones, floods, bushfires, desertification and rising sea levels. Overall, the report found global peace improved for the first time in five years and the economic impact of violence also fell, although the world remains less peaceful than a decade ago. Military expenditure, violent protests, and violent crime, all decreased globally this year, particularly in Asia. While the percentage of GDP spending on defence decreased in two out of every three countries over the past decade, the US and China have continued to rapidly increase their military spending. The 13th edition of the Global Peace Index (GPI) measured the peacefulness of 163 independent states and territories. The GPI covers 99.7 per cent of the world's population, using 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators from highly respected sources, and measures the state of peace using three thematic domains: the level of Societal Safety and Security, the extent of Ongoing Domestic and International Conflict, and the degree of Militarisation. According to the latest report, global peacefulness improved very slightly in the 2019 GPI with average country scores improving by 0.09 per cent."

Our correspondents in Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari reported that people are marooned in several places due to heavy flooding, caused by the rain. Meanwhile, nearly 3,400 makeshift houses in the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar were destroyed due to the rain, killing two people and rendering more than 2,700 refugees homeless, according to a press statement issued by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN migration agency, Cox's Bazar office. In Rangamati, chunks of mud collapsed on tin-shed houses in Kalabagan of the Karnaphuli Paper Mill area, in the district's Kaptai upazila, around 12:30pm yesterday. Speaking to Dhaka Tribune, Kaptai police station OC Md Nasir Uddin said when informed, fire fighters from the local Fire Service office rushed to the spot and rescued four people - a woman named Tahmina Akter, 25, her parents Md Gafur, 54, and Bilkis Begum, 43, and a child named Surya Mallik, 6 - from the debris of the crushed houses. They were sent to the Christian Hospital Chandraghona in Kaptai, where the doctors on duty pronounced Tahmina and Surya dead. Tahmina's parents are undergoing treatment at the hospital. The local met office recorded 170mm rainfall in Rangamati from 6am on Sunday to 6am yesterday. Another landslide was reported at Bamechhara in the Langadu upazila yesterday afternoon, with no report of casualties. But the road communication between Langadu and Khagrachhari's Dighinala upazila was suspended. Langadu Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Prabir Kumar Roy, while inspecting the damage at the spot, said: \"A small hill collapsed on the road, which is why vehicular movement is suspended for now. We will start removing the debris once the rain lets up a little.\" In another incident of landslide, at least 14 kilometres of road between Ruma and Thanchi upazilas in Bandarbanwere blocked yesterday, affecting communication in the area. Meanwhile, at least 30 tourists are stranded in different tourist spots in the district as the water in Sangu River has surpassed the safe level after four days of rain. Speaking to Dhaka Tribune, Thanchi police station OC Zubayerul Haque said: \"There were 25 tourists in Thanchi's Jinnah Para area, four of whom travelled to Thanchi sadar today [yesterday]. We suspect there are more tourists stranded in Remakri area.\" Local sources said communication through the Sangu were suspended on Friday, while traffic on land routes is also suspended due to the heightened risks of landslides. Local administration has set up 126 shelters and asked the locals to move in for safety. In Khagrachhari, the district administration has issued emergency warning, urging locals to move away from areas vulnerable to landslides.  Speaking to Dhaka Tribune, Khagrachhari Deputy Commissioner Md Shahidul Islam said shelters in all nine upazilas are open and ready to accommodate people in case of a disaster. He further said more than 800 families were living in vulnerable foothills across the district, and the administration is working to evacuate them to the shelters.     In Chittagong, the district administration opened 10 shelters where people living in risky areas can take refuge to avert landslide-related casualties. Chittagong Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Kamal Hossain said they were asking the people living at locations with risk of landslides to move to safer places as a precaution. On Sunday, the officials moved 34 families, who are at risk of landslide, from the Modhu Shah hills near the Jalalabad Housing Society in Chittagong city. On July 3, 50 families from the hills near Akbar Shah area were evicted. The district administration has so far listed 835 families who are living on the 17 most vulnerable hills. According to the Weekly Regional Humanitarian Snapshot of UN Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), between July 1 and July 7, 136 incidents of natural disasters were reported in Cox's Bazar, affecting 18,000 people in the refugee camps. 2 Rohingyas killed, 2,700 displaced in Cox's Bazar Five days of heavy rains and winds destroyed more than 3,400 houses in the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar, killing at least two people and displacing over 2,700, according to an IOM statement issued yesterday. \"We are only half way into the monsoon season and helped over 2,000 people in the past 72 hours. Our teams have been working round the clock,\" IOM spokesman George McLeod said in the statement. Preliminary damage estimates have already exceeded those recorded in 2018, he added. Records from rain gauges between July 3-5 in the Kutupalong mega camp showed 510 mm, while Camp 16 - another major settlement - recorded 530 mm. IOM preliminary damage data covering the period of July 2-6 includes 1,186 households affected by landslides, 216 households impacted by flooding, 1,840 households affected by wind, 15,534 people affected by flooding or other safety risks, 391 landslides and 51 wind storms.

      "text": "Heavy rain has caused landslides in the nearby provincial capital of Jayapura Flash floods and landslides triggered by torrential rain in Indonesia's easternmost province of Papua have killed at least 58 people, injured dozens and displaced more than 4,000, authorities said on Sunday. A search for more possible victims was under way in the town of Sentani, which was hit by flash floods late on Saturday. Fifty-one people were killed and 74 injured there, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the national disaster agency, told a news briefing. Heavy rain caused landslides in the nearby provincial capital of Jayapura, killing seven there, Nugroho said. Soldiers pulled alive a 5-month old baby from under the rubble of his house and took him to hospital, Papua military spokesman Muhammad Aidi said. The number of victims \"will probably increase because the evacuation process is still taking place and not all affected areas have been reached,\" Nugroho said. About 4,150 people are sheltering in six evacuation centres, he said.  Hundreds of houses, three bridges and a Twin Otter airplane parked at the airport were damaged by the floods. The Sentani airport, the province's main transport hub, remained open. TV footage showed mud and large logs on Sentani's main roads after floodwaters receded. Disaster authorities have warned local governments of flash flood risks due to deforestation in the mountains surrounding the town, Nugroho said, adding that in 2018 Jakarta sent seedlings intended for tree-planting. \"Forest destruction in the Cyclops Mountains have increased for use as firewood and to turn the land into plantations,\" Nugroho said. \"Since 2018 we have warned the Jayapura government to be careful of flash flood risks because of this deforestation,\" he added."

      "text": "'We have separate plans on pre-Eid, Eid day and post-Eid' Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) Director General (DG) Benazir Ahmed on Friday said CCTV cameras will be installed on the premises of all important Eidgahs, including the national Eidgah, to ensure the security of people offering their Eid prayers. \"We have two important events that are coming up- Eid-ul-Azha and August 15 (Mourning Day). We have separate plans on pre-Eid, Eid day and post-Eid. And we are working to implement the plans,\" he said during a press conference at RAB's media centre in Karwan Bazar, Dhaka.  \"RAB personnel have been working to ensure the security of cattle sellers and buyers across the country,\" the RAB chief said, adding that RAB keeps strong vigilance on cattle markets to check counterfeit notes and \"ogyan party\"(gangs of muggers who render victims unconscious with various substances). He said RAB has strengthened surveillance on launch and bus terminals as well as railway stations, so that holidaymakers can travel home safely.  \"But, this year, roads and rail lines were damaged due to floods in the country's north-eastern region. That is why vehicle movement is slow there. RAB personnel are working sincerely to make Eid journeys of the people smooth,\" The RAB chief said. Noting that there are some 42 accident-prone spots on highways in the country, he said RAB has increased monitoring to avert accidents in these areas. "

      "headline": "Govt doubles import duties on rice to 55%",
      "authors": "Belal Muntasir",
      "text": "A circular was issued in this regard on Wednesday The government has almost doubled import duties on rice to 55%, in a bid to bring slight relief to farmers hit hard by lower prices of paddy. Earlier, import duties totaled 28%. According to a statutory regulatory order (SRO) issued by the National Board of Revenue (NBR) on Wednesday, the new import duties will be effective immediately.  \"We revised the import duties as per the instructions of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, to save farmers from incurring financial losses,\" NBR Chairman Md Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan said. He added that 303,000 tons of rice were imported in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year (FY2018-19), which had a negative effect on the sales of paddy grown by local farmers. \"Farmers even had to sell rice at prices so low that they failed to meet production costs,\" the NBR chairman said. According to the SRO, rice importers now have to pay 25% regulatory duty, as compared to the previous 3%. Furthermore, the NBR imposed 5% advance income tax (AIT) on rice imports for the first time ever. On the other hand, the customs duty has remained unchanged at 25%. NBR member Md Firoz Shah Alam said the government has been gradually increasing import duties on rice over the last few years to discourage imports. The import duty on rice was 25% in FY2017-18, and was raised by 3% to 28% in the budget for FY2018-19. Import duties have now been raised further to 55% to help farmers, Alam added.  Earlier on Monday, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Food Ministry recommended stopping rice imports and taking plans for exports. Experts believe the government initiative to increase import duties will benefit farmers in the long run. Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Research Director Khondaker Golam Moazzem said the decision to control rice imports should have been taken long ago. \"The government has acted too late,\" he said, adding that the late decision had caused suffering for farmers as rice prices were reduced by the supply of rice from imports. He also said the increase in import duties should not increase the price of rice in the market, as there are adequate stocks. Moazzem suggested that the government should procure more rice from farmers immediately, to ensure fair prices, and that exports be allowed in limited numbers. The government earlier promoted rice imports in the last two years ago, lowering import duties to 10% to meet a rice supply shortage caused by floods in 2017. The government had said they required 1,000,000 tons of rice to meet the shortage, but a total 6,000,000 tons were imported in the last two years, said the Food Ministry. There has been substantial growth in rice production over the last few harvest seasons, and rice stocks have risen significantly. The high supply forced farmers to lower prices to the point at which they could not meet production costs. Paddy was found to be selling at Tk450 to Tk500 for every maund (1 maund=40kg) in the last few days, but growers said the cost of harvesting each maund of paddy was between Tk1,000 to Tk1,500. Farmers across the country have launched protests over the issue."

      "text": "Sheikh Hasina has also praised existing collaboration between IRRI and BRRI Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has urged the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) to strengthen its collaboration with the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) to increase rice production in the country.  She made the call when IRRI Director General Dr Matthew Morell met her at the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) on Thursday. The prime minister's Speech Writer Md Nazrul Islam briefed reporters after the meeting. The prime minister stressed the need to strengthen research work to invent saline-, cold-, and draught-tolerant varieties of rice--on a large scale--and improve deep water rice varieties. She emphasized the importance of increasing the capacities for producing rice in the country, continuously, as arable land is diminishing. \"Our farmers are very smart and quick learners. They can easily adopt technology,\" Nazrul quoted the prime minister as saying. Talking about crop patterns, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh cultivates wheat, maize, pulse, and other crops that need less water, in the northern region. She asked the authorities concerned to take steps to boost rice production in the southern region. Also Read- Bangladeshi rice research lags behind due to legal framework She stressed the need to increase the use of surface water and reduce dependence on underground water for irrigation; to protect the environment.  \"So, the country's water bodies--including rivers, canals, and beels--are being re-excavated for irrigation,\" she said.  The prime minister praised the existing collaboration between IRRI and BRRI. IRRI's director general said IRRI is keen to undertake a collaborative program with BRRI to increase rice production in Bangladesh. Raising a 14-point action plan, designed by IRRI--under the collaborative program--he said if the action plan can be implemented, Bangladesh will be able to have high growth in rice production and sustain the country's food security. The action plans include: increasing production in Aush areas, inventing varieties of Aman crops, increasing Boro production overcoming stagnancy, making hybrid rice suitable for local environments through research, and introducing nutritious and healthy rice in Bangladesh. The other action plans include: inventing cold-tolerant Boro variety for the Haor areas,  protecting crops from flash floods, working on saline-tolerant varieties for coastal areas, overcoming harvesting and seed problems, enhancing mechanization to reduce production costs, inventing climate change-resistant varieties, shifting cropping patterns of the northern region to the southern regions, and disseminating of technology to farmers. Dr Matthew said IRRI is interested in working on this action plan in partnership with BRRI. The prime minister praised the action plan. Agriculture Minister Dr Md Abdur Razzaque, Agriculture Secretary Md Nasiurzzaman, the Prime Minister's International Affairs Advisor Dr Gowhar Rizvi, and PMO Secretary Sajjadul Hassan were present at the meeting.  BRRI Director General Dr Md Shahjahan Kabir, IRRI representative for South Asia Dr Nafees Meah, and IRRI representative for Bangladesh Dr Humnath Bhandari also attended the meeting. The IRRI is an independent, non-profit, research institute founded in 1960. The Philippines-based institute has offices in 17 rice-growing countries--including Bangladesh--across Asia and Africa."

      "headline": "What do Rohingyas think about Bhashan Char?",
      "authors": "Nawaz Farhin Antara",
      "text": "They fear the island will flood, cut them off from humanitarian aid and services The displaced Rohingya population prefers living in the cramped and squalid refugee camps of Cox's Bazar, rather than living in a potentially better-sheltered and relatively more comfortable facility on Bhasan Char. The Bangladesh government is almost at the final stage of relocating 100,000 Rohingyas who were forcefully driven away from their land in a Myanmar army crackdown.  However, the unwillingness of the Rohingyas to relocate to the remote island is delaying the relocation plan. Construction has already been carried out at Bhasan Char, previously known as Thengar Char, a river island which emerged twenty years ago at the mouth of the Meghna River. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is set to formally inaugurate the housing complex on the flood- prone isolated island soon. However, many Rohingyas disagree with the relocation plan. Speaking with the Dhaka Tribune, they said they want to continue living in the refugee camps of Cox's Bazar, instead of on Bhasan Char in Noakhali. The assurance of a relatively-comfortable life on the remote island, made by the Bangladesh government, is not enough to convince them. Most Rohingya refugees are unwilling to relocate there as they fear death by starvation, floods, and a lack of humanitarian aid. An exclusive video, released in November by the Guardian, also showed a number of \"prison-like units\" built for Rohingyas on the remote silt island.   Bhasan Char project at a glance The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec), in November 2017, approved a Tk2312.15 crore project to provide temporary shelter for Rohingya refugees on Bhasan Char. The island is located 21 nautical miles from Noakhali, 11 nautical miles from Jahajir Char, 4.2 nautical miles from Sandwip, 28 nautical miles from Patenga, and 13.2 nautical miles from Hatiya. Motor-run boats are the only mode of travel to this area.  Under project \"Ashrayan-3,\" the necessary infrastructure to house 100,000 displaced Myanmar citizens, and other island facilities, are being constructed on Bhasan Char. Almost 80% of the construction of houses and cyclone shelters has already been completed, and the island will have flood protection embankments, secure homes, and administrative buildings. 'A death trap' Speaking to our correspondent at Lambasia Rohingya refugee camp in Ukhiya upazila of Cox's Bazar, a number of Rohingyas rejected the idea of moving to Bhasan Char. Hamid Hussain, a Rohingya man in his sixties, living in the camp for almost five years, said: \"If the Bangladesh government wants to improve our quality of life, then they should do it here in Cox's Bazar where all the Rohingya population is already living.  \"The new place is a death trap. Someone told me that island might go underwater anytime. There is also slim chance of humanitarian services of non-government organizations (NGOs) on that remote island.\" Expressing his concerns, Hamid added: \"There will be no NGOs on Bhasan Char, which means there will be no humanitarian support or activities, and no monitoring.\" At present, many international and local NGOs are working at the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar, providing much-needed food, shelter, healthcare, and other aid to the refugees. Hamid's son Jamil Hussain said his father was a farmer in Myanmar, but they are now unemployed. Discussing his life in the camp, Jamil said: \"It has been over a year since we have taken shelter in Bangladesh. During this period, my father has set up a shop where he can earn Tk200 to Tk300 per day.  \"Life is difficult, but we are well aware this is the best we can do right now. So, we do not want to leave this camp. In fact, we will not go anywhere except our own country.\" 'We will drown' Abdus Salam, a majhi -a title given to a Rohingya leader - of the Lambasia camp said they had already discussed relocation among themselves,and almost everyone is scared about the idea. He told the Dhaka Tribune: \"These Rohingyas have been here for a long time, and they do not want to change their place of residence again. It takes 3 hours to reach Bhasan Char by boat. We do not want to live in such an isolated place. \"Will an adequate amount of food, necessary facilities, and security be available there? There is so much water, we will drown eventually. It is better to die here, than to move to Bhasan Char.\" When asked why the Rohingyas are rejecting the possibly of a better life on Bhasan Char, a Rohingya woman named Shekufa Begum said: \"The camp in Cox's Bazar is very close to my homeland Myanmar, and I can return there if the situation improves.  \"But in Bhasan Char, we face the risk of this island sinking to the depths. Locals and other Rohingyas have warned me about it.\"  Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Mohammad Abul Kalam, who is supervising the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar, said the Prime Minister's Office has been instructed to select some majhis and to bring them to Bhasan Char for an orientation. The majhis will be given a tour of the island and its facilities so they can inspire Rohingyas living in the Cox's Bazar camps to relocate.  \"We will take a Rohingya delegation to Bhasan Char as soon as possible and will show them the facilities,\" said Kalam, hoping they will be more willing to relocate after a tour. On August 25 last year, the Myanmar army launched a crackdown on the Rohingya minority, forcing over 700,000 of the ethnic community to cross the border and take shelter in overcrowded refugee camps at Cox's Bazar."

The World Food Program (WFP) is working with the government of Bangladesh to lift rural women out of extreme poverty through a ground breaking program, said the WFP on Monday. The participants of the Investment Component for Vulnerable Group Development (ICVGD) program come from all 64 districts of the country, residing in remote areas that are prone to natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes and cyclones. They face high poverty with low employment opportunities, reports UNB. \"WFP applauds the government for its commitment towards empowering women and achieving food security in Bangladesh,\" said Richard Ragan, WFP representative and country director in Bangladesh. \"Thanks to commitments like this, rural women will now have a chance to transform their lives and that of their children through skills and knowledge,\" he added.  Currently in its second phase, the program consists of training in entrepreneurship, financial management and life skills, as well as behavioural change education in the areas of nutrition, health, and water, sanitation and hygiene. Each participant will receive a start-up grant of Tk15,000 ($180) and a monthly ration of 30kg of fortified rice during their training period. During the first phase of this program, which started in 2015, 8,000 rural women were provided with similar support. An evaluation of the first phase showed improvements in income, food security and dietary diversity of these women and their families. A positive change in their decision making ability was also observed. Run by the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, ICVGD is part of the Vulnerable Group Development (VGD) program, which is the largest safety net program targeting extremely poor and vulnerable women and their households in Bangladesh."

She said 18 months ago she went to Cox's Bazar when thousands of Rohingyas were entering Bangladesh every day. She spoke to Rohingya refugee children who were forced to run for their lives in Myanmar and sought sanctuary in Bangladesh, a press release issued on Wednesday read. \"All efforts have been made to meet their basic needs, yet many children are to receive general education after one and a half year of exodus. I am worried that a whole generation of Rohingyas will be lost if the absence of children in the education system is continued.\" Schmidt said. Schmidt further praised the Bangladesh government and its people for showing generosity to nearly one million Rohingya refugees living in Cox's Bazar, more than half of whom are women and children.  She said: \"Bangladeshi people have shown immense compassion and risen to the challenge of hosting the world's largest refugee camp.  \"International-national, all the non-government organizations are doing their utmost for the refugees, but as the number of Rohingyas are growing, we believe the cooperation of the Bangladeshi people is also needed,\" The former Danish prime minister went onto say: \"Today, Save the Children is providing life-saving healthcare, food supplies and access to clean water and sanitation.   We are also providing education and child protection services for the most vulnerable children in the camps.  But we rely on the support of the Bangladeshi people, particularly the local host community of Cox's Bazar, whose lives have changed dramatically since the Rohingya crisis escalated nearly two years ago.\" \"Save the children eagerly wishes to work for Rohingyas along with Bangladeshis at any time.\" \"Save the Children stands shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh in responding to the needs of the Rohingya while they are in Bangladesh.  \"Together, we can uphold the dignity and rights of Rohingya refugees and the host community in Bangladesh while pursuing international justice for the crimes committed against the Rohingya in Myanmar,\" she added. On a two day visit with Save the Children Bangladesh Country Director Mark Pierce, Schmidt visited various activities in the refugee camps such as, \"Temporary Learning Centre,\" \"General Food Distribution Centre,\" \"Health and Nutrition Post,\" \"Child Friendly Space,\" \"Child Protection Case\" \"Management Office,\" and \"Health and Nutrition Office.\""

Originating from Dumur in the north eastern hilly region of India's Tripura state, the Gumti was once a hilly river of strong current. But the river has now lost its navigability, current and even its natural course. Locals say, since the river course was altered to save the town from concurrent floods, encroachers began constructing buildings, sewerage lines on its banks; gradually they closed in by piling up waste, to later claim the banks as their land. According to Comilla City Corporation sources, almost 258.74 acres of the river stretching from the Sadar upazila to Comilla municipality are now under the grasp of 522 listed land grabbers. Government land rented, sold  Land grabbers are relentless at renting, leasing, and selling these government owned riverine lands to locals providing them fake documents, locals said. Mizanur Rahman, a riverside house owner, said: \"I had to borrow money to buy this land. The previous owners did not provide any legal papers and now the district administration is trying to evict me from my home.  With Mizanur, Mobarak Hossain and multiple other house owners echoed the same concerns. Initiatives to revive it In a 2016 letter to the Additional Deputy Commissioner Abul Fazal Mir, Assistant Commissioner (Land) Md Shamim Hossain of Adarsha Sadar upazila, asked the authority to evict the illegal land grabbers and save the river. However, locals say, despite repetitive attempts by the authority, the situation remained the same, as they always failed to evict the illegal structures. Comilla City Corporation Mayor Monirul Haque Sakku said: \"The district administration office is responsible to oversee the conservation of the river. However, the city corporation is looking to provide assistance in this regard. \"We hope the plan to restore the beauty of the Gumti River and make it a public recreational spot like Hatirjheel is soon approved,\" the mayor added."

Experts fear, it will not serve the purpose as it would only benefit the traders, not the paddy growers who have been suffering due to low paddy prices in the current Boro season. They rather ask government to utilize more funds on paddy purchase directly from the farmers.  The government announced last week to provide up to 30% export subsidy for private traders who will be exporting rice abroad. Government is hoping that once the export line opens it will help buoy up the market, dampened mostly because of rice glut due to carryover stocks from previous cheaper imports and high domestic output in two successive rice seasons -- Aman and Boro.       Agriculture Minister Dr Abdur Razzaque last Thursday declared the government's readiness to allow up to 1.5 million tons of rice export. Given the current poor demand of rice in international market, a rough estimate says the government would have to bear something between Tk600 crore to Tk1,200 crore as export subsidy, even if the millers and traders having big rice stocks manage to find export markets for 1.5 million tons of rice. To Dr Akhter Ahmed, who heads the Washington-based International Food Policy Research Institute's (IFPRI) Bangladesh operation, rice export is a poor proposition as it will only benefit the traders, not the farmers. \"Rather, I'll propose the government invest this money on buying paddy directly from farmers, convert the paddy to rice through millers and then preserve in public granaries,\" says Akhter, also the chief of party of the USAID-supported Policy Research and Strategy Support Program. Anwar Faruque, a former secretary of the Agriculture Ministry, also considers that government needed to inject more money on paddy procurement if it likes to mitigate the woes of Boro farmers during this season of Eid festival. He said, instead of procuring paddy following faulty farmers' list, the government should buy from farmers' cooperatives as is the case in India's West Bengal. 'Subsidy to hike rice price'  Market sources told Dhaka Tribune the traders, who got benefitted by importing cheaper rice from across the border taking the government's zero tariff advantage in 2017 and 2018, would benefit again by getting the export subsidy. After a government-declared one million tons of crop loss in 2017 haor floods, it allowed both public and private sector rice imports at zero tariff, thereby, flooding the domestic market with a record four million tons of import. Akhter Ahmed fears export of rice with price subsidy facility would rather result in high domestic rice prices; and will not help farmers getting fair price for their paddy. \"Now farmers are suffering from low paddy price and then (in case of rice export) the consumers will also suffer due to price hike of the staple in the domestic market,\" he said. As against the government's paddy procurement price of Tk1,040 a maund, farmers across the country are faring poorly by getting only Tk500 to Tk600 price offer from the traders and millers. As government plans to buy only 0.15 million tons of paddy from farmers and 1.1 million tons rice only from the millers, the fair price set by the government is having no impact in the market in this Boro season when farmers are expected to have grown nearly 20 million tons of rice. Moreover, the government took the rice export decision at a time when global demand for rice is fast shrinking with main players in the rice export markets India, Thailand and Vietnam getting nearly no fresh orders. In a presentation held at the Agriculture Ministry on May 20, Akhter Ahmed informed the government that paddy price declined to as low as Tk499 on May 19. \"Paddy price might further collapse once Boro harvest is completed,\" he feared. Also Read- Rice prices: A curious comparison - The answer is right next door \"The main objective of procurement should be to support prices for farm-level incentives. It is counterproductive to include other objectives, such as public stocks and distributional considerations such as safety net or disaster relief... \"However, at the operational level of the Food Department, building up foodgrain stocks is perceived to be the dominant purpose,\" the presentation stated. It also suggested: \"Rice procurement prices should be set and notified to farmers before rice planting season to enable farmers to make better land allocation decisions.\""

In addition, the Water Development Board has predicted that the water level may rise by a further 10-12cm. Deputy Assistant Engineer Aminur Rashid said 44 sluice gates have been opened to bring the water level under control. Lalmonirhat Sadar Upazila Nirbahi Officer Jayasree Rani Roy said: \"Flood affected people are being registered. Some relief supplies have been distributed among the affected people.\"  Lalmonirhat Deputy Commissioner Md Abu Zafar echoed the UNO's comments on relief distribution. Dalia, Lalmonirhat and Rangpur Water Development Board said it has been raining heavily since Monday, which is why the water level has risen. Due to the heavy rain fall, flooding has occurred in: Dohogram union, Goddimari in Hatibandha upazila, Saniazan, Shingimari, Dauwabari, Sindurna, Patikapara union, Bhotmari in Kaliganj upazila, Kakina union, Bhushbandar, Mohishkhucha union in Aditmari upazila, Khuniagach in Lalmonirhat sadar upazila, Panchagram, and Gokunda union.  Due to the flooding, people living in these areas are facing food and drinking water crises."

      "text": "What is the true cost of industrialization?  Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe are experiencing the hottest summer. The world has experienced about 0.8C rise since 1880.  Roughly, about 0.15-0.20C warming has occurred per decade since 1975, according to an ongoing temperature analysis conducted by scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS). Temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5C between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace, and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures to curtail the increase. Rapid industrialization has led to the release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which is warming the air and depleting the ozone layer.  We are falling victim to climate change, as deforestation intensifies to set up households and industries. Environmentalists suggest that a country should have at least 25% forest coverage to meet the ecological balance, but most countries around the world have less than 17%. It's spring in the Arctic, but ice is melting and the sea level is rising due to an early summer heat wave. Germany has also recorded the hottest day in their history with the temperature rising to 40C last month.  In Asia, extreme heat is also melting the Himalayan snow and causing natural disasters like cyclones and floods, causing climate-sensitive health hazards such as malnutrition, diarrheoa, cholera, and puts women at miscarriage risk with the rise of salinity in the water. World Bank in their report in 2013 cited Bangladesh as one of more \"potential impact hotspots\" threatened by extreme flood, more intense tropical cyclone, sea level rising etc.  World Health Organization (WHO) in their study cited the health consequences of climate change in Bangladesh. The extreme heat wave increases the chances of asthma, heatstroke, and skin cancer.  River water level rise causes unexpected nutrient deficiencies more in women and children as they have limited access during natural disasters. They can't access nutritious foods.  Hence, children suffer from stunted growth and weakness. They grow malnourished and live an unhealthy lifestyle.  They are affected with worms and other diseases. Besides children, women also suffer from malnutrition related diseases. As the custom of the country encourages women to give the nutritious food to the male members and take only the leftovers for themselves, they lack valuable nutrients.  During floods and other natural calamities, streams and rivers tend to get contaminated.  Water from unsafe sources cause the mortality rates of children under five and elderly people to rise, according to a study by WHO and Unicef. Water-logging is a common problem in coastal areas during heavy rain. Water-logging and rising temperatures may increase the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases.  Malaria, dengue, and other such diseases break into an epidemic. WHO in their study cited that pregnant women are twice as likely to be bit by mosquitoes than their non-pregnant counterparts.  There could be two possible physiological factors: First, women tend to produce more exhaled breath, and there are several hundred different components in human breath, which help mosquitoes detect a host. Second, during pregnancy, blood flow to the skin increases, which releases heat. The substances in the skin may also be the reason to attract mosquitoes.  Studies found that pregnancy-induced hypertension and eclampsia risks are very high when the temperature is high and the humidity is low.  Rural women are more prone to develop lung cancer, as they are exposed to burning coals and fossils for cooking.    Climate change has caused global sea levels to rise, a phenomenon that brings sea-water closer to freshwater sources, contaminating freshwater and soil with higher levels of salt. Elevated blood pressure was found more prevalent in some Bangladeshi coastal communities and an icddr,b study argues that higher water salinity levels, possibly triggered by climate change, may have a role in this. The government and private sectors collectively must implement afforestation programs to curb climate change related hazards.  The growth of industrialization has to be limited, especially in coastal areas, as the industrial wastes pollute the water and the emission of gases warm the air.

      "authors": "Reaz Ahmad",
      "text": "For over three decades a 500 ton stock of DDT has caused serious health hazards; UN FAO comes to the rescue   Thanks to a United Nations-led initiative, Bangladesh is finally getting rid of a huge cache of notoriously toxic and currently illegal pesticide, Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane or DDT, as it is commonly known. Thirty four years after the import of a sub-standard DDT consignment which has since been stored at Chattogram Government Medical Sub-depot (MSD), will soon be shipped out of the country and destroyed in an underground incinerator in Germany. Government will launch a USD 42 million project - 'Pesticide Risk Reduction in Bangladesh' - with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations on Thursday, under which USD 8.29 million will be spent to dispose of the DDT, officials of FAO and the Economic Relations Division (ERD) of the Finance Ministry told the Dhaka Tribune on Wednesday.  Global Environment Facility (GEF) is providing the DDT destroying fund. Established on the eve of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, GEF helps tackle the planet's most pressing environmental problems.   Once destroyed, Bangladesh will at last be freed from the trouble of stocking  such a big consignment of DDT, which for years has been polluting the environment causing serious health hazards. The development comes 21 years after Bangladesh officially banned DDT registration in the country, stopping local production and imports. The United States banned toxic DDT back in 1972 while a worldwide ban on its agricultural use as pesticide was banned under the Stock Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) since 2004.  In 1985, the Bangladesh government, with an Asian Development Bank (ADB) financed project, implemented by the World Health Organization (WHO), imported the DDT to fight a malaria epidemic. However, it was later found out to be not in compliance with the technical requirements and therefore, was stored in Chattogram MSD.  The stockpile has remained there since, where due to the adverse effects of a humid tropical climate on DDT molecular stability, the stock became severely degraded and largely obsolete. In addition, in 1991 the area was exposed to severe floods, greatly exacerbating the problem by flushing DDT into the surrounding environment.  Speaking on the DDT crisis at a city workshop last year, a then additional secretary of the ministry of environment forest and climate change said exposure to the stockpiled DDT might have caused cancer to at least two of his colleagues who later died. They were posted at the DDT stockyard at different points in time.  DDT persists in soil, water, and bio-accumulates in organisms through the food chain. Eventual consumption by humans has toxic and likely carcinogenic effects.  Bangladesh has one of the highest population densities of any country in the world and the port city of Chattogram is the second largest city of Bangladesh. The DDT stockpile is in the centre of the city.  According to the FAO, people living in slums surrounding the depot until recently, very likely have been exposed to DDT and the stockpile poses a very high risk to human health and the ecosystem.   FAO says: \"While DDT is banned for use as an agricultural pesticide, testing has shown high concentrations of DDT in dry fish, a common source of protein and the basis of many livelihoods in Bangladesh. DDT is being used in some areas of Bangladesh to prevent spoilage of fish in the drying process, demonstrating a severe lack of awareness of the negative impacts of DDT.\"  Why it took so long In Bangladesh there is neither strategy nor capacity for collecting and disposing of hazardous waste such as obsolete pesticides. National regulations and border customs practices have loopholes that allow hazardous substances to escape attention.    Following increased public awareness about the negative impacts of DDT like its spillage owing to floods, and the DDT contamination of dried fish, the government in recent years has tried to manage funds and capacity to dispose of the DDT.  The FAO project now intends, not only to rid Bangladesh of the toxic substance but also to support the country in updating its national regulations in keeping with the Stockholm Convention, and developing national capacity for the management and safe disposal of hazardous waste in order to safeguard people and the environment. The project objective is to reduce the risk to human and animal health and the environment from stockpiles of POPs and other obsolete pesticides, and from the ongoing excessive use of new POPs and other highly hazardous pesticides. The project has several components, which include: disposal of legacy stockpiles of POPs, governance and enforcement, and awareness and communication regarding pesticide use. It's not only DDT In addition to the 500 tons of DDT, there are another estimated 500 tons of other POPs in Bangladesh and the government-FAO partnership also aims to reduce the risk to human and animal health and the environment with an environmentally sound elimination of 1000 tons of POPs. The project will also work to ensure better management of empty pesticide containers, better food preservation and agricultural practices, and improved legislation for chemical management.  The project proposes collecting, cleaning up, and safely disposing of the large stockpile of obsolete DDT in Chattogram, and developing national capacity for emergency preparedness.  Furthermore, the project will work towards ensuring safe practices in the management of hazardous waste, risk assessment,  sampling and analysis in the field and laboratory, for environmental monitoring. The project also proposes piloting a collection and disposal/recycling strategy for empty pesticide containers with an initial 100 tons of containers to be collected and safely disposed of.  What is DDT? Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, commonly known as DDT, is a colorless, tasteless, and almost odorless crystalline chemical compound, originally developed as an insecticide, and ultimately becoming infamous for its environmental impacts.  It was first synthesized in 1874 by Austrian chemist Othmar Zeidler. DDT's insecticidal action was discovered by Swiss chemist Paul Hermann Muller in 1939. DDT was used in the second half of the Second World War to control malaria among civilians and troops. Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods in 1948.   In 1962 publication of Rachel Carson's book, \"Silent Spring,\" cataloged environmental impacts that coincided with the widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment with little prior investigation of their environmental and health effects. The book said that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the environmental movement and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States in 1972. "

      "text": "COP 25 needs to do more for Bangladesh Bangladesh is considered as one of the most vulnerable countries to natural disasters and climate change. The country having low-lying characteristics, combined with increasing population and poor socio-economic backgrounds of the people, renders it highly vulnerable to natural hazards such as floods, cyclone, and other extreme weather events. Over the years, the magnitude and frequency of these natural disasters have intensified as a result of climate change hence contribute to huge economic losses. Since 1980, the country witnessed over 200 natural disasters, contributing to a total death toll of around 200,000 people and economic loss worth $17 billion. Given the poor economic development and financial support of the developed country, the country experiences difficulty in minimizing loss and damages. For example, the natural hazard events in Bangladesh resulted in economic losses of more than $10 billion from 2000 to 2013, but the total funding available for relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction for the said period was $2 billion only. Every year, the Conference of Parties (COP), which is a decision-making body, takes place to review and monitor the implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). At COP 21, held in 2015, Paris, the developed countries pledged to provide $100 billion of new and additional finance each year to developing countries by 2020. In the latest report by the Standing Committee of Finance, which was submitted to the negotiators at COP 24, estimated that $55 billion climate fund was raised by developed countries in 2016. However, the report stated that only around a quarter of this amount was channeled towards adaptation efforts. This year, the 24th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 24) was held on December 15, 2018, in Katowice, Poland. Bangladesh, being a member country of the convention, has expressed concerns about the climate-induced loss and damage. The said topic has always been a debatable topic at the international climate change treaties. The reason could be attributed to the fact that there is no clear financial mechanism of addressing loss and damage. Also, the developed countries fear that the losses and damages incurred from the adverse impacts of climate change will be entirely borne by them. Climate-induced loss and damage are the manifestations of extreme climatic events as a result of persistent emissions of greenhouse gas contributed by the developed countries over the years. Hence, the developed countries fear that they will have to bear expenses of both current, past and future climate-induced loss and damages.  The provisions on loss and damage in the agreement of COP 24 have not been given due consideration and are not in favour of the vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh. The provision states that \"Each interested party may provide, as appropriate, information related to enhancing understanding, action and support, on a cooperative and facilitative basis, to avert, minimize and address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts\". The provision clearly indicate leniency in providing any kinds of supports to address loss and damage. The rules clearly stated \"Each interested party may provide...\"which indicates that the member countries or the developed countries have given some privilege to decide on the amount of financial and technological resources. In other words, the developed countries may or may not provide the amount of financial supports required by the developing countries.   At COP 25, which will be held in December 2019 in Santiago, Chile, the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage (WIM), which has been established to address climate-induced loss and damage, will be reviewed hence discussions will largely be centered on loss and damage. Now, it is imperative for Bangladesh to strategically explore possibilities and avenues to address loss and damage. Also create an enabling environment to attract climate funds and enhance budgetary allocations to adaptation efforts. Concerns over inadequate climate funds to address climate change adaptation and loss and damage are required to be re-emphasized. Also showcase our mitigation efforts such as adoption of battery-run three wheelers, solar energy, etc across country. Such efforts would facilitate to uphold our image at the international climate change arena. COP 24 was merely a war of words. It is imperative for Bangladesh to do some preparatory work for the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and put forward all its claims in an articulated and diplomatic manner at COP 25.

The Habiganj Rice Research Institute took the initiative to plant these crops on an experimental basis and the success rate has now inspired several other farmers to cultivate it as well.  Farmland at Gungiajuri haor of Habiganj is always vulnerable to flooding, which is why hundreds of farmers from Abdullahpur area of Sadar upazila went for this different approach.  The production rate was higher and farmers were able to harvest beforehand in comparison to regular crops. Local union parishad member Shrikanto Das said: \"There is massive production compared to previous years and crops, too are safe from floods now. This success has inspired many other farmers to cultivate these crops.\" Farmer Salim Ullah said: \"Last year I cultivated 80 maunds of paddy on 42,768 square feet of land, this year almost 100 maunds of paddy were produced on the same land. Also Read- USDA: Rice output continues to see growth  \"Regular crops have not yet fully grown whereas the hybrid 58 rice is already harvested,\" he added.   Another farmer Rahim Mia added: \"The first cultivation of hybrid rice 5 and 58 has shown a huge success rate and from the next time, more of these crops will be produced.\" Dr. Rafiqul Islam, senior scientist of Habiganj Rice Research Institute said: \"When hybrid rice 5 is cultivated in flood risk areas, production rates are expected to double.\" Planning Officer of this project and also the Chief Executive of local NGO ASED Jafar Iqbal Chowdhury said: \"The high production rate of the hybrid crops has inspired farmers to produce more and the beneficial part is these crops are ready for harvest a week before other crops.\" Chief Scientist of Gazipur Rice Research Institute Dr Rumana Yeasmin came to visit the fields and said: \"These hybrid crops were invented for flood risk areas and they have show great results.  \"Farmers are really satisfied with this high production rate,\" she added."

      "text": "Cox's Bazar is one of the most disaster-prone districts of Bangladesh  UN agencies have launched the second phase of their Disaster Risk Reduction activities in the host community of Cox's Bazar, alongside partners and local authorities.  Cox's Bazar is one of the most disaster-prone districts of Bangladesh. UN agencies - International Organization for Migration (IOM), the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), and the World Food Programme (WFP) - have been working with the government to further develop local capacity to respond to recurring disasters. The second phase, which was launched on Tuesday, will further reinforce and rehabilitate cyclone shelters, strengthen local capacity, preparedness, and resilience, and strengthen social cohesion, the agencies said in a joint statement.  File photo of Rohingya women and children in a camp in Cox Bazar Mahmud Hossain Opu/ Dhaka Tribune UN agencies said they are working closely with the government as well as the Cox's Bazar district Disaster Management Committee to strengthen the local community's resilience and capacity to face recurrent disasters. \"IOM is very pleased with yet another partnering initiative with the Government of Bangladesh, our sister UN agencies and other partners, this time to contribute to tackling Disaster Risk Reduction in the host communities,\" Manuel Pereira, IOM deputy chief of Mission in Bangladesh, said.  He said infrastructure improvements and capacity strengthening of communities to take the lead in disaster preparedness and lifesaving response is a priority for IOM. \"Our commitment to Bangladesh capacity to mitigate and, when needed, self-response to disasters is unequivocal,\" he said. Distressed rohngya women and children at a camp in Cox Bazar Dhaka Tribune/Mahmud Hossain Opu  Peter Guest, emergency coordinator for WFP in Cox's Bazar, said rehabilitating the cyclone shelters is just part of their disaster risk reduction activities in the coastal district. \"Mitigating the impact of disasters and ensuring vital access points remain open is critical to maintaining food security in the region,\" he said. Guest noted that Bangladesh is facing an increasing number of weather-related disasters as the effects of climate change worsen \"which makes it even more important to ensure that local communities are empowered and resilient when facing disasters.\" The launch was followed by a two-day Disaster Risk Reduction workshop that sought to create linkages between local, national, and international disaster reduction actors. Head of Operations for UNHCR in Cox's Bazar Marin Din Kajdomcaj said UNHCR and partners continue to improve their preparedness capacity for extreme weather events. File photo of Rohingya people Migrating to different camps in Cox Bazaar Dhaka Tribune/MAHMUD HOSSAIN OPU \"UNHCR has put refugees at the centre of the response through skill trainings and the provision of basic tools [and the] results are already showing,\" he said. \"While joint projects underway have massively reduced the risk of floods, landslides and the loss of life, much more remains to be achieved, through the exchange of knowledge and best practices, improvement of coordination and simulation exercises,\" Kajdomcaj said."

      "text": "BD Clean has an inspiring vision of cleaning up the streets of Bangladesh BD Clean - which inspires to turn Bangladesh into a cleaner and healthier nation - is Bangladesh's biggest mass-action environmental campaign and was first launched in 2016.  In July in 2016, a group of passionate youth roaming through Gulshan, collected waste and garbage by themselves with a higher purpose amid the heightened security.  Police and members of law enforcement agencies offered cooperation and did not bar the youths from cleaning the city's posh neighbourhood, considering their noble intention. In the early hours of June 3 in 2016, a group of 24 youths started their mission from Dhaka's Shahbagh intersection - whose selfless acts of determination has now fanned across the country, reaching 54 districts.  BD Clean draws its strength from the support of selfless volunteers |Courtesy The campaign started off by clearing litter from footpaths, fields, river banks and roadsides throughout Dhaka. The campaign also garnered publicity through the use of posters and other activities, highlighting the importance of cleaning up the city.  Their core message is that Bangladesh will become clean through the actions of its own people.  As more and members have been inspired to engage community volunteering in order to bring about a significant positive change in the society, the member count of BD Clean has risen to a whopping 17,246 as of July 2019. BD clean, a youth voluntary organization, tends to create mass awareness on the importance of having a clean environment and its benefits. To achieve that goal, it draws its strength from the support of selfless volunteers. These members consist of youth from different communities, who partake in social, charitable and environmental activities on a voluntary basis. The group encourages people to put waste material into litter bins. The central message is one of individual responsibility.  The founder's vision Farid Uddin, the founder of BD Clean, believes that education and awareness are of utmost importance, if we are to successfully keep our environment green and clean. A graduate from Dhaka University, he drew immense attention to his work through the use of social media.  Talking to Dhaka Tribune, the highly ambitious student of Fine Arts expressed his profound determination towards his goal and of optimism about the future of the country.  He said: \"It is the duty of all to keep his or her own neighbourhood clean. The citizens themselves can keep the capital and other cities clean. No directives or government actions would do any good unless people realize, by being conscientious members of the society, the urgency of a cleaner and safer Bangladesh.\" Funding, operations, campaigns The organization has identified two sources of funding. Primarily, the organization started functioning through own funding, and later also received charitable donations from various organizations, which arrange cleaning programs and competitions in the educational institutions.  Meanwhile, given the  ongoing floods and erosion along the main river banks of the country, BD Clean has already launched campaigns in flood affected areas and hosted awareness events. Recently, an eight-week campaign titled \"Clean Campus, Green Campus\" is being held at 1,453 educational institutions across Bangladesh.  Each team, consisting of 101 members, represented different schools and colleges. These teams ran awareness campaigns about waste management, and highlighted the fact that keeping our neighbourhoods clean is beneficial for everyone.  They also encouraged the education institutions to cover at least 20% of their premises with green trees. Following successful campaigns, a vast majority of the institutions have taken steps to use dust bins.  Moreover, the students, inspired by BD Clean, took photographs of how much they have cleaned and shared the photographs on social media, said Farid. For Dhaka city, BD Clean delegated two coordinators, one each for Dhaka North and Dhaka South. Farid draws inspiration from the language movement in 1952 and the Liberation War in 1971.   He said: \"Our youths took charge of their destiny, and transformed challenges into motivation and courage in 1952 and 1971. I think change may not be possible immediately but transformation of our society is very much possible if the youth come forward. \"I have a dream of developing a 'Clean Bangladesh' for the next generation of youths by 2021 - the golden jubilee of Bangladesh's independence.\" "

      "authors": "Proma Gulshan",
      "text": "Climate change is real, and it's here The Kalboishakhi storm is one of the main indicators of the arrival of the Bengali New Year, or \"Pohela Boishakh\" in Bangladesh.  Pohela Boishakh marks the beginning of the New Year, and the beginning of summer. The Kalboishakhi storm happening earlier may very well indicate that summer is arriving earlier in Bangladesh. The scientific research on Bangladesh is sparse, but climate change being a global phenomenon, a lot can be inferred from the research that is based on other areas of the world. According to scientific records and media reports, summer is arriving earlier every year in Europe as well. The early occurrence of the Kalboishakhi this year in Bangladesh may indicate the same thing happening here. The implications of this are major -- it means that climate change is no longer the big bad thing in the future, but something that is happening right now. It is here, and knocking at our doorstep. Most articles on climate change published in the Western media include suggestions on what the reader can do to combat climate change. This makes sense, because even though climate change can be natural, what we are facing now is human-induced climate change.  But does this same idea apply to the average Bangladeshi reader? If the main reason behind climate change is the greenhouse gas emissions caused by industrialization, surely Bangladesh, being such a young and small country, has had little to do with that. Bangladesh has contributed a minuscule percentage of the greenhouse gases that are present in the atmosphere today, but it is one of the countries that are at greatest risk from climate change. The developed countries of the world that are responsible for the industrial age and subsequent global warming have had their chance to develop and prosper, and will no doubt feel the brunt of climate change, but so will we.  A small nation that has faced so many atrocities will face more. Climate change is going to bring many disasters to Bangladesh. Farmers will suffer as crop production is affected by untimely storms and frequent floods. River erosion, which is already common in Bangladesh, will become more frequent.   Many people will become displaced, and this will lead to a growing number of \"climate change refugees.\" As evidenced by the Rohingya crisis, no country (except maybe Bangladesh) wants a large number of refugees. It can be said that moving Bangladeshi climate change refugees overseas will not be an option. Therefore, we can look forward to more overcrowding of already overcrowded areas. The current Bangladeshi government has done a lot to secure funds to help us combat climate change. There is nothing we can do to stop climate change at this point, but we can make the best of the funds and resources available to us in order to help mitigate the effects of climate change.  Many disaster-prone areas of Bangladesh have evacuation plans in place for residents, which help to reduce casualties. Such work needs to continue, as disaster-preparedness is the only thing that can make the future better for all Bangladeshis.  With many countries opting for green energy and international funds being channeled to countries like Bangladesh, it is not all doom and gloom. There are steps that can be taken to minimize the effects of climate change. It is now a matter of taking them with efficiency and speed.  Something as small as the early arrival of Kalboishakhi can indicate that urgent action is necessary. More scientific research on this matter is also required, as in the swift communication of such information on mass media.  Proma Gulshan is Editorial Assistant at the Dhaka Tribune."

      "text": "Untimely rains negatively impact farming output in two districts this season Farmers who planted winter crops on a lot of land in Rajshahi and Faridpur are worried about huge losses due to the recent rains. Crops on 5,880 hectares of land in various upazilas are about to be ruined by three days of untimely rains, lasting from Wednesday to Saturday. If favourable weather conditions continue,an estimated 26,460 metric tons of farming output is expected. But due to the recent and unfavourable turn in the weather, officers of the agriculture division and local farmers fear that the above goal may not be reached. Farmers recently planted their winter crops to recoup the losses caused by two recent floods.  Unfortunately the recent rains, locusts, and rot have all negatively affected their crops. In many areas, the paddy has also gone underwater. Masud Karim, assistant agriculture officer of Puthia upazila, said: \"At this moment, most of the paddy on the lands have ripened. And when the paddy ripens, the roots of the paddy  naturally soften, and the head becomes heavy from the fresh blooming sheaf of paddy. Added to that, with the rain and the accompanying winds, the paddy has fallen into the water some areas. But at this time,we are advising farmers to drain water from the lands. Those lands that are underwater have a greater probability of producing less.\"  Crops on 300 hectares of land in different upazilas are about to be ruined by three days of untimely rains. Farmers recently planted their winter crops to recoup the losses caused by two consecutive floods in two phases. Now they are facing a tough situation with the winter crops which have gone under rainwater. According to the Faridpur Met Office, 32 mm of rain was recorded in the district on Friday and Saturday. Vvisiting Charmadhobdia, Aliabad, Ombikapur unions of Sadar upazila, this correspondent found waterlogged fields of crops and vegetables, including 'Muri-kata' onions. Farmers fear the biggest losses with a damaged onion crop.  If the rainwater doesn't drain from the land quickly it will cause huge losses to farmers, said some local farmers. Kartik Chandra Chakraborty, agriculturalist at the Department of Agricultural Extension, Faridpur said: \"Various types of crops have been damaged. Farmers of 'Muri-kata' onion and winter crops will be the worst affected by the rains,\" he said."

      "text": "'If there is a flash flood in the haor areas, storm water flows down to the Meghna River through the Kushiyara River, and ilish enters Hakaluki from the Meghna' Fishermen of Moulvibazar are pocketing good profits, as ilish are being netted in an abundant number in the Hakaluki Haor. A beam of satisfaction is seen in the faces of thousands of fishermen, and they are passing busy time with cheerful mood. Traders as well as fishermen remain busy round the clock in unloading the delicious fish from boats, and supplying those to wholesale markets across Bangladesh. According to Kulaura Upazila Fisheries Department, fishermen have been netting ilish in the haor areas since 2016. Ilish was a hard catch in the last three years, but due to this year's abundant flash floods, and persistent rain, the Kushiyara River over-flowed, and ilish, along with other freshwater fish, entered Hakaluki Haor. Local fishermen Moyna Mia, Masuk, and Keramot Ali told Dhaka Tribune that on a few occasions they caught ilish weighing up to 900 grams. But usually most of the catch was smaller in size, and weighed between 300 and 600 grams. Mohammad Sultan Mahmud, fisheries officer in Kulaura upazila of Moulvibazar, said: \"If there is a flash flood in the haor areas, storm water flows down to the Meghna River through the Kushiyara River, and ilish enters Hakaluki from the Meghna.\" He further said the 65-day ban on fishing in the Bay of Bengal also contributed to the abundant quantity of ilish this year.  Fish traders of Achurighat, Chidrat Ali, Moshabbir Ali, and Kirendranath said, Hakaluki Haor is booming with all kinds of fishes because the Ministry of Fisheries And Livestock (MOFL) released a large amount of fish larvae in the haor. Price of ilish is also decreasing in the local markets as plenty of ilish is being netted. Its price in wholesale markets now range between Tk 500-600 per kg depending on size. Sirajuddin Ahmed Badshah, chief of a Moulvibazar-based local organization that works to protect the haor and the farmers, and preserve natural resources, said: \"Large ilish were a common catch in the haor and Kushiyara River in the past. But since the Buri Keari embankment was installed, ilish are left on the other side, and fishermen were unable to catch enough fish.\" \"If the embankment is demolished, and other water bodies dredged, larger quantity of ilish would have been available, and we could have enriched our bio-diversity as well,\" he added. Dr Mrittunjay Kundu, professor of Sylhet Agricultural University's Aquatic Resource Management Department, said: \"It is unusual for ilish to change their direction, and lay eggs in the haor. It will be a milestone if ilish can be aqua-cultured in the haor. \"Though in haor, ilish cannot grow to their fuller size as much as the flowing-water ilish, we should do more research for aquafarming ilish in large water bodies like a haor.\" Dr Mrittunjay further added: \"Haors are getting polluted because of the insecticides used by paddy farmers. Biodiversity of these areas are at a huge risk due to unscrupulous use of harmful chemicals.\""

      "text": "The meeting was facilitated by Imrul Hasan Khan, Director, Programmes and Operations, RedOrange Media and Communications RedOrange Media and Communications and Dhaka Tribune jointly organized a consultative meeting, titled \"Reflection on MHM Learning: National MHM Strategy.\" Md Zahirul Islam, Additional Secretary of the Local Government Division under the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operatives, was present as the chief guest at the event, which was chaired by Rokeya Kabir, Chair of Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) Platform and Executive Director of BNPS. The meeting was facilitated by Imrul Hasan Khan, Director, Programmes and Operations, RedOrange Media and Communications. The meeting's objective was to share information, opportunities and challenges of MHM among stakeholders in order to help formulate The National MHM Strategy. Mahbuba Haque Kumkum, Programme Manager, Simavi Based on Ritu Program's findings, two topics stood out -- education and wash. When dealing with menstruation, we needed an improved educational channel to disseminate correct scientific data. An obstacle to this is a mother taboo that claims that menstrual blood is polluted. Breaking this one will remove 80% of all taboos. To that end, we needed to create a sustainable source for correct information in order to educate our youth. So we focused on educating schoolteachers and families as the primary source of information, producing effective results.  Furthermore, education officers should monitor how effectively teachers are educating students on sensitive issues, including but not limited to menstrual hygiene. We also need to improve the school wash systems. We have tried to build awareness in this regard, and we felt that an information dissemination system to let the schools and community know about the budget for realizing MHM toilets should be developed between the local government and the school and community to produce the best results. Nakib Rajib Ahmed, Head of Programmes, RedOrange Media and Communications Lack of awareness is the root cause behind every taboo, misconception and social stigma around menstruation, and a significant aspect of the Ritu Program is building that awareness and advocacy around menstrual hygiene management on a national level. Working on this, we have learned two major things. First, on a national level, using edutainment and infotainment involving mass and social media campaigns have a big impact in raising awareness. We produced a 13-episode reality TV show, where we learned that if we can get the target audience directly involved, it gathers massive acceptance and credibility. If these people are talking about it publicly, then the taboo is broken to a large extent and people can start having a more positive outlook on menstruation. The second most noteworthy learning comes from our journalist fellowship program, where we provided orientation to 90 journalists. It had a transformative effect on these journalists, and now they identify MHM as a significant aspect of women's health, which has, in turn, inspired them to write extensive news reports on the topic.

Mahjabeen Ahmed, WASH Specialist, UNICEF National hygiene promotion strategy of Bangladesh has emphasized on menstrual hygiene. When national hygiene surveys are conducted, a number of indicators are included which paints a clear picture of the situation. Within its support to ensure the sustainability, UNICEF has suggested to include very important elements in the strategy: informing  girls on menstrual hygiene issues at early age before  menstruation starts, operation and maintenance of WASH facilities at schools and other institutions, emergency preparedness plan eg during natural disasters, reinforcement of public-private partnership, disposal methods at homes, schools and workplaces, community engagement for breaking taboos, making appropriate use of  technological advancements, development of appropriate and gender sensitive IEC/BCC materials, involvement of men as they have many important roles in the society such as father, husband, colleague, classmate and professionals and better knowledge management through dissemination of best practices of different stakeholders. Dr Ikhtiar Uddin Khandaker, Head of Health Programme, Plan International Bangladesh We have focused our SRHR efforts in hard to reach locations like coastal and hilly areas. We should continue to create partnerships with the union council. In our experience, it has produced better results since these councils have a budget allocated exclusively for SRHR; they even helped install toilets. With regard to informing students about MHM, we suggest creating interactive and engaging channels apart from the standard curriculum. This allows students to feel more interested and helps them absorb the information better. Md. Zahirul Islam, Additional Secretary, Local Government Division The government is in the process of creating an MHM strategy through a working committee with me as its chairperson. In this meeting, we have already discussed the need for awareness, infrastructure, regulatory reform, availability of products and pads, and budget allocations, and I am certain these discussions will bear fruit. Menstruation is a natural phenomenon and our people's representatives, guardians, parents, teachers and religious authorities need to exercise an ideal social perspective toward it. To bring this about, we need an all-encompassing social movement with the Ritu Program as the pioneer behind it whose experience can prove invaluable to us. I would request every institution to include madrasas whenever they are working to create MHM awareness in schools. Since madrasas are managed by the government, it is often easier to work with them than with schools. With Islam having specific guidelines related to menstruation, we need to work on sensitizing our religious leaders as well, thus removing religious obstacles currently predominant in society. Private contributions outweigh government contribution in case of MHM because the government does not have sufficient resources to take a financial lead on this. The government will focus on vulnerable groups and be responsible for their development. Lastly, I would like to point out that our communication regarding MHM has become primarily English-centric and I suggest that we make a comprehensive Bangla version available as well. This will help increase reach and is likely to produce far more effective results. Mahfuj-ur Rahman, Equity and Rights Specialist at WaterAid Bangladesh We have been working on a project called WASH in School since November 2016 with the aim to address WASH inequalities at secondary school and madrasas across the country. At the initial phase, the project encompasses approximately 350 secondary schools and madrasas from 76 upazilas in greater Rangpur, Sylhet and Dhaka division. In our experience, infrastructure is crucial for MHM, that is why we tried to follow a gender-friendly inclusive model and it has seen significant development over the years. An integral part of it is an exclusive restroom reserved for MHM, primarily because although there are latrines in most schools, such restroom that allows changing sanitary pad is not available almost anywhere. On disposal, the ministry circular states that every school needs to have a lidded bin exclusively for pad disposal. But carrying that bin away for further disposal becomes an issue. That is why we came up with a sustainable plan -- the bin would house a pit behind it to collect pads. In about three years when the pit is filled to capacity, these pads will get incinerated. These restrooms are also equipped with washing and drying facilities of sanitary materials. Md. Enamul Haque, Joint Secretary, Education Ministry Under the Ministry of Education, we have 10,000 madrasas covering 100,000 students. There are plans for 1,800 more madrasa buildings, and according to our SDGs, each building should have at least two wash blocks. MHM is often not in focus as a part of the fourth SDG and to address that, we should include the madrasa training centre in our strategy. Md. Iqbal Hussain, Joint Secretary, Women and Children Affairs Ministry It is an undeniable fact that MHM is still a taboo in our country. Last year, our ministry carried out a project to ensure adolescent girls' menstrual health by producing and distributing sanitary napkins. I was appointed as the project director, but after doing a little research, I notified the ministry that it would be difficult for me to carry out my responsibilities the project's sensitive nature. Later, a woman was appointed in my place. We have to acknowledge these realities when dealing with MHM. Dr Bilkish Begum, Deputy Secretary, Health Services Division  Speaking of hygiene management, in the Health Ministry, women starting from the rank of deputy secretary all the way to peons do not have access to a toilet exclusively reserved for ladies. As a workaround, we use the library toilet and that too takes some effort. I hope this will be addressed in the near future. Dr Mahbubur Rahman, Project Coordinator, EIU, icddr,b In the national hygiene surveys of 2015 and 2018, hygiene product usage rates showed 85% of all women used cloth pads. In 2018, sanitary pad usage increased, bringing cloth pad usage to 73%. The usage of sanitary pads was most prevalent among adolescents. In one research, we gave both cloth and sanitary pads to schools to determine preference patterns. Results showed a preference for both. The challenge with cloth pads was drying and washing while that of sanitary pads was the availability of proper disposal methods. Increased MHM awareness in schools also decreased absenteeism to an extent. We need to orient girls and women on how to use these pads hygienically. We also need to focus on making these products as biodegradable as possible and help facilitate the pad disposal process. Zobair Hasan, Director, DORP We started bringing MHM to the forefront of discussion since 2014. Of the 11 directives issued in a 2015 circular, the first stated that there will be sufficient fund allocation for MHM. As in a few other cases, there is no exclusive budget allocation for MHM; it is fragmented over multiple allocations. The 2019 Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation report states that 80% of the country's health and sanitation costs are borne by families. The case is quite similar for schools as well. We look forward to seeing our government create a policy that will acknowledge our recommendations. In our 17 SDGs, the fourth SDG states that women should have separate toilet facilities and we should work to achieve this goal by providing this facility all over the country. The SDG Planning Commission has allocated a budget which amounts to Tk1,186 per individual. Our local representatives need to be aware of this since the budget needs to be implemented in the grassroots. Reaz Ahmad, Executive Editor, Dhaka Tribune Objectively speaking, we need to acknowledge that we are not doing too badly as far as providing basic hygiene necessities are concerned. Comparatively, in many rural areas of India, women do not have access to proper toilets, let alone MHM facilities. Almost 100% of our country has access to some form of hygiene facility. Putting the three stakeholders -- our government, NGOs and charities account for 33% of the total health budget. That means 67% of our health expenditure is out of pocket, which is one of the highest in the world. Since the '70s, we have been getting exceedingly better at health management even through natural disasters such as cyclones and floods. But, we need to prioritize on addressing how people slip back into poverty because they cannot cope with the high health budget. The irrational levels of VAT applied to MHM products and ingredients only contribute to the problem. Removing these taxes will benefit not just women but future generations. Issues such as MHM and early marriage need to be addressed immediately, otherwise, we will not be able to begin reducing malnutrition and stunted growth for our future generations. Nasrin Begum, Unite for Body Rights We are working to incorporate MHM strategies in the NCTB curriculum. NCTB has announced that after 2020, the books up to 10th grade will include MHM and SRHR as a part of life-skill education. We need to try to incorporate SRHR and MHM in the public and private teachers' training institutions; only then can we have a major impact on a large group of adolescents. Lastly, we should develop a few web-based tools as part of the strategy in order to virtually connect to every adolescent in the country. Alok Majumder, Country Coordinator, WAI, Simavi MHM should not be simply about women since it affects reproductive health and thus our entire future generation. According to a 2019 government report with survey data from 2013 and 2018, although 84% schools have latrines, only 22% have access to soap and water and only 13% has MHM systems in place. Among these latrines in schools, 55% remain locked which needs to change. The previous survey showed 40% absenteeism and the current survey shows a 10% decrease, which is a sign of good progress. Currently, the ratio for the number of students to toilets is 187 to 1, while our government's target is to take this ratio to 50 to 1. Md. Abdur Rauf, Joint Secretary, Policy Support Branch, Local Government Division The National Hygiene Promotion Strategy 2012, the first legal document on MHM, first saw the inclusion of MHM in Bangladesh. One of the 10 strategies mentioned in it was the Behaviour and Social Change Communication (BSCC) strategy and its primary focus was personal hygiene including menstrual hygiene. Previously we did not have any data on the state of menstrual hygiene. So in 2014, we conducted a survey under the local government in collaboration with icddr,b and Water Aid.  The results showed that 86% of all women use cloth pads and over 30% are not aware of MHM until it happens to them. However, our most recent survey data, which is yet to be published, shows that the percentage of women using cloth pads has dropped by 13%. In 2018, we had met at Sonargaon hotel to observe the Menstrual Hygiene Management Day where we witnessed a rather strong demand for the creation of a legal instrument for MHM. After prolonged deliberations, we now have created a guideline that will help develop the National MHM Strategy. Fazal Mahmud, Manager, Marketing, Square Toiletries Ltd Before going to our recommendations, I would like to thank Bangladesh government and NBR for their care for female hygiene and declaring SRO to withdraw supplementary duty. However, we believe that this caring attitude will be reflected further to remove Custom Duty on Raw Materials; some of the major raw materials, such as Airlaid, PE Film, SAP etc. still have a CD of 25%, 10% and 10% respectively. Also, if the prevailing 15% VAT is removed from production stage, it would help companies to offer lower priced sanitary napkin. From Square Toiletries Limited, we are trying to make our napkins more environment-friendly. To do that, we need significant assistance from our government, particularly because the necessary raw materials will have to be imported. India launched a biodegradable sanitary pad in March 2018 which costs only Rs 2.5 since it is heavily subsidized by the Indian government. It would be good if our government adopts similar practices and extend its assistance to produce and promote such environment friendly solution across the country.  On the topic of ensuring availability and disposing sanitary napkin, we have a few initiatives in place. One such initiative is educating around 100,000 students annually and making sure their parents are notified of this MHM awareness program. Availability of pads in educational institutes or working places is an infrastructural issue and lack of eagerness is also there; even though we are pursuing to build a channel to keep products available at these places, a government order would bring more pace to ensure access of sanitary napkin for every girl. Mahiul Kadir, Executive Director, Hope for the Poorest If we divide the girls and women relevant for MHM into three broad categories -- we have those who have no knowledge regarding menstruation, the ones who are aware but do not have the resources to acquire necessary pads, and ones who are exercise MHM in an ideal manner.  A secondary target group would then be parents and siblings with teachers and leader groups as part of the community. The tertiary group would consist of the media which can focus on creating a link between policymakers and beneficiaries. Then there are organizations like the MHM Platform that addresses such issues, and lastly, there are cultural and social activists that can help create an enabling environment. Furthermore, we need an intervention from the government so that we can have a separate and exclusive entity to address MHM issues. Prof Dr Md Abdul Mannan, Director (Secondary), Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education The curriculum that was developed in 2011 for pre-primary to Class XII included assessment strategies and teaching-learning approaches. But we have not been able to transition from a result-based education to a learning-based one  because we could not implement the continuous assessment mentioned in the curriculum. Over the years, we have witnessed much development from a makeshift latrine to a toilet and now we have requirements for a wash block. But in order to achieve the fourth SDG, we are in dire need of continuous assessment. Mushfiqua Zaman Satiar, Senior Policy Adviser, SRHR and Gender, The Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands The Ritu Program had a target of creating an MHM policy and it is evident through this dialogue that the initiative is already underway. Through our research projects, we have noticed how girls drop out due to MHM issues. This drop out leads to early marriage and that, in turn, leads to early pregnancy which proves detrimental for them in the long run. These limitations are restraining the women in our society from keeping up with men in terms of progress and development. Unfortunately, the project outline stated that we are to start with HSC students, whereas girls in Class IV often experience menstruation. So we believe girls should be made aware at a much earlier age. We should also focus on alleviating the shock that accompanies experiencing menstruation for the first time."

      "text": "The bridge collapsed in July this year because it did not have any reinforced cement concrete pillars Locals have been suffering for the past two months, since the collapse of the only bridge in the Rangachira area of the Sadar upazila in Tangail, that had access to the Bangabandhu Bridge, causing major inconvenience in the daily communication of 40,000-45,000 locals of 20 villages.  A bamboo bridge was built in its place now being used regularly by auto rickshaws, motorcycles and rickshaw-vans. Locals fear the bamboo bridge might collapse anytime as it is unsteady and shakes when a vehicle crosses it. According to District Relief and Rehabilitation Office sources, the contractor company Molla Enterprise had built the Rangachira Bridge in FY2016-17, at a cost of Tk22 lakh. \"The tender issued for the Rangachira Bridge did not include any instructions for piling. So, the bridge had collapsed due to its weak foundation during the recent floods in the area,\" said former union parishad chairman Badiuzzaman Faruk.   \"The bridge collapsed in July this year because it did not have any reinforced cement concrete (RCC) pillars,\" said Abdus Sattar Azad, Awami League's Kakua Union unit president. Auto-rickshaw driver Minhaz Uddin, who has to drive his vehicle regularly on the bamboo bridge, said: \"The collapse of the concrete bridge have caused much inconvenience to the people here in the char areas. It needs swift reconstruction.\" Kakua UP Chairman Md Ali Jinnah said: \"The temporary bamboo bridge was financed from my private funds to curb the commute trouble.\" He added that a letter was sent to the Upazila Engineer and MP for the construction of a brand new bridge in the area. Tangail District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Abdul Gani said: \"Tenders has been issued for reconstructing broken bridges across the district. We will construct the bridges upon considering their priority.\""

      "text": "The houses are built with chhan and bamboos on elevated platforms. Generations of building skills have made these homes aesthetically pleasing, temperate and comfortable The Machang house is a shared tradition among the various ethnic communities of Chittagong Hill Tracts, despite the diverse customs and unique crafts. The houses are built with chhan and bamboos on elevated platforms. Generations of building skills have made these homes aesthetically pleasing, temperate and comfortable. With the proliferation of modern building materials, however, Machang houses are in decline. Even though these traditional houses can still be seen in many villages in the hills, builders and locals say people are no longer choosing to make them, opting instead for modern dwellings. According to people from these communities, the original purpose of the elevated houses, which often stand on 5-6 feet of braced bamboo stilts, was to protect the homes from wildlife and flash floods. The space under the platform is also used to shelter livestock. The chhan, which along with bamboo was the main material for building these houses, was once in high demand in the three hill districts. With changing agricultural practices, the volume of chhan cultivation is decreasing and prices of the material have gone up. Mong Sha Prue Marma, a resident of Trakkhiyang Para, said bamboos and trees are not readily available from the forests, and bamboo in the markets is very expensive. \"This is the reason Machang houses are in decline,\" he said. The platforms of Machang houses are supported on bamboo frames, with the main pillars often made from trees. Sometimes large bamboo stilts are also used. The diagonal supports are tied to the pillars with 'bet,' or strips made from young bamboo.  Despite the rich customs and distinct architecture of the Machang houses, ethnic communities have lost their interest in building Machangs because of the dearth and high price of materials. With this crisis, these architectural heritages are at risk of being lost from the local culture. Kasyimong Marma, a student of Bandarban Government College, said even people who can afford these houses will not build them these days as they do not last more than three to four years. \"So even if it is a little more expensive, those who are well-off prefer to build brick-and-concrete houses.\" One has to go to Trakkhiyang Para, ieght kilometres out of Bandarban town, before they can spot the first Machang house. But then. even in this out-of-the-way village, modern dwellings are taking over. In a cluster at the village's centre, brick houses have mushroomed in the last few years. Bandarban Tribal Cultural Institute Research Officer Uchnu said Machangs were going extinct mostly owing to relocation of the communities, and unavailability of the traditional building materials. \"We need coordinated public and private effort if we are to sustain this heritage,\" he said."

      "text": "Arif and Sumit are the first Bangladeshis to get selected for the prestigious mentoring program which connects filmmakers with leading US entertainment professionals  Bangladeshi filmmakers Arifur Rahman and Rezwan Shahriar Sumit have been invited to Film Independent's Global Media Makers (GMM) program in Hollywood, Los Angeles, according to a recent exclusive report by Hollywood Reporter. They are the first Bangladeshis to be selected for the prestigious program which connects film talent such as writers, directors, and producers, with leading US entertainment professionals through workshops and master classes. The program which initially focused on mentoring talent from the Middle East and North Africa, will bring 18 participants from selected regions of the world to LA for a six week residency program starting October. This is the first time Film Independent, creator of the prestigious Spirit Award, has included filmmakers from South Asia for its annual Global Media Makers program. GMM was launched in 2016 as a partnership between Film Independent and the US Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs which focused on mentoring film talent from countries in the MENA region (Middle East and North Africa).  This year GMM expanded into South Asia with a total of 18 candidates: nine men and nine women selected from India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Lebanon.  Selected participants are awarded a yearlong fellowship starting with a six-week residency in Hollywood, LA, starting October 1.  This year's mentors include Andrew Ahn (Spa Night), Jay Duplass (Room 104), Nicole Perlman (Guardians of the Galaxy), Justin Simien (Dear White People), Mary Sweeney (Mulholland Drive), Lulu Wang (The Farewell) and Bradford Young (Selma). 49 GMM fellows have participated in the past four years, leading to eight produced projects. Among those projects, Egyptian producer Hossam Elouan's 'You Will Die at Twenty' was praised in Venice and Toronto. Tunisian filmmaker Nejib Belkhadi's Look at Me and Turkish filmmaker Ali Vatansever's Saf, also premiered in Toronto, and Egyptian filmmaker Amr Salama's Sheikh Jackson was Egypt's official 2017 submission to the Academy Awards. The master classes and sessions focus on screenwriting, creative producing, and documentary filmmaking, where participants develop their ongoing projects with US mentors, with industry sessions, and field trips to major entertainment companies. These include Netflix, Stage13/Warner Bros., ARRAY and HBO, including an exclusive interaction with HBO Films, Miniseries and Cinemax programming president, Len Amato. Sumit, director of Nonajoler Kabbo-The Salt in Our Waters, told Dhaka Tribune's Showtime: \"GMM has invited me for my second feature project titled 'A New Prophet' starting next week in LA. This is a writing and development residency organized by Film Independent and the US Department of State. I have recently returned from France after completing the post production of my first film Nonajoler Kabbo and will fly off to LA on September 29 for this program.\" Asked about the local release date of Nonajoler Kabbo, Sumit who was a semifinalist at Sundance Screenwriters Lab in 2017,  replied: \"I will start submitting the film in the international film festival circuit from October and the local release date will be set according to the buzz it receives globally.\" Arif, producer of Afghanistan-Bangladesh co-production Roqaia, which opened at the 76th Venice International Film Festival, told Dhaka Tribune's Showtime: \"The GMM program seemed very interesting to me because filmmakers cannot directly apply to this program. They have to be nominated by global filmmakers. As Sumit and I got selected at this program this must mean we (Bangladeshi filmmakers) are on the right track. It is also a huge honour for us to represent Bangladesh in LA and major Hollywood professionals and studios.\" \"When GMM officials contacted me saying I had been nominated by other global filmmakers, I completed their official application and other procedures. I also told them then if we collaborate and organize some workshops with these industry professionals back in Bangladesh it would be great, because we need to nurture promising filmmakers back here. They replied positively and hopefully we can do that soon,\" added Arif. Arifur Rahman, producer of Matir Projar Deshe - Kingdom of Clay Subjects, has been invited to the GMM program for his upcoming Bangladesh-Germany co-production, 'Paradise.' The film has also been selected for the 16th Berlinale Co-Production Market.  Arif is currently attending a producers' program in Busan, Korea, and will start for LA when it ends this week.

      "text": "For Eid-ul-Azha, Gazir Bazar haat houses a lot of cattle coming in from around 150 villages of 18 upazilas in Jessore, Magura, and Jhenaidah Cattle traders are frustrated because of falling cattle prices due to the high supply of sacrificial animals at  Gazir Bazar haat in Kaliganj upazila of Jhenaidah.  For Eid-ul-Azha, Gazir Bazar haat houses a lot of cattle coming in from around 150 villages of 18 upazilas in Jessore, Magura, and Jhenaidah. Traders highlighted three main reasons for low sales, that include: floods having affected customers financially, insufficient customers from affluent parts of the country, and too much cattle from traders. On a visit to the cattle market on Monday, this correspondent saw almost 4,000 heads of cattle on display, but not many customers, driving them to bargain with traders. Cattle traders said approximately Tk3 crore worth of sacrificial animals were there that day. The price of a cow for sacrifice has on average fallen at least Tk10,000-Tk20,000 compared to prices last year. Sellers and businessmen in the market were disappointed by their losses this year. Lutfur Rahman from Fazilpur village of Kotchandpur upazila in Jhenaidah, said he brought four cows to sell in the market but was able to sell only one for Tk60,000. He added that the price should have been at least Tk70,000. Shaheb Ali from Magura, said: \"I have been in the cattle business for 48 years. I think because of the flood situation across the country, the demand is low for cattle.\"  He too was able to sell only one cow at a price of Tk53,000. Abdur Rahim another seller of the same upazila, said he had bought a cow for Tk87,000, but was able to sell that for only Tk85,000. Because of the additional expenses and the loss in sale price, he suffered a loss of at least Tk5000. Abdur Razzak, from Bagherpara upazila, Jessore, said: He brought a cow weighing 4 maunds, which should have sold for Tk90,000, but it went for Tk80,000 only. Shafirul Islam, from Salua village of Magura district, said: \"This year the number of buyers from outside Jhenaidah, and especially Dhaka, are low.  This is one of the reasons for the low price of cattle.\" He added that he sold a cow for the same price he bought it at. Sagar Biswas, the leaseholder of the cattle market, said: \"Our cattle market supplies the best quality cattle in the district. Every year thousands of heads of cattle are traded, but this year the sales are low relative to supply.\""

      "text": "The state has a strong ethnic mix, deeply committed to preserving their cultural autonomy Dissident political leaders from the Indian state of Manipur on Tuesday said they were unilaterally declaring independence from India and forming a government-in-exile in Britain. The former princely state became part of India in 1949, two years after the country won independence from Britain, but has since seen decades-long violent separatist campaigns.  Narengbam Samarjit, external affairs minister in the self-declared Manipur State Council, said the exiled government would push for recognition at the United Nations. \"We will run the de jure exiled government here from today onwards,\" he told reporters in London, after a declaration of independence first announced in Manipur in 2012 was read aloud. \"We will seek recognition from different nations to become a UN member. We hope many of the countries will recognise our independence.\" Manipur, one of India's smallest states with a population of around just 2.8 million people, is one of the so-called \"Seven Sisters\" - a group of restive north-eastern states. The region, encircled by five other countries and connected to the rest of India by a sliver of land arching over Bangladesh, has been wracked by armed conflict and instability.  It has spawned more than 100 militant groups over the decades whose demands range from autonomy to secession.  Violence has been part of daily life for decades in Manipur, which borders Myanmar, with a strong presence of the Indian military. The state has a strong ethnic mix, and its Meitei, Naga, Kuki and Pangal communities are all deeply committed to preserving their own cultural autonomy. Its people have also always tended to look eastwards in their search for cultural links. Samarjit said he hoped the world would support its independence cause. \"We are not free there and our history is going to be destroyed, our culture is going to be extinct,\" he warned. \"So the UN should listen we raise our voice to the whole world that the people living in Manipur are human beings.\" The High Commission of India did not respond to a request for comment."

      "text": "French cartoonist Philippe Squarzoni has taken up the huge task of trying to convey the complex science of climate science and the global emergency that it implies in the form of his autobiographical/documentary graphic novel titled 'Climate Changed'. Hopefully, this will enable the general public, which does not always seem inclined to wade through dense texts on scientific topics, to get a better appreciation of the challenges of global warming The book starts with the author contemplating the difficulties of tackling the subject of global warming in comic book form. Unlike most comic book stories, it's a scientific phenomenon without the conventional beginning and end.  His solution is to place a fairly detailed exposition of climate science in the context of an autobiography. The end result is illuminating. It serves to remind the reader that climate change is not just happening to the globe. It's happening to all of us, since we all live on this planet that is rapidly heating up, and is already presenting us with real consequences in the form of record high temperatures, droughts and deadlier storms. His visit to his childhood home and his observation of how much smaller and how different it seems as an adult illustrates that the comfortable planet we knew even a few decades ago is gone forever; the climate has changed, and it's a now a new, more dangerous world that we live in. As a low-lying country which is both densely populated and incredibly vulnerable to sea level rise, Bangladesh gets two mentions in the book. Squarzoni quotes climatologist and World Bank economist Stephane Hallegatte: with \"...a rise in sea level of a little over 3 feet (1 metre)... numerous densely populated coastal regions such as the Ganges and Nile deltas could be flooded. Millions of people will be driven out, and agricultural production will be severely affected. 20% of Bangladesh could be flooded.\" Bangladesh comes up again when Hallegatte discusses the potential effect of millions of climate refugees on the international arena: \"If 20 million people leave Bangladesh and head for India, what do we do?... What will the India and Bangladesh of 2060 be like? Will tensions between them have eased? Or will they be at war?\" Even in Bangladesh, such long-terms concerns are rarely addressed in the short-term new cycle. Unfortunately, the effects of climate change will be felt disproportionately by the poor; this is made clear by Squarzoni's account of the severe flooding caused by Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans in 2005. The wealthier sections of the populace all evacuated upon hearing storm warnings a day in advance. The poor had no means to escape, and had to survive for days on the roofs of their submerged houses with most of the city being flooded with up to 23 feet of water.  30,000 people took shelter above the flood waters in the city stadium, until being finally evacuated by the government to the surrounding states. Desperate people started looting shops for supplies, with the result that a curfew was imposed; US soldiers freshly returned from Iraq were called in with orders from the state governor to shoot to kill. Total deaths numbered 1293, and 2 million were displaced; hundreds of thousands for over a year. A vast number of people were left in financial ruin with no means of rebuilding their ruined homes. All this in the richest country in the world. The question arises as to how poorer countries would deal with similar storms and floods, which will grow more common everywhere as global warming adds heat and power to storm systems. Will wealthy countries treat poor countries any better than they treat the poorest of their own citizens? \"So, how to end this book?\" Squarzoni asks as he draws to a close. He observes that so far humanity has failed to deal with the existential threat of climate change by curbing fossil fuel use, and thus closes almost on a pessimistic note. However, he goes on to say, \"The story isn't over.\" Everything depends on how successfully we the public are able to lobby governments of the world to act over the next decade, which according to the 2018 International Panel on Climate Change report is all the time we have left to make severe cuts to fossil fuel use and thus prevent catastrophic climate change of over 1.5C.

      "text": "According to government data, production of the silver fish stood at 517,000 tons in 2017-18, up from 279,189 tons in 2006-07 Ilish production in Bangladesh has doubled in a decade, thanks to the government's efforts, including its ban on catching brood fish, and fries. According to government data, production of the silver fish stood at 517,000 tons in 2017-18, up from 279,189 tons in 2006-07. In 2014-2015 the production was 387,211 tons. The ban was first imposed in 2011, the officials of the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock said at a national seminar on \"65 days fishing ban in the sea, and 22 days ban on hilsha fishing to protect reproductive Hilsa programme - 2019\"  at capital's CIRDAP auditorium on Wednesday.  The seminar was organised by Sustainable Coastal and Main Fisheries Project of the Department of Fisheries.  Masud Ara Momi, assistant director of the fisheries department, said: \"In 2011-2014, the government imposed a ban on catching Ilish during the breeding season for 11 days. In 2015, the period was increased to 16 days and in 2017 to 22 days. We have found significant increase in the production as well as in size and weight. \"The average size of the netted fish also increased from 510 grams (2014) to 880 grams (2016).\" This year, the ban on fishing will start from October 9 and will continue till October 30, she said.  While sharing the impact of the ban, Director (Marine) Dr Md Abul Hasanat of the fisheries department gave examples of neighboring countries - India (45-61 days), Myanmar (92 days), Thailand (91 days), Srilanka (February, September, October), and China (78-124 days). \"We have done a research on the impact of the 65-day ban where we found that 49% of the people related with the industry said it's helpful, 14% said time period for ban needs to be increased while 3% said the time span needs to decrease, with 6% for delaying the ban period,\" said Dr Md Abul Hasanat.  He also emphasized on the challenges of implementing the ban on fishing and recommendations, saying: \"We lack manpower and logistics, budget; there is a tendency of illegal entry of foreign vessels, lack of patrol vessels as well as controlling the motorized and non-motorized fishing boats in the 710 kilometers of the country's coastal area.\" Recommendations Citing the study, a number of recommendations was advised. They are:  *    increase of manpower,  *    opening up a new economic code to implement banned seasons, and allocating a sufficient budget,  *    adopting new programs to implement banned seasons as well as materializing them, increasing food assistance and adopting alternative economic activities for fishermen            during the period,   *    providing ID cards to all the fishermen working in the vessels at sea,  *    Ensuring \"Safety of Life at Sea\" training for all officials, sailors and fishermen of sea vessels,  *    passing the proposed Marine Fisheries Bill and the National Marine Fisheries Guideline,  *    updating the data of motorised and non-motorised fishing vessels,  *    registration of all fishing vessels, bringing all fishing vessels under the (Vessel Monitoring System) VMS and the (Automatic Identification System) AIS systems, *    formulating the Bay of Bengal Hilsa Commission comprising of the members from the countries concerned,  *    capacity building of the Marine Fisheries and Coastal  Fisheries departments to implement the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance (MCS),  *    taking effective measures to control sea pollution, and demarcating a 40-meter geofence or control line in the Bay. The speakers at the seminar, suggested that the government coordinates with neighboring countries India and Myanmar in regard to the ban on fishing at the Bay of Bengal. \"Fishermen are at risk, as well as the fishing industry, because of the ban. However, this ban needs to be imposed on the fishing boats of Myanmar and India in our territory,\" said Md Tajuddin Taju, general secretary of the Marine White Fish Trawler Owners Association.  Representative of Bangladesh Coast Guard Commander Masud said that they have recently sat with the high officials of India including the director general of the Coast Guard, where they have assured the Bangladeshi part that they will take initiatives so that their fishermen do not cross the maritime border.  The national seminar was presided over by State Minister for the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock Md Ashraf Ali Khan Khasru. In his speech, he said: \"Fishermen may not be aware about the ban, but the trawler owners know about it. So, they have to follow the government directives as well as think about the safety of the fishermen.\" Secretary of Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock Md Raisul Alam Mondol, Fisheries Research Institute Director General Yahya Mahmud, Secretary (Maritime Affairs Unit) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Khurshed Alam, leaders from different fishing vessels, and associations, among others, were present at the seminar."

      "text": "Bangladesh's insurance sector is a vital area that requires more attention The role of insurance in managing risks in an economy cannot be overstated. On a micro scale, it safeguards households and companies from a myriad of risks. On a larger scale, it reduces the financial burden on a government and creates a stable environment in which businesses can thrive and succeed.  While Bangladesh has made gigantic strides on the path to economic prosperity, its insurance sector is a vital area that requires more attention and would benefit from regulatory reform. Currently, Bangladesh's insurance sector comprises 45 general insurance companies and 31 life insurance companies. In addition, the country has two state-owned insurance corporations -- one in the general segment and the other in the life segment. Within Bangladesh's insurance sector, life insurance constitutes a 73.5% share of its insurance market and non-life insurance a 26.5% share. Micro-insurance and Islamic Insurance (Takaful) are also a part of Bangladesh's insurance sector.In 2017, non-life insurers earned a gross premium income of Tk2,908.1 crores and life insurers Tk8,203.1 crores. The assets of all the insurance companies stood at Tk44,328 crores by the end of 2016. Investments in both life and non-life insurance companies have grown significantly during the period between 2006 and 2014. Yet, despite some growth, a comparison with other countries paints a dreary picture. Overall, insurance penetration (insurance premiums as a fraction of GDP) in Bangladesh was a meager 0.7% in 2016 and has mostly been on a downward trend since 2009 (see Figure 1).  Figure 2 clearly indicates that Bangladesh's life insurance penetration rate falls behind those of several other developing countries. Compared to its South Asian counterparts, including India, Bangladesh has the lowest premium per capita. According to the World Bank, from 1999 to 2004, the average gross premium income as a percentage of its GDP was 2.7% in India, 1.27% in Sri-Lanka, but only 0.51% in Bangladesh. Egypt, which like Bangladesh is one of the countries featuring in Goldman Sachs' Next Eleven (N-11), has been implementing regulatory reforms. These reforms have helped Egypt strengthen its insurance sector significantly, as is evidenced by the growth of its insurance density premium per capita from $8 in 1999 to $23 in 2016 (PwC Analysis). Globally, Bangladesh ranks 86th out 88 countries in terms of its premium per capita (US dollars) and 85th out of 88 countries in terms of its premium as a percentage of its GDP. Bangladesh had one of the lowest life insurance penetrations rates in 2014 Additionally, Bangladesh lacks insurance products in areas that could prove imperative to its growing economy and population.One such area is agricultural insurance. The agricultural sector is an integral part of the country's economy and accounts for more than a third of all employment, and Bangladesh suffers from agricultural production \"shocks\" every five years. Safeguards against such shocks will enable rural low-income households to keep their children in school, retain their productive assets, and protect their future economic and human development.However, apart from NGOs and public insurance corporations, there are very few providers of agricultural insurance products. Bangladesh has been exposed to the risk of natural calamities and this has had significant adverse consequences for its economy. Insurance can help it significantly in managing this problem. For example, Cyclone Sidr accounted for 20% of the government's expenditure in 2007. Reinsurance can play an important role in reducing the financial impact of disasters on the government budget, eg in 2011, Thailand suffered due to floods and the country's losses were monetized at $30 billion. But due to the reinsurance, $12bn was the insured loss. Consequently, its economy recovered in a short time. Health insurance in Bangladesh in both the private and public sector is virtually non-existent. The percentage of its GDP spent on health is only 2.64% -- the lowest in South Asia. Close to 9% of households pay huge healthcare payments, and 7% have to finance their healthcare costs by selling their assets. People in rural areas are especially vulnerable to falling into the poverty trap. Pension schemes are mostly seen in the Government sector and most elderly people have to rely on family support for their sustenance. And as Bangladesh develops and life expectancy rises, the proportion of elderly people will increase proportionately. Therefore, to relax the burden on government funds when this happens, the country's pension system needs to grow to accommodate employees from various sectors. So it is clear that there is ample space for expansion of and improvement in Bangladesh's insurance sector. Bangladesh's macroeconomic trends show that potential growth in the insurance sector is possible, especially since Asia in general is expected to see unprecedented growth with over a quarter of global primary insurance premiums likely to be generated from the region. The region is set to represent a large share of overall life insurance premiums between 2016 and 2025, rising from 11.6% to 21.7% (see Figure 3). Bangladesh is poised to capture some of this growth. According to a report published by the Boston Consulting Group (2015), three out of five cities in Bangladesh will see the emergence of more than 100,000 people in the middle and wealthy classes in the upcoming decade. This could easily translate into a higher demand for insurance products as individuals and companies become increasingly risk-aware. As per PwC's Analysis, the non-life segment is expected to grow at a high rate and overtake the life segment by a 1% margin. And as the country becomes more industrialized, the demand for fire and property insurance as well as workers' compensation is likely see a substantial growth in demand. Emerging Asia is projected to capture much of the growth in life insurance premiums Bank assurance (a partnership between an insurance company and bank where the bank sells insurance products)presents growth opportunities in Bangladesh's Insurance sector and can result in mutual benefits for banks, insurers, customers and regulators. Banks usually have the preexisting technological and human resources to provide the best customer services. Therefore, it is likely to be more convenient for customers to, for instance, pay premiums and withdraw cash backed by life insurance policies from their banks' ATMs.  On the regulatory side, financial institutions diversifying their product range may reduce systematic risk. In this scenario, insurers stand to benefit as well, as access to banks' various distribution channels could widen their market-reach without them having to create a network of agents. Selling a range of financial services to customers can be in banks' best interests since insurance products would give them a stable source of income. Bank assurance The insurance industry's trajectory towards higher growth is, however, not without challenges. For one, there is a lack of trust between insurance companies and their customers, because the former often engage in highly speculative investments. Claim-settlement related problems also undermine the customer-insurer relationship, and the process of settling claims can be arduous and long. Secondly, Bangladesh's labour force lacks the necessary skills and knowledge to provide insurance services of the highest standard. Therefore, there is a dire need for more actuary consultants and employees holding MBAs and Master's degrees in the country. From a macroeconomic perspective, Bangladesh suffers due to uneven income distribution where the majority of the people are poor, do not have disposable incomes and are unable to afford insurance. This hinders growth of a country's insurance penetration rate. Moreover, its technological capacities need major advancement. Globally, the insurance sector has been undergoing digitization and platforms are being created to optimize customer service and streamline processes. But in Bangladesh, there has been minimal utilization of modern technology with websites being inadequately developed and inefficient processes being used. Moreover, insurance companies do not have access to accurate and up-to-date demographic statistics to use for actuarial computations.  And last but not the least, the regulatory environment in Bangladesh leaves much to be desired. In this scenario, regulatory reform in its Insurance sector can stimulate the country's growth and generate savings by providing easy access to tools for enhanced risk management. It is estimated that a 1% increase in its insurance penetration rate can markedly contribute to Bangladesh's growth (see Figure 5). What a 1% rise in insurance penetration can mean for an economy One of the ways the insurance sector can contribute towards giving a boost to Bangladesh's economy is via the development of its funding infrastructure.Infrastructure development requires long-term investments and insurance companies tend to make such investments. This synergy is leveraged by other countries where it is mandatory for pension funds to allocate a part of their funds to make investments in infrastructure.  As Bangladesh's economy expands, so will its need to fund infrastructure projects. However, the social impact of increased insurance penetration levels in a country beleaguered by poverty like Bangladesh also needs to be kept in mind. Wide health and pension coverage would prevent many people from falling into the poverty trap. This is particularly relevant for women who have lower levels of income and a higher average life expectancy, and are consequently at a higher risk of being destitute when they are old.  Fundamental macroeconomic indicators including GDP growth, unemployment and foreign direct investment (FDI) could be strengthened by a robust insurance sector, which can promote growth by providing guaranteed access to liquidity via insurance coverage. And if increased savings are channeled to various financial savings instruments including insurance, capital markets stand to benefit greatly. A flourishing capital market contributes significantly to a country's growth. Additionally, a resilient insurance sector can help to curb unemployment. Provided there is adequate training and education, young graduates will be able to find various career opportunities in the insurance sector. FDI, yet another central concern for a developing country, is also likely to be boosted by regulatory reform relating to solvency and risk management. In such an environment, financial stability, enabled by a strong insurance sector, should increase investors' confidence and attract substantial international investment. Mature reinsurance markets can increase FDI Regulatory reform must have some principal aims and insurance-related regulation should stop the sale of unfair policies and mis-pricing to consumers. This is especially important because insurance by its nature is a complex product, whereby vulnerable consumers can be persuaded to opt for complicated benefit structures, enticed by complicated policy language. Furthermore, regulators must also take steps to prevent only profitable consumers being selected by insurance companies while the majority cannot access insurance. Ideally, regulation should strive to be inclusive and prevent unfairness. Lastly, regulators must account for insolvency-related risk and ensure there is a satisfactory level of capital reserves to protect customers in scenarios where they cannot collect claims when they need to. Stipulation of risk-based capital requirements such as Solvency II in the EU or principal-based capital requirements such as in the US are regulatory paths that may also be considered.

Bangladesh's Ambassador in The Hague sought support from the Netherlands to implement the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and become a development partner by implementing the delta plan. Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 is premised on greater attention to the grassroots through its in-built, bottom-up, approach, reports UNB. Bangladesh Ambassador to the Netherlands Sheikh Mohammed Belal highlighted the Netherlands' vast reservoir of knowledge and technology; huge pool of water and delta- related business entities plus knowledge institutions; as well as enormous goodwill for Bangladesh. The delta bond between the two countries was emphasized at a seminar in The Hague recently, the Embassy said on Wednesday. Ambassador Belal praised Dutch innovation and creativity in securing their country from the scourge of floods--despite a large part of their country being below the mean sea level--and underscored that Dutch ingenuity in delta management would be critical in implementing the delta plan; like its technical assistance to Bangladesh in formulating the plan. He recalled the historic visit of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to the Netherlands in November 2015 and the twin-ministerial visit from the Netherlands to Bangladesh in June 2015; towards forging institutional cooperation between the two delta countries.  Prof Dr Jaap de Heer, team leader and director of the consortium assigned to prepare the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100, made a keynote presentation at the seminar. He elaborated on the genesis of Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 and explained the key features of the plan and implementation challenges. Lauding the government of Bangladesh for undertaking a long-term plan for a sustainable deltaic Bangladesh, Professor Jaap de Heer underscored the need to mobilize required funds and ensure appropriate institutions implement the plan. As the delta management in Bangladesh will largely depend upon cooperation with the Himalayan basin countries--due to Bangladesh's many trans-boundary rivers--Professor Jaap de Heer also emphasized the need to have broader regional cooperation in the water sector across the basin states. The Ambassador and Professor Jaap de Heer then responded to the questions asked by the distinguished members of the Asian Table. The event was moderated by Secretary of the Asian Table Ronald Staallekker. In the audience were: former ambassadors, civil servants, politicians, and consultants of different fields with experience in Asia, in general, and Bangladesh, in particular."

      "text": "Are we ready for the next cyclone?  Cyclone Fani hit Bangladesh recently. The damages do not much compare to other disasters which had previously taken place and it seemed that Bangladesh was well prepared.  This should be commended as, when it comes to natural disasters, it is very difficult to reduce the damages and destruction to zero. Although Cyclone Fani did not gather much speed but, if the cyclone had hit us with much greater power like the ones in the past, what would have happened? The number of dead bodies and destruction of property would have been higher.   The question then arises: How prepared is the government to face such natural hazards? Bangladesh is a country of natural disasters -- cyclones, floods, river bank erosion, earthquakes, droughts, and other natural disasters occur almost regularly in this country.  In the past, the concept of disaster management only remained in two phases -- relief and recovery. However, after having faced disasters, slowly, Bangladesh has adapted risk identification, preparedness, the participation of the people, and a host of other strategies for disaster management.  But, is it enough? To understand our aptitude in this regard, we need to understand the legal framework of disasters. A legal framework is needed because it gives mandatory obligations and responsibilities to appointed people.  Though a good legal framework regarding disaster management should have been prepared in the early stages but, in reality, the Disaster Management Act was passed in 2012.  The Act formed a department -- Disaster Management -- which is responsible for the application of all plans and policies regarding disasters at all levels of the country. In this framework, the Act asks to form councils and committees at different levels who will work together to protect people from disasters. There is a National Disaster Management Council in Bangladesh consisting of the prime minister as chairperson and different ministers and officers as members.  The responsibility of this council is to give the guidelines and policies of prevention, mitigation, preparation, response, and other necessary things regarding disasters. Also, there are local level committees and groups working to execute the plans with the National Disaster Response Coordination Group and national level management committees.   These committees at the local level play a very important role during hazards -- they stay close to ordinary people and execute the plans easily.  But these suffer from a lack of coordination and cooperation which causes the people from the affected areas to suffer. There is a need for participation of women and disabled people in these local committees. Their representation will help identify the problems and their recommendations will help to create a strategy for effective management.  The government usually provides relief through monetary, health, food, and other support to affected people.  It has two separate funds named National Disaster Management Fund and District Disaster Management Fund which help in this regard.  Although these funds receive donations nationally and internationally, the relief goes to the affected areas through a process which is quite corrupt. The allocated relief seldom reaches the people who have suffered. Health is a crucial factor during hazards -- health clinics and hospitals are often in full capacity. The government can alter this by including institutions, hospitals, and clinics under any private or non-government organization to come and offer any form of aid.  If necessary, it can appoint the armed forces to recover the disaster areas. Bangladesh's shelters for hazards are not sufficient and fully prepped. Emergency shelters must be appointed and stocked for disaster.  If necessary, the legal framework also said to form a research and training institute to increase the capability of disaster management. The legal mechanism of disaster management is good in theory but not in reality.  The government is still working to make a better regulatory framework to face disasters.  We have to remember Bangladesh is at high risk when it comes to natural disasters.  The application of laws and coordination among all the authority in all the phases of rescue, relief, preparedness, and recovery can reduce the harm of disasters at the highest level.

Even though fishermen are netting lots of Ilish, the price is still very high and beyond the reach of most people. Compared to the previous year, Ilish is being sold at a higher price which is affectiing the retail market. Ilish, weighing between 800-900 grams was sold between Tk23,000 and Tk25,000 per maund and Ilish   weighing 1kg or more was sold between Tk33,000-35,000 per maund. Ilish weighing one kilogram was sold at Tk1200 at Reazuddin Bazar, which is just two kilometers off the Fishery Ghat.  Marine fishing boat owners' association leader Aminul Haque Babul Sarker said, \"It is a matter of great happiness for us that we are netting big sized Ilish  fish this year. We are supplying the fish to more than 50 markets of the city and 14 upazilas of the district.\" He also added that the price will come down quite soon .    There are a total of 2400 registered fishermen in Chittagong. Of them, as many as 2000 fishermen are involved with netting Ilish fish, said sources at the district fisheries office. Mominul Haque, District Fisheries officer told Dhaka Tribune that they undertook various initiatives in the district to raise awareness among the fishermen, traders and locals about protecting mother Ilish . \"The catch of Ilish has risen significantly this year due to better management during the fish spawning season, moreover intensified vigilance against Ilish catching during the ban period and increased frequency of drives against offenders have also helped the cause,\" said the District Fisheries officer.   According to the ministry of fisheries and livestock, Ilish contributes to one per cent of the country's total gross domestic product (GDP) and 11 per cent of the country's total fish production. A total of half a million fishermen of the country are directly involved with Ilish netting. The livelihood of another 2 million people is involved with this fish."

      "text": "As the imports declined, prices went up by Tk4-3, with per kg onion selling for Tk48-52 at the port on Thursday, compared to Tk45-48 the previous day The prices of onion have gone up again after imports fell significantly at Dinajpur's Hili land port because of the new minimum export price (MEP) set by the Indian government. As the imports declined, prices went up by Tk4-3, with per kg onion selling for Tk48-52 at the port on Thursday, compared to Tk45-48 the previous day.  Although onion prices were around Tk39-42 per kg before the new Indian export policy took effect. According to sources at the Hili land port, the import of onion resumed around 5:15pm Sunday after the new MEP came into effect.  A total of 368 tons of onions, on 17 trucks, were imported through the port on Sunday. The imports rose by 561 tons on Monday but then again fell to only 297 tons on Tuesday. The downward trend continued on Thursday also. Rashed and Sweet, onion importers at the port, said onion prices in Bangladeshi kitchen markets depend heavily on imports from India. So, if import falls, prices go up automatically, they added.  Harun-Ur-Rashid, an onion importer at the port, said: \"Previously, the import cost of per ton onion was $250-300. In recent months, prices went up in the Indian market due to stock shortage caused by floods. \"Recently, the Indian government also hiked the export price to check price hike in their market. On Friday, India fixed the export price at $852 per ton,\" he said.  Moreover, the new MEP had negatively impacted traders, as they were now forced to open new letters of credit (LCs) spending more money.   Previously, it would cost around Tk23-30 lakh to import 100 tons of onion which now increased to around Tk73 lakh.  As a result, the Hili port was witnessing a major slump in import, he said. \"However, new onion will come up in different areas of India within the next 20 to 25 days. We hope that price will come down to a tolerable level soon,\" Harun added. TCB's open market sale of onion The Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) began sale of onion at a subsidized price in the open markets in Dhaka on Tuesday. The corporation started selling onion at Tk45 per kg at five spots in Dhaka on Tuesday. A buyer can purchase a maximum of two kilos of onion from the spots. Govt to import from Turkey, Myanmar, China The government has decided to import onion from Turkey, Myanmar and China to improve supply and bring down prices of the essential cooking ingredient at kitchen markets. The move came after the Indian government recently fixed minimum export price of onion to rein in soaring prices in their domestic market."

      "text": "Cultivators in Madan, Mohanganj, Khaliajuri, and nearby upazilas said they could not make seed-beds due to excessive rainfall brought by cyclone Bulbul that hit the area recently Farmers in the haor regions of Netrokona district are deeply concerned about Boro paddy farming as the water level in haors are not receding as expected. Cultivators in Madan, Mohanganj, Khaliajuri, and nearby upazilas said they could not make seed-beds due to excessive rainfall brought by cyclone Bulbul that hit the area recently. Boro farming will be delayed if we cannot prepare seed-beds in due time, said the farmers, adding that the delay is more likely to increase the chances of crop damage in early floods. However, Agriculture Department officials said they have advised farmers to cultivate early-season paddy varieties in these regions to avoid the damage.  According to district Agriculture Department, a total of 11,875 hectares of land in 10 upazila of Netrokona has been targeted for preparing Boro seed-beds this year. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, the target for Boro production has been set at 7,45,362 metric tons from 1,83,870 hectares of land in Netrokona. Sanjib Dey, a farmer from Khaliajuri upazila, said: \"It seems that sowing Boro saplings will be late this year, which will minimize the chances of good yields. Winter season begins in two weeks, and it will be too late if we have to start the cultivation process then.\"  \"We won't get healthy saplings in winter, which won't bring robust outcome eventually. Besides, it will take more time for the Boro plants to become mature, and so the crops might get damaged in early flood,\" he added. Expressing similar concerns, Sukomol Sarker, a farmer from Kadirpur village in Khaliajuri upazila, said: \"Crops get damaged by untimely floods almost every year. Since, the preparation of seed-beds is being delayed this year, it will significantly increase the chance of crop damage.\" Sadhan Chowdhury from Tatianagaon village of the same upazila said: \"There are some areas, surrounded by rivers, which are relatively high ground. However, some areas are low lying and it is necessary to dredge some portions of rivers in these areas, starting from the estuary of Meghna river towards northern direction. It is not possible to save crops from flood water without river dredging.\"  Agricultural expert and people concerned in haor regions said water is not receding due to a couple of reasons including lack of river dredging, making unplanned embankments in different places of haor regions.   Habibur Rahman, deputy director of Agriculture Department in Netrokona, said: \"We are advising farmers to cultivate early season paddy varieties in haor region. For example, cultivating BRRI dhan 28 reduces the risk of crop damage in early flood. However, farmers have started planting seeds after preparing seed-beds in some areas, and hopefully others will be able to do the same within a week.\" Netrokona Deputy Commissioner Moinul Islam said: \"We are encouraging farmers to cultivate early season paddy varieties that are high-yielding and grows up in a short time.\""

      "text": "They cultivated potatoes after the government provided them with agricultural equipment and fertilizer free of cost Farmers of Atrai upazila in Naogaon are expecting a bumper crop of potato this season, as the plants are thriving this year. Local farmers prioritized cultivating potato, along with Ropa Aman paddy, because flash floods were less of a problem last year. They were inspired to cultivate potatoes after being provided agricultural equipment, fertilizer, and guidelines--free of cost--as part of a government initiative. Along with government support, the farmers also made significant efforts for a good potato harvest. According to sources of the upazila agriculture office, potato cultivation exceeded the targeted farmland allocation of 2,800 hectors in the eight unions of this upazila.   \"The farmers were also provided with technical support and guidelines, which significantly lowered infections and diseases that commonly affect the harvest,\" Upazila Deputy Assistant Agriculture Office Shafi Uddin told the correspondent. Farmers of several upazilas, including Shahagola and Moniyari had planted a large number of potatoes, said a source from the local agricultural office. Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, farmer Akkas Ali of Rasulpur village said: \"I planted potatoes on two acres of farmland. The harvest looks good, and I am optimistic that I will make a hefty profit this year.\" Echoing the same opinion, farmer Sultanur Alam said: \"I planted potatoes on more than 3 acres of farmland. So far, my crops are unaffected by natural disasters and diseases. I am hoping for a large harvest this season.\""

      "text": "Several BIWTA officials derisively refer to the Buriganga as \"the largest sewer in the world\" The much-delayed relocation of the tanneries from Hazaribagh to Savar has done next to nothing to impede the degradation of the Buriganga. Already in the first weeks of summer, the stagnant Buriganga's water now resembles discarded engine oil, black and thick, billowing toxic stench over the kilometres of neighbouring areas. Mostafizur Rahman, deputy director of the Department of Environment (DoE), said that during dry season, the Buriganga becomes uninhabitable, utterly devoid of oxygen and of all aquatic lifeforms. The DoE conducts a monthly test on the water of the river. The extent of pollution is visible everywhere on the 27km stretch of the river. The tanneries in Hazaribagh were ordered by the court to relocate because they were held responsible for releasing tons of toxic waste into the river every day for decades. The state largely paid for the dearly expensive relocation, out of an untenable hope for a cleaner river. Also Read- In pictures: Black tides of Buriganga Several Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA)officials derisively refer to the Buriganga as \"the largest sewer in the world.\" One of the officials requesting anonymity, said: \"For decades, every government has emphasized the need to protect the rivers. But look at Buriganga, Turag and Balu today. They are nothing but sewerage lines,\" said the BIWTA official requesting anonymity.      Dr Monowar Hossain, executive director of the Institute of Water Modelling (IWM) said the level of pollution in the rivers around the capital is increasingly becoming irreversible.  He said: \"During monsoon, you cannot see the pollution because it gets diluted. Now that the river is at its lowest, the pollution has become visible. Industries and various other sources are indiscriminately polluting the rivers - especially the Buriganga. You cannot have a sustainable development by destroying the environment around you,\"  He noted that the country's huge population is yet another factor: \"If our current population is 18 crore, we should immediately have a population policy like many other countries. By the time the mighty industrialists, the government and the people decide how to address the pollution problem in our rivers, it will be too late. You might be able to bring back some fresh water, but aquatic life will take a long, long time to recover.\"  Black water, silent killer Along the Buriganga, millions of people are exposed to the noxious air. Residents of Kholamora said their lives are sluggish and dreary due to the river pollution.  Ahmed Fazle Rabbi, a primary school teacher in Kholamora said instead of having any benefits of living by a river, they suffer: \"During the dry season, we do not dare touch the ebony water of the river. Children suffer from various health problems due to toxic air pollution, at times it becomes difficult for us to breathe.\"  Boatmen who ferry people across the river reported suffering from skin disorders. \"We make a living by ferrying people across this dead river. Our work is hazardous, as the continued exposure to the water has left our skin scarred and diseased,\" Gazi Sheikh, a boatman, said, revealing ugly rashes on both of his hands.  The Buriganga and other rivers around the capital remain stagnant for eight months between September and May. During this period, the only movement of the river water occurs during high and low tides in the Meghna River, 25km downstream.  The rivers Brahmaputra and Jamuna in Tangail and Manikganj are the only waterfeeders for the river system around the capital. As soon as floodwater recedes upstream, the Ghior Canal in Manikganj and the Old Brahmaputra River in Tangail stop flowing due to siltation at the confluences of Jamuna and Brahmaputra. The water stops feeding the channels, turning the rivers around the capital into stagnant cesspits. When the floods revive the rivers in June or July, the accumulated waste is flushed downstream through Meghna into the Bay of Bengal. Resuscitating the rivers In order to revive the rivers, in 2010 the Water Development Board (WDB) took up a Tk 1000 crore project called \"Rehabilitation of Buriganga, Turag, Balu and Sitalakhya and Augmentation of Dry Season Flow\". The project envisaged, among other components, dredging of 160 kilometers of waterways from Tangail and Manikganj to Dhaka. The IWM did a feasibility study on the scheme. The project came to a standstill when several government bodies failed to reach a consensus.  A WDB official confided that the Local Government and Engineering Department for one, was unable to say what to do with dozens of culverts, link roads they had built on top of the waterways connecting the capital from feeder points.  But many feel that an isolated and expensive project to restore water flow will not solve the problem alone. For instance, the Dhaka Wasa and both Dhaka city corporations dump a significant portion of their untreated waste into the Buriganga every day.  Thousands of small to large industries along the river also dump their liquid and solid wastes in the river. At densely populated areas along the river, all human and household wastes find way into the river. At the Sadarghat launch terminal, hundreds of large vessels arrive and depart every day, carrying thousands of passengers. And all the waste produced by them, ranging from mainly polythene wrapping, dirt and food residue generated on the launches, is nonchalantly swept into the river. Humayun Kabir, a senior engineer with the WDB, said: \"A single project cannot solve this problem, no matter how much money you pour into it. The problems need to be identified, analyzed and addressed. It should become a national priority first for at least a few months. Law enforcement agencies could help train and create awareness among people.\""

Quader, also the road transport and bridges minister, said the historic June 7 is an unforgettable and significant day in the history of Bangladesh. He said the historic movement for six-point demand, declared by the greatest Bengali of all time Bangabandhu, took an important turn on June 7, 1966.  Quader added, \"We got independence under the dynamic leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. And now the country is moving ahead under the visionary leadership of Bangabandhu's worthwhile daughter Sheikh Hasina.\" On this day in 1966, the Awami League (AL) under the charismatic leadership of Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called for a day-long strike throughout East Pakistan, pressing the demand for autonomy to end the exploitation, deprivation, subjugation and tyranny of the then central government of Pakistan on the people here. People took to the streets during the dawn-to-dusk strike throughout the province and the law enforcement agencies, including the East Pakistan Rifles (EPR), opened fire on the demonstrators in Tongi, Dhaka and Narayanganj that left 11 people, including labour leader Monu Miah, Shafique and Shamsul Huq, dead."

      "text": "Farmers in six upazilas of the district have cultivated the Ropa Aman paddy in most of the farmlands during this Aman season Despite flood menace, farmers in the northern district of Nilphamari got a head start in cultivating winter vegetables using an innovative bamboo shelf method. Farmers in six upazilas of the district have cultivated the Ropa Aman paddy in most of the farmlands during this Aman season. They are now eagerly waiting for the harvest.  However, not all lands were suitable for Aman farming. As low-lying lands have been flooded due to excessive rainfall, they have had to cultivate various winter vegetables such as cauliflower, cabbage, tomato, radish and eggplants etc, in the high and unoccupied lands. According to Met office sources, on average of 547mm rainfall was recorded in the beginning of the monsoon season which declined later. However, the volume of rainfall doubled at the end of the season triggering floods in the area.  Despite suffering a great deal of stress in vegetable farming due to the ill-timed flood, farmers did not sit idle. They overcame the situation by making bamboo shelves and began early farming. Majority of the farmers in Nilphamari made these elevated shelves with bamboo sticks and created seedbeds on them.   Komola Thakur, a farmer from Malipara village in Nilphamari sadar upazila, said: \"My land was flooded and I had to make three cauliflower seedbeds all of which are 10 feet in length and 4 feet in width. It will give me a head start because the saplings will ready for plantation by the time flood water recess.\" Dulal Chandra, another farmer of the village, said: \"I made similar seedbeds last month. It gave me enough saplings to cultivate cauliflowers on one Bigha of land. The vegetable will be ready for sale soon. I am hoping for robust yields and good price.\" Another farmer Abul Kalam Azad said: \"It cost me around Tk15,000 to cultivate 3,500 pieces of cauliflowers on one Bigha of land. If it can be sold at Tk10 a piece, then we get around Tk35,000 which is pretty reasonable.\" Abul Kashem Azad, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension in Nilphamari, said: \"Different types of vegetables will be cultivated on an estimated 5,826 hectares of land in the current 2019-20 fiscal year. Farmers are now more aware and innovative.\" \"Bamboo shelf farming is their idea. This method can protect the seeds from natural disasters, excessive heat and insecticides. This way, the seeds can be grown healthy resulting in robust production and fetching more profit.\""

According to Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) sources in Tangail, due to heavy rains, the Jamuna river water level rose resulting in river erosion in Mamudnagar Union of Nagarpur upazila. Union ward 7 is completely engulfed by the river. Villages affected by the erosion are: Kukuria, Keshob Majhail, Majhail, Shona-majhail, Barbaria, chala-Bakla, and Baniapara, where about 500 families were forced to vacate their homes and lands this year. To control the damage by reducing the speed of the river current, the authorities have dumped 36000 of Geo bags in 550 meters of the eroded land since June 17, but the improvement is negligible. Locals say they have sheltered with relatives, or otherwise poor living arrangements. The erosion swallowed large tracts of land this year, including paddy, jute, and peanut fields, and schools, madrasa and mosques in ward 7 of the union.  Karim Sheikh of Kukuria village said: \"River erosion over the years has cost me 16 bighas of my cultivatable land.  Now I only have my home left.\" Abu Sayeed of the same village said his family once owned 150 bighas of land, all of which is now under the Jamuna river. Many other villagers in the erosion prone areas, like Abdul Hye, Sirajul Islam, Mannan, and freedom fighter Abdul Jalil, say they have lost their properties to the Jamuna river because of annual floods . Mamudnagar Union Parishad Chairman Majedur  Rahman Talukdar said: \"If the authorities could build a permanent dam in the river erosion areas, the lands of people in this union could be saved.\" Tangail BWDB Executive Engineer Serajul Islam said: \"We have proposed a project to the higher authorities to build a permanent dam.  Dam construction will commence when the proposal is approved.\""

      "text": "Traders remarked that the price dip was due to adequate stock availability in the local market The price of imported green chilies at the local wholesale markets in Hili land port has dropped by Tk40-45 in a span of just two days. Even on Thursday, it was sold between Tk105-110 per kilogram, while on Saturday it was sold for Tk60-70 per kg. Traders remarked that the price dip was due to adequate stock availability in the local market. Sources at the land port said, after a restriction of almost a year, import of green chilies began from July 20. Until yesterday, 230 tons of green chilies were imported through 31 trucks in the past six working days. The price dip was also attributed to the strong presence of locally produced green chilies, which caused its retail price to fall from Tk130-140 per kg to Tk110.  Anwar Hossain, a green chili importer at Hili land port, and Mostafa Hossain, a retail chili trader, said the price of chilies had spiked a few weeks ago thanks to the floods, which prevented farmers from being able to meet the national demand. It was for this predicament that the government had decided to lift the chili import embargo, they remarked. \"Recent bumper yields in Rajshahi, and Meherpur had benefited the local markets, which caused the price of chilies to drop in both the wholesale, and retail sectors,\" they said. But this fall in price had also caused a section of importers to incur losses, as they had to sell them off at significantly lower rates, Anwar and Mostafa added. This has also caused them not to import any more green chilies for the time being."

Fertility, foetuses and children are also affected by toxic air, the review found Air pollution may be damaging every organ and virtually every cell in the human body, according to a comprehensive new global review. The research shows head-to-toe harm, from heart and lung disease to diabetes and dementia, and from liver problems and bladder cancer to brittle bones and damaged skin. Fertility, foetuses and children are also affected by toxic air, the review found, reports The Guardian. The systemic damage is the result of pollutants causing inflammation that then floods through the body and ultrafine particles being carried around the body by the bloodstream. Air pollution is a \"public health emergency,\" according to the World Health Organization, with more than 90% of the global population enduring toxic outdoor air. New analysis indicates 8.8 million early deaths each year - double earlier estimates - making air pollution a bigger killer than tobacco smoking. But the impact of different pollutants on many ailments remains to be established, suggesting well-known heart and lung damage is only \"the tip of the iceberg.\" \"Air pollution can harm acutely, as well as chronically, potentially affecting every organ in the body,\" conclude the scientists from the Forum of International Respiratory Societies in the two review papers, published in the journal Chest. \"Ultrafine particles pass through the [lungs], are readily picked up by cells, and carried via the bloodstream to expose virtually all cells in the body.\" Prof Dean Schraufnagel, at the University of Illinois at Chicago and who led the reviews, said: \"I wouldn't be surprised if almost every organ was affected. If something is missing [from the review] it is probably because there was no research yet.\" The Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, which has tracked atmospheric CO2 levels since the late 1950s, on Saturday morning detected 415.26 parts per million (ppm). It was also the first time on record that the observatory measured a daily baseline above 415 ppm.  The last time Earth's atmosphere contained this much CO2 was more than three million years ago, when global sea levels were several metres higher and parts of Antarctica were blanketed in forest. How does air pollution affect our body This results in breathing problems, from asthma to emphysema to lung cancer. There is now overwhelming evidence that air pollution results in serious harm not only to the lungs, but also to the heart. Strokes, dementia and reduced intelligence are all conditions affecting the brain that have been linked to air pollution. Perhaps the most disturbing impact of toxic air is the damage to reproduction and children. Fertility is reduced and miscarriages increased by exposure to air pollution. The unborn are also affected, with a recent study finding pollutants in the placentas that nourish foetuses. Bangladesh, one of the most densely-populated countries in the world, has long been struggling with air pollution, and Dhaka continuously ranks among the world's most polluted cities. Dhaka is the second most polluted capital, with Bangladesh having the most polluted air in the world, according to the 2018 World Air Quality Report by Greenpeace and AirVisual, that present PM2.5 air quality data aggregated through the IQAir AirVisual platform."

      "text": "No complaints can be lodged against influential sand extractors The Pouli River dam, protecting Tangail city from land erosion, is now under threat due to illegal sand extraction. Illegal sand extraction is causing problems to the residents of three nearby villages, as hundreds of heavy trucks ply and damaged the dam to a large extent. An influential group of people, wielding local Awami League leaders' name, are extracting sand from the river, and no action is taken on any complaints placed. During daytime, they extract sand from lands they have taken on lease. However, during the night they use industrial vacuum to extract sand directly from the river. Back in 2000, the 47km long Pouli River dam was built under the \"Compartmentalization Pilot Project\" (CPP). Since then the dam has not undergone any renovation, with various parts of it getting damaged to the point of breaking up. If the dam was to breach, houses, crop fields, schools, mosques, and temples in a massive area will be washed away by water.  Last year, the people of Ramdevpur village in Kalihati upazila repaired the dam in order to protect themselves from being washed away. An influential group of people, wielding local Awami League leaders' name, are extracting sand from the river, and no action is taken on any complaints placed | Dhaka Tribune However, with the danger of floods looming ahead, their future appear uncertain. Local people said hundreds of sand trucks ply over the dam every day, damaging the only path they use to commute. They cannot say anything in protest because of the powerful influence of vested quarters. They face life threats if they protest. Moreover, there is sand everywhere; inside their foods, clothes, and everything else. It is getting increasingly difficult to survive here, they said.  Requesting anonymity, a sand extractor said: \"A part of the dam in Mohela was damaged last year, and more parts will suffer the same fate. We have to do what the owners' say.\" \"Many that took lease of the land along the river bank, carry out illegal sand extraction directly from the river. Nobody can say anything to them.\" Tangail's Deputy Commissioner (DC), Shahidul Islam said: \"I have assigned the executive officer of Kalihati upazila to look into this. We will take proper actions to preserve the dam that protects Tangail city.\" * Illegal sand mining going across the Pouli River Dam  * Heavy sand truck movement damaging the dam * Some parts of the dam are damaged to the point of breaching * No complaint works against influential sand mine owners * Locals facing difficulties in surviving - commutes and environmental surroundings are affected * Without proper measures, river will devour massive areas  "

      "text": "Media reports had earlier spoken of about 30 dead, with the radio reporting that four pregnant women were among the victims At least 42 people were killed after their houses were swept away Tuesday in a landslide caused by torrential rain in the western Cameroon city of Bafoussam, state media reported, showing images of rescuers desperately sifting through rubble for survivors. \"Searches are ongoing. We fear there are further deaths,\" a senior local official told AFP on condition of anonymity as nightfall neared. A total of 42 bodies were taken to the hospital in the city, according to an official statement read on Cameroon Radio Television (CRTV). Media reports had earlier spoken of about 30 dead, with the radio reporting that four pregnant women were among the victims. Pictures of the tragedy in Bafouassam posted on social media showed ramshackle houses having crumbled into the ochre-coloured terrain and men clad in hard hats digging away at piles of mud in the search for survivors. \"The houses that collapsed were built on the side of a hill in a risk zone,\" said the local official in the West Region, of which Bafoussam is the capital, some 300km northwest of the capital Yaounde. He said the landslide was caused by torrential rains that have fallen in the country over the past few days as well as the wider region, with neighbouring Central African Republic and Nigeria also seriously hit.  Cameroon President Paul Biya offered his condolences to families of the victims in a message broadcast on CRTV. Landslides are quite exceptional in the area although further south they are less rare in the rainy season, notably in the English-speaking southwest.  It was in the south-western coastal resort town of Limbe that five people died in a landslide following flooding in July last year. Neighbouring Central African Republic, already mired in a brutal civil war, is reeling from 10 days of torrential rain which have plunged swathes of the country underwater, creating a new emergency in one of the world's poorest nations. Tens of thousands of people have been left homeless after the CAR's largest river, the Oubangui, burst its banks at the height of the country's worst floods in decades which have left parts of the capital Bangui submerged, prompting authorities to warn of the risk of cholera. Several agrarian states in another Cameroon neighbour, Nigeria, have also been hit by flooding. A torrential downpour Monday allowed dozens of inmates to escape from prison in the central state of Kogi."

      "headline": "Moving Beyond 'women'",
      "authors": "Anna Plowman",
      "text": "Questions of 'gender' and vulnerability to climate change What does it mean when we talk about climate change with a focus on gender? What is 'gender' in this context, and what is a 'gender-based' approach? Most ongoing discussions around 'gender' and climate change are dominated by issues concerning women. This is for good reason. Women are set to be disproportionately impacted by the exacerbation of extreme weather events associated with climate change.  'Gender' and the existing focus on women In regions suffering from crop loss and food scarcity, food is often prioritized for male members of the household while women and girls receive smaller portions and are more likely to become malnourished.  Women's workload simultaneously increases as it becomes necessary to walk greater distances to collect clean water and obtain food. Further to this, as households experience stresses on income and food supply, domestic violence against women tends to increase.  Women spend more time than men in the household and away from town centres, and are less likely to own their own phone. This reduces the likelihood that they will receive timely emergency warnings - - about incoming storms, for example - - and advice on what actions to take.  Furthermore, women are more likely to avoid going to cyclone shelters due to fears of being around unknown male company, and a greater risk of being subjected to sexual harassment or assault.  Additionally, women and girls are less likely to have learned to swim, increasing their likelihood of drowning when encountering floods. This problem is compounded by their clothing, particularly sarees, which are known for having a lot of drag and becoming caught up in trees and other debris. Beyond the more immediate impacts of climate change, the longer-term challenges of climate change are also experienced differently by women and men.  It is more common that male rather than female household members will migrate out of highly-exposed areas in search of alternative sources of income, and in such situations, it is often women who are left to manage a household and child care on their own, not necessarily knowing when or if remittances will arrive.  In light of such ways in which women's experiences of climate change are expected to be different compared to men's, conversations around 'gender' and climate change tend to be dominated by the central topic of women and the extra burdens they are set to bear as the impacts of climate change become more severe.  Broadening considerations of 'gender' Yet 'gender' encompasses more than traditional binary groupings of 'women' and 'men'. A more inclusive interpretation of 'gender' further includes transgender people (who identify as a gender different to that which they were assigned and socialized as at birth) and gender non-binary people (who feel that they fit into neither the category of 'woman' or 'man').  Yet, discussions around 'gender' and climate change generally do not consider the ways in which the experiences of these groups with climate change may be different from cis-gendered women and men (people who identify with the gender which they were assigned at birth).  In what ways does a person's non-cis gender identity - - as something which is either known by the wider community or as something which is hidden from the wider community - - impact the way they engage with society and economy, and impact the way in which other people engage with them?  Based on these differences, in what ways are trans and non-binary people likely to be differently impacted by climate change? Once considerations of gender and climate change are broadened in this manner, this subsequently invites further questions, for example, about ways in which non-heterosexual people (gay, lesbian, bi- or other) may also be differently impacted by climate change.  If a person suffers social exclusion and discrimination based on their gender orientation or sexuality (be it something that is known to the wider community, or even based on rumours) this may impact the extent to which the person is included by the wider community in preparations for or responses to an environmental event.  Threats of violence and discrimination from the wider community may further impact the willingness of such people to seek access to available forms of assistance. In situations of economic downturn due to infrastructure damage and crop loss, they may be more likely to be turned away from paid employment.  They may additionally be less likely to be part of an integrated wider family network to whom they can turn for help in preparation for, or in the wake of a disaster. This includes local family members who could offer immediate local help, or even migrant family members who could facilitate the person's subsequent migration.  The impacts of discrimination and exclusion from the family are even more acute for elderly individuals who are more prone to suffering in extreme temperatures and less able to travel to shelters on their own. By considering these scenarios, it becomes apparent that there are many factors beyond a female gender identity which can shape a person's experience with increasingly extreme weather events. In light of this, an intersectional approach to discussions around gender and climate change is useful.  What is 'intersectionality'? Through an intersectional approach, questions of 'gender' in the context of climate change ultimately open the doors for considerations not just for the ways in which women and men are impacted differently by climate change, but also for the ways in which such gendered differences diverge between people of varying backgrounds and social identities. As an approach within critical feminist theory, intersectionality has historical roots in the reactions of black feminists in the United States to a mainstream feminist movement which they criticized for generalizing understandings of women's struggles around a white, middle-class experience.   The mainstream feminist movement questioned, for example, the gendered division of labour whereby (white, middle-class) women were assigned to roles in the household and excluded from formal employment opportunities.  Contrarily, the fight for the right to engage in paid employment outside the home had little relevance to working-class women of colour who had for a long time been forced to undertake the compacted responsibilities of both low-wage employment and household-based labour.  In addition to their exclusion from the mainstream feminist movement, women of colour struggled to have their voices and gender-based experiences of racism represented within the civil rights movement, as leadership positions were largely held by men.  Suffering further sexism within these groups, it was evident that neither the feminist nor civil rights movements on their own were going to adequately address the intersecting forms of oppression that women of colour experienced based on their gender, race, and class. It was understood that liberation for all women would not take place while issues of race-based and class-based oppression remained unaddressed by the wider feminist movement. Through an intersectional perspective, experiences of oppression are understood as being inherently bound up not only in gender but in additional interacting factors (which carry their own social power dynamics) such as class, economic status, place/location, religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, sexual orientation, gender identity (beyond cis -gendered male and female identities and including those transgender or non-binary people), physical ability, and health. How does intersectionality relate to climate change?  In the context of climate change, understandings of vulnerability can be made more nuanced through an intersectional approach. Class, place/location, and livelihood are already prominent factors in consideration when gauging vulnerability to climate change.  Someone who lives in a coastal area (which is highly exposed to storms, flooding, and erosion), and who is additionally both a low-income earner and dependent on agriculture or aquaculture for their income is widely understood to be highly vulnerable to climate change.  Climate change policy discussions and program designs already tend to acknowledge the intersections of a female gender identity with these factors (class, location, and livelihood) and the role of these intersections in shaping a person's vulnerability to climate change.  Yet beyond this, a wider and more deliberate intersectional approach can be used to identify groups of people who may be additionally marginalised and thereby more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.   In what ways are a person's experiences of climate change impacted by their other various intersecting social positions? For example, as a member of a minority ethnic group such as the Arakanese in Barisal division? Or as a Hindu person in a predominantly Muslim area? As a person of uncertain nationality and legal status such as  the Rohingya in Cox's Bazar? As a person who is very young or very old? As a person who has a non-heterosexual sexuality? Or a non-cis gender identity, such as a hijra person? As a person who suffers with mental or physical health problems? Or as a person who was born neuro-diverse or differently physically abled? For people who are marginalised by more than one of these factors (in addition to the more traditional indicators of vulnerability relating to female/male gender identity, class, location, and livelihood), how do their experiences with social life and with climate change differ based on the interaction of those specific factors?  It is useful to know, for example, how climate change may differently impact an elderly, less-mobile Muslim woman in a peri-urban embankment area, compared to a young able-bodied Hindu woman who lives in a rural floodplain region and engages in subsistence agriculture. Information gathered on this can be used to inform the design of programs and policies to improve assistance to vulnerable groups. The aim is not to introduce so many categories and complexities to the point where disaster response becomes slow, inefficient, and ineffective.  Yet this approach can be useful in identifying groups and sub-groups of people who may otherwise be left behind, forgotten, or excluded from receiving assistance, and who may be more in need of such assistance.  Further, short term programs and policies which address the immediate impacts of climate change, an intersectional approach can help better inform efforts to address underlying inequalities between groups, which form the cause for the greater vulnerability of some groups over others.  The traditional focus on gender and women's vulnerability has raised questions for ways in which women can be better integrated into social and economic life, thereby reducing their vulnerability to the impacts of climate change. The same approach can be used to promote the integration of other marginalised groups, and thereby reduce their underlying disposition as vulnerable people in the face of climate change.  Acknowledging the intersections of various social aspects in the way that people experience climate change further allows discussions of gender to move beyond existing broad and simplistic portrayals of women as vulnerable victims of climate change.  An intersectional approach can further acknowledge various other factors which may make some women more vulnerable than others, and may make a non-cis person or even a man highly vulnerable to climate change.

      "text": "Farmers were able to harvest 25-29 maunds of rice per bigha Despite floods, heavy hailstorms, and other climate challenges, three districts in the Rangpur division have managed to yield a bumper crop of Boro this season, as part of the Teesta barrage irrigation project. The Nilphamari, Rangpur, and Dinajpur districts were brought under the irrigation program that was inaugurated on January 15.  The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) sources said cropland of about 40,000 hectares was irrigated in the project command area -- which should yield approximately 2,095,230 tonnes of rice priced at a minimum of Tk119 crore. Cropland   in the project command area has been irrigated and soon the Boro paddy will be harvested in: Nilphamari sadar, Jaldhaka, Dimla, Kishoreganj, Syedpur, upazilas in Nilphamari district; Rangpur sadar, Taraganj, Gangachara, Badargonj of Rangpur district; and Chirirbandar, Parbatipur, Khansama of Dinajpur district. Executive Engineer Abdullah Al Mamun--working in the Dalia sector of the project--showed in a report that the irrigation cost for a hectare of land, with an electric irrigation pump machine is Tk10,500. The irrigation pump operates with diesel costs of Tk14,000 per hectare, but in the project command area of the Teesta barrage, irrigation costs only Tk1,200 per hectare.  \"If we could have managed to get more water to flow through from the Teesta, upstream, we would have irrigated 79,000 hectares of the land in the first phase. We were only able to irrigate 40,000 hectares because of insufficient flow -- which is a lot less in comparison,\" said Engineer Abdullah. Agricultural Extension Officer of the Teesta Barrage Irrigation Project Rafiul Bari said: \"Because of insufficient water upstream, 40,000 hectares of land were irrigated in the project command area. \"Farmers were able to harvest 25-29 maunds of rice per bigha(0.2529 hectare).They also saved electricity and diesel worth Tk550 crore.\" Harvesting season is scheduled to start within  two weeks, but farmers have already harvested BR-28 rice, said farmer Bimal Chandra Roy."

      "text": "The NATP-2 initiative has helped farmers in the region to reap profits after incurring losses during the floods earlier this year The char areas adjacent to the Padma River in Rajbari's Sadar upazila are witnessing a bumper cauliflower yield, thanks to the National Agriculture Technology Project-2 (NATP-2). Not only cauliflower but also a wide array of winter vegetable is blooming in the region. They are in high demand at local markets as they are free of pesticides, and good in taste. The NATP-2 initiative has helped farmers in the region to reap profits after incurring losses during the floods earlier this year. The project's outcome can be seen in Sadar upazila's Barat, Mulghar, Basantapur, and Shahid Wahab Pur unions. Apart from cauliflower, farmers in the said unions are also cultivating cabbage, eggplant, pumpkin, beans, radish and long beans in areas spanning over 850 hectares, according to sources at the district Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) office. Farmers are also receiving fair prices for their produce, they mentioned.  Md Khalil, a farmer from Gopalbari village under Barat union of Sadar upazila, cultivated cauliflower on 1.5 bigha of the exhibition plots under the local DAE office. After extracting them, he sells each kilogram of cauliflower for Tk 55-60. He only had to spend Tk20,000, which brought him a profit of Tk1.5 lakh, he added. Like Khalil, many others echoed that winter vegetable cultivation has changed their luck by reducing poverty. Sajeda Begum, another farmer from the same village, fared with similar results in pumpkin and eggplant cultivation. She sold both of them for Tk30 per kilogram. Md Bahauddin Sheikh, agriculture officer at Sadar upazila, said traditionally most of the farmers were dependent only on farming paddy and wheat, but recently the practice has been changed; instead of farming paddy and wheat thousands of farmers are now cultivating different types of winter vegetables. Not only the traditional farmers, but marginalized people who do not have any cropland are also using unused land around their house to grow vegetables, he added."

      "text": "Once-powerful rivers have turned into cropland and playgrounds due to land encroachment River encroachment has continued in Nilphamari; structures are built, plus paddy and vegetable is cultivated, on riverbeds. Nilphamari is home to nearly 600km of rivers. These include the: Paramatta, Tista, Buri Tista, Charalkata, Burikhora, Dhum, Bamandanga, Panga, Kumlai, Nautara, Jamuneshwari, Ichhamati, Kalamdar, Kharkharia, Bullai, Deonai, Shalki, Kherkati, Chara Nodi, Kherua, Chikli, and Auliakhana. Most of these rivers are on the brink of extinction due to their decreasing water levels. They have been filled in and often turned into cropland. Structures have been built upon some of them. Powerful land grabbers drying up river beds The once fast-flowing Jamuneshwari River is now farmed for different kinds of crops. The main course of the river, upstream from the Haratkitala Bridge, is surrounded by a tin fence. Locals said a company has recently bought all the river land. Former Union Parishad (UP) Chairman of Palashbari union, 95-year-old Shyamcharan Roy, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"I have seen how fast the Jamuneshwari River flowed. In my childhood, fishermen used to earn their livelihoods by catching small and big fish from the Jamuneshwari. \"Traders from far away used to come for commerce,\" he said. \"My forefathers would tell me about steamers on this river. And now, encroachment has left it almost dead.\" Rahidul Islam, 82, from Kamarpara village under the same union, said: \"No one can deduce from the river's current flow that it was once fast flowing. People are grabbing land however they can.\" Meanwhile, Palashbari UP Chairman Momtaz Uddin Pramanik, 85, said: \"This one company has bought a lot of river land at a very low price. Some parts of the river have been silted up. If the river were excavated, it would help the locals with their farming.\" Jamuneshwari River's source lies in Bilanchal in Mekhliganj village in Kuchbihar of India, and enters through the border in Gomnati union under Domar upazila in Nilphamari. Another branch from Bilanchal has joined the Jamuneshwari, passing through Ketkibari union. The river is 50 metres wide and 116km long. The Bamandanga River flows right beside Nilphamari town. Shakhamachha Port, built around this river, was once the most important spots for trade and commerce in Nilphamari. Cargo boats, from all across the country, used to come to participate in trade. Now, after gradual filling, the river has fallen victim to land encroachment, and has turned into a playground for locals. Encroachers regularly build structures on river land.  Abdus Sattar, 75, from Sarkarpara village in Nilphamari town, said several establishments--such as rice mills, cleats for drying paddies, small factories, and houses--have been built by encroaching on the Bamandanga; all the way from Gachhbari to Anandabubu's pool.  \"These mills are further filling up the river by throwing in ash as waste material,\" Sattar said. \"Despite the issue getting everyone's attention, nobody is brave enough to speak up against the influential land encroachers.\" Nearly 42km long, 38m wide, and 2.3m deep, the Burikhora River flowing through Ramnagar union has now turned into cropland. Boro paddy and corn is cultivated on the cropland near Shyannashi Ghat in Bahalipara village of Ramnagar. \"The river has lost its retention capacity after being filled up,\" Bidyacharan Roy, 69, from Bahalipara said. \"As a result, in dry seasons, the river hardly gets any water, but during the monsoon it floods easily.\" Kalamdar River in Domar upazila has a similar situation. The river was used for washing and cooking by guests who would come to visit the Peer's fair hosted on the banks of Kalamdar. However, just like the other rivers in Nilphamari, it has been filled up for cultivation. Water Development Board Executive engineer Abdullah Al Mamun told the Dhaka Tribune: \"There are 18 small and large rivers in Nilphamari. We will start an operation soon, to keep these rivers from being encroached on. We have sent a list of the rivers to the National River Protection Commission.\" \"There is no river in the country that has not been grabbed,\" River protection and research institute foundation Riverine People Bangladesh's Director Dr Tuhin Wadud said. \"We need to bring changes to laws on river encroachment. The River Protection Commission needs to be strengthened by coordinating it with other ministries.\" Meanwhile, Nilphamari Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) (revenue) Shahinur Alam said: \"We have instructed all Upazila Nirbahi Officers (UNOs) and assistant commissioners (land) to identify the rivers threatened by encroachment.  \"Other than that, the district commission and Water Development Board have taken a joint initiative to excavate and protect the rivers,\" he added. \"Some of these rivers are being re-excavated, while others have been tendered.\"   "

      "text": "'We are trying to ensure 14 feet of depth by maintenance dredging' Dredging around the Barisal river port area improved the navigation for river transportation in the region. Transportation on major routes in Barisal were on the verge of shutting down because of the inconvenient commute due to formation of new sandbanks (Dubo Char) and shallow water levels in rivers ahead of the upcoming dry winter season, said Abdus Sobhan, a water transport worker. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) started maintenance dredging at about thirty points selected across rivers starting from November 4 to mitigate the navigability crisis. However, the water transport crews stressed the importance of capital dredging alongside maintenance dredging to remedy the poor water flow from upstream which causes severe navigability crisis in the regional river routes. \"We are trying to ensure 14 feet of depth by maintenance dredging. We will avoid further dredging, as it may result in rapid erosion and other problems regarding navigability,\" said Mizanur Rahman Bhuiyan, the superintending engineer of dredging department of BIWTA.  This year's flash floods in the northern parts carried significant amounts of silt and sediments downstream and deposited them in the southern parts of the country, he added. Regarding the dredging process, Mizanur said seven dredging machines have been mobilized at different points around Barisal while three more would be added to the fleet soon. About 30 lakh cubic metres of sediments would be dredged from Barisal regional rivers including one lakh cubic metres from Barisal river port area, he added. BIWTA is planning to undertake excavation projects to make the river flow straight as river bends facilitate sedimentation, said Ajmal Huda Mithu, deputy director of marine safety and river traffic officer of Barisal River Port. Ajmal instructed people to contact the BIWTA, who wish to use the dredged sediments for free to fill their lowlands."

BWDB Superintending Engineer Akhil Kumar Biswas said at least 241 such structures were demolished in the first two days of the ongoing crackdown against encroachers. Confirming the numbers, BWDB's Executive Engineer (Dhaka Operations and Maintenance Division-II) Dewan Ainul on Monday told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Three of the structures were owned by Haji Salim. One of them was even a four-storied one.\" He said they started the drive from Old Dhaka's Lalbagh to reclaim the encroached land along the 10km-long river protection embankment leading towards Gabtoli. \"We have recovered a stretch of 1,953 metres on the embankment till now,\" he said, and added that the drive will resume at 9am on Tuesday. However, when contacted, Dhaka 7 lawmaker Haji Mohammad Salim could not confirm the BWDB official's remarks. His Assistant Personal Secretary Sohel claimed that they did not receive any prior notice from the authorities regarding the drive. \"We still have valid documents for the buildings,\" he said, but declined to comment further on the matter.   Earlier, Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) on February 5 had demolished several semi-concrete structures owned by Haji Salim. The BIWTA, too, on Monday dismantled 120 illegal structures, including several multi-storied ones, on the banks of Buriganga and Turag rivers, raising the number of the demolished establishments to 1,620. Till now, the BIWTA has managed to reclaim at least 16 acres of land.  Amid eviction drives on riverbanks, the government on Thursday also had transferred BIWTA Chairman Commodore Mohammad Mozammel Haque. 30 acres of Dhaleshwari land encroached in Singair Meanwhile, a report submitted to the High Court on Monday said that some 30 acres of land along the Dhaleshwari River under Dhalla mouja in Manikganj's Singair upazila were occupied by 37 individuals and organizations. Of the land, 11.30 acres have been encroached by Manikganj Power Generations Limited alone, said the report placed by the district's deputy commissioner. A list of the 37 illegal land grabbers was also submitted before the High Court bench of Justice Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Md Ashraful Kamal. Later, the court fixed February 25 for the next hearing. On October 22, Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh had filed a writ petition with the court, seeking its directives to free the Dhaleshwari River from the clutches of encroachers. The following day, the court issued a rule and asked the Manikganj deputy commissioner to submit a report within 60 days attaching CS/RS records. Following an appeal filed by the power plant, the court later ordered a survey in line with the BRS record. As per the court directives, the local administration of Manikganj district submitted the report with a list of 37 land grabbers."

      "authors": "Thomson Reuters Foundation",
      "text": "Brazilian president authorized the military to fight the fires after several days of public protests  When Maria Augusta Almeida, 45, heard her grandson cough incessantly, she knew what was to blame: the fires raging in the Amazon forest, some of them more than 200 miles (322km) away from Porto Velho. The smoke permeating the city, the capital of Brazil's northwestern state of Rondonia, is leading concerned parents to wait for hours in line at local hospitals to get help for their children who are struggling to breathe. The Thomson Reuters Foundation visited four health centres in the city, one of the hardest hit by smoke from the burning rainforest. In all, there were reports of children, some of them infants, seeking medical care due to smoke inhalation. Last month, Brazil's space research agency, INPE, revealed the number of fires in the Amazon was the highest since 2010. That sparked international calls for the country to do more to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest - key to curbing climate change - from deforestation and other threats. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro authorized the military to fight the fires after several days of public protests and criticism from world leaders. In Porto Velho, residents said the Cosme e Damiao Children's Hospital, run by the Rondonia state government, had become the epicentre for children with breathing difficulties. The symptoms from outdoor smoke inhalation have evolved into a full-blown crisis for some parents, as they do not know how to protect their children from what is in the air. The daughter of local salesman Mauro Ribeiro do Nascimento, almost two years old, has asthma and could not stop coughing. \"I have taken her to Cosme e Damiao three times already,\" her father said. \"They were doing nothing but putting her on a nebulizer.\" The device helps patients breathe in medicine as a mist through a mask or a mouthpiece, to treat respiratory problems. Worried about the strain on her lungs, do Nascimento took his daughter to a different centre for an X-ray, which showed her lungs were \"congested\" due to irritation caused by smoke. Staff at Cosme e Damiao were not authorized to say how many children they had attended since the fires escalated, and did not respond to requests for comment. But volunteers and locals said the lines grew much longer about a month ago, when smoke began choking the city streets.  \"The city was so filled with smoke you did not know if you should keep the windows open to maybe get some fresh air, or close them to stop more smoke from getting in,\" said Sara Albino, a nursing student who volunteers at the hospital. At her worst, Albino's 20-month-old daughter had to use a nebulizer five times a day, which she has at home. Eye drops had to be applied constantly to ease the burning sensation in the child's eyes, her mother said. \"Her eyes would not stop tearing up ... they were almost glued shut; it was like conjunctivitis,\" she said. Urban fires According to the World Health Organization, fires in the Amazon pose a risk to health including from respiratory diseases, especially in children. But not all fires affecting Porto Velho are far away in the jungle, as they have become a cheap way to clear vegetation from urban areas for construction purposes, according to residents. Last week, the city's airport had to shut down after smoke from an urban fire got out of control. The vegetation on the roadsides leading to the airport was burned to a crisp. The fires in Brazil's sprawling Amazon rainforest have receded slightly since Bolsonaro sent in the military to help battle the blazes last week. Meanwhile, families do what they can at home. \"I bought a humidifier ... we keep it in my granddaughter's room,\" said Raimundo dos Santos, 71, who was selling water to people waiting in line at a Porto Velho health centre. The machine, which increases moisture in the air, has helped his eight-year-old granddaughter breathe. But the rest of the family is still struggling. \"I myself have already been to the hospital since the fires started,\" dos Santos said, adding that he was treated for smoke inhalation. "

The Indian weather service said Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Fani was expected to make landfall on Friday afternoon in Odisha state and barrel north-eastwards towards Bangladesh on a pathway that is home to more than 100 million people. In total, about 1.2 million people are expected to be evacuated from low-lying areas of 15 districts in the eastern state of Odisha to cyclone shelters, schools and other buildings, authorities said, reports Reuters. Along with \"extremely heavy\" rainfall in places, a storm surge of about 5ft is \"very likely\" to inundate some low-lying areas of Odisha, according to the Indian Meterological Department.

Some 3,000 shelters in schools and government buildings have been set up to accommodate more than a million people. More than 100,000 dry food packets are ready to be dropped if needed, reports said. On Thursday the storm, which reports said was the biggest to hit eastern India in nearly two decades, was brewing in the Bay of Bengal and moving steadily and ominously towards the shore.  It was predicted to pack sustained wind speeds of 180-190 kph and gusts up to 200 kph, equivalent in strength to a Category 3 to 4 hurricane. It was expected to make landfall near the Hindu holy town of Puri, a major tourist hotspot. More than 100 trains have been cancelled in past 48 hours, according to Indian Railways. Three special trains were running from Puri to evacuate pilgrims and tourists. Authorities have asked tourists to leave coastal areas and avoid unnecessary travel. Special buses have been deployed in Puri and other towns. Dozens of officials were making announcements on hand-held megaphones across the coastal belt asking residents to leave their homes.

Speed of the wind may reach 200 km/hr. pic.twitter.com/YGHGlfAYLW  After Odisha, Fani was predicted to head north towards the state of West Bengal and then towards Bangladesh, where authorities were already preparing on Thursday. Other coastal states south of Odisha like Andhra Pradesh, home to 50 million people, and Tamil Nadu, population some 70 million, were also on standby. Fishermen have been advised not to venture out. The Indian Navy has also been put on alert.  Kolkata airport shutdown All flights from Kolkata's Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport will be cancelled from 9.30pm on Friday till 6pm on Saturday as Cyclone Fani is expected to make landfall tomorrow morning. All flights from Odisha capital Bhubaneswar have already been cancelled from midnight as the extremely severe cyclone nears the state's coast, south of temple town Puri. The Airports Authority of India also issued an advisory to all the coastal airports to take adequate precautions. India's biggest oil and gas producer ONGC has evacuated close to 500 employees from offshore installations and moved drilling rigs to safer locations, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported. \"Heavy rains are expected in all the coastal districts amid fears of flash floods. We are all geared up for the challenge,\" said Sethi. 'Total destruction' Forecasters have warned of the \"total destruction\" of thatched houses, the bending and uprooting of power and communication poles, the \"flooding of escape routes\" and damage to crops in some areas. Bangladesh Disaster Management chief Mohammad Hashim said that 3,600 cyclone shelters had been opened in 13 coastal districts. The country's weather bureau has told deep-sea fishing vessels to stay near the coast, while inland water transport activities were suspended.  Coastal-area farmers in Bangladesh were instructed to harvest their paddy fields as a surging tide may inundate and ruin crops. Fani is the fourth major storm to slam into India's east coast in three decades, the last in 2017 when Cyclone Ockhi left nearly 250 people dead and more than 600 missing in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.  The worst cyclone on record in Odisha in 1999, killed almost 10,000 people and caused an estimated $4.5 billion worth of devastation."

The landslide occurred shortly before sunset on Monday in West Java province. Search and rescue teams said they have found 15 people dead and are scouring the area for at least 25 missing. Pouring rain, power cuts and rough roads are preventing heavy machinery from accessing the area in Sukabumi regency, disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.  \"Relief efforts have also been hampered by a lot of people who want to get to the disaster,\" he said.  \"The roads are narrow which has caused rescue teams, logistics and ambulances to be stuck in traffic jams.\"  The search operation has halted for the day but will resume Wednesday morning.  Four people have been injured in the disaster and 60 others evacuated from the area, Nugroho said. Landslides are common in Indonesia, a vast tropical archipelago prone to natural disasters and torrential downpours. More than 20 people died in October when flash floods and landslides hit several provinces on Sumatra island, western Indonesia. In June 2016, nearly 50 people died when floods and landslides struck Central Java province."

Authorities ordered mandatory evacuations for hundreds of people as crews worked through the night to contain the so-called Sandalwood Fire, which had scorched about 500 acres near Calimesa, about 70 miles east of downtown Los Angeles. It was only 10% contained as of early Friday, Riverside County Fire Department (RCFD) officials said. The blaze, named after a local landmark, erupted on Thursday afternoon when a garbage truck dumped burning trash that spread onto vegetation, the RCFD and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said in a statement.  By early Friday, a second Southern California wildfire, dubbed the Saddleridge fire, spread to more than 4,000 acres in the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles, prompting an evacuation order for more than 1,900 homes. \"Once daylight comes, a more accurate assessment can be performed,\" the LA Fire Department said in a pre-dawn Twitter message. \"A number of homes have been destroyed by fire but the estimated number is not available at this time.\" The 2018 wildfire season was the deadliest and most destructive ever recorded in California, with about 100 residents and firefighters killed. More than 8,500 fires erupted, scorching more than 1.8 million acres and causing billions of dollars of damage. There were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries from the latest blazes, among about 275 wildfires that have broken out across California as hot, gusty winds signaled the start of its peak fire season, state officials said."

      "text": "The Farakka barrage was constructed in the early 60s with the main purpose of helping flush out sediment deposition from Kolkata Port Sanjay Kumar Jha, eastern India's state of Bihar's water resources minister on Tuesday said that Farakka barrage, which has been built by compromising the state's interest, should be dismantled. According to Times of India, the minister said the state government has been writing to the federal government for the resolution of the problems caused by the dam and will do so again encompassing all issues. The Farakka barrage was constructed in the early 60s with the main purpose of helping flush out sediment deposition from Kolkata Port, besides addressing drinking water requirement in West Bengal. The dam became operational in 1975. \"It (Farakka barrage) must be dismantled in the interest of Bihar...People of Bihar have been suffering every year due to it. It has become 'sorrow' for all of us,\" Jha told reporters. \"What options do we have. Either it (barrage) should be dismantled otherwise people of Bihar will continue to suffer or it should be repaired completely by retrofitting it and carry out dredging in its upstream,\" he added.  The minister pointed out due to siltation in the upstream of the dam, the peak level water discharge from Ganga, which reaches Farakka within 48 to 50 hours in normal course from Patna, has not reached there even after seven days. Stating that Ganga's highest flow level at Allahabad and Patna was recorded at 85.09 meter and 49.79 meter respectively on September 22 this monsoon, Jha said the water reached Patna from Allahabad covering a distance of 515km in just two days, while it has already taken seven days to cover 415km of distance between Patna and the Farakka and the peak level water has not reached there yet. Making a strong plea to the central government to resolve the issue, he said if the things are not resolved, the problem would become \"grave\" especially for cities/towns situated along river Ganga in years to come. Asked as how many gates of Farakka barrage have been opened for water discharge, Jha said out of 109 gates, 76 have been opened fully while remaining 33 gates have been kept opened upto 75% which is sufficient for water discharge. \"I don't have any knowledge as when did these 10 extra gates were built over Farraka barrage,\" Jha said when journalists pointed out that Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that 119 gates of Farakka barrage were raised to prevent floods in Patna and other districts."

      "text": "Extending over eight countries from Afghanistan to Myanmar covering 3,500 kilometres, the Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) is one of the greatest mountain systems in the world. It has more than 60,000 square kilometers of glaciers and 760,000 square kilometers of snow cover, which is a massive store of freshwater. It supports 240 million people living in this region and is also the source of 10 major Asian rivers including Ganges and Indus, providing essential resources to nearly two billion people  In recent years, the HKH - spanning over Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan - has been going through rapid changes due to climate change and a plethora of disruptions including natural disasters, infrastructure development, migration and land use change.  To evaluate the impacts of these forces on the HKH and address the environmental, economic and social pillars of sustainable mountain development, more than 350 researchers, practitioners, experts and policy makers from the region came together to develop the first comprehensive assessment of the HKH, which was developed over the last five years. The assessment report consists of 16 chapters, which assess the status quo of knowledge of the region, shed light on the various drivers of change in the region, address data gaps and provide actionable recommendations.  The report presents nine mountain priorities, aligned with the UN SDGs, including ending poverty in the mountains, universal access to clean energy in the mountains and halting biodiversity loss.  This report - the first in a series - has been produced as a part of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Monitoring and Assessment Programme (HIMAP), which is coordinated by International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD).  \"The HKH is relevant to Bangladesh from water management and river management angles, as we are dependent on upstream countries. We cannot manage our water and disasters alone and trans-boundary cooperation is extremely important for Bangladesh for river water issues,\" said Golam Rasul, chief economist at ICIMOD.  \"Our dependency on upstream countries is very huge since rainfall water is not enough. So, for any planning of water resources In Bangladesh, we need to know what they are doing upstream. If they don't conserve water, we will have negative impacts in Bangladesh,\" he said.  Another important aspect for Bangladesh is disaster management. Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and China account for more than 50 percent of the world's groundwater withdrawals, and these take place mostly in the plains of river basins that originate in the HKH. The Ganga Brahmaputra Meghna basin is Bangladesh and the country drains huge amounts of water from July to September, making it prone to flooding. So, it needs collaboration regarding early warning, forecasting, planning for disaster mix management, etc.  \"The Bangladesh government should take it as a priority to work together with the HKH countries to manage disasters and develop water resources jointly,\" Rasul added. Prior to the report's launch, ICIMOD held an HKH Science Policy Forum in November 2018 with relevant think tanks, subject matter experts and decision makers. The consultative workshop explored ways to strengthen regional cooperation, including common priority actions. \"As a donor, we recognize that there will be less and less bilateral arrangements and more multilateral, so we need to invest in institutions that will take the work ahead in the long term,\" said Mandakini Suri of Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), a panelist at the HKH Science Policy Forum. \"My government believes we need cross border collaboration to solve environmental and climate change issues. We have arctic council in Europe to reduce pollution. It's an integrated part of our mission and helps secure peace and prosperity in the north,\" said Solveig Anresen, environment advisor of the Norwegian ministry of environment, and another panelist at the workshop.  \"Although the arctic countries are different, they have common goals on fighting climate change and environmental issues, and this is similar to the HKH countries. You need to engage indigenous people and women. We believe regional cooperation for development is the key to success,\" she added. The participants of this International Consultation Workshop also shared experiences and lessons learned in the context of river basin management, cross-border landscape approach, and regional cooperation.  The report finds that the effects of climate change on the HKH are particularly acute, with the number of extreme warm events, intense precipitation having increased and extreme cold events decreasing overall in the last five decades. Snow-covered areas and snow volumes are also projected to decrease in the HKH due to increased temperatures. Mountain settlements on the HKH are also highly vulnerable to natural disasters as they are located on unstable lopes that are prone to landslide, erosion, or floods, and if these trends continue, the frequency and magnitude of water-induced hazards will increase.  Moreover, even if global warming is limited to 1.5 C, warming will likely be much higher in the HKH, being at least 0.7 C higher in the northwest Himalaya and Karakoram.  However, consensus among climate models for the HKH region is weak - a result of the region's complex physical features and the coarse resolution of global climate models.  The report recommends stronger regional cooperation for greater sharing of scientific and indigenous knowledge, more reliable projections of temperature increase via better monitoring.  It also suggests that in addition to global emissions reductions to reduce temperature rise, enhancing adaptation to climate change requires transformative adaptation policies, including mainstreaming of adaptation into planning and budgeting processes.  \"20 billion USD investment is needed in the HKH for climate action. So, we need to educate businesses and build a business case for adaptation,\" said Debra Tan, head of China Water Risk - a Hong Kong based nonprofit dedicated to addressing business and environmental risks arising from water crisis.   \"Businesses just want to know how they are exposed so they can protect their assets. We need to map their assets to identify their risk exposure.\" she added. Another factor contributing to exacerbating climate change in the HKH is air pollution. Through the deposition of black carbon and dust, air pollution is speeding up the melting of ice. Mitigating air pollution requires investment in clean technologies and infrastructure according to the report.  Meeting the future energy needs of the HKH is a key focus of the report. While some HKH countries have scaled up off-grid initiatives, it is difficult to replicate those innovate business models for energy solutions in mountain communities.  In this context, the report states that Improving energy efficiency - particularly that of biomass which is widely used in the region - is the most cost-competitive strategy to meet the energy needs of the HKH.  Another option is to explore the full potential of hydropower and other renewables to combat its energy poverty and attain energy security, while also ensuring climate resilient development.  Agriculture is one of the main livelihood options in the HKH, but traditional agricultural systems in the region are under pressure with loss of agrobiodiversity and is failing to meet the food and income needs, which is affecting food security in the region. Mountain people are especially vulnerable to food and nutritional insecurity. When the high mountain areas experience heavy snow fall, people often decrease food consumption. Moreover, during bad weather conditions, road networks are often disrupted which makes food transport difficult. The high cost of transportation translates to high food prices, which often make them unaffordable, thus affecting people's nutrition. However, the challenges mountain communities face are often not properly understood or reflected in national agricultural policies. There is a lot that needs to be done to enhance food security of the HKH people, and many ideas were shared by participants of the HKH science policy forum in this regard. Agricultural production needs to be diversified, which will address the issue of farm income and increase food security. Moreover, a way of working needs to be created that transforms river basin approaches - using a multi import area development approach that looks at not only tourism but agro-tourism for instance. Market access also needs to be provided along with building human capability to understand the markets and new production techniques, and necessary land use policy changes made, which creates an enabling environment for ensuring food security.  The people living in the HKH are some of the poorest of the region, and comprise mostly of ethnic minorities, minority populations, and tribal groups. The report finds that in the Hindu Kush Himalaya, poverty incidence is one-third compared to one-fourth for the national average. The factors that predict poverty and its persistence in the HKH broadly are related to remoteness and limited access to markets and basic facilities, high dependence on natural resources, demographic, social and cultural factors and political and socioeconomic marginalization of the population. \"Poverty in the HKH is a very complex issue and the IUCN is quite concerned. One of the lessons learned is the earlier [action is taken] the better and having good metrics for measurement [of impact]. We need to focus on how we can help communities improve their livelihoods,\" said Boris Erg of IUCN.  \"We will try to look into how by making bankable and workable investment projects we can help link communities and make sectors work together,\" he added.  Because there is significant overlap of the determinants of vulnerability and of poverty in the HKH, the report suggests various measures, including allocation of resources for mountain poverty reduction programmes, with targeted approaches for indigenous and marginalized communities, social protection for climate threats, addressing multidimensional poverty and sharing of data among HKH countries.  The report presents two possible pathways that can lead the HKH to a prosperous scenario by 2080.  The first such pathway involves large-scale sustainable development investments with regional cooperation, with a focus on developing HKH's natural resources, infrastructure and human resources. This requires national and international funding through collaboration among state, corporate, and non-state actors. The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) and Indus Water Treaty are some examples relevant to this model.  The second pathway to prosperity combines investments with cooperation across multiple levels. This involves developing water and energy through smaller-scale and decentralized programs that promote self-reliance, and coordination among many non-state development and social actors. Farmer-managed irrigation systems in Nepal and local spring water management projects in India are examples of this approach. Effective environmental governance - the way formal and informal institutions act to manage the environment - is the key to address these multifaceted challenges in the Hindu Kush Himalaya, according to the report.  This involves equitable sharing of the environmental resources - forests, water, biodiversity, agriculture - as well as the costs, and risks.  While there are few existing regional policies and processes for environmental governance in the region; most are national and subnational. Environmental governance reforms require decentralization supported through subnational and national governance systems to scale up successful initiatives and empower community action, as well as transboundary cooperation.  \"Whether it is realistic in South Asia to think of a river basin wide agreement or treaty or will that always be elusive, is a key question, and we cannot put all our eggs in the same basket thinking there will be a big breakthrough with a broad region wide agreement in the future\" said Shantanu Mitra of DFID, who was a panelist at the HKH Science Policy Forum.  In spite of the political and cultural differences of the eight HKH countries, the common challenges unite them all and puts the impetus on them to cooperate to address the risks. \"There are rocky times ahead for the region: between now and 2080, the environmental, economic and social conditions laid out in the report could go downhill. Because many of the disasters and sudden changes will play out across country borders, conflicts among the region's countries could easily flare up,\" said Eklabya Sharma, deputy DG of ICIMOD. \"But the future doesn't have to be bleak if governments work together to turn the tide against melting glaciers and the myriad impacts they unleash.\""

      "text": "From the brink of destruction to one of the world's fastest growing economies As the Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul came down to land at Kigali International Airport in the very early hours of July 3, sitting next to me, Egyptian Abdel Ismail on a business trip to Uganda, said: \"There is a gulf of difference between the Rwanda of 1994, and now.\" Referring to the notorious genocide for which Rwanda was known to the world, he said: \"This country has been able to miraculously leave it's tragic past behind, to become one of the greatest examples of reconciliation, not only in Africa, but also for the rest of the world.\" \"Enjoy yourself in this beautiful country,\" he added as we parted. In the next three days, I realized just how right my Egyptian friend was. This was my first visit to Rwanda in Central Africa. I was in Rwanda to take part in the first ever Kigali Global Dialogue at a leading hotel just opposite the Embassy of China, which has already made significant inroads in the continent of Africa. China has been described by many as the future influential player in the world. The government of Rwanda, in association with the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), a leading Indian think tank, organized the event to highlight the potential of Africa, especially Rwanda. Of course, many attending the dialogue were of the opinion that the involvement of the ORF was nothing but a counter to Chinese influence in Rwanda and the rest of Africa, a notion vehemently brushed aside by the President of the think tank. Anyway, let's forget about the geopolitics for now and focus on the tremendous transformation of Rwanda.  The Rwandan surprise for me began with the journey from the airport to the hotel in the diplomatic enclave. Kigali is a hilly green city, extraordinarily cleanl and disciplined. I never expected so many good things of this African nation. As a journalist, I did know how Rwanda suffered in the worst genocide since the Second World War. I was also aware how Rwanda clawed back from the devastation of genocide, through reconciliation. However, the extent of Rwandan development was beyond my imagination. In 1994, the Hutu-led government and it's militia massacred more than a million Tutsis and a third of the Twa people. About 70 per cent of the Tutsi population was wiped out. On July 4, 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Force, led by current President Paul Kagame, a retired General, defeated the Hutu government forces and militia and liberated the country. Since then, July 4 is celebrated as the Liberation Day of Rwanda. Following the liberation of Rwanda, which is one-fifth the size of Bangladesh with 11 million people, there were international and domestic trials to hold the perpetrators of the genocide accountable and many were punished. After a while, the Rwandan leadership realized there was no choice other than reconciliation for the nation to move forward. And the leadership, led by Kagame, who himself is a Tutsi, began the process of reconciliation by abolishing identification by ethnicity, that was introduced by colonial Belgium. Now, every person is identified as a Rwandan rather than a Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa. That was the beginning. Since then, Rwanda has come a long way, overcoming all odds . From the brink of destruction, the East African nation has become one of the fastest growing economies in the world and an example for the globe in many aspects, especially women's empowerment. It might sound astonishing to many that more than half the cabinet members are women. So is it in the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Parliament. There is also significant representation of women in the Senate, the upper house of Parliament. It's worth mentioning another aspect of their turnaround concerning the provisioning of   healthcare. In Rwanda, emergency medicines can be reached to any remote place in the country using drones, something not yet done in developed countries. Whoever comes to visit Rwanda will undoubtedly realize the power of a nation that is united."

      "authors": "Nawaz Farhin Antara",
      "text": "This according to a 2018 Rajuk survey of 204,106 buildings in Dhaka  About 66% of the houses in the megacity of Dhaka have been illegally built--in plain view of Rajdhani Unnyan Katripakkha (Rajuk)--in contravention of mandatory building codes. Urban planners and architects think the unplanned urbanization and negligence by monitoring authorities has led to a situation where Dhaka dwellers are living among \"live atom bombs.\" A survey of 204,106 buildings over 1,528 square kilometres was conducted, under Rajuk's purview, in Dhaka from January-July 2018; a total of 134,925 buildings, or 66.1% of them, were found to be faulty. \"Of the 195,376 buildings already constructed, problems were found with 131,583 of the buildings. Of the 8,730 buildings under construction--that were surveyed--designs for 3,342 buildings were found to be faulty,\" Housing and Public Works Minister SM Rejaul Karim disclosed in parliament in early February this year. Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, urban planners claimed buildings which were built without following all security and safety measures are just like atom bombs that can explode at any time. They fear that thousands of city dwellers will be killed and Dhaka city will not be able to survive if a major disaster like an earthquake or fire hits the city. Rajuk member (Development Control) Abul Kalam Azad said the actual percentage of buildings that do not adhere to construction codes is much higher than the findings of the survey. \"Though the survey claims that only 66.1% of buildings violate the building codes, Rajuk found that around 95% of the buildings were constructed without adhering to Rajuk's building codes.\" He claimed that the discrepancy is down to his accounting for minor violations of the building codes.  The Rajuk official alleged that builders change approved designs while constructing the buildings after bribing the officials concerned. The Rajuk member also claimed that sometimes builders, or house owners, change the designs according to their own interests, compromising on security and safety measures. Why is unapproved infrastructure still being built? Industry insiders and urban planners state that Rajuk is conducting operations to evict the tenants of illegal constructions and demolish unauthorized installations; however, no legal action is being taken against the owners or builders of the buildings. As a result, the reconstruction of unapproved infrastructure cannot be stopped, they said. Construction sector experts say design plays an important role in protecting infrastructure from earthquake damage. A good design can considerably reduce the possibility of loss. Urban expert and architect Iqbal Habib said that Rajuk is responsible for these faulty buildings. He said: \"Considering the safety of Dhaka's city dwellers, Rajuk should identify these buildings as well as make the building lists public.\" Some who construct buildings four-to-five feet wider than their design, are not following the design approved by Rajuk. The foundations are weak, so this is dangerous in any natural disaster; starting with earthquakes.  Renowned civil engineer and former adviser to the caretaker government Professor Jamilur Reza Choudhury said there are fire risks in the entire city, and the massive population and unplanned urbanization adds to the mushrooming of illegal installations. \"The buildings are fitted together, so fire spreads quickly from one house to another.\" \"Although Rajuk takes various measures to combat the irregularities by housing companies, when it breaks down extra parts of these buildings the companies rebuild these sections some days later. So we have not been able to stop this yet,\" said Rajuk member Abul Kalam Azad. Most of Dhaka's land was reclaimed from water bodies and people established their buildings by filling the land, without hiring a civil engineer, he claimed. \"When we sent a letter to a listed responsible engineer, the engineer denied responsibility and said he was responsible only for a specific part of the building construction,\" he added. Mehedi Ahmed Ansary, professor at Buet's Department of Civil Engineering, said the risk is not rising because of a lack of design, but because of equipment and materials used. \"While constructing the buildings, the owners compromise with quality by using substandard materials. They are not setting up buildings properly as they are reducing costs in the foundations. Additionally, floods can occur because of poor construction, earthquake, or fire related problems,\" he added. The professor urged Rajuk to increase its manpower to conduct regular surveys and surveillance to improve the situation. Can third-party solutions help? Civil engineering experts think Rajuk could appoint third-parties to monitor the construction process to force builders to comply with building codes. Buet professor Mehedi Ahmed Ansary said that that developed world usually appoints third-parties to inspect building safety and they also monitor the construction processes. He claimed that they submitted a third-party proposal to Rajuk in 2016 but Rajuk has yet to accept the proposal. However Rajuk member Abul Kalam Azad said his office has signed an agreement with Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) which will be responsible for monitoring all construction processes. Azad also hoped that they can sign another agreement with the Asian Development Bank soon over the issue. Warning tough action against illegal construction, the Housing and Public Works Minister SM Rejaul Karim said risky and uninhabitable buildings are being identified. \"Once the process is complete, we will move ahead [with demolition],\" he added. The minister furthered that the owners of unauthorized buildings will be asked to tear them down first, and the government will take legal measures and dismantle structures if the owners do not comply."

      "text": "There is no planet B This year, farmers are in the spotlight because they did not get enough money for their production. The news created widespread anger and frustration among the masses. The government came forward to solve the problem, but they seem helpless. On the other hand, students have come forward to help the farmers in their lands, which was commendable. It shows the eagerness of the young people to reach out to the community to solve their problems. In many countries in the West, students do odd jobs to gain experience and earn money. I saw them working when I visited Canada last summer. There was no snow and the big fields were covered with strawberries, raspberries, green peas, etc. The farms were owned by the farmers and their families. As a visitor, we could pluck the berries and peas, and gather them in a basket. They charged us for them but it was very nominal. It was a great experience indeed to learn about farming. We can also do this in our country. The lesson that we should learn from the farmers in our country is very significant. They seldom protest for their grievances or rights being ignored. They are the silent heroes who work day long but are not rewarded. We should prioritize farming as much as we can. It can, in the long term, create job opportunities as well and also give us a rich dividend. Developing our farming industry is very important for the environment too. The extremely hot weather in Bangladesh, and also in the large areas of the sub-continent, tells us how global warming is already affecting our lives. People from all walks of life are waiting for the monsoon rain to come so that they can breathe a sigh of relief. But there is no respite. Aren't we responsible for this condition? As a species, we are moving forward. We are gaining more and more control over many elements of nature, but we are constantly facing the fury of nature at different places of this planet. For instance, droughts, extreme cold or heat, cyclones, floods, etc have taken away peace of mind. The way we are destroying mother nature, it is obvious we have to withstand its wrath in different forms at different places.  However, many small changes in our lifestyle and daily routine can pave the way to a greener life. First, we can reduce the use of plastics significantly. The ideas mentioned here may sound straight from old school giving the tendency of people buying plastic furniture to cookware. For instance, using boxes of stainless steel to carry food, having foods not with plastic cutlery can be a great start. For the beverage industry, avoiding straws is highly recommended. Additionally, a coffee culture is also beaming up in the city. With it, the use of plastic cups and mugs is increasing day by day, which is another threat to the environment. These plastic wastes are polluting the environment alarmingly. We should come to sense. We should go back to our old habit of using glassware or any other type of bio-degradable things. It is high time we shunned plastic goods in our day-to-day life. To add here, we can reintroduce the use of jute products in our homes. For example, jute bags can easily replace plastic bags which we use randomly. Moreover, jute represents our own cultural heritage. It is very eco-friendly too. Because of negligence, we are losing valuable forests. The Sundarbans has been under threat. But this has failed to draw the attention of most people. However, in the recent time, many organizations are campaigning for tree plantation drives. But it is not enough. They can also work with waste. Moreover, \"Clean Bangladesh\" drives should be carried out from time to time. The workers who will work under such projects should be paid too. These projects need to be well monitored. The UN will hold a climate change summit in September in New York, where ways and means will be discussed how best we can face challenges as a result of environmental pollution. This time various organization who work on the environment have emphasized on the slogan \"plans, not speeches.\" So we look forward to this summit where the leaders will come together with the initiatives that will be effective to save the world from further loss.

      "text": "Whole villages have been flattened and families were left mourning the death of relatives killed by trees and the debris A freak storm tore down houses and overturned cars and trucks as it swept across southern Nepal killing at least 27 people and leaving more than 600 injured, officials said Monday as a major rescue operation gathered pace. High winds battered the rural district of Bara and adjoining areas late Sunday. Five children were among the dead, the home ministry said, as rescuers battled to get relief supplies to the region and evacuate injured. The winds were so fierce that they overturned a bus carrying passengers, witnesses said. Houses, trees and electricity pylons were all toppled in the storm. Whole villages have been flattened and families were left mourning the death of relatives killed by trees and the debris, an AFP photographer in the stricken region said. Overturned cars blocked some roads. Injured victims flocked to local hospitals who were unable to cope, with some people were airlifted to Kathmandu for treatment. \"People who went back into their houses for shelter were crushed,\" said Jay Prakash Das, a Bara resident. \"We rushed out to help. A man had died right next to our building under a tree. People had fractured bones and many had head injuries,\" Das added. Hot and cold \"I've never seen anything like this. The winds took away everything, my home and my family,\" Ram Babu Patel, 45, whose wife was killed in the storm, told AFP.  \"I was at home getting ready for dinner when the storm hit - it was unbelievable. We have nothing left.\"  Prakash Tharu, a volunteer in Bara district, said the devastation caused by the storm had left \"a desperate need for food and relief.\" Rescuers struggled to reach many settlements blocked by fallen trees and electricity poles.  \"Security bodies including the army have been working intensely since Sunday night on rescues and relief,\" said Rajesh Poudel, Bara's district chief. Every year hundreds die in landslides and floods during Nepal's monsoon season, but storms causing such high casualties in spring are rare. The disaster comes as Nepal nears the fourth anniversary of a devastating earthquake that killed nearly 9,000 people and left millions homeless.  Nepal's difficult terrain and limited infrastructure often leaves emergency workers struggling to reach far-flung areas. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli expressed his condolences and said that the government would do its best for treatment of the injured.  The provincial government has announced free treatment and a financial assistance of $2,710 for families of the dead."

      "text": "All acted accordingly and a substantial volume of paddy has already been harvested in the districts A hectic effort is now underway to save the Boro crop in the peak rice harvesting season amidst weather forecast of an early flash flood in some parts of Bangladesh's haor areas. With only a fifth of the Boro paddy harvested till April 20, weathermen informed the government yesterday that the Indian states of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura are expected to experience heavy downpours over the next 48 hours, thereby causing floods in some northeastern regions of Bangladesh. Sources at the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) told Dhaka Tribune yesterday that upon receipt of the flash flood forecast, officials have been instructed to further assist haor farmers in quickly reaping the standing Boro crop in the fields. They said, during the prolonged nationwide shutdown, the administration has helped farm labourers from many northern districts with transport to move to seven Haor districts for harvesting rice. Buildings of several thousand educational institutions have also been kept open to temporarily accommodate the farm labourers.   Quoting the latest forecasts from met offices of both Bangladesh and India, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) yesterday warned of possible flash floods in northeastern Bangladesh due to heavy downpours in some parts of the Indian states of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura over the next two days.   Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, a BWDB executive engineer, who regularly keeps track of flash floods and rains, told this correspondent yesterday: \"We've forewarned the concerned government departments about the possibilities of heavy rainfall-induced flash floods sometime in late April.\" \"It appears it's imminent now. All acted accordingly and a substantial volume of paddy has already been harvested in the districts, which may experience some inundation owing to heavy rainfall in Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura,\" explained Bhuiyan.    Meanwhile, the river ports have been asked to hoist cautionary signal number one on Wednesday as rain or thunderstorms are likely in some regions of the country. The regions are Rajshahi, Rangpur, Pabna, Bogura, Tangail, Dhaka, Mymensingh, Faridpur, Khulna, Barishal, Patuakhali, Noakhali, Cumilla, Chattogram, and Sylhet.      Rice farmers in seven haor districts - Kishoreganj, Netrakona, Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Sylhet and Brahmanbaria - are worried about completing the Boro harvesting before the floods.    Government on its part, has meanwhile provided haor farmers with 23 additional reapers and 128 more combined harvesters under its farm machinery subsidy scheme. And these freshly deployed harvesting machines joined an existing fleet of 383 reapers and 156 combined harvesters to help haor  farmers reap the Boro crop quickly.     The Agriculture Ministry confirmed Dhaka Tribune that the machines, apart from some 261,000 farm labourers, have joined forces to harvest Boro in the seven haor districts, which account for a fifth of the 20 million tons of Boro expected to be harvested across the country this year. Of the three rice seasons - Aus, Aman and Boro - the irrigated rice Boro contributes over 55 percent of Bangladesh's yearly output of the staple.       DAE sources told Dhaka Tribune that starting the second week of April, haor farmers have already managed to harvest rice from one lakh hectares of land till April 20. Boro acreage in seven haor districts has been nearly 4.5 lakh hectares this year. "

What is more worrying is that, according to leading global storm tracker AccuWeather, it is the first super cyclone in the Bay of Bengal since 1999, with fears that this storm will have a devastating impact across Bangladeshi coastal regions.  As we have not witnessed a cyclone of this magnitude for decades, and given Bangladesh's already precarious position in dealing with the coronavirus, it is absolutely essential that we treat this super cyclone with all the seriousness it warrants.  To that end, it is good to see Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina herself actively involved in monitoring the development of the cyclone.   This sends the right message to the rest of the authorities concerned, and indeed the entirety of the country, that this is an extremely serious situation, and everyone should be doing their best to brace for and mitigate the potential damage likely to be caused.  There is no way to truly be prepared for a cyclone, much less one of the magnitude Amphan is being touted to be. However, we must do our best, by closely monitoring the storm and evacuating people and transporting them to safety to the best of our abilities.  Already, hundreds of thousands of people from different coastal districts have been evacuated and taken into cyclone shelters -- this is the kind of response that will help us save lives and protect people from the cyclone.  Bangladesh has long been held as a leader in disaster management, and natural disasters, be they floods or cyclones, are something we unfortunately face every year. With careful monitoring and pro-active decision-making, we will be able to withstand the effects of Amphan as well."

      "text": "Labour crisis worries farmers in Nilphamari Local leaders, teachers, traders, students, and boy scouts have joined hands in harvesting Boro paddy in haor areas of Moulvibazar, racing against the impact of incessant rain, flash floods and the shortage of farm workers caused  by the coronavirus outbreak. Moulvibazar Deputy Commissioner Nazia Shirin, Superintendent of Police Faruk Ahmed, and Municipality Mayor Md Fazlur Rahman, are some of the many who lent a hand to farmers harvesting crops in Hakaluki, Kauadighi, and Baikkabil Hail haor regions. They hoped  their action would inspire others to help farmers, as Boro crops require timely harvesting. Hundreds of Chhatra League men, like many others across the country, have been helping farmers during the harvest season in the past three days, acting on the premier's directives, said Sahab Uddin Sabel, president of Juri upazila unit Chhatra League. The lack of public transport, triggered by the ongoing shutdown to rein in coronavirus, has confined labourers to their homes and left farmers in trouble.  \"In this crisis, we will harvest and deliver the farmer's crop to his doorstep when farmers contact us,\" added Sabel. Farmers expressed their gratitude to local Chhatra League men as they expressed their intention of continuing the task for more farmers.  Farmer Monoranjan Biswas said: \"We had a good Boro yield this season. I am a poor man. I was worried about harvesting my paddy in time, due to farmworker shortages and flash floods. Some Chhatra League men harvested my paddy and I will always be grateful to them.\" Moulvibazar Deputy Commissioner Nazia Shirin said: \"There is a shortage of farm labourers due to coronavirus fears this year. It's been raining here for a few days. I have visited fields in the haor region so that people are inspired to help farmers whose crops are at risk due to the rains and flash floods. Already, 65 percent of the paddy has been harvested in the district. We are ready to operate 35 combine harvesters and 113 reaper machines.\" Labour crisis worries farmers in Nilphamari Farmers expressed concern about arranging farm workers as Boro harvesting is about to begin in 20 to 25 days in Nilphamari. Boro rice was cultivated on 82,665 hectares of land in Nilphamari where a bumper harvest of 394,536 tons is expected this season, according to Department of Agricultural Extension sources. Abdul Matin, a farmer of Charkharibari village in Dimla upazila, said: \"I have cultivated Boro paddy on 5 bighas of land this season. But harvesting is adversely impacted due to the countrywide shutdown triggered by the coronavirus outbreak. Labourers often go from village to village during the harvesting season. If they cannot get out of their homes in time, farmers have much to worry about.\" District DAE Deputy Director Nikhil Chandra Biswas, said: \"labourers who left Nilphamari for harvesting in other districts will get back before the harvest begins here. We have 19 combine harvesters. Ten more will be readied. Hopefully there won't be any crisis for farm workers here.\""

      "text": "The grant will support procurement of health safety materials Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $300,000 emergency grant to support Bangladesh's fight against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The grant was approved on Friday. The grant will support procurement of health safety materials including personal protective gears, N95 masks, safety goggles, aprons, thermometers, and biohazard bags.  The list has been prioritized by the Directorate General of Health Services(DGHS), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of Bangladesh. The materials will help the government to strengthen its efforts to contain the spread of the virus in the country.  The grant assistance is sourced from the ADB Regional Technical Assistance titled \"Regional Support to Address the Outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 and Potential Outbreaks of Other Communicable Diseases\". ADB Country Director Manmohan Parkash said ADB is fully committed to supporting Bangladesh in the fight to control Covid-19, and this is only the first of the planned support that ADB is preparing to provide the Bangladesh government to deal with this difficult situation. \"This assistance will invigorate Bangladesh's ability to strengthen prevention, improve health professionals' protection from the disease, test people to detect infection, manage severe cases, and reduce the risk of the deadly virus' mass transmission,\" said Parkash.   \"We are working tirelessly to put together further assistance in the health and financial sectors,\" Parkash added.  In the face of a threat of a coronavirus outbreak, the Bangladesh government has taken various actions and adopted measures in line with the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendations. On March 18, ADB announced a $6.5 billion initial package to address the immediate needs of its developing member countries as they respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.  ADB's previous responses to Covid-19 include $200 million made available through ADB's Supply Chain Finance Program for companies manufacturing and distributing medicines and other items needed to combat the pandemic.  ADB's response to date also includes $2 million announced on February 7, to enhance detection, prevention, and response in the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Greater Mekong Subregion; another $2 million announced on February 26, to support response in all its developing members; and a CNY130 million ($18.6 million) private sector loan, signed on February 25, to Wuhan, PRC-based pharmaceutical distributor Jointown Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd to support the continued supply of essential medicines and personal protective equipment.  Another grant of $600,000 was provided to Sri Lanka on March 13. ADB has a strong track record of responding rapidly to provide targeted support to Bangladesh in times of emergencies, including natural disasters such as floods and cyclones, and other disasters like influx of people in Cox's Bazar camps from across the Myanmar border."

      "text": "Visiting Ilish Mokam at Port Road area of the city (largest wholesale market of Barisal), a kg of Ilish was found selling at Tk650-800 depending on the size of fish Off-season Ilish in large quantity is flooding the wholesale markets of Barisal every day, and it sells comparatively cheap.  Visiting Ilish Mokam at Port Road area of the city (largest wholesale market of Barisal), a kg of Ilish was found selling at Tk650-800 depending on the size of fish. Last year the price was almost double during the same period. Talking to this correspondent, the fishermen said that they had been netting a huge amount of Ilish since the middle of winter though it was an off-season for the species. Most of the Ilish were caught from Elisha, Meghna and Kalabadar and other southern rivers and coastal waters, Said Sentu Mia, a local fisherman.  He believed that upstream flow of the rivers are higher this year than previous years, which was why a huge quantity of big-size Ilish were available in the rivers. Fish traders said the sudden rise in supply made the Ilish price cheaper. \"Currently, every day at least 1,000 mound of Ilish enter our Mokam,\" said Ujjal Das, a Port Road based wholesaler, adding that the supply was very high.  Traders were sending these Ilish to Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and other areas of the country, he added.  \"The sizes of most of the Ilish are between 700-1200 gram. Usually such amounts of large-size Ilish is rare during winter,\" he informed. \"Increased supply in the market made the price cheaper,\" he said, adding that last week the price fell further. Now Ilish weighing 1,000-1,500 gram per piece are selling at Tk800 per kg, while those below 1000 gram sells at Tk 650-700 per kg, added Ujjal, saying that last year it was Tk1,200 and Tk800. However officials from the Department of Fisheries claimed the high yield of Ilish as their success out of anti-Jatka drives. Dr. Bimal Chandra Das, district fisheries officer (Ililsh), said that the government had taken different steps to protect breeding of Ilish that caused the increased supply. Anisur Rahman, Ilish researcher and chief scientific officer of Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI) at Chandpur centre, said that main Ilish season is from August to October.  \"There is also another short season from November to January. So it is not unusual for getting big Ilish in winter,\" he added.  Government's efforts to protect Jatka (Ilish less than 10 inches in length) and ensuring safe breeding also contributed to the increased Ilish production, he explained."

      "headline": "Will we survive the Great Lockdown?",
      "authors": "Jyoti Rahman",
      "text": "Can Bangladesh avert a humanitarian or financial crisis? Economists aren't known for their imagination, the lack of which among the practitioners of the dismal science is evidenced by the prevalence of the adjective \"great\" to describe economic events. Thus, the worldwide slump of the 1930s became the Great Depression, and the 2008-09 financial crisis led to the Great Recession. Enter into this dubious pantheon of greats the Great Lockdown -- the moniker given by the IMF to the shutdown of economic activities around the world in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The World Economic Outlook -- the IMF's flagship publication -- is released twice a year, in April and October, at meetings in Washington DC that are attended by the finance ministers, central bank governors, and other econocrats from around the world.  There was no DC gathering this April, and the first chapter of the Outlook was released last week. The Fund projects the world economy to shrink by 3% in 2020. Not only is this a sharp downgrade from January projections, but if realized, this will be a worse performance than what happened in 2009 across the world (Chart 1).  Chart 1: GDP growth   Source: IMF. If the real world was a textbook economic model, the Great Lockdown would have been followed by the Gala Reopening -- the consumers would have spent on the pent-up demand, and the firms would be busy filling the shelves. Unfortunately, the real world is not so simple. The scary thing about the Fund's forecasts is that they are based on assumptions that may well be too optimistic. The IMF assumes that the pandemic will fade in the second half of the year, allowing for a gradual lifting of containment measures around the world. These are strong assumptions.  Medical and life scientists' understanding of the virus is evolving by the hours, but as things stand, we simply don't know enough about the virus to say whether the pandemic will fade in a few months, or whether there might be a second wave of outbreak. Overlaying this is the thorny politics of lockdown and re-opening around the world. The uncertainty around the economic impact of the pandemic is illustrated by how the financial markets view 2020 growth prospects for China -- the origin of the pandemic and one with the most data points about the economic impacts of the lockdown. As of April 6, the average among the blue chip forecasting firms' projection for China was 2% growth for 2020, compared with 5.2% forecast a month earlier. Underneath this average forecast was, however, a remarkable spread, with some forecasters still expecting China to grow by 5% or more this year, while others expecting a contraction of up to 3%. The IMF's forecast for Bangladesh will be included in the complete World Economic Outlook, which is scheduled for May. The World Bank, however, has released a detailed analysis of the economic impact of the pandemic on South Asia. The Bank forecasts the Bangladesh economy to grow by 2-3% in the fiscal year 2019-20 and 2.2-2.9% in the fiscal year 2020-21. To put these numbers in context, in the five years to 2019, average annual growth rate was 7.5%, while as of October 2019, the IMF was expecting the economy to grow by 7.3-7.4% a year into 2024, and the last time the country experienced a growth rate below 3% was when HM Ershad was still president (Chart 2). Chart 2: Economic growth in Bangladesh (%)  Source: IMF, World Bank.World Bank forecasts are for fiscal years. Considering the huge uncertainty around the assumptions that underpin these forecasts -- both the IMF's global ones as well as those by the World Bank for South Asia -- it might be more useful to focus on the detailed mechanisms behind the headline numbers. And such, a detailed examination would highlight the complex policy challenges of this multi-layered crisis. As best as one can guess, with a determined effort and a bit of luck, Bangladesh may be able to avert a humanitarian or financial crisis in the near term. But the pandemic will likely leave the country much weaker in the medium term, derailing the hard earned development trajectory of the past decades. In the near term, like the rest of the world, Bangladesh is also facing what the Economist calls the grim calculus (the London magazine is better in the profession when it comes to coining phrases). But the trade-off between lives and livelihood is particularly acute in Bangladesh, which is potentially at risk of a humanitarian crisis -- what Asif Saleh of Brac calls the pandemic of hunger. Largely reflecting the collapse in global oil prices, the World Bank expects inflation to remain moderate (Chart 3). But it does acknowledge the risk of food price spikes. If countries ban food (particularly rice) exports and transport routes are disrupted, risks to food security and social disruption will heighten. Chart 3: CPI inflation (%)  Source: IMF, World Bank.World Bank forecasts are for fiscal years. Of course, an important threat to food security is from various social distance measures. However, it is not at all clear that social distancing as practised in the advanced economies is appropriate for Bangladesh. Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, a Yale economist, puts it succinctly: \"If you're a day-wage labourer in a rural area of a developing country, and you don't have much of a buffer of savings, you may be reliant on your wage earnings in a given day or a given week in order to feed your family. \"Now, in a country where there's social insurance and you can target social protection to people who are in that situation, maybe you can tide them over for this period of need. But in a country where it's not easy for us to identify people who need that social protection and provide aid to them directly, it's going to be very difficult for us to ensure that they abide by those guidelines. \"If their family is going hungry that week, they're not going to follow all of your guidelines.\" Mobarak is repurposing his existing research to explore public health measures that are more fit for purpose for our conditions. We can also learn from two other densely populated, manufacturing and remittance dependent monsoon lands that have done well to tackle the pandemic. Tightened border controls, agile health departments, tech platforms, and a hand-washing song that went viral helped in Vietnam. Aggressive testing, contact tracing, cooked meals helped in Kerala. In both cases, public awareness played a crucial role. Is Bangladesh behind the curve when it comes to flattening the curve through public awareness? Even as the world was shutting down, Dhaka saw a huge concert on March 7 and large public gatherings on March 17, to say nothing of the RMG worker return to Dhaka fiasco in the first week of April and the massive janaza in Brahmanbaria as recently as April 17.  Well, if we are late then it's all the more urgent to put the effort into a 360 degree campaign to raise public awareness.  Few regimes in the world have a friendlier media and civil society. Crisis is the time for all that chumminess to turn to concerted action-oriented camaraderie.   What else can be done? The government has announced cash handouts. A variation of the \"universal basic income\" concept that is popular among progressive activists and wonks in the West, this is being tried in a number of countries (the Pakistan example would appear to have caught the fancy of Bangla social media). The idea here is that government programs are complex and inefficient, people know what they need, so give them cash and trust their judgment. Forrest Cookson, a Dhaka-based American economist, suggests using the voter list and puts a price tag of 2% of GDP. His approach may well be feasible, and is worth pursuing. But it may not be enough on its own. Exactly how will a cash handout help by itself if there is no rice in the market? If there is a food shortage, and prices are rising, cash handouts will risk fuelling that inflation even higher. If we are worried about the poor going hungry, we need to give them food, not just cash. And if there is any country that knows how to distribute relief efficiently and forestall famine, it is Bangladesh.  As Asif Saleh puts it: \"Covid-19 is new and different in important ways, but we are home to premiere public health experts and institutions. We have one of the world's best networks of community health workers, a rich history of public-private partnerships in emergencies, and communities with incredible levels of resilience. We have weathered cyclones, floods, and so much more.\" Of course, the pandemic is different from cyclones and floods. The contagion element has to be addressed in the relief operation. For example, the World Bank report shows that Bangladesh performs the worst in the region when it comes to access to soap for hand washing. Shruti Rajagopalan and Alex Tabarrok of George Mason University recommend trucking in water and soap for hand washing. Something similar should be feasible in Bangladesh. The authors also recommend: Using cell phones to survey, inform, and pre-screen for symptoms, and subsidizing phone accounts alive; and requisitioning and repurposing government buildings as quarantine facilities. Both may well be feasible in Bangladesh. Even without any food crisis, the pandemic is already wrecking lives and livelihoods. Depending on the measure, over three-quarters of Bangladeshis work in informal sectors. The Great Lockdown is hitting them particularly hard.  Using cell phone data, the World Bank report notes that 10 million people may have left Dhaka as their incomes dried up. Unsurprisingly, the Bank forecasts a sharp slowdown in service sector and household consumption growth. As a result, the World Bank estimates 15 million people will fall below the poverty line -- that is, people earning less than US$1.90 in 2011 prices -- by 2021-22  In the short term, that is over the next weeks and months, as the global economy remains frozen, orders, production, profits, and jobs are taking hits. The chaos and despair in the garments belt north of Dhaka is visible to all.  Reflecting the global slump, the World Bank forecasts a nearly 20% fall in exports in 2019-20. Meanwhile, factories in Bangladesh's major competitors are partly (Indonesia, Cambodia) or fully open (China, Vietnam). If the rest of the world recovers as the IMF optimistically assumes, it's important that Bangladesh doesn't miss out on the winter production schedule, orders for which typically would come in during May-June.  China and Vietnam are in much better shape than us when it comes to the pandemic. That may well be the case when it comes to production of the country's major export.  Even more worryingly, exports are not expected to rebound until 2021-22. Reflecting the global uncertainty, investments are also expected to remain tepid into 2021-22. Clearly, the longer the global recession continues, the more pressure businesses and firms will be under.  Bangladeshi businesses are, by and large, not cash-rich, high-margin firms. Many RMG factories will not survive if the global slump continues beyond 2020. If the country's industrial capacity is damaged because of the pandemic, longer term development prospects will dim. Contrary to the populist reactions, therefore, there is much logic to the government's support (not stimulus -- that's a misnomer!) package.  The global slump is also exacting its toll on the other driver of growth -- remittances. Remittances continued in the aftermath of the 2008-09 crisis as the gulf economies recovered and migrant workers with precarious lives sent money back to the only safe haven they know -- Bangladesh.  This time may be different. The service sector jobs whence much of our remittances come are also the ones that are affected by the social distancing policies around the world. Most of the Bangladeshi workers around the world don't have a savings buffer. As their incomes stop, presumably so will remittance.  In addition to dampening household income and consumption as remittances dry up, the country's external balances will be hit. The World Bank projects a widening of the current account deficit (Chart 4).  How concerning is that? Chart 4: Current account deficit (% of GDP)  Source: IMF, World Bank.World Bank forecasts are for fiscal years. The currency crisis As the pandemic went global in February and March, financial markets around the world recoiled. Most emerging markets experienced unprecedented capital flight -- $90 billion dollars in the first quarter of 2020, far higher than was experienced during the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Investors did not differentiate between countries -- money simply flew to the safety of the dollar. Exchange rates tumbled -- both Indian and Pakistani rupees have fallen by over 7% since the beginning of the year. So far, the taka has avoided the carnage, and foreign exchange reserves remain ample (Chart 5). Chart 5: Reserves in terms of months of imports  Source: CEIC Asia. The best way to forestall a currency crisis is to avail an IMF lifeline, which is exactly what's being done. The Fund is essentially giving free money to the developing world to cushion finances from the economic freeze. And Bangladesh has had strong macroeconomic fundamentals over the last three decades.  That is, with luck, a currency crisis should be avoided. Nonetheless, moving into the longer term, the Great Lockdown will still leave a fiscal scar. Even without any significant new policies, the World Bank expects the budget deficit to nearly double to about 10% of GDP in 2020-21. Public debt is projected to rise from 33.8% of GDP in 2018-19 to over 50% of GDP in 2021-22.  Of course, the pandemic will leave a huge fiscal imprint around the world. But as is the case for individuals, so it is for countries that the poor can afford debt the least. Ultimately, how the fiscal burden is shared between different sections of society reflects the underlying socio-political settlements. And there is no getting away from the fact that our polity was in extremely rude health well before the pandemic.  For the last four decades or so, there has been an elite consensus in Dhaka to do whatever it takes to avoid a repeat of the macabre dance of deluge and death that hit us in the early 1970s. That consensus underpinned the exports and remittance-driven growth of the last four decades and the accompanying social development.  When an economy grows at 7% a year, incomes double roughly a decade. At 3% growth rate, it takes a quarter century. A new growth and development model will be needed to revert to the faster pace of growth after the pandemic is over.  But that's in the longer term. Before that, we will need to survive the Great Lockdown.   Jyoti Rahman is an applied macroeconomist (www.jrahman.wordpress.com)."

He said farmers would be able to complete the harvest in time if heavy rainfall or early floods did not occur.  He thanked political and social organisations, voluntary groups, students and teachers of schools and colleges and the Chhatra League for helping farmers in harvesting paddy during this crisis period. Razzaque conveyed his thanks to local administrations, public representatives, police, health division, and agriculture departments at district, upazila and union levels in this regard.

      "text": "'This is ridiculous. It happens every year and we need a sustainable plan to avert this kind of situation in the future' Farmers are forced to harvest their half-ripe paddy in the haor regions as croplands are inundated by incessant rain and water from upstream in Bishambharpur upazila of Sunamganj.  The Surma River has risen significantly and it is keeping water in the haors, causing waterlogging in the croplands, said the local Water Development Board (WDB). Md Al-Amin of the local WDB said: \"The Surma has swollen up due to the incessant rain in the past few days. Now, we can't lower the rubber dam because that will let more water into the haors.\"  On a visit to the affected areas on Friday, this correspondent found farmers waist deep in water, busy harvesting their crops in anticipation of another flood.  Farmer Narayan Barman of Krishna Nagar said: \"Our croplands are always flooded during this time of the year and this year it's no different. We are worried that our half-ripe crops will be damaged in the coming floods if we don't harvest it soon.\" Askar Ali, another farmer from the same village, said: \"I planted 29 varieties of paddy this year, all of which have been inundated by the rush of water  from upstream and high plains. The paddy has taken its time to ripen. But I had to begin harvesting to save my crops from getting completely submerged.\"  Monju Barman said: \"We can't find farmhands to help with harvesting because no one wants to work all day waist-deep in water. We now have to pay extra to hire good help.\" Sreebash Chandra Barman said: \"The haors are full, water can't flow and has nowhere to go, and the upstream water can't drain into the Surma River. This is ridiculous that it happens every year. We need a sustainable plan to avert this kind of situation in the future.\" Bishambharpur Upazila Parishad Chairman Safar Uddin said: \"Due to incessant rain in the past few days, water from upstream, with no path to get to the rivers, has inundated the croplands in the low-lying regions. This happens every year. The upazila administration is prepared to compensate farmers for their potential losses.\" Bishambharpur Upazila Agriculture Officer Deepak Kumar Das said: \"Farmers have begun harvesting their half-ripe crops, worried about impending floods but this should not be a problem. \"Farmers of the upazila have already harvested paddy from 1,620 hectares of the total 1,820 hectares of paddy croplands in the region. Weather permitting, all farmers in the low-lying regions can gather their harvest in time.\""

      "text": "'I used to lose sleep thinking that an early flood this year may destroy all my hard-earned crops because the labour deficit may not allow me to gather my harvest in time' Farmers have successfully gathered 95% of Boro paddy in Moulvibazar, despite uncertainties over the availability of labour and an early onset of the flood, potentially threatening this year's harvest in the district. With tireless efforts from 27,135 farmhands and using 39 harvesters and 121 reaper machines, farmers have managed to overcome the challenges brought forth by the coronavirus pandemic this year, says the district agriculture department. Local farmers say the labour wages were higher compared to previous years due to this year's labour shortage. However, they all agree that they were very worried about this year's harvest and now they are delighted to have gathered it all so quickly.  Farmer Kamal Miya, of Hakaluki Haor, said: \"I used to lose sleep thinking that an early flood this year may destroy all my hard-earned crops because the labour deficit may not allow me to gather my harvest in time. But, there was no problem this year.\" According to the Department of Agriculture Extension, this year the target for Boro production was set at 53,500 hectares and due to favourable weather and absence of sudden natural disasters, farmers have managed to reach that target.  Moulvibazar Department of Agriculture Extension Deputy Director Kazi Lutful Bari said: \"Farmers have harvested 95% of Boro paddy in the district. The month of April posed some threats with potential hails and floods to damage the crops. But, farmers of haor regions have already gathered their harvest. Now, farmers in highland regions can take their time to harvest their crops.\" Regarding the preparations of an early flood in the district, Water Development Board Executive Engineer Ranendra Shangkar Chakraborty, said: \"Boro farmers have successfully saved their crops from this year's flood. But, we are also aware of the impending Aush and Aman cultivation this year.\" \"All vulnerable embankments of Monu and Dhalai rivers have already been repaired. We have taken all possible measures to quickly take actions in case of a sudden dam collapse during the rainy season.\" Meanwhile, Agricultural Minister Md Abdur Razzaque on Tuesday told an online media briefing that farmers have already harvested about 90.02% of the Boro paddy sowed in the Haors and marshlands of Bangladesh. He said that Boro paddy was cultivated across 454,399 hectares of wetlands this year, with 400,906 hectares yielding harvests."

      "headline": "Women's empowerment is vital for climate resilience - but the burden of survival in Bangladesh should not rest on their shoulders alone",
      "authors": "Basundhara Tripathy Furlong and Isobel Talks",
      "text": "                                                                    As we all know, Bangladesh is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Partly this vulnerability can be attributed to the physical characteristics of the country, such as the flat, low-lying topography and climactic features which render it highly susceptible to floods, droughts, cyclones and earthquakes. However, socioeconomic factors also leave Bangladesh vulnerable in this time of climate emergency. The country has a very high population density, with many living below the poverty line (Pouliotte, Smit and Westerhoff, 2009). Social risks - such as gender inequality, social discrimination, unequal distributions of resources and power at the intra-household level and limited citizenship - have been important factors in pushing and keeping households in poverty. Additionally, the country has suffered a long history of weak political governance, and many livelihoods here rely on climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture and fishing (Huq and Ayers, 2008). Gender inequality has also been highlighted as a key barrier to climate resilience. In Bangladesh, unequal power relationships between men and women have resulted in a greater number of women experiencing poverty than men (Kabeer, 2003).The patriarchal system prevalent in mainstream Bengali society perpetuates oppressive gender roles. Alongside having unequal access to resources,women tend to have responsibility for care giving and the provision of food and fuel in the household. These tasks are highly affected by climactic disasters. All of these factors make it more difficult for women to recover from flooding and drought, as they are more reliant on climate sensitive resources than men and thus cannot adapt as easily as men can. Women are also less well represented than men in decision making processes at both national and local levels, so it is hard for them to advocate for changes to this inequality. However, there has been a pushback in recent years against this 'men-versus-women dichotomy' in climate change studies, as some argue that this \"feminisation of vulnerability\" reinforces a \"victimization discourse\" (Djoudi et al, 2016: 248). In fact, women are often proactive agents of adaption, and the causes of vulnerability are multifaceted and dependent on political relations beyond gender alone. It is this complexity that the panelists in the 'Embedding Gender Equality in Climate Action' session at the 4th CSD conference on 18th October 2019 sought to address. The first presentation from Dr Anastasia Seferiadis, Dr Oliver Scanlan and PhD scholar Basundhara Tripathy-Furlongaptly demonstrated the intricacy of gender and power, and inaptitude of the simplistic 'women as climate victims' discourse, in Bangladesh. Drawing on case-studies of a female centred micro-credit organisation in Jessore, a women's informal 'bondhu' group in Satkhira, and women's key role in the AchikMithik Samity in Madhupur they showed that women in Bangladesh are amassing and strategically deploying social capital, acquiring habits, skills and capacities to enable them to renegotiate their position, and appropriate elements of various projects in a DIY fashion as best suits them and their situation. However, due to the patriarchal environment of Bangladesh they are unable to dramatically rupture social ties, but instead are incrementally 'reweaving' them. The second presentation from Nasrin Siraj, PhD student at the University of Amsterdam, also disrupted the notion of a straightforward male and female divide, as her paper explored ethnic tensions in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in relation to inter-ethnic marriage. Expanding on our understanding of ethnicity within cosmopolitan sociability, this paper reflected on marriage practices (love marriage and arranged marriage) in shared neighbourhoods of Indigenous people and Bengali-muslim migrants. Through examples of inter-ethnic marriages from her ethnographic fieldwork, the presenter demonstrated shifting identities within the hill tracts of indigenous communities and their interaction with the mainstream Bengali population. The third paper, presented by Ms Sayeda Karim, Research Associate at ULAB, investigates female leaders in Bangladesh and their perception of climate change. Her research discovered that not only do women need to be given leadership opportunities so that their perspectives can be heard and needs met in climate strategies, but also that current leaders need support and opportunities to network so that they can develop an understanding of how climate change is affecting sectors beyond those that they specialise in. Finally, the fourth paper from PinashAkter, Project Officer at OXFAM, and Anushree Ghosh, MSc Student at Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science & Technology University, explored OXFAM's PROTIC project, a participatory initiative that has trained local women in how to use mobile technology to gain knowledge on climate adaptation strategies. The paper highlighted the role of gender in building climate resilience through the PROTIC project implemented in Dimla, Nilphamari. The main aim was to understand the function of the mobile phone for climate change adaptation led by women farmers.  In the discussion that followed the presentations it was reiterated, as the papers had made clear, that the solipsistic 'women are climate victims' rhetoric should be avoided. But it was also raised that there are risks to only emphasizing women's role as climate agents too. As one discussant Saydia Gulrukh, a journalist with New Age, noted; \"We need to interrogate gender as a social construct. In Bangladesh micro-enterprise has sought to empower women with knowledge, but infact women end up burdened with more work and responsibility on top of their rigid domestic roles ... so when we talk about women's role in climate resistance and how women can work towards climate adaption I worry that in the name of inclusion we may burden women with more unpaid work\". In relation to the last paper, another discussant, Dr. Samiya Luthfa, Associate Professor at the Department of Sociology in the University of Dhaka, questioned whether giving women mobile phones with climate adaptation information was enough to break through the societal and cultural barriers in rural areas of Bangladesh. As gender is a binary, it must not be forgotten that we need to redefine masculinity, and engage men in that process, in order to also dismantle fixed notions of femininity. The WID (Women In Development) approach, which arose in the 1970s within international development, was roundly criticized for utilizing a \"just add women and stir\" approach (Harding, 1995). Proponents of this school of thought hypothesized that bringing women into capitalist modes of production would increase prosperity all round, but they neglected considering how unequal gender relations had led to women being confined to the domestic sphere in the first place. The GAD (Gender And Development) approach that was formed in response to these critiques instead specifically focuses on the power relations between women and men, rather than on women alone (Plewes and Steurt, 1991:127). In the debates on climate adaptation in Bangladesh, it will be vital for this critical approach to gender to be applied so as to avoid over burdening women with the work of survival, rather than addressing the power imbalance between men and women, so that communities can become more resilient as a whole.

      "text": "The pandemic calls for strategizing on a whole different level The coronavirus pandemic has been a very interesting and cautious time for communications professionals across the world. Almost all comms professionals, especially in Bangladesh, are now experiencing a new element in crisis communication since the pandemic struck more than 200 countries.  Almost all the companies of Bangladesh have their own crisis communication strategies, but this was something they never expected to experience. In the context of Bangladesh, crisis communication only means tackling potentially negative news in the media, or trying to mitigate the damage to a tolerable level.  Keeping comfortable and supportive relationships with the media people is synonymous to crisis communication in this country. Before I started working with a bank about a year ago, I used to work with a telecom company that had about 13,000 mobile network towers across the country.  During natural disasters such as cyclones and floods, we were needed to communicate to the people in the coastal areas of Bangladesh about how to take care of themselves and vacate their homes and go to cyclone shelters. The government always depends on the telecom companies for this.  However, the real crisis communication in Bangladesh started during this pandemic, which went way beyond our plans and thinking. But we learned a lot of aspects about both external and internal communications. We have 8,500 people working for the bank, and we felt the need to make them aware on what was coming.  At the end of February, even before the first case was identified in Bangladesh, we formed an informal core committee that started monitoring the spread, flight, and behaviour of the virus. With an enormous workforce, it was urgent to make them aware of how to remain safe from any kind of contamination.  We have an e-learning platform, which we thought could be utilized. We started gathering as much information as we could from the reliable sources, such as the government, WHO, BRAC, and some major international news organizations. By the first week of March, we were able to prepare a set of FAQs for all employees.  The FAQ was simple: What is coronavirus, how prevent it, what to do when someone is infected. However, communicating this to an enormous workforce was a challenge. Informal surveys say no one actually reads most of the emails that are sent to them.  Therefore, sharing the FAQs with team leaders and department/unit heads was very effective, and they made sure that everyone read the FAQs and knew the facts available at that time. Gradually, many more facts surfaced, and we could know about the life-threatening risks.  When the first coronavirus case was identified in our country, we had to move faster than we thought we could. The government, as well as the media in Bangladesh, began to provide various kinds of information on the prevention. We started implementing social distancing practices.   Communicating this was vital. We observed that people were already panicked, and that helped. Our communications regarding social distancing worked. When the government announced the \"general holiday\" at the end of March, we fathomed the problem in the message, and we immediately reworded the holiday internally as the \"stay-home\" holiday.  We had to ensure that our people -- who would not be working at the branches -- must remain home and not go anywhere outside their geographical locations. The banks were not closed; they had to deliver the basic services on a limited scale. Now, we had to ensure that our people as well as the customers visiting the branches knew how to remain safe.  Communicating on how to remain safe at the same time as serving the customers was highly important. At the same time, we also needed to make the visiting customers aware about the dangers of being contaminated. Apart from visiting the branches, they were also going to the ATM booths.  So, they had to be alerted and communicated on how to remain safe when they came out of their homes with all kinds of precautionary measures. We sent emails and texts to them about the dos and don'ts. We also started encouraging them to use all digital platforms, so that they remain away from the branches and bank from home.  Since the end of March, I started compiling various types of suggestions on how to remain safe, what to do when infected, where to go when infected, etc, and communicated to our workforce almost every day. No one had told me to do that; I felt the need. Yes, people were noticing those communications and calling to thank me. I was inspired.  We also noticed the psychological impact on everyone; our stress level had gone up. Therefore, this was a good opportunity to communicate some general health and safety tips that can keep everyone healthy -- both mentally and physically -- during this difficult time.  The need for constant communications with the customers as well as the workforce has multiplied manifold. The need actually arose as we monitored their requirements during this pandemic.  These are new learnings for the communications professionals. The pandemic has taken, to a different level, thinking differently and applying extreme imagination while strategizing any communication plan.

      "text": "With jute, the sky is the limit Why not jute? The government of Bangladesh had banned plastic packaging nearly 20 years ago, but nothing much has happened except that drains, canals, and rivers have become more and more choked with plastic.  Government departments have failed consistently to become more eco-friendly, more active in preventing pollution. I think back 40 years when, on behalf of Oxfam Trading and championing \"fair trade,\" I used to visit Bangladesh to search out utility handicrafts from producer groups.  From the beginning of Bangladesh, Oxfam had supported and bought from organizations such as \"CORR-The Jute Works.\" 40 years ago, the Dhaka Airport Duty Free Shop, very sensibly, would provide jute bags for bottles and other merchandise, but later with the advancement of technology and more stringent security, bottles had to be packed in \"see-through\" plastic bags! The authorities at every level have completely failed to enforce the ban on plastic bags or encourage jute packaging.  Oh yes, if you go to seminars run by the government or NGOs, you are likely to get a nice conference bag made of jute, but what about using jute/burlap bags for food grains?  Having qualified in farm management, I know that if grain is stored in bags which can \"breathe,\" the grain can be at 16% moisture content, whereas in plastic or bulk storage, it has to be 14% or lower to stay in good condition. There are a number of NGOs that make attractive clothing from jute which is exported around the world, and indeed this trade should be encouraged and supported as much as possible by the government authorities.  Indeed, I have a beautiful multi-coloured waistcoat, made of jute and cotton and with natural dye colours. When the ban on plastic was announced in 2002, many shops started using \"netting\" bags. But now everything is, again, put into plastic bags -- even things that do not need bags.   The shops should \"charge\" for plastic bags as they do in other countries, which might encourage the shoppers to carry their own shopping bags.  A survey last year estimated that over 400 million plastic bags are used in Dhaka each month and that a three metre thick layer of plastic bags is on the riverbed of the Buriganga River. These statistics are most frightening! To make \"Use Jute\" an effective campaign, you need vigorous inter-ministerial cooperation so that all ministries are on the same page. Like climate change, it is essential that all ministries are involved when it comes to the use of jute.  Jute is already being used to make shoe uppers, lampshades, suitcases, paperweights, helmets, and even shower and bath units. Panels, false ceilings, and partitions are already in the market.  Jute composites are, I understand, used for covers of electrical appliances, pipes, post-boxes, roof tiles, and grain storage silos.  The construction of low cost, pre-fabricated mobile units that can be used in times of natural calamities such as floods, cyclones, and earthquakes has a huge potential in the subcontinent itself.  In addition, jute has been used to make different types of furniture. It would seem that the sky's the limit. To see a resurgence in the importance of jute during \"Mujib Borsho\" would be especially pleasing, because in 1972, only the export of jute could bring in foreign exchange.  Let the growers, workers at the jute mills, designers, and craftswomen and men join with government officials to make this an historic year.

      "text": "Nevertheless, Netrakona farmers are expecting a profitable boro paddy yield Fearing a delayed harvest of boro paddy, farmers in Khulna and Netrakona are in distress as the monsoon rains have begun pouring and they are yet to cut most of their crops. The boro paddy is late in ripening this season due to untimely rainfall and a prolonged winter last year, and farmers are worried about their harvest due to the new problem-- manpower shortage amid the Covid-19 nationwide shutdowns. In Khulna, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) office, only 18% of the paddy has been harvested. They are worried as the district has had 124 millimetres of rainfall in the last three days. The office said the crops which have not been harvested yet would face minimal damage while the harvested grain will face even more damage. Amirul Azad, in charge of the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (Met office), Khulna unit, said the district has had heavy rains since Thursday and it's possible that the rains will persist for a few more days, waterlogging most of the crop fields. Farmers and DAE sources said, along with Dumuria and the swamp areas of Singair, Baniakhali, Khalshi, Bamondia, and Gonalir are already waterlogged due to the rains and the crops are half underwater which might damage quality. Jamal Gazi, a Dumuria farmer said he had already harvested his half acre of boro paddy, but due to the rains most of it might be damaged before he can safely store it. Although Dumuria Agriculture Officer Md Mossaddek Hossain said the rain will not affect the harvest of the area, farmers Abdul Aziz, Nurul Islam, and Shahjahan Fakir say their crops are on the way to be wasted soon. The official said 30% of the 21,205 acres of crop land in Dumuria has been harvested. Pangkaj Kanti Majumdar, deputy director of Khulna DAE said the total harvest amounts to 57,540 acres of lands in Khulna this season, of which 18% has been harvested.  \"The persistent rain will have no effect on the paddy as the sunlight is also right this year,\" added the official. Meanwhile, in Netrakona, farmers are busy harvesting boro paddy--which is expected to provide a high yield this season--in 134 haors of Madan-Mohanganj and Khaliajuri upazilas of the district. Though production is abundant this year, farmers are suffering from tremendous manpower shortage due to the Covid-19 outbreak and fear early floods soon due to the persistent rainfall. According to the Netrakona DAE office, they have provided 42 combine harvesters and 8 reaper machines to assist farmers who are not able to manage additional farmworkers like in past years. Habibur Rahman, deputy director of DAE said: \"The government is paying 50% of the total cost of these machines to assist the farmers. We provided 28 harvester machines to the swamp areas as production is high there. We hope the harvest will soon end and will fetch a good price this year.\" However, Shafikul Islam, Monir Hossain, Sukomol Sarker and other farmers said the allocated machines are not enough for the large areas of cropland and the authority should allocate more machines to make the harvest sooner. Contacted, Deputy Commissioner Moinul Islam, who regularly visits the farmers, said: \"If they ask for more we will provide extra farmworkers from other districts to assist them.\" \"All necessary help will be provided to the farmers,\" the official promised. He added that more than 1.84 lakh acres of land are shining with flowering boro paddy in Netrakona district."

      "authors": "Shohel Mamun",
      "text": "The government has announced an allocation of Tk100 crore to procure machines for harvesting paddy and reduce dependency on labourers Boro paddy is ready to be harvested all across Bangladesh as Boisakh (Bengali month) approaches, but it is now under threat due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Farmers are worried about harvesting as there is a shortage of farm labourers due to a countrywide transport suspension in line with the general holidays declared by the government.  Apart from this, many parts of the country are under lockdown. People are instructed to stay at home and going outside after sunset is now considered a legal offence.  According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statics (BBS), farmers from around 25 districts are dependent on farm labourers from other places during harvest time.  Districts like Dhaka, Narayanganj, Gazipur, Narsingdi and Chittagong are facing an acute crisis of farm labourers. Moreover, districts in the haor area-- Kishoreganj, Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Sylhet, Brahmanbaria -- as well as Feni, Munshiganj and Patuakhali also need to hire labourers and are under moderate crisis. The farmers from the acute and moderate crisis areas mostly hire labourers from Jamalpur, Sherpur, Dinajpur, Thakurgaon, Kurigram, Jessore, Netrokona, Gaibandha, Meherpur, Naogaon, Natore, Rajshahi, Mymensingh, Jhenaidah, Chuadanga, Joypurhat, Rangpur and Nilphamari districts.  However, there is a restriction on their movements due to the coronavirus pandemic.  This creates a big challenge for the farmers, especially in haor area, as they will get only about three weeks to harvest the paddy for soon there will be flash floods in the beginning of May.   During a recent visit to the haor area, our correspondents found that farmers are almost prepared to harvest Boro crops and some have already started. \"Labourers from Mymensingh districts used to come to Sunamganj to harvest paddy but this year they are not here yet,\" said a farmer from Sunamganj haor area on Sunday.  Jamshed Ali, a farmer from Balaganj upazila of Sylhet, said: \"I am worried that I will not be able to harvest all my crops in due time as there is a shortage of workers because of the countrywide shutdown.\"    Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already ordered the district administration and police to help the agriculture labourers and send them to their respective destinations. However, in reality most labourers do not want to move to other district as they do not have identity cards to prove themselves as farm labourers. \"If we move to another part of the country, we might have to stay there even after the harvest period, as the pandemic may turn deadly in Bangladesh,\" said Abul Kalam, a farm labourer from Jamalpur. \"Moreover, bus owners will increase the fares as there is no assurance that they will get a return trip,\" he added. Government initiatives Meanwhile, the government has announced an allocation of Tk100 crore to procure machines for harvesting paddy so that a fewer number of labourers is required. The government has also planned to supply some harvesting machines to the farmers from their own stock.   However, such initiatives might not be sufficient as the government is mainly focusing on the haor area, whereas there are many other districts which produce Boro paddy.  According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the government has set  a target to produce 20.43 million tons of Boro paddy in the current fiscal year. Out of the total, 3.745 million tons paddy will be produced in seven of the districts under the haor area, which is almost 20% of the total target.    According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, a total of 180 combined harvesters and 137 ripper machines have been allocated for districts under the haor area.  Ministry of Agriculture Secretary Nasiruzzaman said: \"It is time to harvest Boro paddy. Seasonal labourers from different parts of the country, including North Bengal, will start moving to the haor regions.  \"So all concerned have been requested to ensure that all their travels and movements are smooth and in accordance to the health guidelines. \"We have already provided harvesting machines to farmers which may reduce dependency on labourers,\" he added."

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "Indian analysts also questioned BJP's reported claim that 4 million illegal Bangladeshi immigrants were now in India The Indian media has come down heavily on the country's ruling right wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and union minister of state for home affairs, G Kishan Reddy, for his ridiculous comments on Bangladesh on February 9. Reddy had said that \"half of the citizens of Bangladesh will leave the country if India offers citizenship to them.\" The Indian analysts also questioned the BJP's reported claim that 4 million illegal Bangladeshi immigrants were now in India. The Indian Express and the Hindustan Times in recent weeks have carried comments by eminent Indian scholars suggesting that Indian leaders were wrong in their perception of Bangladesh and must rethink their attitudes to the country, especially with regard to the old mindset that people from this part of the old Bengal found India to be a goldmine for employment or any other benefits. 'Bangladesh is performing far better' Karan Thapar, a reputed journalist and television commentator, writes in the Hindustan Times, \"Frankly, I blame Henry Kissinger. Way back in the 1970s, he called Bangladesh 'an international basket case.'\" \"At the time, no doubt, it was. Television images of the frequent devastating floods it suffered confirmed this characterisation. So the description stuck. Today, Bangladesh is a different country.\" Thapar had a withering response to Reddy: \"Apart from the fact that he was undiplomatic and offensive, Reddy also revealed that he's ignorant of the true state of Bangladesh. Worse, he doesn't know that, in comparison to India, Bangladesh is performing far better on many, if not most, of the indices that determine quality of life.\" \"So when AK Abdul Momen, Bangladesh's foreign minister, says, 'Some Indian nationals are entering Bangladesh illegally for economic reasons,' he may well be right.\" People migrate to improve their lives, and life in Bangladesh seems decidedly better. If you're an Indian Muslim in danger of lynching because you trade in meat, accused of love-jihad because you've fallen in love with a Hindu, or in fear of losing your citizenship, you could easily be tempted to cross over to the other side.\" Thapar's statement certainly makes sense for a wide swath of people. 'Our neighbour largely outshines us' Another analyst, Swati Narayan, a research scholar at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, wrote in the Indian Express, \"Bangladesh's economic growth rate has surpassed India. In the last decade, on a range of social development indicators, from infant mortality to immunisation, Bangladesh has fared better.\"  She also mentioned the recent victory of the Bangladesh Under-19 cricket team against India in the youth World Cup, saying, \"Bangladesh beat India at the junior world cup. So why would Bangladeshis en masse want to leave their cherished homeland?\"  \"Since economic liberalisation, Indians have grown much richer than Bangladeshis, but in terms of quality of life our neighbour largely outshines us,\" she wrote.  Swati mentioned her recent doctoral thesis - How have India's poorer neighbours forged ahead in social development? - where she sought to decode the South Asian development puzzle.  In her opinion, \"Bangladesh's most prominent factor has been its ability to dissolve inequalities through sustained investment in public services and the bridging of social and gender distances.\" \"In comparison, India is grappling with the worst unemployment levels in 45 years and sinking economic growth rates.\"  Swati writes, \"Berating our neighbours with the false bogey of illegal immigrants, in light of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), is nothing but an unjustifiable Islamophobic distraction. Instead, it would be far wiser for the Indian government to humbly learn the recipe of South Asian success to improve the lives of citizens from the impressive \"Shonar Bangla\" - a term of endearment in reference to Bangladesh. Immigration from Bangladesh in recent years India's national debate on the NRC and CAA shows little sign of drawing to an end. At the core of this debate is the fast-held belief that millions of immigrants from Bangladesh have illegally entered West Bengal, Assam and Tripura, radically altering the demographics of these three states.  A layman's knowledge about \"millions of illegal immigrants\" is mostly based on anecdotal evidence and hearsay like \"it is known..,\" \"that vegetable vendor is from...\" and \"in the border areas...\"  Beliefs and opinions, especially when not substantiated by facts, are hard to change.  In West Bengal, if there has been a massive entry of Bangladeshis into the state in recent decades, it should have led to a skyrocketing of the state's population number and substantially set it apart from the rest of the country.  But, according to census data from 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011, the growth rate of West Bengal's population has distinctly been less than the national average since the 1990s. This is true not only for the whole population, but also for both the Hindu and Muslim communities as indicated by the past two or three census figures. This punctures the myth that West Bengal is bursting with a much larger-than-expected population because of Bangladeshi immigrants. Both the Indian scholars outline Bangladesh's achievements at a very appropriate time when the two neighbours have issues to settle over CAA and NRC, but in particular the random border killings which have only to an increase in anti-Indian sentiments in Bangladesh. To end, a quote from Thapar's piece says it all: \"Life in Bangladesh appears a lot more attractive than in India.\""

      "text": "The fate of other char dwellers living across the country is more or less the same as 70% of them rely on agriculture alone for their livelihood Natural calamities and lack of employment are two of the main factors holding char people back from participating in mainstream life. These two factors are also hindering their chances of a better livelihood, education, sanitation, and healthcare.  Abdul Bari, 35, who lived in Purar Char, a char on the Brahmaputra river in Jatrapur union of Kurigram Sadar upazila, had the misfortune of experiencing river erosion not once, not twice, but 10 times.  Mentioning that he only earns Tk6,000 - Tk7,000 per month to feed a family of three children, his wife and mother, Bari said: \"I was 11 when I witnessed our home being devoured by the river for the very first time. Now I am waiting for it to happen for the 11th time. Due to this I was forced to shift my house on multiple occasions. Providing for my family is a daily struggle for me. \"Though I am a farmer, I also teach at a local private community school and so my children are being able to continue their studies. But those who are illiterate and earn less than me are suffering even more. We [char dwellers] are in a never ending fight for survival.\" The fate of other char dwellers living across the country is more or less the same as 70% of them rely on agriculture alone for their livelihood. Experts say that char people require special arrangements to cope with the adverse effects of climate change and also urged the authorities concerned to form a designated foundation and a national policy for the development of this ill-fated segment of the population.  Commenting on the issue, Habibun Nahar, deputy minister of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said: \"The life of char dwellers is totally different from those who live on the mainland. We have visited these lands to know more about the people who live there, to learn about their survival strategies and also to understand the effects of climate change on their lives. Char dwellers have their own way of adapting to the changes. We are working towards the development of these people.\"    There are 109 char upazilas, both coastal and river chars, in 32 districts across Bangladesh.  According to the \"Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2016,\" 26% of households in the coastal char lands earn less than Tk7,000 per month, and 24.1% in the river char areas, while that figure stands at 22.6% nationally. More than half of the children living in char areas of the country are deprived of primary education. Only 21.4% of people living in coastal char areas have access to electricity. Adding to the misery, merely 33.6% of the households have proper sanitation in the coastal chars, and 31.3% in the river chars.   Access to clean drinking water and healthcare are other major battles that char dwellers have to fight for every day. According to research conducted by Unnayan Shamannay, a non profit and non government research organization, a student living on the mainland, on average, has to go 0.92km to get to a primary school and 1.7km for a high school. Whereas, a child living in char areas has to travel 2.5km and 5.5km respectively to get the same educational opportunities. Jahid Islam, member secretary of National Char Alliance (NCA), an advocacy platform comprising over 50 organisations working for the rights of char dwellers, said: \"Due to the lack of a designated organization, government allocation of funds for the development of char people goes unused. A foundation is needed to properly utilize  money for the integrated progress of char dwellers. \"It is not possible to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) leaving char people behind. We need a national policy for the development of chars and people living there, immediately.\""

      "text": "The people of several villages, including Bhalkutia, Kostapara, and Khanurbari, are fearful with their lands and homes under threat An sudden and unanticipated bank erosion of the Jamuna River is wreaking havoc on the inhabitants of Bhuapur upazila in Tangail. This has taken away arable lands and homesteads in the last two weeks, and is creating panic, especially among farmers. The people of several villages, including Bhalkutia, Kostapara, and Khanurbari, are fearful with their lands and homes under threat.  Floods have damaged their crops and cattle, leaving them in despair, said local sources. Jahurul Islam of Khanurbari in the upazila said: \"Many houses were submerged in flood waters for the last three 13 days. No action has yet been taken to save the people.\" Houses, schools, and madrasas have been devoured by the Jamuna River in the upazila of the district in a wild water level rise, causing severe river erosion in the past couple of days. The riverbank erosion has hit several areas hard at a time when Covid-19 is sweeping the country, said Jahurul. Rafiqul Islam of Kostapara village said erosion has already claimed his home and lands along the river. When the water level first began to rise, locals urged authorities to take steps to check the erosion, but nothing was done, he added. \"The Water Development Board did not take any effective steps to protect the localities from the dreadful erosion earlier,\" he alleged.  The WDB dumped some sacks at Khanurbari, but those bags were filled with earth and not sand.  Tomato, brinjal, chilli and mustard fields went into the river due to the erosion. The erosion has turned acute in the areas. Another farmer of the village said he cultivated brinjal, tomato and chilli, partly on his own and partly on leased land taking a loan.   Most of his cropland was devoured by the river in the last 10-12 days, he said.  \"The way the river is eating up our crops, the burden of the loan will mount on us,\" he added. Lokman Hossain, a local, said several hundred families lost what they had, including their homesteads, to the riverbank erosion earlier.  \"Many were trying to eke out an existence growing crops on their arable land. But the untimely riverbank erosion has devastated their lives, \" he said. Locals urged the administration to take immediate measures. Contacted, Serajul Islam, executive engineer of the Water Development Board (WDB), said steps have been taken to protect the eastern side of the mouth of the river from the erosion."

      "text": "Bangladesh has taken the lead by dismantling some 234 ships in 2019 Bangladesh has again retained top spot in the global ship-breaking industry. The NGO Shipbreaking Platform, a Belgium based advocacy organization, has published data on ships dismantled worldwide in 2019. Bangladesh has taken the lead by dismantling some 234 ships in 2019, according to the list published on February 4. According to the platform which ensures the safe and environmentally sound dismantling of end-of-life ships worldwide, 674 ocean going commercial ships and offshore units were sold to scrap yards in 2019. Of these vessels, 469 large tankers, bulkers, floating platforms, cargo, and passenger ships, were broken down on only three beaches in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, amounting to nearly 90% of the gross tonnage dismantled globally. According to 'Review of Maritime Transport 2019' published by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Bangladesh secured the top position in ship breaking by dismantling 47.2% vessels of the world in 2018. According to the report, India dismantled 25.6% of ocean going vessels, Pakistan 21.5%, Turkey 2.3%, and China 2% in 2018. In 2017, the top four ship breaking countries were India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and China. No respite from workplace casualty The platform documented accidents that killed 24 workers in Chittagong, making 2019 the worst year for Bangladeshi yards in terms of fatalities since 2010. At least another 34 workers were badly injured. Differing with the platform's casualty statistics, Palash Kumar Das, Inspector,  Department of Inspection for Factories & Establishment (DIFE), told Dhaka Tribune that 19 ship breakers died on the job. Speaking to Dhaka Tribune, Tapan Dutta, convener of the Ship Breaking Workers' Trade Union Forum, said Bangladesh has become the top dumping ground for discarded ships in the world with the country dismantling the highest number of vessels due to cheap labor and lax regulations.  \"The dismantling will further increase in Bangladesh in the coming days as China and India have put a limit on the number of imports of scrap vessels on the back of environmental concerns,\" Tapan said. \"Ship demolition is a highly risky affair, yet ship breaking yard owners hardly follow occupational safety standards and wage board regulations. The ship breakers are denied their rights to form trade unions. Insolvent ship breakers retain this sort of hazardous job as they have no other options, and yard owners take advantage of the situation,\" said the labour rights activist.   Muhammad Ali Shahin, senior program coordinator of Young Power in Social Action (YPSA), an organization for sustainable development, told Dhaka Tribune that the ships brought in for scrapping should be properly cleaned before beaching. \"Ship breaking yards must ensure that scrapping does not cause any pollution and health hazards through releasing hazardous wastes. The ship breakers should also ensure occupational safety to avert workplace accidents. We are waiting for the day when Bangladesh will gain international recognition for complying with all regulations,\" said Shahin, who has been working on the ship breaking sector for 18 years. There are an estimated 3,000 permanent and 5,000 to 7,000 temporary workers in the ship breaking yards  on the 25km strip of Sitakunda upazila in the district.  Coastal degradation According to the platform, thousands of protected mangrove trees have been cut to make way for  ships discarded for scrapping in Bangladesh. 14,000 mangrove plants were felled in 2009 in Sitakunda to make space for ship breaking yards. According to an estimate by Chittagong based  YPSA, over the past few years, at least 60,000 mangrove trees have been cut along the coast near the port city of Chittagong to make way for more ships. The felling of mangroves has negative consequences as they are essential for the ecosystem and are the last barrier against the devastating effects of typhoons and floods. Long-term health impacts As per the platform, the risk of developing a fatal occupational health hazard is high as workers lack proper respiratory equipment to protect themselves against toxic fumes and contaminated materials released during the cutting and cleaning operations. In most cases, harmful substances are not even identified and therefore they put workers' health in harm's way. Some cancers, including asbestos related mesothelioma, will only develop 15 to 20 years after exposure, and cause many more casualties among former ship breaking workers. In addition to taking a huge toll on the health and lives of workers, ship breaking is a highly polluting industry.  In South Asia, ships are grounded before they are pulled and broken apart on tidal mudflats. On these once pristine beaches, coastal ecosystems and local communities depending on them, are devastated by toxic spills and other types of pollution caused by the breaking operations.  As long as ship breaking is carried out by beaching, the environment will suffer."

      "text": "According to the local agriculture department, this year's harvest season will begin from April 15 in all the haor areas of Sylhet. Since farmers lost their crops to the floods in 2017, Boro fields in Sylhet have yielded good harvests the past two years. Farmers are also expecting a good harvest this year with ripe crops in abundance on wetlands in haor areas throughout the division.  However, farmers are still fearful they may fail to bring home all their hard earned golden harvest due to a labour shortage in this lockdown across different parts of the country and a transport halt, following the coronavirus outbreak. According to the local agriculture department, this year's harvest season will begin from April 15 in all the haor areas of Sylhet.  This year Boro has been cultivated on 474,195 hectares across the division, with the highest cultivation in Sunamganj on 219,300 hectares. The department has set a production target of 1,860,000 tons of rice from Sylhet this year and they believe the target is achievable.   Kausar Chowdhury, from Dirai upazila of Sunamganj, said: \"We are anxious to harvest our crops this year! Especially because we are expecting a good yield. But all the farmers are stuck at home. I don't know how we'll manage to harvest all our crops.\" Jamshed Ali, of Balaganj upazila of Sylhet, said: \"I am expecting a good yield this year due to government incentives and support from the agriculture department. \"But, I am worried if I'll be able to harvest all my crops in time with the shortage of workers in this countrywide shutdown.\"  Sylhet Agricultural Extension Department Additional Director Sree Nibash Debnath said: \"I have visited the largest haors in the division and have found the Boro paddy to be of good quality and free of disease or rot. \"Farmers need not worry about their harvest this year. A combined harvest machine has already been allocated to Bishambharpur upazila in Sunamganj. Also, there are enough workers to help with the harvest. workers from outside the district will also aid in the harvest following local administration guidelines.\" "

      "text": "Agriculture department statistics state 17,800 farmers from the district have been brought under the agriculture incentive program from Nilphamari in the ongoing 2019-2020 fiscal year The government is giving various kinds of incentives to further the agriculture sector. As a result, the agriculture scenario in Nilphamari has undergone massive changes thanks to those incentives and subsidies. Sources at the district agriculture department office say incentives are being m given to the farmers to encourage more farming.  Additionally, the government is also undertaking agriculture rehabilitation programs to support those affected by floods and other natural calamities. On the other hand, crores of taka is being disbursed in subsidies for fertilizers and agricultural machinery to the farmers. Agriculture department statistics state 17,800 farmers from the district have been brought under the agriculture incentive program from Nilphamari in the ongoing 2019-2020 fiscal year. Under the program, the farmers received wheat, maize, onion, mustard and moog lentil. Those who received 20 kilogram of wheat for one bigha of land also received 20kg of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and 10kg Muriate of Potash (potassium chloride) fertilizers. Md Moksen Ali, 50, a farmer from Sarkarpara village of Sadar upazila said, to recuperate for his losses faced in previous floods and other disasters, he has begun harvesting maize in advance.  A paddy farmer previously, he resorted to maize cultivation as it required very little capital, and he received free seedlings and fertilizers as he was part of the incentive program. Md Rezaul Islam, a maize trader at Ramnagar union, said depending on the maize quality, a kg of the crop fetched Tk700-920 currently. Sirajul Islam, another maize farmer from the same union, cultivated the crop on two bighas of land. But as part of the incentive program, he received seeds and fertilizers for one bigha of land completely free. \"This saved me a lot of money, which I used to cultivate wheat on an additional bigha of land nearby,\" he added. Md Kamrul Hasan, agriculture officer at Nilphamari Sadar upazila, said that apart from subsidies, government surveillance and agricultural research have made it possible to achieve success in agriculture.  \"Especially since farmers are able to buy fertilizers and agricultural machinery in small quantities at hand, they have turned around,\" he added.  Sirajul Islam, deputy director at Nilphamara Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) office, said the government's incentive program has attracted a lot of farmers' interest, which helped 17,800 to be part of the program. This program will help many farmers to become self-sufficient, he added."

      "text": "Let's not underestimate our own ability to find the best way forward in this crisis Dhaka's streets are eerily empty. When ten million rickshaw drivers, day labourers, factory workers, maids and others raced to get home before the government \"holiday,\" the city became unnaturally quiet. Dhaka is usually full of the sounds of interaction, energy, and a growing economy. The sounds of people earning, people who were able to get by financially. Where are they now? What will they eat? How long can a rickshaw-puller like Shumi in Rajshahi, whose family of five subsists on what she can bring home at the end of the day, after she's paid a Tk350 guarantee to the rickshaw owner? According to WB data, only 15% of Bangladesh's population makes more than Tk500 a day. They can meet their daily expenses, send their children to school, and hope that they reserve enough for an emergency health crisis. Most villagers depend on remittances from the cities or abroad. Because this is a global crisis, people everywhere are out of work. Income has stopped. How long can they last? The US government is now encouraging physical distancing until the end of April. Approximately 75% of workers have access to paid sick leave, and close to 90% have health insurance.   Almost a third of people could work effectively from home. And yet we still see that, despite all of these forms of social support and benefits, many people are struggling financially with the consequences of the Covid-19 policies. In Bangladesh, where over 90% of workers are in the informal sector, health insurance is a luxury, and most homes don't have any sort of internet connectivity, how much more devastating would these policies be here? How many workers making Tk500 a day can work from home? For Bangladesh, let's admit that Covid-19 is a humanitarian crisis with a public health dimension. If large-scale physical distancing is required, we must find ways to mitigate the economic shock that will bring the majority of the country into food insecurity within weeks. Urban poor who live off daily wages will have to skip meals.  Let's find ways to keep people safe that also protect their livelihoods. If they absolutely must stay home, we will need to provide food or emergency cash transfers. Assuming that mobile money providers are able to keep their agents active during this time, we have a financial system that goes deep into the villages and could deliver money to almost every household. While there are important lessons to be learned from China, South Korea, Italy, and other countries who are deeper into their Covid-19 response than we are, we should also question how much of their policies could be imported here. China's health expenditure per capita is 10 times the average in Bangladesh; and Italy's is eight times as large as China's. It doesn't stop there. People staying at home connect to the world through their smartphones -- buying groceries, sending money to loved ones, video chatting with friends to stay mentally positive. The data from smartphones, location information in particular, have proven invaluable in contact tracing.   In South Korea, a website tracking the locations of newly identified cases enabled people to see if they had been exposed when they went to the mall or movies, and seek testing. Today, in China, people get a red, green or yellow message on their phone that lets them know whether they should prepare to leave their home and go to work, based on the latest Covid surveillance data. Contrast this with Bangladesh, where many people struggle to understand an SMS and a recent phone-based Covid survey led to widespread confusion. We can seek inspiration from the models abroad, but we should also recognize that many mitigation strategies may be out of our reach. We should also have a sobering realization that our public health care system is already overburdened and that curve, as is, is very skewed and not flattened.  There are 127,000 hospital beds in the entire country. 91,000 of them in public hospitals for a population of 170 million. It gets worse. The entire public system has 432 ICU beds with only 110 outside the capital Dhaka and if you add the numbers from the private sector, you have another 737.   This is for a population of 170 million. Italy has 4.1 doctors on average per 1,000 people and Bangladesh has 0.5 and that too based on official numbers and a significant chunk of these doctors are either abroad or not practicing. At Dhaka's medical college and hospital, the largest government medical facility in the country, over 500 patients seek critical care monthly, and over 400 are turned away due to lack of capacity. We need to think hard about an appropriate public response in a place as dense as Bangladesh, where most families' ability to eat depends on daily wages and 87% employment is generated from the informal sector?   The average household in Bangladesh has over five members, and usually includes three generations. Families share one latrine and more than 80% of the slum households share a water source with five or more households.   There is no way to separate the old and the young, the productive adults from those whose age makes them more vulnerable to serious illness and death. To practice the social distancing norms that most Western countries have relied on to reduce transmission is proving to be culturally completely impossible. How do you stock up on 30-day supplies when you can only buy a few days' worth of food? What will you do after that food runs out if your income has been cut off? While I am worried, I also have endless faith in Bangladesh's ability to rise in a moment of crisis. Even when outsiders see us as a basket case, we see an innovative path forward. When global health experts said that Bengali mothers couldn't make oral rehydration solution at home and we'd have to import packets of premade solution, which were heavy and difficult to transport to rural villages given the communications infrastructure in the 1980s, we taught families about lobon-gur and child mortality plunged.   When people in villages were dying of tuberculosis because the hospitals were too far away, we found ways to bring testing and treatment to the community level.   Covid-19 is new and different in important ways, but we are home to premiere public health experts and institutions. We have one of the world's best networks of community health workers, rich history of public-private partnerships in emergencies, and communities with incredible levels of resilience. We have weathered cyclones, floods, and so much more. Let's not underestimate our own ability to find the best way forward in this crisis, to find the best in ourselves and make sure that we help each other survive this crisis.

      "text": "Police in the port city are arranging to send some 1500 labourers Amid acute shortage of labour in haor areas where paddy is ready for harvest, authorities in Chittagong are arranging to transport people in the northeastern part of the country. The Chittagong Metropolitan Police (CMP) has taken an initiative to send up to 1,500 labourers to the haor areas, prone to flash floods during this time of the year. Some 100 labourers have already left on fives buses on Sunday, said CMP Deputy Commissioner SM Mehedi Hasan before adding that social distancing measures were ensured.   According to him a large number of people, hailing from the haor areas, live in the port city for a living. \"We have listed 1500 people, who are willing to go back for harvesting paddy. They will travel in phases by buses provided by transport operators,\" said the senior police official.  Each of the 40-seat buses has been disinfected while in a bid to ensure social distancing, they will carry 20 people at a time, according Deputy Police Commissioner Hasan  \"The labourers will report to Oshtogram police station in Kishoreganj. They will stay at a primary school and nobody will be allowed to go home after harvesting paddy,\" he added. Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, Inspector Nejam Uddin, the officer-in-charge of Chittagon's Bakalia police station said that most of the labourers travel to their home districts in this time of year usually.  \"This year, they were stuck due to the coronavirus lockdown. The move came in line with instructions of the prime minister,\" he said."

      "headline": "How has Bangladesh changed?",
      "authors": "Julian Francis",
      "text": "The agricultural sector is developing, but at what cost? Now that the country is in the process of celebrating \"Mujib Borsho,\" I am fortunate to be able to look back so many years. It is a privilege to have been able to follow Bangladesh since its birth in 1971.  I had actually heard how the Pakistani authorities had tried to starve Bengalis to death after the cyclone of November 1970, and in 1971, in the refugee camps in India, I assisted the struggle for the refugees to survive in appalling conditions where malnutrition and death were widespread.  I saw in early 1972 to what extent the infrastructure and the economy of the country had been shattered. Later on, in 1974, during the famine conditions of Rowmari, Kurigram, I heard how, on one occasion, 6,000 local people waited all day for the 400 chapattis being made every day at a particular gruel kitchen. There have been so many changes -- many positive -- since those very difficult days in the early 1970s. Ten years ago, my work often took me to Rowmari, and though still a relatively poor area, I know that all communities ensure that nobody ever starves to death.  Especially during the lean months of September to November, many people may not eat three times a day, but relatives and neighbours ensure that all eat at least once.  Bangladesh may now have more than double the 1971 population of 70-75 million, but it is now in a position of being self-sufficient in staple food to feed about 170 million people.  The big challenge that still remains is that many do not have the purchasing power to obtain that food. I am often asked what has changed the most. Obviously food production, but also the huge contribution that the RMG industry has been making to the country's economy.  Communications too -- especially roads and telecommunications -- have dramatically changed how the country works. Mobile phones have revolutionized how people lead their lives, even in remote areas.  While road communications to and from Dhaka have transformed the way business is run, it is unfortunate that the mass transit facilities for Dhaka have, until recently, been completely neglected by successive governments and the great city seems to be grinding to a halt.  This, in turn, is likely to have a great negative effect on businesses and livelihoods all over the country. It is expected that the mass transit schemes currently being built will dramatically transform the situation in the near future. However, probably one of the biggest changes I have seen is the position, presence and visibility of women. What struck me when I came to Dhaka in January 1972 was the absence of women in the streets and in most offices I then visited. Though there may still be a long way to go, particularly in the rural areas, this positive change is a significant one. Change, however, often comes at a great cost. The largely mono-culture agriculture, with hybrid seeds and agro-chemicals, has and is slowly taking a toll on the land in some parts of the country.  Soil fertility is being adversely affected and, as the older generation points out, the diet of most people is less \"balanced\" than 40 or 50 years ago. Many local varieties of indigenous rice have been lost, varieties that had over hundreds of years adapted to local soil types and climate.  Some years ago, I went to an area in Tangail that I first visited nearly 25 years before, when I had visited the villages and studied the agriculture and peoples' livelihoods. Talking to the local people, especially farmers, 25 years later, was both interesting and depressing.  They said that as there were no more \"birds of prey,\" such as kites, hovering up in the sky, it was clear that the \"food chain\" had broken and that we were heading for some sort of catastrophe. In the old days, they said, the fishes and frogs in the paddy fields would eat the insects and the kites would eat them, mice and rats. There are no fishes in the paddy fields now and there are far, far fewer frogs.  This is all to do, they said, with poisoning the land with fertilizer and insecticide. These farmers may be illiterate, but they are highly knowledgeable experts whose voices fall on deaf ears.  The same illiterate farmers were telling us about \"global warming,\" now called \"climate change.\" 25 years ago, they were saying that the level of the Jamuna River was beginning to rise a few days earlier each year as a result of the earlier melt of the Himalayan snows. Getting better over time Compared to the early 1970s, Bangladesh is much better organized to react to natural disasters. I have been involved in relief and rehabilitation activities related to the floods of 1987, 1988, 1998, and 2007, as well as the cyclones of 1970 and 1991.  Therefore, I have seen how reactions to disasters by government and NGOs have improved considerably. There is still much, much more to do, however, as the effects of \"climate change\" are affecting the seasons, the patterns of rainfall, and therefore food production.  What about other changes? There have been significant and visible improvements in health and education centres run by the government and some of the many NGOs that have sprung up since independence.  However, not nearly enough has been accomplished by successive governments and everything has progressed far too slowly. Communities in remote areas such as the island chars, where I used to work, are ill-served and are lacking in most of the basic services.  Even the big NGOs do not find it cost effective to work in these remote areas and government extension services do not have budgets to move across the difficult terrain. In the 1980s, those of us involved in rural development were very much encouraged with the recommendations of the Land Reform Commission:  That all khas land (government land to which no one has title) should be distributed amongst the landless as quickly as possible, That sharecroppers should have legal protection and a just share of the crop grown on the land they till That the government should fix a daily minimum wage for agricultural labourers Another proposal to fix a ceiling of ten acres per family, would have involved land redistribution, but it failed to pass a later committee stage.  In 1984, two laws were enacted. One set the minimum agricultural wage rate at 3.5 kilos of rice or cash equivalent and the other was that all government land should be released to the landless.  However, after the passing of more than 25 years, it is clear that successive governments do not have the courage or political will to pass further laws to enable that these proposed benefits can reach the very poorest, particularly the extreme poor.  Khas lands mostly remain unregistered and are controlled by mastaans and lathiyals supported mostly by strong local political backing. If governments are really serious about assisting the extreme poor to move above the poverty line, they have to become serious and distribute khas land to the landless on an urgent basis.  The people of Bangladesh have the strength to succeed, but they need the support of a strong and courageous government. A strong and courageous government is also required to reduce the amount of leakage or corruption which affects all development processes.  I remember learning that even during the Rowmari famine of 1974-75, the chairman of a local co-operative association was systematically smuggling priceless food supplies over the border to India.  Sadly, now, a certain amount of leakage is the norm, not the exception. I am told that a PWD Contractor, for instance, normally pays out, for bribes, at least 30% of each contract's value. Therefore, most contractors inflate their tender quotations by at least 30%.  To overcome this, we need a \"sea-change\" in the way work is done. If nothing changes, the culture of corruption will continue.  In recent months, the government ministers led by the prime minister have been clear that corruption will not be tolerated. It is most important to punish those who are corrupt -- no matter who they are.  In this \"Mujib Borsho\" year, it is important to be reminded what Bangabandhu said in his homecoming speech of January 10, 1972. He said: \"I want to say, not a single employee should take bribes. Remember, it was not an opportune moment then (1971), but now, I will not forgive those who take bribes.\"  Another major form of corruption is carried out by rich people avoiding the payment of income tax. Those who avoid paying income tax, including foreigners, are breaking the law and should be strongly and urgently prosecuted. Having a brother and a son, both with severe learning disabilities, I have always been very close to people with disabilities and disability issues. Since 1971, but more so in the last few years, the government and donors are giving this sector much more attention -- never enough, of course -- and many dedicated NGOs are breaking new ground.  This is encouraging and long may it continue. People with disabilities are showing that they can be assets for the country if they are provided with a few opportunities, but there is still so much more to do! What about my dreams for the future of Bangladesh? Having lived through the tumultuous movement to bring back democracy in 1990, like many others, I am bitterly disappointed that the Jatiyo Sangsad has never been able to function properly.  An opposition giving robust constructive criticism is a \"must\" for a fulsome democracy. Successive oppositions of both major political parties have boycotted parliament on account of issues that should have been easily settled.  By not contributing to the work of parliament, the MPs can be accused of cheating the people who elected them.  This state of affairs saddens many citizens very much and I do not know who has the key to unlock this very serious problem, but this problem must be overcome for the sake of the country.  In recent years, the economy has been growing at a very good pace, but only if confrontational politics is overcome, Golden Bangladesh will have a truly golden future. These are a few thoughts as I look back over the years I have known Bangladesh, as well as daring to dream of a more peaceful and prosperous future.  In conclusion, I know how fortunate I have been to live amongst such warm, committed, and passionate people who certainly have the will and strength to succeed, and I am sure that they will.

      "authors": "Anando Mostofa",
      "text": "Kerala's approach has proven less disruptive, less costly, and more effective than any other state in India  The South Indian state of Kerala has been spearheading the country's fight against the novel coronavirus. From innovative schemes like mid-day meals being delivered at homes to South Korea-like isolation testing kiosks, the state has been at the forefront in India's battle to control the Covid-19 spread. Kerala was the first state to record a positive Covid-19 case in India. In January, a medical student returning from China's Wuhan tested positive for the virus. Kerala has been on alert mode since, trying to bring the situation under control. The state soon began implementing mandatory quarantines for visitors arriving from China, weeks before India's central government instituted similar measures across the country. In early March, a BBC News talk show referred to the success of Kerala in containing the first three positive cases of coronavirus and its previous record in dealing with the Nipah and Zika viruses. Kerala currently has 364 cases of coronavirus, making it the eighth most stricken among Indian states. Crucially, however, it has recorded the highest number of recoveries, with 123 people getting better as of Saturday. This impressive track record has also earned world attention. On Friday, The Washington Post credited the robust response of Kerala to the coronavirus pandemic. The Washington Post noted Kerala resorted to \"aggressive testing, intense contact tracing, instituting a longer quarantine, building thousands of shelters for migrant workers stranded by the sudden nationwide shutdown and distributing millions of cooked meals to those in need.\" Could Kerala provide a workable model for the Bangladesh government to follow? Need to speed up testing During the period of the lockdown, anywhere in the world, there is large scale testing. The Washington Post noted Kerala had conducted over 13,000 tests for coronavirus by the first week of April, more than larger states such as Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Kerala was also taking a lead in doing rapid tests and walk-in tests. According to pandemic data site worldometer, in South Asia, Bhutan has tested 1,511 people per million, followed by Pakistan (192 per million), Sri Lanka (211 per million), Nepal (152 per million) and India (137 per million), as of Sunday. Bangladesh tests only 50 people per million. It is clear that the first thing Bangladesh needs to do is to ramp up its rate of testing. Physical distancing, social solidarity Through appropriate and effective early actions, Kerala has successfully slowed the spread of infection in the state, largely by promoting physical distancing and mainly sanitary precautionary measures, and providing better protection for health staff well before the hugely disruptive and draconian lockdown imposed in India in late March.  The state government invited religious leaders, local bodies, and civil society organizations to participate in policy design and implementation, considering its specific socio-economic conditions, including urban slum environments. It has communicated effectively in different languages to educate all, including migrants, and to prevent stigmatization of those infected, even opposing the term \"social distancing,\" which has caste connotations, with \"physical distancing and social solidarity.\" Returning migrants Despite Kerala's long-standing achievements in education, health and science, highly educated Keralans tend to migrate to work out of state, if not abroad, seeking more lucrative employment. The state was still recovering from the devastating floods and Nipah virus epidemic of 2018 when tens of thousands began returning after losing jobs in the Middle East. Kerala is also the destination for a large number of Indian internal migrants. With the nationwide lockdown, non-residents, equivalent to almost 5% of Kerala's population, have returned, causing a surge of new infections, which is very much similar to Bangladesh. Such unusually high movements of people have made the state more vulnerable. Despite some controversy, the state appears to have handled the migrant issue very well. The state health department promptly went into action, setting up a coordination centre on January 26. Recognizing there was no time to lose, the Kerala government set up mechanisms to identify, test, isolate and treat those infected, quickly earning an excellent reputation. Less disruptive, less costly, more effective The Kerala government involved a range of relevant state ministries and agencies to design measures to improve consistency, coordination and communication, and to avoid confusion. At the same time, there were community consultations, including experts, to find the most locally appropriate modes of limiting infections, along with the means to monitor and enforce them. Communities were provided essential epidemiological information to understand the threat and related issues, ensure compliance with prescribed precautionary measures, and avoid panic. Credible leadership The Kerala government has set up 18 committees and holds daily evening meetings to evaluate the situation, issuing media updates about those quarantined, tested, and hospitalized. Kerala's approach has proven less disruptive, less costly, and more effective than any other state in India and even other countries in the world. After recording its first Covid-19 case on January 30, its infection and death rates have been kept relatively low despite much more tracing and testing. Surely, there is a lesson there for the Bangladesh health authorities, if they care to take heed.  "

      "text": "A local fisherman at the docks said, in the last 10-15 days a huge number of ilish were caught from the Bay of Bengal and the Meghna and Tetulia rivers Fishermen have been blessed with an abundance of ilish in Bhola. In the last two weeks they have made catches in the thousands made possible by large numbers of ilish spawning in the estuaries of the Meghna and Tetulia rivers during the second breeding period (January-March), say experts.   This comes as a pleasant surprise to fishermen and wholesale businessmen alike, as sales are booming at wholesale fish markets after a somewhat disappointing season. Aside from the usual fish markets, ilish is now being sold at every street corner of the district. In a visit to the docks, this correspondent found prices to be more affordable with an abundant supply. Wholesale buyers from all across the country including Dhaka, Barisal, and Chandpur were there, buying and packing fish in styrofoam and ice. A local fisherman at the docks said, in the last 10-15 days a huge number of ilish were caught from the Bay of Bengal and the Meghna and Tetulia rivers. Ashraf Ali, president of the largest fish wholesaler association told Dhaka Tribune that both fishermen and businessmen did not profit much during the initial ilish fishing season. But the big catches this winter season have made up for that.   \"The price is also cheap, with ilish weighing 700-900 grams being sold at Tk25,000 per maund. Fish over 1kg are sold at Tk30,000 per maund, while ilish between 450-700 grams is sold at Tk12-20,000 per maund,\" he added. District Fisheries Officer Azaharul Islam said: \"It is a sight to behold, seeing ilish being netted in such quantities. In an effort to build a safe haven for ilish here in Bhola, we are working hard to eradicate illegal fishing.\" Last fiscal year, the ilish market target in the district was 1.3 lakh tons and actual demand was 1.61 lakh tons. This year, the target was set at 1.6 lakh tons, but by December sales exceeded 1 lakh ton, he added. Md Imtiaz Zaman, regional assistant researcher at Eco Fish, an international organization working with ilish, said: \"There was an increase in ilish spawning during the second breeding period and fishermen were able to net a good amount of fish.\" The 22 day ban on ilish fishing has worked successfully and has aided in bigger catches as well, he added."

      "text": "Kalai Ruti is traditionally made in a special earthen pan  The land of Behula, Chapainawabganj, a district of Rajshahi, was once upon a time a vacation destination for the nawabs of Murshidabad and Daudpur Mouja before the British came to India. It is unique from other districts in its ethnicity, dialect, and its organic cuisine.  The streams of the mighty Ganges regularly flood the shores of this riverine land, giving a distinctive character to the land and its people. The fertile land with the hottest of summers and the coldest of winters gave birth to the mouth watering \"Kalai Ruti,\" a thick flat bread made of lentil flour, which is good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner on a busy day. Cooking calling for skill and excellence Kalai Ruti is traditionally made in a special earthen pan and the entire process, from kneading to rolling, needs the skillful hands of a chef to ensure its full potential.  The flat bread is at its best when served with savoury Bhhartas (Mashed Vegetable Preparations) like mashed aubergine, and Chutneys (Mashed Spice Preparations) made from chilli and onions. But always, the ingredient that makes the dish more appetizing is the homemade mustard oil drizzle The most distinctive feature of the bread is that it will keep for 3 or 4 days. It will not dry out, and it won't spoil. Gaining Popularity  It is a century old traditional staple delicacy of Chapainawabganj gaining popularity. Even the United States (US) Ambassador to Bangladesh, Earl Robert Miller, visited Rajshahi and was delighted by the tasty treat. Restaurants around Zero point, Shahebbazar, Uposhohor, Binodpur, Railgate, Ranibazar, Mianpara, and Lakhshmipur have added Kalairuti to their menus, and people of all ages try the dish with chutneys, bhhartas, and spicy meat dishes of duck, beef, or chicken. Shafiul Islam, a medical student of Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital, who came to Rajshahi just to taste the dish, said the moist and juicy texture of the bread and the spicy bhhartas makes him come back to the restaurant every time he is in town. Boosting the Economy People of this largely agricultural region are mostly dependent on seasonal crops, but the regular river erosion, floods, joblessness and inflation, leave the poor  ever poorer. But with the recent popularity of Kalairuti, people in Chapainawabganj who once sold the bread as street food, are now employed in famous restaurants. Now the economy of both Chapainawabganj and Rajshahi are getting a much needed boost from this local delicacy."

      "text": "The bridge was declared risky in 2015 and was closed for vehicular transport use The only bridge connecting Dhaka to Shariatpur's Naria and Bhedarganj upazila has remained inaccessible to vehicles for three years now. The inconvenience in communication has been affecting the everyday life of a few hundred thousand people, as they are forced to take a 15km detour for the lack of a better route. According to Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) sources, the Language Movement martyr Golam Mowla Bridge, was built during 1997-98 to connect Dhaka to Shariatpur's Naria and Bhedarganj upazila. The bridge was declared risky in 2015 and was closed for vehicular transport use. According to LGED's district office, LGED initiated a plan to build a brand new bridge alongside the old one, and at the end of 2017 the contract went to one Navana Constructions with a budget allocation of Tk14.87 crore. The timeframe of the contract ended in 2019 and was renewed further to allow the construction work to continue.  A local businessman Nazrul Islam from Naria bazar said: \"My business took a tumble ever since the bridge was shut down, and I couldn't conveniently transport goods. Besides, I am losing out on customers on the east side of the bridge. If things continue like this my business won't survive for long.\"  Md Haris, a Naria upazila resident, said: \"Vehicles--carrying bricks from the other side of the river to my house for construction--need to take a 15km detour, increasing my costs.\"  Another local Barkat Hossain Murad said: \"It has been three years and the contractor has just two pillars to show for it. It will take decades to complete the bridge with only just three to four workers.\" Engineer Abul Hashem of Navana Constructions claimed the construction works kept being interrupted due to many drawbacks. \"Since we began the work we have been facing problems like land disputes and floods. Also, the new bridge cannot be constructed according to the plans without knocking down the old one. However, the work has picked up pace now. We can hope the bridge will be completed within the allotted time.\" Shariatpur LGED Executive Engineer Shahjahan Farazi acknowledged that the delay in construction increases the suffering of the people of the two upazilas. \"We are taking every possible measure to finish the construction at the earliest possible time.\""

      "text": "450,000 people deprived of treatment Islampur Upazila Health Complex in Jamalpur is currently unable to provide proper healthcare to local residents due to a lack of doctors and equipment. Islampur upazila has a population of 450,000, who are largely poverty stricken and face river erosion and floods regularly, said sources.  According to local residents, 33 doctors, including consultants and junior consultants, are needed to run the health complex and its three sub-centers. However, only 22 such personnel happen to be there at present. There is also a shortage of nurses, wardboys and helping hands. The hospital also lacks modern equipment, which means patients are being deprived of pathological services. On the other hand, there is a fully functional operation theatre with equipment worth crores of taka in the hospital, where complex operations and caesarian operations used to be conducted. Sadly, this operation theatre has been rendered ineffective by a lack of an anesthesiologist and a surgeon.  Masud Mia from Bahadurpur village, who admitted his nine-month old pneumonia-affected son at the hospital and Golap Uddin of Chinaduli village who admitted his eight-year old daughter suffering from cold and cough, confirmed that there was no child specialist in the hospital.  They along with other patients complained about not getting proper treatment in the hospital. Responding to queries, Dr AM Taher, upazila health and family planning officer, said he had only recently joined. He acknowledged the absence of doctors as well as junior consultants for surgeries, anesthesia, gynecology, medicine, pediatrics, cardiology and dental surgery.  A hospital officer, wishing to remain anonymous, said that diagnostic centers had cropped up in abundance near the hospital. Locals complain that the diagnostic centers are driving away new doctors in a bid to earn money in the name of providing good treatment. Dr Gautam Roy, Jamalpur civil surgeon, said: \"There is a shortage of consultants and junior consultants in the whole district. The higher authorities have been informed and hopefully the problem will be solved soon.  \"The local administration has also been informed about the illegal diagnostic centers,\" he added."

      "text": "Agriculture is the bedrock of our economy -- can we protect the sector from Covid-19 and other disasters? If blood is the price of freedom, then the people of this country have gained this freedom by shedding it through the great Liberation War of 1971. The long 23 years of torture and oppression have come to an end.  The economic solvency and democracy of this country has been achieved and the brave children of the time ie the freedom fighters, played a leading role in accomplishing this impossible task. Then Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the architect of independent Bangladesh and the father of the nation, realized that agriculture was the main driving force of a country's economy. That is why he attached the utmost importance to agriculture in order to rebuild a war-torn newly independent country. At a time when the world is in turmoil due to the aggression of Covid-19 and my beloved motherland is not out of it, I am feeling the urge to express my expressions in writing at this juncture of the country.  According to experts, the world has never faced such a crisis since Second World War. Even Bangladesh's economy is under the most pressure in the last ten years. The number of corona attacks is increasing day by day and this number is not comfortable. Our present Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has already given the right steps and timely instructions to address this crisis.  At the same time, he advised all to work with courage to get out of this calamity, which will undoubtedly play a vital role in creating our metal resilience, enthusiasm, and working enforcement in this crisis. Worldwide public life has almost come to a standstill due to the turbulent aggression of Covid-19, many people have become unemployed which is a matter of great concern.  This is likely to lead to severe food shortages worldwide. Bangladesh is no exception. And if there is a food crisis, it is not possible to bring food from outside to feed this huge population, and the global situation seems to be that food will not be available. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of the present agri-friendly government, the minister of agriculture, the secretary, and eminent personalities of the agriculture sector have already taken major initiatives with special emphasis on agricultural production, mechanization, and marketing of agricultural products in the wake of Covid-19 aggression.  Boro paddy is expected to have bumper yields this year as there is no disease and insect infestation across the country. Farmers are waiting to take their boro paddy to homes and harvesting boro paddy has already started in the districts of the haor region and continued till mid-May. The harvesting of paddy in the haor region of the country is started first, and they are very careful and diligent to take this one crop of the year ie boro paddy in the house.  With workers from different parts of the country, they enjoyed the rice harvest in a festive way. At this crucial time of the boro rice harvest this year, the aggression of Covid-19 is threatening to take the paddy home. In other parts of the country, boro paddy harvesting will usually continue to mid-June and it is hoped that by then the corona situation will have eased and people will be able to return to normal life. In the current boro season in the country, boro paddy has been planted in 5 million hectares of land, which is 2% more than the target and boro paddy will produce about 20 million metric tons. About 10% of it has been planted in the districts of the haor region alone, which produces about 1.8 million metric tons of rice. According to the country's flood forecasting center and meteorological department, the Sylhet division is facing short-term flash floods due to heavy rains in Assam and Meghalaya in April, and the whole May is full of different kinds of natural calamities. The current agri-friendly government believes that \"the country will survive if the farmers survive.\" During the global corona epidemic, when there is a shortage of workers, the minister of agriculture, the secretary, and all concerned have come to the side of the farmers and have taken steps to cut the boro rice of the haor with the highest priority.  In accordance with the health rules announced by the government, initiatives have been taken to send workers from other parts of the country and increase the number of harvesters in seven districts of the haor region, namely Kishoreganj, Netrokona, Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Bahmanbaria, Habiganj, and Sylhet. BRRI dhan28, BRRI dhan67, BRRI dhan74, and BRRI dhan88 have already harvested and BRRI hybrid5, BRRI dhan29, BRRI dhan89 are being harvested.  For this work, workers have been taken to Haor from different parts of the country like Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Bogra, Mymensingh, Meherpur and surrounding districts under special arrangements and in the mean time about 90% boro rice of this region harvested. At present there are 362 combine harvesters and 1,056 reapers in operation in the haor area. 160 new combine harvesters and 137 reapers have been allotted on an emergency basis for seven districts of the haor region. In addition, 220 old repairable combine harvesters and 487 reapers have been repaired. BRRI has already sent three combine harvesters to the haor area on the instructions of the director general on its own capacity to finance the Strengthening Farm Machinery Research Project of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) and they are successfully harvesting paddy.   In addition to government initiatives, the non-government organization ACI-supplied combine harvester is assisting farmers in harvesting boro paddy in the haor area. With the official supply of harvesters and reapers for the haor area, the farmers of the area are able to breathe a sigh of relief. At the same time, the announcement of the government to purchase paddy at the rate of Tk26 per kg and rice at the rate of Tk36 per kg directly from the farmers has undoubtedly awakened the pulse of life among the farmers across the country.  The government has allocated Tk9,000 crore for subsidy in the agricultural sector including fertilizers and seeds in the interest of farmers. It has allocated a total of Tk206 crore, including Tk120 crore for agricultural rehabilitation, Tk50 crore for compensation and cooperative based farming for farmers affected by natural calamities and Tk75 crore for setting up demonstrations for expansion of new varieties and technologies in crops.  In this global crisis, these incentives and allocations in the agricultural sector are a landmark step of the present agri-friendly government through which countries will be able to deal with difficult situations like food shortages. As per the directives of the prime minister, in order to ensure that a piece of cultivable land does not remain uncultivated in the country, the production target for the coming aus season has been fixed at over 3.6 million metric tons, which is about 600 thousand tons more than the previous year and accordingly aus target area is 1.3 million hectares.  Distribution of aus paddy seeds among the farmers is continuing under the agricultural incentives by the Ministry of Agriculture. If the plans and targets for aman production by 2020 are adopted in advance, it will be possible to continue production by overcoming the losses of the current boro and the upcoming aus season under the influence of Covid-19.  In order to interrupt the food supply in the country, under the leadership of director general of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, in the coming aus season, seeds of BRRI dhan26, BRRI dhan48, BRRI dhan82, BRRI dhan83, andBRRI dhan85 have been supplied to Rangamati, Khagrachhari, and Bandarban hill districts for jhum and plain land cultivation.   Also, under the direction of the authorities, various divisions and regional offices of BRRI are distributing seeds to the farmers according to the capacity of BRRIin order to increase the cultivation of aus. Under the leadership of the Father of the Nation, the people of Bangladesh brought independence in 1971 by breaking the shackles of subjugation by risking their lives through the war of liberation. Today, on the birth centenary of the Father of the Nation, under the leadership of the worthy daughter of the Father of the Nation, our present Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the people of Bangadesh have once again embarked on a war which can be termed as \"Food War.\"  The number of disasters or epidemics that have hit the world and the amount of loss of life and property caused by it has been far greater than the damage caused by the subsequent crisis. Ignoring the aggression of Covid-19, those who are working to raise paddy in the homes of farmers and provide them with food security are today's brave warriors.  Under their leadership, Bangladesh will win the next food war. Our gratitude and greetings to all those who are dedicated to the tireless efforts of picking up boro paddy in the house of the farmer before the hill slope arrives in advance.  In the history of the world, women started agricultural work. To address the corona situation, our PM has advised us not to keep any cultivable land uncultivated as well as to cultivate vegetables that can be grown in the backyard.  And if women are involved in this activity, they will be able to engage themselves in productive activities at this juncture of the country by fulfilling the nutritional needs of the family. Finally, I would like to recall a quote about the old woman who took out some money from her bag and handed it over to Bangabandhu and requested him to spend it on building a golden Bengal. This small effort of mine, under the leadership of our prime minister and people's leader Sheikh Hasina, is a firm determination to stand by the corona crisis and the next possible food crisis. May Allah protect our country and the people of our country. Amina Khatun is Principal Scientific Office, Rice Farming Systems Division, BRRI, Gazipur."

      "headline": "Illegal land grabbing spree choking Karnaphuli River",
      "authors": "Anwar Hussain, Chittagong",
      "text": "CPA served show cause notice   Different establishments like jetties, shops, canteens, clubs, fertilizer manufacturing companies, power oil plants, and dry docks have sprung up illegally over time on both sides of the Karnaphuli River, in the process choking the river which is known as the lifeline of Chittagong. This can be attributed to the lax attitude of the concerned authorities. An inspection report prepared by the National River Conservation Commission (NRCC) revealed the appalling encroachment scenario of the river. On April 21, 2019, NRCC Chairman Dr Muzibur Rahman Howlader made a visit to the river and found that different organizations were constructing structures encroaching on the riverbanks. The commission's full time member Md Alauddin, members Sharmeen Soneya Murshid, Moniruzzaman and Md Aminul Islam, hydrologist Sazidur Rahman, Chittagong Additional Deputy Commissioner (revenue) Delwar Hossain, and several other officials were present during the inspection. According to the commission's inspection report, construction work was underway for a new jetty adjacent to jetty no 15 of the Chittagong port. The Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) project called 'Patenga Landing Station Construction' was being implemented jointly by Chittagong Dry Dock Ltd and Bangladesh Navy over an area of 40 decimals, which is part of Karnaphuli River as per government land survey. However, no prior permission was obtained for the construction work. The commission also found that the river bank was being filled up by earth and sand which constricted and obstructed the river flow, which is in total violation of the existing rules. The CPA does not have any right to damage or obstruct the natural flow of the river. No agency can undertake any development project and obstruct the free flow of the river without protecting the foreshore the inspection report pointed out. Any jetty expansion project should commence keeping a safe distance from the river foreshore. Asking to stop the work immediately without further delay, the commission requested the district administration to evict all illegal structures from the river. It was revealed that the CPA leased out five acres of land to Incontrade Ltd. It was found that three acres of the land fell within the river boundary, when the illegal structures of the Karnaphuli were identified back in 2015. Currently, Incontrade Ltd has filled up 19 acres of area and an adjacent canal which falls within the river boundary. According to the map, the canal is 46 feet wide, but has now shrunk to 15 feet due to the encroachment. The CPA leased out land adjacent to the Chittagong Airport runway to Smart Trading which is within the river area as per land survey. The commission found that the earth-filling was ongoing in the river. As stated by NRCC's report, seven brick kilns, constructed encroaching on the river foreshore on the south side of the port, were heavily polluting the environment.  The report also mentioned that Karnaphuli Fertilizer Company Ltd and Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Ltd were constructed on the river jetty. Currently, United Power Oil Plant is constructing another jetty which is also obstructing the river flow. During the inspection, members of the commission acknowledged that the way the grabbing spree is going on, Karnaphuli River, known as the gateway of Chittagong port, would soon narrow down. Consequently, the floodplain of the river will not be able to retain additional water during floods. Moreover, the conveyance capacity of the river will sharply fall. The river will fail to combat natural calamities like cyclone, storm and tidal surge as the sea level is rising due to climate change. Furthermore, the navigability of the river will also be at risk, mentioned the inspection report. According to the State Acquisition and Tenancy Act, 1950, river foreshore cannot be leased out and no organization can build structures encroaching or filling up the river. However, river foreshore has been allotted to Karnaphuli Dry Dock Special Economic Zone Ltd, violating the aforementioned act. In its inspection report, the commission observed that no economic endeavours are allowed at the heavy cost of the Karnaphuli River and its water resources. After inspecting the river on December 12, 2018, the commission forwarded a report with a 16-point recommendation to the concerned government agencies in order to save the river. In the report, the river commission requested the district administration to evict all the illegal structures based on the list of the grabbers. The CPA was asked to cooperate with the district administration regarding the eviction drives. However, the commission condemned the lack of action regarding the implementation of the recommendations. Md Alauddin, full time member of the NRCC, told Dhaka Tribune that very little progress has been made with regard to the eviction of the illegal structures from the riverbanks. \"We have made some suggestions and recommendations in the inspection report; however, hardly any step has been taken based on them,\" remarked Alauddin. Replying to a query, Alauddin said that the district is facing fund constraints and manpower shortage, preventing execution of the eviction drives. \"The illegal structures have been built on the land of Chittagong Port. The CPA has leased out the structures to different organizations which is why CPA itself should take the initiative to evict the illegal establishments,\" he said, adding that they would follow up on the matter and ask the CPA again to carry out the evictions. Contacted, Department of Environment Director (Chittagong Metro) Mohammad Nurullah Noori said they have served a show-cause notice to the CPA to attend a hearing on March 10, on charge of damaging the environment by filling up Karnaphuli riverbank. Eminent Karnaphuli researcher Prof Dr Md Edris Ali blamed the lack of coordination among the concerned organizations for stalling the eviction drives. \"There is a serious lack of coordination among the government agencies. The CPA has leased out its land to different organizations without taking permission from the district administration.  Moreover, the river commission should be given more power so that it can take effective steps to conserve the rivers of the country,\" added the researcher."

      "authors": "Mahmuda Mity",
      "text": "Multiple working options for vulnerable communities can be a window of success Bangladesh is frequently cited as one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world due to its geographical location (Ayers 2009). Moreover, the country is highly disaster-prone with frequent incidences of cyclones, tidal surges, floods, riverbank and soil erosions, salinity intrusions and others because of its very flat topography and low land above sea level (Akter 2009). People have learned to adapt to risks over time as disasters have been a regular phenomenon for Bangladesh for a long time. However, the poor with limited capacity to cope with the changing environment suffer most due to frequent exposure to these disasters. In addition to the disaster-prone regions, the community who depends on natural resources are more vulnerable than others. For example, increasing salinity or long-lasting water logging destroys crops and soil fertility causes threat to livelihood and biodiversity.  In the coastal areas of southern Bangladesh, salinity has increased from the last few years and has made the area difficult to grow crops historically irrigated by fresh water. Especially after cyclone Aila, most of the coastal areas were inundated by saline water and local people faced huge losses of their livestock and assets. Like other vulnerable people, Jhorna's family became helpless after losing all their crops and fishes.  Jhorna is a woman who lives in Shyamnagar Upazila, under the district of Satkhira of Khulna Division. She is an example of a successful woman who saved her family from the financial crisis by doing multiple works. Though her family's main occupation was crop farming, she is now raising hens, ducks, goats, and cows in her house. Moreover, she is farming freshwater fish in her pond which was unusable after cyclone Aila. She is also involved with soft crab farming which contributes to a big portion of her family's income. She is also involved with selling seasonal fruits as an additional income source.  According to her (back in Sep 2019), 'Involving with only one income generation activity can make people more vulnerable than others who are involved with multiple works. If one activity becomes hampered during disaster then the rest of the activities can be useful to survive well.' When Jhorna first got married, she was dependent on her husband. She was not allowed to go anywhere without being accompanied by a family member. However, back in 2007, just after cyclone Sidr, she was trained by Practical Action on agriculture cultivation and started growing vegetables in her house. During cyclone Aila, all of Jhorna's families and her neighbour's crops and vegetables died due to excessive saline water. That time Jhorna had to go outside to collect water and relief. Jhorna's family had suffered for over a year since the cyclone Aila had hit, but its aftermath helped her to become an independent woman. As her family couldn't continue the agricultural work due to excessive salinity, her husband had started to work as day labour and she started to attend several training sessions on alternative livelihood practice offered by different NGOs namely Shushilon, Practical Action, Oxfam, Gono Mukhi and others. Because she realized the importance of training sessions from her previous training experience which she gained from Practical Action. Through these training sessions, she learned how to grow rice; fish and vegetables in saline areas; which kinds of beds would be good to; use for planting vegetable; how to plant seeds in beds and sacks; how to make organic fertilizer and pesticide; which fertilizers to use in each season; which crops to harvest; which repellent to use for insects; and how to increase the crop production. She also learned how to keep her poultry healthy by using more nutritious food rather than medicine. Then she started getting involved with multiple income-generating activities by staying at home. Her knowledge acquired from various training had helped her to become capable of successfully growing vegetables and other plants in saline soil. Now her family is also adopting these techniques to produce saline tolerant rice seeds.  Now Jhorna has started to earn more than her husband and has gained decision making power in her household through her economic empowerment. Her husband respects her advice and opinions, he looks up to her and consults with her. Now no one stops her to go anywhere or to do anything. Day by day, her confidence has increased now she not only raises livestock and poultry but for the last one year she has started raising pigeons.  She is a member of the managing committee of a primary school. She learned a lot at different meetings and that is how she increased her self-confidence. Now she can raise her voice without any fear. Everybody listens to her, including government members. That's why she's become more interested in working with the local government. She goes to a monthly meeting at the Village Development Committee where they discuss all the problems of the village, write them down, and hand them over to the chairman or members of the local government. Her father-in-law is now her biggest support. When she has to attend a meeting, her father-in-law helps out with housework. According to her father-in-law, 'My daughter-in-law has gone to work for the good of my family, and if I do not support her a little, she will not be able to improve her life. Although I used to be very angry with her going outside at the beginning, I now understand that she learns a lot from these meetings, that are helping to solve our financial problems'. In the future, she dreams that her three daughters will be highly educated. She believes that none can develop their life without education. She also wants to train her neighbours and wants to start a large poultry farm with hens, ducks and pigeons. Besides, she has a plan to increase her soft crab farming work. Jhorna's Story reiterates the never-ending perseverance and aspirations of our rural women who have used their knowledge gained to become empowered. These independent individuals are contributing to helping their families and communities break free of their vulnerabilities to climate change. However, more training with future adaptation plans can be useful to minimize the vulnerability to both disaster and climate change. Mahmuda Mity is working as a research officer at the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD). Her research interest lies in climate change and adaptation, capacity building, migration and urbanization."

      "text": "The company is also offering up to 300% in cash voucher through lottery Jamuna Electronics and Automobiles Ltd is offering free registration and learner's licence on purchase of its motorcycles at the month-long Dhaka International Trade Fair (DITF). The company at its pavilion is displaying six new Pegasus motorcycles, including the Evo 150r. Sales executives at the pavilion said the company was offering Victory 80CC model at Tk55,470, originally priced Tk70,000, Victory 100CC at Tk58,856 instead of Tk75,000, Fabio 125CC at Tk93,856 instead of Tk1,10,000, Zeus 150CC at Tk1,03,856 instead of Tk1,20,000, and Evo 150r at Tk1,16,856 instead of Tk1,33,000. Jamuna is offering free registration and learner's licence along with the discount, they added. The company is also offering up to 300% in cash voucher through lottery. \"We have five years, or 70,000km engine warranty for our motorcycles, in which we have installed Japanese carburetor. Customers will also get seven free services in two years,\" said Mohammad Rakibul Islam, in-charge of the motorcycle section of Jamuna's pavilion.  Visiting the pavilion yesterday, many customers were browsing through the new motorcycle models. \"This is our local brand. Although I was skeptical initially, I think the quality of the bikes will be good,\" said Habibur Rahman from Jatrabari. Saiful Islam from Baridhara bought a Victory 100CC motorcycle. He also received 50% in cash voucher from the lottery. \"I was excited as I won 50% of the motorcycle amount in cash voucher after purchasing the bike, which already was sold at discount. I used the amount to purchase a new refrigerator,\" he said. Rakibul said such offers were for the DITF only. \"Customer turnout is increasing with each passing day. We sold 11 motorcycles until now. Whether this offer of free registration, learner's licence and 300% cashback will continue after the fair is yet to be decided by the management,\" he added."

      "text": "The rains gave exhausted firefighters a boost in battling some of the blazes, with more relief expected over the weekend as the wet weather is forecast to hit other hotspots Drought-breaking storms dumped desperately needed rain on some bushfire-ravaged parts of eastern Australia on Friday, while giving joy to many farmers who have faced losing precious livestock and crops. The rains gave exhausted firefighters a boost in battling some of the blazes, with more relief expected over the weekend as the wet weather is forecast to hit other hotspots. The unprecedented fires, fuelled by climate change and a years-long drought, have claimed 28 lives over the past five months. They have scorched massive tracts of pristine forests in eastern and southern Australia, decimated livestock on already barren farms and destroyed 2,000 homes. Following extreme hot and dry weather that have fuelled the fires, Friday saw the heaviest rainfalls in nearly a decade in some areas close to hotspots. \"Rain has fallen across most fire grounds over the last 24 hours, which is great news,\" said the Rural Fire Service of New South Wales, the eastern state where many of the worst blazes have raged. \"Our fingers are crossed that this continues over the coming days.\" Crisis not over However the rains have not hit all fires in New South Wales, nor in the state of Victoria to the south, where many of the worst blazes are raging. The rain has also completely missed Kangaroo Island, the nation's third, biggest off the southern coast of the mainland that is famed for its pristine wilderness. Fires have devastated the national park on the island, wiping out much of its koala population and threatening to completely eradicate bird and other endemic marsupial species. Authorities have warned the crisis could worsen again with Australia only halfway through its summer. Celebration Still, the prospect of more wet weather across eastern and southern Australia over the coming days offered further hope. The bushfires and the drought have pushed many farmers in Australia to the brink, and this week's heavy rain gave many rare cause for celebration.  \"What can I say, we are so lucky. Before this, dams were dry, and we were carting water and feeding stock for months,\" Stephanie Stewart, who lives on a farm in northern New South Wales, told AFP. \"This has made life a lot easier on the land, that's for sure. Now hoping it spreads and can ease the burden for so many other amazing farmers who have been and still dealing with this dreaded drought.\" Animal rescues Roughly a billion animals are estimated to have died in the fires nationwide. With huge tracts of their habitats destroyed, environmental groups have warned the blazes could drive many species to extinction. Much attention has focused on Australia's tree-dwelling koalas, with images of the cuddly-looking animals being rescued from wildfires making world headlines. But on Friday morning, some koalas and other native animals at the Australia Reptile Park on the east coast of New South Wales had to be rescued from floodwaters. \"This is incredible, just last week, we were having daily meetings to discuss the imminent threat of bushfires,\" park director Tim Faulkner said. \"Today, we've had the whole team out there, drenched, acting fast to secure the safety of our animals and defend the park from the onslaught of water. \"We haven't seen flooding like this at the park for over 15 years.\" Rain dangers The heavy rain is being seen as a double-edged sword. The water could also make it harder for firefighting trucks to venture deep into forests on muddy tracks, authorities have warned. Flash floods are another concern, with scorched mountains unable to hold the water and potentially sending torrents of muddy ash into waterways. Such torrents have already led to huge numbers of fish dying in rivers that were poisoned by the muddy ash, local media have reported."

      "text": "The pandemic and measures some countries took to secure domestic supplies have inhibited normal trade and supplies, and caused some major price fluctuations The global coronavirus pandemic threatens to cause a huge shock to international food trade and trigger a new food crisis, a top agriculture official in China said on Monday. The comments came as coronavirus outbreaks roiled global agriculture supply chains and upended trade, and after some countries restricted exports of main grains and increased procurement for reserves. \"The fast spreading global epidemic has brought huge uncertainty on international agriculture trade and markets,\" said Yu Kangzhen, China's deputy agriculture minister. \"If the epidemic continues to spread and escalate, the impact on international food trade and production will definitely worsen, and might trigger a new round of food crisis,\" Yu said during a video conference on the country's agriculture outlook. The pandemic and measures some countries took to secure domestic supplies have inhibited normal trade and supplies, and caused some major price fluctuations, Yu added. The coronavirus pandemic, which started in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has infected 2.3 million people and killed 159,000 people worldwide. Strict lockdowns and quarantines to control the coronavirus outbreaks have disrupted China's supply chains and made it difficult for many industries to find enough workers, delayed poultry and pig production in the world's top meats market. Though China has sufficient grains to meet domestic demand, some other import-reliant farm products like soybeans and edible oils may be impacted by the global pandemic, Yu said.  China's exports of aquaculture, vegetables, and tea will be affected due to the disease, Yu added. Speaking at the same conference, Agriculture Minister Han Changfu ruled out a food crisis in China, saying it had the confidence and ability to secure supplies of grain and other major agricultural products. While the pace of domestic virus transmissions has slowed, China is focusing on infections from overseas arrivals as it guards against a major resurgence and monitors the spread in northeastern Heilongjiang province. \"The risk of imported coronavirus is still huge and will put considerable pressure on livestock production,\" Yu said. China is also fighting with the deadly African swine fever, which has slashed its pig herd by at least 40% and is still spreading. The country has reported 13 new cases of African swine fever since March. \"African swine fever risks have significantly increased, as pig production recovery accelerates and more piglets and breeders get transported,\" Yu said. China's farmers, lured by good profits and a series of government policies, have sped up efforts to rebuild pig herd. Pests, drought and floods also present harsher threats than usual to output this year, Yu added."

      "authors": "Thomson Reuters Foundation",
      "text": "East Asia, Iran and European countries have been the worst hit so far, but the map showed a small number of cases in about 20 African states, and more across Central and Latin America Governments and health systems in wealthy nations are struggling to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, suggesting the poorest countries may be hit far harder if the virus gains a foothold there, a top UN official warned. Mami Mizutori, head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), said even in developed countries, health services were under stress and did not have enough equipment to treat people in need as the numbers infected rose rapidly. \"It is easily imaginable that if this becomes the case in a country where the health system is not as sophisticated, then that could lead to possibly higher mortality,\" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Geneva. A coronavirus tracker map from John Hopkins University showed there were more than 150,000 confirmed cases worldwide on Saturday, with the death toll topping 5,600. East Asia, Iran and European countries have been the worst hit so far, but the map showed a small number of cases in about 20 African states, and more across Central and Latin America. Even in wealthy parts of the world like Europe and the United States, the virus has exposed how risk affects everyone differently depending on their economic status, Mizutori noted. People living in poverty and lacking health insurance or secure employment cannot afford to be sick or miss work, she said, pointing to the virus as an \"equity issue.\" \"We need to really make sure that the vulnerable people are protected,\" she added. Large numbers of office workers have been told or have opted to work from home but this is not an option for many people. \"The day that you can't go to work may be the day you stop getting food for yourself and your family,\" she said. If coronavirus expanded in poor countries, the economic impact on individuals would likely be greater as economic losses would be a bigger share of gross domestic product, she added.  Crash course The slower spread of the virus to Africa, however, may have bought the continent valuable time to take preventive measures. Some African countries, like Rwanda and Uganda, are implementing strict controls at airports as well as simple hygiene practices such as setting up public sinks to wash hands. \"Hopefully the lessons that are rapidly being learned in other countries where it has happened earlier will prevent that this becomes a serious situation in less-developed countries,\" Mizutori said. Malka Older, an affiliated researcher at the Sciences Po Center for the Sociology of Organizations, said there was an element of \"elite panic\" to the pandemic as leaders, politicians and top sports personalities contracted the virus. \"Part of the reason we have been seeing so much global attention ... to this is that it affects the rich too - more than quite a lot of disasters do,\" she said. Mizutori urged all states to invest more in their health services, including medical staff and data collection, to boost resilience to health threats, as they agreed five years ago. In 2015, after epidemics like Ebola, MERS and bird flu, most governments signed up to a disaster prevention roadmap, called the Sendai Framework, which gave higher priority to health threats alongside natural risks like earthquakes and floods. But they have yet to implement the joined-up measures needed to head off serious outbreaks like coronavirus, Mizutori said. \"We haven't done enough and this is a very clear wake-up call to everyone globally,\" she said."

      "authors": "Tribune Desk",
      "text": "18 families were shocked when they noticed drinking water from the taps tasted like alcohol In a bizarre incident in the southern Indian state of Kerala, taps in a residential building in its Thrissur district started to pour foul-smelling mixture of alcohol and water. According to The News Minute, 18 families were shocked when they noticed drinking water from the taps tasted like alcohol. The incident that took place in Solomon's Avenue Flat in Chalakkudy, Thrissur, last week, was traced back to excise department's callous destruction of seized illegal alcohol bottles, Manorama Online reported. According to the report, excise department officials seized around 6,000 litres of alcohol from a shop in the vicinity of the residential building.  The court had then ordered destruction of the illegal alcohol bottles following which the excise officials disposed the liquor by digging a pit on the bar premises and emptying bottles one after another. In the bizarre turn of events, the alcohol slowly seeped into the soil and \"mixed\" with the apartment's open well located next to the dug up pit. The alcohol mixed water was pumped to tanks of the residential building, leading to the shocking outcome.  Apartment complex owner Joshy Maliyekkal says he noticed the alcohol smell when he switched on a motor to fill a water tank outside his home. \"All of a sudden, the pipe started to smell very bad,\" he told the New Indian Express. \"We were suspicious as to why such a smell was coming from the water drawn from an open well.\" He said locals have been using the well for years and have never had a problem. Deputy Excise Commissioner TK Sanu has been quoted as saying: \"These bottles had been seized from bars whose licenses had been cancelled six years ago. We couldn't have known that our operation would raise such a stink.\" The Manorama report also noted how officials found themselves \"in a spot\" and were \"struggling to come up with an escape route\" after a probe was initiated on the issue. Chalakudy municipality ward councillor VJ Joji has been quoted saying that alternative water-supply arrangements have been made for the affected families. \"These families had been using water from the contaminated well for several years. It was their only water source.\""

      "headline": "Monster Pacific cyclone Harold batters Fiji",
      "authors": "AFP",
      "text": "Images on social media showed extensive damage at Nausori, just outside Suva, with corrugated iron roofs peeled back by the ferocious winds A deadly Pacific storm slammed into Fiji on Wednesday, tearing off roofs and flooding towns, after leaving a trail of destruction in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Tropical Cyclone Harold weakened slightly overnight from a scale-topping Category Five to a Four, but was still lashing Fiji with winds of up to 240 kilometres per hour, forecasters said. The official NaDraki weather service said the cyclone was offshore south of Fiji's main island Viti Levu, but passing closer to land than initially expected. Despite the downgrade, it said Harold remained \"extremely dangerous\" and advised residents in the island's south to shelter in churches, schools or other substantial buildings. Images on social media showed extensive damage at Nausori, just outside Suva, with corrugated iron roofs peeled back by the ferocious winds. The main street of Ba, in the island's north, was submerged after the local river burst its banks. The National Disaster Management Office said residents along much of the south coast, home to many of the country's major tourist resorts, should evacuate. \"We are expecting a significant storm surge to be very dangerous for those living in coastal areas, we urge you to move to higher ground,\" it said. NDMO director Vasiti Soko said evacuation centres had been set up and officials were attempting to maintain social distancing to ensure Covid-19 did not spread among those fleeing the cyclone. Fiji has 15 cases of the coronavirus, with all known sufferers in quarantine before the cyclone hit. Town 'obliterated'  Harold claimed 27 lives in the Solomon Islands last week, and on Tuesday tore through Vanuatu, destroying much of the country's second-largest town Luganville.  World Vision's Vanuatu director Kendra Gates Derousseau said an aerial survey carried out by disaster officials late Tuesday showed the town of Melsisi on Pentecost island had also been devastated. \"We've done some programming there in the past, so I can recognize the landmarks -- you can see that 90% of all buildings are obliterated, is the term I'd use,\" she told AFP. A massive international aid effort was launched after the last Category Five storm to hit Vanuatu, Cyclone Pam in 2015, flattened the capital Port Vila. But Vanuatu's international borders are currently closed as the impoverished Pacific nation bids to remain one of the world's few places with no confirmed Covid-19 cases. The government has revoked a domestic travel ban imposed as part of its virus response, which will allow disaster relief to flow from Port Vila to the worst-hit islands in the north. New Zealand said it had deployed a P-3 Orion aircraft to help with damage assessments and allocated US$300,000 in aid funding for essential supplies. Foreign Minister Winston Peters said Wellington would provide further assistance if requested by Vanuatu. \"We are aware that the Government of Vanuatu is running a 'keep it out' strategy, and we will give serious consideration to ensure that any response to the Cyclone does not lead to the spread of Covid-19 to Vanuatu,\" he said. The cyclone formed off the Solomons last week, where it washed dozens of passengers from an inter-island ferry into the sea. It was initially expected to only reach Category Three. Latest forecasts say it will brush past Tonga early Thursday, still at Category Four strength, before petering out over the sea by the weekend."

Hindu couple, Anju and Ashokan, tied the knot amidst the crowded premises of Cheravally Muslim Jamath Mosque on Sunday, reports Times of India. The marriage took place according to Hindu tradition and practices, and was solemnised by a Hindu priest. According to the report, the bride's mother had been struggling financially since the death of her husband two years ago. While she struggled to save money for Anju's wedding, her neighbor who is a Jamaath secretary, suggested she approach the Jamaath committee.  She did exactly that and found that Jammath committee was willing to help. Apart from hosting the wedding, the mosque committee also served a vegetarian 'sadya' to around 1,000 guests, added The Hindu. Members of both the Hindu and Muslim communities turned out in large numbers to witness the marriage."

      "text": "Thousands of Rohingyas living in the border areas of Bangladesh face mortal peril as the monsoon weather gets worse Jamila Khatun's face reflected the gloom of the overcast sky when she looked outside her window on Wednesday, checking for any sign of the heavy, grey clouds breaking away.The rickety shack she now calls home is already flooded with rainwater from the previous day, just as the other shanties erected on the no man's land on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border in the Bandarban district - currently home to more than 5,000 Rohingya refugees.\"The flash flood washed my mud stove away yesterday [Tuesday],\" the mother of four told the Dhaka Tribune.She showed her small ration of rice, lentils and vegetables that she was no longer able to cook. \"The last time I cooked was yesterday [Tuesday] afternoon. My children and husband had dinner last night with the leftovers from lunch. We have not eaten anything since morning,\" she added, worried about how she was going provide her family with the next meal.The no man's land, where Jamila's family and other Rohingyas are currently residing, lies on the international border between the Konarpara area of Bandarban's Naikkhyangchhari upazila in Bangladesh, and the Tambru area of the northern part of Rakhine state in Myanmar.The 5,000 Rohingyas took refuge in the hilly area in August last year, when the Myanmar security forces launched a brutal crackdown in the Rakhine state - home to Rohingya Muslims - in retaliation of an attack on Myanmar border police by Rohingya insurgents earlier that month.Bangladesh has been experiencing a heavy bout of monsoon rain for the last few days. The flash flood down the hills in the area, caused by the rain, has inundated the makeshift refugee camp on the no man's land.\"This time, the flood is worse than what we experienced in the past,\" said Dil Mohammad, a Rohingya refugee leader in the area. \"We cannot cook our food. Our children have been starving since this [Wednesday] morning.\" Jamila Khatun's shack has been destroyed by the flash flood coming down the hills in Bandarban on Tuesday, July 24, 2018 | Tarek Mahmud  Also Read - 25,000 Rohingyas at risk of mudslides during monsoon The Rohingyas are now worried about waterborne diseases and snakes, not to mention landslides, he added.The situation is much worse in Cox's Bazar, where over a million refugees are living cramped up inside the camps in the district's Ukhiya and Teknaf upazilas.  \"A number of shanties are damaged by rain, floods, and landslides every day,\" said Mohammad Amin, resident of D5 block in Ukhiya's Kutupalong refugee camp. \"The flash floods and landslides happened so suddenly, we had no time to move away. Our camp is waterlogged now.\"The condition of the refugees living camps deeper in the is terrible as they are in dire need of food, drinking water and medicines, said Abdul Mannan, who lives in the Balukhali camp in Ukhiya.More than 500 incidents of landslides, flood, storms and water-logging, lightening and other monsoon calamities were reported from May 11 to date that affected about 50,000 Rohingya refugees, according to the Inter-Sector Coordination Group, that is coordinating the aid activities in Cox's Bazar.Speaking to the Dhaka Tribune, the government's Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Md Abul Kalam said: \"We have already relocated about 35,000 camp-living Rohingyas who are at high risk of landslides and flood to safer places. We also have plans to evacuate others who may face any kind of disasters.\"In its weather forecast yesterday, Bangladesh Meteorological Department said light to moderate rain with temporary gusty wind was likely to occur in most places in the Chittagong division in the next few days, while heavy rainfall was likely to occur across the country.The aid agencies working in the refugee camps said winds and heavy rains pound the fragile landscape sheltering the refugees, triggering landslides and floods, and more emergency response was needed to tackle the situation.The Cox's Bazar district administration said supports and aids were being distributed to the affected people of landslides and flash floods."

      "text": "\nAs floods rise in Bangladesh, crab farming helps families tread water\n\n\n\n\nRifat Islam Esha\n\n\n\n\n Published at 03:39 pm March 18th, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nKishore Mondol, a farmer in the low-lying deltas of southern Bangladesh, points at the four-foot-high platform of grey clay he and his wife have just struggled to build.\nThe mound is intended to keep their next home above ever-rising floodwaters. But even it won't last long, he fears.\n\"Within the next 10 years, monsoon high tides will be flowing over this level,\" he predicts.\nWith tidal floods fast worsening as a result of more intense rainfall and sea level rise, \"this is the third time within 20 years we are moving our home higher,\" complained Mondol, whose village lies in Khulna district, at the head of southwestern Bangladesh's Sundarbans tidal forests.\nSea level rise and worsening storm surges are making life increasingly precarious in southern Bangladesh's low-lying deltas, flooding homes and filling fields with salty water that keeps rice from growing.\nMany former farmers have switched to raising tiger shrimp - now Bangladesh's second biggest export after garments - in shallow ponds. But even the shrimp are now dying in many areas, hit by viral infections, local people say.\nInstead, as waters continue to rise, women in the region have hit on a new, tough and flood-friendly harvest: mud crabs.\nMore floods, less rice\nIn a village where most land lies 10 feet or less above sea level, and is flanked by major rivers on either side, flooding is an ever worsening worry for residents of Joymoni.\nWhen this year's monsoon arrives, \"we fear water may come as high as 3 feet, especially during the full moon, as our side of the village has no protective embankment since Cyclones Sidr washed it away\" in 2007, Tripti Mondol, Kishore's wife, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nAlready, \"salt is seeping into the very heart of our soil,\" she said.\nSubrat Chandra Gayen, 50, another resident of Joymoni, said nearly 80% of families have had to give up on rice farming, which once provided food and an income for most people in the area, including women who sowed, harvested and threshed it.\nThe loss of income has driven some farmers - particularly men - to migrate and look for work in cities, while many families raising shrimp have fallen into debt after taking high-interest loans from shrimp traders that they are now unable to pay back, local people say.\nThe Bangladesh government predicts rising sea level could displace about 20 million people from Bangladesh's coastal districts by 2050.\nCrabs, however, may help solve a big share of the problems, the village's women say.\nCrabs for export\nKhadija Begum, 43, now does a brisk business buying and releasing batches of baby mangrove mud crabs into a shallow pond she has rented for $48 a year from a local land owner now living in Dhaka, the capital.\nThe tiny crabs, their shells still soft, are caught in local creeks by fishermen. She feeds them small amounts of waste fish once a day, she said, and within two weeks they are six times their original weight and have developed hard brown shells.\nBegum catches them, ties their legs with jute string or straw and packs them carefully into large bamboo baskets, which she sends her husband to sell at the Buddhamari local market, 2 km away.\nFrom there they are transported to Dhaka and flown live to major importers China, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and Hong Kong, she said.\nFish traders grade the catch, with crabs with claws broken worth less, but those with a clump of bright orange-yellow eggs on their bellies - a delicacy for which South East Asians are willing to pay more - worth up to $26 a kilogram.\nBegum and her husband's earnings from crab sales now add up to between $780 and $840 a year, she said. The money has helped them send their eldest son to college in Khulna - a source of huge pride.\nBangladesh's fisheries department, working with non-profit organizations, has been encouraging farmers with salt-tainted fields to take up crab farming since 2011, with poor women a particular target for help.\nUnlike shrimp farming, crabs can be raised in small ponds and demand less up-front investment, said Muhammod Zulfikar Ali, mayor of Mongla Port municipality.\nReturn are also quick and, at the moment, higher than for shrimp and with lower disease risk, he said.\nCrab farming's growing momentum is reflected in Bangladesh's export figures. According to the government's Export Promotion Bureau, crab exports have climbed from $7 million in 2011 to more than $23 million in 2016.\n20% of the country's current harvest is coming from back-yard pond farmers in the country's coastal Satkhira, Bagerhat and Cox's Bazar districts, according to government data.\nTo further boost the industry, the government fisheries department is now trying to establish crab hatcheries. Currently most young crabs are caught in the wild, and catches have been falling with growing demand.\nWhat is the solution long-term?\nSome experts, however, warn that crab farming may not be enough to sustain families in increasingly risk-prone southern Bangladesh.\n\"Although crabs farms can be a lifeline against climate impacts they will only aggravate this unsustainable high-salinity\" situation, said Pavel Partha, a researcher with the Bangladesh Resource Centre for Indigenous Knowledge (BARCIK).\nCoastal villages, for instance, are running out of water they can drink. Many now have to buy potable water for nine months a year, from October to June, they say. Buying about 5 litres a day per person costs Mondol's family about $3 a month.\nHarjeet Singh, the global lead on climate change for charity ActionAid, said local peoples' ability to adapt to the changing conditions was limited.\n\"This place is going to vanish in the next 20 years, the way the sea is rising,\" he said, while visiting Joymoni. \"Unsafe migration or crab farming are people's own efforts, what we call autonomous adaptation, but it can only provide limited relief.\"\nGovernment loans, to help communities scale-up adaptation efforts that work, could help, he said. But \"there is a limit to how much [people] can raise their houses.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Many refugees live under constant threat of landslides, flash floods in the camps Flash floods and standing water, triggered by water running down the hillsides after heavy rains have damaged makeshift shelters, infrastructure, stored food and other establishments in the Cox's Bazar Rohingya camps since the beginning of the monsoon. An Oxfam survey of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh found that more than half of them were unprepared to face the calamities that come with the monsoon. \"The monsoon rains are causing flooding, landslides, and disease outbreaks in the Rohingya refugee camps,\" said Oxfam's Humanitarian Program Coordinator in Bangladesh, Gabriela Luz-Meillet. \"Hundreds of thousands of people are living in temporary shelters, on hills of compacted mud which are completely shorn of protective trees and plants. Those hills could melt into the earth. There are refugees alive today who will not make it through to the end of the rainy season.\" Kutupalang D5 camp dweller Mohammad Reaz told the Dhaka Tribune that they become anxious whenever it rains. \"Every day, a number of shelters are damaged by rain, flash floods, and landslides,\" he said.  \"But water logging causes more suffering in the camps,\" added Mohammad Arafat, another refugee at the Balukhali camp. The Bangladesh Water Development Board's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre recorded 116mm rainfall in Cox's Bazar during the last 24 hours. It has forecast 945.60mm rainfall in the district this month.  The worst affected by the monsoon are the 4,000 or so Rohingya stranded at no man's land of Tambru and Konarpara under Naikhongchhari's Ghumdum union.  Rohingya leader Dil Mohammad said flash floods over the last two days had damaged their food. \"We are facing scarcity of drinking water, medicines, food and other necessities,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune.  'Untenable, inhuman situation' The latest spate of torrential rain that started on Tuesday morning damaged more than a hundred shelters in Kutupalang camp, the refugees said. Lalu Majhi, the designated Rohingya leader of a particular camp area of Balukhali, said many shelters had been set up on the hill slopes. The local administration evacuated more than 200 families from the risky hillsides but many families are still residing in areas at risk for landslides and floods. He said they had received reports over the last two days, of minor landslides in the camp area. Similar reports have come in over the last two days from Tanjimarghona, Balukhali-2, Moynarghona, Shafiullahkata, and Lombashia in the camp area. Many of the affected families are now living under the open sky.  Cox's Bazar district administration said the Rohingya population affected by landslides and flash floods is getting support and aid. International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies expert, Steve McAndrew, after finishing a four-month assignment as head of emergency operations for IFRC in Bangladesh, said the monsoon rains are already causing chaos in the makeshift camps. \"Each year [with IFRC] I see more need, but this last operation in Cox's Bazar was to me some of the worst conditions I've ever seen in my career. One of the things that's lacking here is hope - there's no end in sight, there's no light at the end of the tunnel for the people we're serving,\" he said. \"We're letting them know that we're listening, and we are spreading the word so that the world knows this situation is difficult, untenable and inhuman,\" McAndrew added."

A fax message forwarded by the Bangladesh High Commission in Delhi to the Foreign Affairs and Water Resources ministries on Wednesday contained the ominous warning, reports UNB. China recently alerted India that it would release excess water into the Brahmaputra River following heavy rainfall on the upper course of the river, known as Tsangpo, located in Tibet, read the fax. The message also said reports indicated that the water level in the Tsangpo River has now reached the highest mark in 50 years, forcing local authorities to discharge excess water into the Brahmaputra River. Also Read- Flood alert as 'unprecedented' volume of water flows down Brahmaputra  Diplomatic sources said India has informed the officials concerned in Bangladesh of the matter. The Indian government is on high alert as well, as the river also runs through Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. According to reports from our Sylhet correspondent Md Sirajul Islam, the chief engineer of the Sylhet Water Development Board said Bangladesh has been alerted about the release of excess water by China, which may have a possible impact on Bangladesh. According to the message forwarded by Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, there are fears that the release of the excess water by China may cause floods downstream of the Brahmaputra. Sirajul Islam added that he had received a message from the ministry saying that Sylhet would not be affected by the possible swellingof the Brahmaputra, as the region is situated in the Meghna basin."

Most rivers of the Surma-Kushiara basin were above the danger level at 9am on Saturday, according to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of the Bangladesh Water Development Board. \"The Sylhet division of Bangladesh is experiencing floods due to the heavy rainfall in Assam and Meghalaya for the last few days,\" said FFWC Executive Engineer, Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan. \"It is normal in the monsoon season,\" he added. The flood waters will recede in the next 48 hours, if the rainfall subsides upstream, Arifuzzaman said. According to the FFWC flood bulletin, the Khoai, Monu, and Kushiyara rivers are at 205cm, 33cm, and 14cm above the danger level.  The water level of the rivers in the Brahmaputra basin is also rising since retaining flood waters coming down from Assam. June is considered the beginning of monsoon. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is normal during this time across the whole river catchment in Bangladesh, originating in Northern India. With heavy rains in the upper catchment of the trans-boundary rivers, water levels might rise more in the next few days, the FFWC official said. According to the Indian Meteorological Department, the Assam and Meghalaya regions might experience heavy rainfall till tomorrow. Places upstream of Bangladesh's north-eastern border have recorded heavy rainfall. Sohra, for example, recorded 211.5mm of rainfall, Silchar 114.6mm, Majbat 121.4mm, Kherunighat 145.8mm, and Lumding 89.4mm.  The Bangladesh Meteorological Department recorded 109mm of rainfall in Sylhet's Kanaighat, and 60mm in Sunamganj on Saturday."

Shariatpur Our correspondent reports that Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya said the government has taken all measures for people who have been affected badly by the Padma River erosion in Naria upazila of Shariatpur recently. The minister made the announcement when visiting Kedarpur, Mulfotganj, and the Bashkhali area on Tuesday morning. The minister announced the allocation of 500 bundles of tin sheets, Tk1.5 crore in cash, and 4,000 packets of dry foods as relief.

MP Col Shawkat Ali (retd.), MP BM Mozammel Haque, AL leader Enamul Haque Shamim, Advocate Sultan Mahmud, UNO Sanjida Yasmin and Mayor Shadidul Islam Babu were present, among others, during the visit. With the continuing erosion of the Padma River at different points, some 100 families have been rendered homeless in Naria upazila since Friday last. Including the latest, some 6,000 families under three unions of the upazila have been rendered homeless due to the scourge of riverbank erosion in the last three months. Besides, several thousand acres of croplands have been devoured by the river as the erosion has taken a serious turn in the upazila. A big portion of Naria Upazila Health Complex and a mosque adjacent to the hospital also washed away. At least 12 hospital buildings are at risk of being washed away at any time, said locals. In the last month, the river has devoured several multi-storey buildings, a mosque, 2,000 business centres, 300 shops, and other establishments located on the riverbank. A 1.5km area, from Naria Banshtola to Purba Naria, was washed away by the river. Locals are expecting some respite in the current spate of erosion of the Padma River in the upazila due to rising waters and slow currents, in the river, but they also feared that if the river water starts to recede then the erosion may take a serious turn again. Jamalpur Our correspondent reports that low lying areas of eight unions in Islampur and Dewanganj upazila of the district have been inundated by flood waters for the last 24 hours. Flood situation in Jamalpur hampers daily life |Dhaka Tribune Water Development Board (WDB) officials said though the Jamuna River water level dropped by 1 cm during the last 24 hours as of 12 noon on Tuesday, it was still 4 cm above the red mark at Bahadurabad ghat point.

Bagerhat Dhaka-Pirojpur Highway in Bagerhat totally washed away on Tuesday evening as the erosion of the Madhumati River has taken a serious turn in Chitalmari upazila. Locals said thousands of acres of land, homesteads, and several business establishments and shops in the upazila have gone under. Lal Mian, a trader of the upazila said, \"We have already lost many business establishments and villages to the river and if the present situation continues, we will become paupers.\" Local people have demanded the authorities take immediate action. Gaibandha Overall flood situation in the char and river basin areas of the Brahmaputra and Teesta rivers in the district worsened further as the river rose more in the last 24 hours till Tuesday morning, reports our correspondent.

Standing crops on 350 hectares of land went under in the Kanchipara, Kayarhat, Kholaihara, Mashamari and Uria areas. WDB engineer, AKM Monayem Hossain, said they had already started to repair the embankment. \"It is difficult to do the work as there are rivers all around the embankments in char areas,\" he added.

      "text": "Monsoon begins doing its worst to the refugees in the cramped makeshift camps in Ukhiya upazila and Tambru no man's land Heavy rains and squally weather have started battering the Rohingya refugees living in makeshift camps in the Cox's Bazar's Ukhiya upazila and no man's land between Bangladesh's Konarpara and Myanmar's Tambru border points. A Rohingya minor boy was killed and his mother injured after a mud wall of their hut collapsed on them during a storm at the Kutupalong refugee camp in Ukhiya on Monday morning. The boy was identified as three-year-old Faruk, son of Abdur Shukkur and Sokhina Khatun, according to sources from the camp and Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Md Nikaruzzaman Chowdhury. The child died on the spot while Sokhina survived with injuries after the wall of their hut at the Block H of Camp No 7's Hill No E3 collapsed during heavy rain, Nikaruzzaman said. Faruk's body was kept at a camp hospital and Sokhina was admitted to Ukhiya Upazila Health Complex. Since Saturday, the first monsoon rains had started hitting the Cox's Bazar camps housing over one million Rohingya refugees, triggering flash-floods and landslides and destroying the makeshift shelters. Apart from the three-year-old boy's death, there were, however, no reports of any major casualties. Aid agencies have been warning that the monsoon season could prompt a humanitarian catastrophe in coming months at what is the world's biggest refugee camp, sheltering people that have fled violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state over the years. Waterlogging, due to landslides, has proved to be a curse at the Balukhali Rohingya camp too, adding to the refugees' woe. Also Read- First monsoon rains pound Rohingya camps UNO Nikaruzzaman confirmed that the squally weather and landslides were responsible for the destruction of more than 50 shelters at the D-4 and D-7 blocks at the Kutupalong camp.  Other than the death on Monday morning,  only one person was injured in one of the incidents so far, he said. Refugee leader Abul Kashem said, apart from the landslides, several areas of the camp were inundated following heavy rain in the past two days. Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission officials said that more than 600 shelters were destroyed in the past three weeks following heavy downpour and landslides. UN refugee agency spokesperson Caroline Gluck on Sunday told AFP that so far nearly 29,000 refugees had been relocated to new areas out of an estimated 200,000 people at very high risk of landslides and flood, who need to be moved to safer areas. Meanwhile, the Rohingya refugees' camp in the no man's land between Bangladesh's Konarpara and Myanmar's Tambru was inundated after flash-floods on Sunday. Rohingya leaders Dil Mohammad told the Dhaka Tribune that many of their shelters at the camp were submerged after Tambru Canal's water level rose following heavy rain and flash-floods since morning. The refuges were immensely suffering after losing their habitats and forced to take shelter on the hills in the no man's land, he said, adding that many Rohingyas had also taken shelter in Bangladesh territory. Another refugee leader Md Arif said the Border Guard Bangladesh personnel were helping the Rohingyas to cross over and find shelters. \"But we are worried as we will have to build the roofs over our heads again from scratch. We are also worried about food and medicines for the ailing ones,\" he added. Over 5,000 Rohingya people had taken shelter in Tambru's no man's land, near Ghumdum border area under Bandarban's Naikhongchhari upazila, since August 25 last year, when ethnic conflicts in Rakhine sparked the most rapid human exodus seen since the Rwandan genocide in 1994. Since then, more than 700,000 Rohingyas crossed into Bangladesh fleeing brutal persecution by Myanmar's security forces, joining more than 400,000 others who were already living in cramped makeshift camps in Cox's Bazar."

Last year, around 22 districts were affected by floods, but there are concerns that this year's floods will surpass even the serious flooding of last year, when the affected districts went underwater for months.\nThe Meteorological Office has warned that there is a possibility of flooding in 37 of the 64 districts, caused by incessant heavy rainfall during the monsoon season.\nAs part of the preparation, Relief and Disaster Management Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya and Secretary of the ministry Shah Kamal, held a series of meetings with various organizations and officials concerned, in the past few days.\nRepresentatives from Bangladesh Army and Navy were also present in those discussions.\nOn Tuesday, in one such meeting organized by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, the army and the navy were directed to be prepared for tackling any possible natural disasters, including floods.\nConfirming the matter to the correspondent, Secretary of the ministry concerned revealed that emergency messages were also sent to the deputy commissioners of the 64 districts.\nSpeaking to the correspondent, Mofazzal Hossain said: \"The government has distributed 200,000 tons of rice, Tk5 lakh in cash, blankets and two bundles of corrugated tin sheets in district relief funds across the country.\"\n\"A control centre has also been established at the Department of Disaster Management.\"\nThe minister added that officials concerned have been instructed to keep school, college and madrasa buildings across the country in top shape, so that people can use them as shelter during natural disasters.\nWhen it rains, it pours\nBangladesh is witnessing incessant heavy rainfall even as the monsoon season is yet to come. The Met Office forecasts torrential rainfall in some parts of Bangladesh from May 4 to 7.\nLandslides are also a serious threat to public safety during the monsoon season. A series of landslides claimed 166 lives in the hill tract regions of Bangladesh last year.\nMeetings were held from April 22 to 26 in Cox's Bazar, Chattogram, Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari to chalk up emergency response during the times of crisis.\n\n\nTerming the amount of recently recorded rainfall alarming, the ministry concerned has warned the deputy commissioners across the country.\nFarmers of flood-prone regions have been instructed to harvest their crops on an emergency basis, to save them from possible flood.\nLocal deputy commissioners have arranged for public service announcements to raise awareness on this issue.\nSources from the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, quoting DC offices from wetland districts, confirmed that 88% crops have already been harvested from these regions. The farmers also witnessed a bumper harvest this year.\nHail and thunderstorms\nThe people are also at serious risk of death and injury caused by hailstorms and lightning strikes.\nSources from the ministry concerned stated that frequency of hailstorms and the average size of hailstones are getting larger. There are also reported incidents of hail penetrating tin roofs of homes and injuring the residents inside.\nIn 2015, the Bangladesh government declared lightning strikes a natural disaster. The ministry believes that a significant reduction of tall trees, such as palm and coconut trees, are contributing to increasing deaths by lightning strikes.\nAccording to ministry sources, lightning strikes killed 307 people across the country in 2017, and 380 in 2016.\nIn May 2016, 81 people died of lightning strikes in a span of four days, and on March and April, another 70 people died of the natural disaster.\nThe Disaster Management Ministry advised the public to keep their distance from tall trees, electric poles, transmission wires, and mobile towers during thunderstorms.\nThe officials concerned also instructed people, especially children to avoid playing outside during storms, and advised fishermen to refrain from venturing out into rivers and the sea.\nThe disaster management minister, while addressing the May 1 meeting, said: \"Bangladesh is witnessing more and more lightning strikes. We have installed lightning detection machines in eight districts of the country, including in Dhaka, Sylhet, Mymensingh, Satkhira and Naogaon.\"\nRohingya refugees at risk\nRelief and Disaster Management Ministry Secretary Shah Kamal told the correspondent: \"A total of 1,100,000 Rohingya are currently staying in Bangladesh, and landslides pose a serious risk to around 200,000 among them.\n\"The refugees are being shifted to an area between Kutupalong and Balukhali for their own safety. Among the 50,000 families at risk, 25,000 have already been shifted to abovementioned safe area, and the rest are to be shifted soon.\"\nPointing out the army and navy's significant contributions during past events of disaster in the country, Shah Kamal said: \"Bangladesh Army and Navy personnel has a history of risking their lives for the people affected by disasters. So, this year we have asked them to be prepared to tackle any emergency situation.\"\nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "The Kushiara River was flowing 118 cm above the danger level at Fenchuganj Bazar on Wednesday Even though waters in Monu and Dholai rivers are flowing under the danger level, a number of low-lying and new areas adjacent to the rivers remain flooded in Moulvibazar, marooning and severely affecting thousands of people. Ranendra Shankar Chakrabarti, the executive engineer of Moulvibazar Water Development Board, said the situation was improving gradually.  Since the water flow from upstream and rainfall have declined, the risk of damage to the protection embankments in Manu, Dholai and Kushiara rivers also decreased, he said. \"The rivers are very curvy and there are bends in the rivers in border areas. The capacity of these rivers has decreased to 60% because of sedimentation. So when there is heavy water flow from upstream, it creates flooding.\" Meanwhile the flood situation in Fenchuganj upazila of Sylhet has deteriorated further, leaving 30,000 people of 25 villages in five unions marooned. The Kushiara River was flowing 118 cm above the danger level at Fenchuganj Bazar on Wednesday, said sources at the local Water Development Board office. At least 30,000 people remained marooned. Dire conditions The residents of the flood-affected areas in Moulvibazar are suffering from acute shortage of pure drinking water and sanitation crisis. Locals have also become afraid of outbreaks of waterborne diseases as the affected people have been using floodwater for daily uses and defecating in open places. During visits to different affected areas, this correspondent saw that many households are still under floodwater and many people have taken refuge in different shelter centres and rooftops of buildings. Some people have also taken shelter on different embankments and are living in dire conditions - without any source of clean drinking water and necessary hygienic facilities. There is an acute crisis of foods although relief distribution from government and non-government initiative is underway, locals said. People who have lost their homes in the flood are living in makeshift shelters on the town protection dam in Barahat Dhaka TribuneBabli Begum, who has taken refuge on the Barahat embankment along with around 400 families, said: \"I have managed to come here with my mother and two children our village was suddenly flooded. My house is still under waist-deep water. We have nothing here with us - no food, clothes, money or other daily essentials.\" \"I am the lone income source of my family. I have no money since I cannot work. I do not know how I will provide if I lose my sewing machine,\" she said. Only few days ago, these people were preparing to celebrate the Eid-ul-Fitr with much festivity, but the sudden flood has changed everything, taking away their homes, cattle and crops. The floodwater has ravaged many villages and fields of Aush paddy and other vegetables, locals said, destroying their livelihood.  Ismail Ali said their home went underwater after the Baroikona embankment of Monu River collapsed in the early hours of Wednesday. \"The embankment was already vulnerable with numerous rat holes and foxholes on it. But it gave in at the end when it could not take the enormous pressure of the floodwater.\" At the Barahat town protection dyke, around 50-60 men, women and children had crowded this reporter seeking aid. One of them, Saleha Begum said: \"If we had not received 5kgs of rice on Monday, we would have had to starve. Lack of toilet and drinking water is the major problem now. However, a local female politician had one tube-well installed here and that is now the only source of drinking water of 400 families. \"We have to wait in a long queue to get water from the morning. The women are suffering mostly for the lack of toilets while children from different diseases.\" The reservoirs of pure drinking water in every household of Moulvibazar town provided by the municipality are currently under several feet of water. The reserve system of tube-well water is also out of order as there is no power supply in most of the flood affected urban and rural areas, leading to massive public suffering. \"There was no Eid for us. We only managed to save our lives,\" said Khaleda Begum. The flood-hit people have alleged that they are not getting enough aid and relief materials from the government. However, some non-government and volunteer organizations along with people from home and abroad have come forward with aid - providing cooked food, water purifying pills, oral saline, candles, matchboxes and dry food to the affected helpless people. Moulvibazar Civil Surgeon Dr Abu Jaher told the Dhaka Tribune that 74 medical teams were working to provide medical support to the flood victims across the district.  \"The teams have been sent everywhere. They are providing water purifying pills, oral saline and primary treatment including essential medicine,\" he said.  The civil surgeon also advised people to stay safe from water borne diseases. According to Moulvibazar district administration, some 50 shelter centres have been opened and 5,390 people rescued and sent to the centres. The military has sent four teams to work in the flood-hit areas. The government has allotted Tk9.4 lakh and 743 metric tons of rice for the flood affected people. "

Numerous potholes and puddles have developed on roads constructed by the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) in Kulaura, Rajnagar and Sadar upazilas, hindering smooth vehicular communication to and from the north-eastern district. Some roads were still submerged under knee-deep water on Friday, while two culverts in the district have also suffered damage, worsening the traffic situation. According to the RHD, cracks had also developed on the regional roads and highway of Juri,  Borolekha, Kulaura, Rajnagar upazilas, and in Sheola and Charkhai areas. The scenario was almost as bad on the Moulvibazar-Rajnagar and Fenchuganj-Sylhet, Kulaura-Shamshernagar and Kulaura-Sreemangal roads.  \"There are as many as 500 roads in Moulvibazar,\" said the district unit LGED's Executive Engineer Kamrul Islam. \"We are assessing the amount of the losses and hope that the actual figure will come out in a few days. However, we cannot repair the roads right now since there are no funds available.\" The district administration is maintaining a list of losses incurred due to the flooding between June 12 and 20. Mintu Ranjan Das, executive engineer of RHD, Moulvibazar, estimated the cost of repairing the damaged roads at Tk12.85 crore. Situation is 'normal', says DC Contradicting reports from Moulvibazar, the district's deputy commissioner, Md Tofail Islam, said the overall flood situation was \"improving\", while denying there were any instances of water-logging in the district. \"Water has gone down from the roads and the traffic was normal,\" he claimed.  \"Several villages were flooded as a river protection embankment collapsed in Rajnagar upazila; however, the embankment was repaired while Kamalganj was seeing improved flood situation as well.\"    Photo:Dhaka Tribune Ranendra Shanker Chakraborty, executive engineer of Moulvibazar Water Development Board, said the Kushiara river protection embankment had been repaired in the Rajnagar upazila's Haldigul and Kalaigul areas. Official accounts did not match with the experiences of families on the saturated ground.  Up to Thursday, at least 6,322 families had been affected in Kulaura upazila, where there had been two fatalities. One person died in the floods in Rajnagar, where there were 7,180 affected families.  In Sadar upazila, the affected families numbered 10,508, while there were 27,920 affected families in Kamalganj upazila and 2,090 in Sreemangal upazila.  Trade hit The passage of freight to and from India through the Chatlapur land port has been suspended for the past ten days, with the Chatlapur Bridge approach deemed too risky for traffic.  Private vehicles and foot passengers were also encountering difficulties both ways through the border crossing. Sub-Inspector Jamal Hossain, of the land port's immigration department, said around 100 vehicles ply the route on a normal day.   \"Since June 13, traffic through the land port has dropped drastically, with most left to commute on foot while entering and leaving Bangladesh,\" he said. In a further blow to the local economy, Aush paddy cultivated on at least 4,160 hectares of land in Kulaura, Rajnagar, Sadar, Kamalganj and Sreemangal upazilas had been damaged.  "

According to reports of our Bogra correspondent several areas of Sariakandi and Dhunat upazilas in Bogra district have been flooded by the rising Jamuna River following continuous rainfall and water from upstream. The water at Mathurapur point of Sariakandi and Dhunat point of  Dhunat upazila was flowing 11 centimeters above the danger level at 12.00 pm on Sunday, the Water Development Board said. Thousands of houses on the river bank in two upazilas got flooded in the morning. According to local sources, standing crops of 622-hectare land  got damaged in char areas of the upazilas. Meanwhile, croplands, homesteads, establishments of  Chaluabari, Kazla, Bohail, Hatsherpur, Kutubpur of Sariakandi villages went under water leaving thousands of people homeless.  Locals have moved their belongings and domestic animals to safe places as the river water was flowing above danger level, said WDB Engineer Hasan Mahmud. Abdul Karim Apple, chairman of Bhandarbari Union Council, said more than 500 families have been marooned as the Boishakhichar went under water. Sairakandi Upazila Agriculture Officer Md Jahangir Alam said aman paddy of 42 hectare, vegetables of 20 hectare and sugarcane of 5 hectare went under water in last few days. Our Gaibandha correspondent said water level of major three rivers Brahmaputra,Teesta and Karotoa has been continuing to rise alarmingly for few days last causing flood in char and river basin areas of several areas in the district. The officials of Bangladesh Water Development Board said water level of the Brahmaputra River crossed the danger level at Phulchharighat point of the district inundating vast areas particularly the chars and the river basin areas of Sundarganj, Sadar, Phulchhari and Shaghata upazilas. More than 575 houses of Kapasia, Horipur and Belka unions went under water in last few days, said Water Development Board sources."

      "text": "Smaller crises and non-economic damages should also be considered, experts say Despite being one of the nations most vulnerable to climate change, Bangladesh has little information on assessing losses and damages caused by it. This has become a bar to demanding sufficient compensation in the world forum. Bangladesh has collected information on only seven major disasters,which count damages of only $11.6 billion in the last 20 years (1998-2017).Meanwhile, the most polluting country United States of America has collected information on 482 disasters that occurred in the same period, and have estimated economic losses of $945 billion. China has calculated its losses and damages at $492 billion from its 577 disaster events during that time period. Among others, Japan recorded economic losses and damages of $376.3 billion, India of $79.5 billion, Puerto Rico of $71.7 and Germany of $57.9 billion. According to the Disaster Management Department (DMD), Bangladesh has recorded only 7 major events. Heavy floods in 1987, 1988, 1998, 2004, 2007caused Bangladesh an economic loss of $8.4 billion; and cyclone Sidr in 2007 and Aila in 2009 caused $3.2 billion in losses. That brings the total losses and damages to $11.6 billion in that time period.  A recent global study titled \"Economic losses, poverty and disasters 1998-2017\", jointly conducted by the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) and the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), shows that in the last 20 years,disaster-hit countries reported direct economic losses valued at $2,908 billion. That includes both climate-related and geophysical disasters, of which climate-related disasters caused 77% or $2,245 billion.  Among the disasters, earthquakes and volcanic activity are recognized as geophysical,while floods, cyclones, drought and wildfires are the most dangerous forms of climate-related disasters. On the whole, reported losses from extreme weather events rose globally by 151% during two terms of 20-year periods. The World Bank has calculated the actual cost to the global economy is a staggering $520 billion per annum, with disasters pushing 26 million people into poverty every year. Experts term it as alarming, and say that besides giving serious thought to the issue, we should also demand compensation at the global forum, and should maintain data on losses and damages to build our own capacity to adapt to these situations. Shashanka Saddi, head of the emergency preparedness and response program at BRAC, said we have to calculate actual losses from all events via a proper and internationally acceptable mechanism, as we face small floods, droughts and storms every year that are being  unrecognized. \"We can make demands only when we have related data about our losses and damages. At the annual conference of parties (COP24), we should play more a active role within LDC and G77 groups to negotiate,\" he said.  \"How can we demand compensation if we are ignorant about the issue?\" he asked. A report says developed countries of the world keep records of most of their losses and damages. On an average, they record data of 53% of disasters, while lower middle income countries like Bangladesh calculate losses and damages of only 31% of disasters. About 87% disasters of lower-income countries were not recorded, as they were able to keep records of only 13% of disasters. And upper middle-income countries keep records of 40% of disaster-related information.   Among the reported disasters, floods occurred 3,148 times, storms 2059times, earthquakes 563times, extreme temperature 405times, landslides 378 times, drought 347times, wildfires 254times, volcanic activity 99times and mass movement (dry) 12 times. People were mostly affected by floods. Two billion people were affected by floods, 1.5 billion by drought, 726 million by storms, 125 million by earthquakes, 97 million by extreme temperatures, 4.8 million by landslides, and wild fire, volcanic activity and mass movement (dry) affected 6.2 million people.  Developed countries, including neighbours China and India, are mostly responsible for global warming, which has made Bangladesh one of the most vulnerable countries to climate-related disasters. COP24 will be held from December 2 this year at Katowice in Poland, where losses and damage-related issues will be among the most debated issues.  Dr Md Shamsuddoha, chief executive of the Center for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD), said developed nations are interested in direct economic losses through insurance mechanisms, which is also a business tool. They are not interested in the other non-economic losses which are also important and caused by climate change. \"Pressure is being created on developed nations to compensate both for economic and non-economic damages. We hope we will have some achievement in the international forum, especially at the upcoming COP24,\" he said. \"Bangladesh should develop a mechanism to assess climate-related losses and damages. The government should realize its importance and decide which ministry or department will play the key roles.\" Additional Secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief Satya Brata Saha told the Dhaka Tribune that we have data on economic losses and damages of major disasters, but we need to count minor disaster-related losses too. For a sustainable economy, it is necessary to keep records of losses and damages. \"We have already developed a model for loss and damage assessment. We are going to take up a pilot project in this regard, and if needed we will amend the assessment mechanism model in the light of that experience,\" he said. \"The model will be placed at COP24 with a hope that other countries, both developed and least developed, will accept it,\" he added.  In March this year, a committee was formed for developing a national mechanism on climate change induced disaster-related losses and damages,in light of a study report from the ministry of disaster management and relief. The process was started in 2016. "

      "text": "Two Rohingyas have been killed and at least 10 others injured in mudslides since the monsoon started Thousands of Rohingyas living in tents and makeshift houses on the hills and slopes are vulnerable to landslides as heavy monsoon rains batter the coastal district of Cox's Bazar. Over 200,000 refugees in the camps are still living in areas considered to be at high risk of flooding and landslides, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre, operating within the European Commission's Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations department, said in its June 12 report.  Twenty-five thousand refugees are at very high risk, the ERCC said. Poor drainage system in Rohingya camps have added to the refugees' woes Tarek Mahmud/Dhaka TribuneIt has reported 60 incidents of landslides, floods, and storms between June 9 and June 11 in which 855 shelters were damaged. More than 700,000 Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh to escape a brutal crackdown by the Myanmar security forces. They have taken shelter in Cox's Bazar, a district bordering Myanmar. The refugees have cut down trees and razed hills to set up temporary homes. Six days of heavy rains have made the topsoil of the hills fragile. The makeshift houses stretch over several thousand acres of hilly area. The roads have already become muddy, and some are inaccessible.  Monsoon and deforestation often trigger deadly landslides in Bangladesh that kill dozens every year. Landslides in the densely populated camps can be disastrous. Ukhiya upazila administration said two Rohingyas have been killed and at least 10 others injured in mudslides since the monsoon started.  Rohingya youth, Md Rafiq, a volunteer working for the Rohingya camp management authorities, said he was worried about his family living in a makeshift shelter on a hill slope in Balukhali camp. Another refugee, Kalam, said a landslide damaged his house on a hillside in the Shafiullah Ghata area of Balukhali camp on Wednesday. \"We have been hearing reports of landslides for the last couple of days and we are really scared,\" he said. In Myanmar, the Rohingyas said they always lived in fear of being attacked by the army and the Moghs. \"In Bangladesh, our current worries are the rains, floods, and landslides,\" said octogenarian Yusuf Mia, who hails from Maungdaw. He lives at the Kutupalang extension camp where about 50 makeshift houses were damaged by landslides in the last five days. A UNHCR report said the pathways and stairs have developed cracks or broken away, and hillsides have crumbled pounded by rain. The International Organization for Migration said humanitarian agencies reported some 88 incidents of landslides and flash floods in the camps in just three days, affecting over 21,500 people back in May. They said the number would increase with the rains. The IOM, in its latest report, said conditions in the camps are \"further deteriorating as torrential rains that began on June 9 continue to trigger landslides and flooding.\" Refugee Rehabilitation and Relief Commissioner, Abul Kalam, said the government's concerned bodies and humanitarian organizations are working round-the-clock to provide aid and secure infrastructure."

      "text": "Following heavy rain and onrush of water from the hills, rising water levels of a number of rivers in several districts around the country have left people marooned after damaging protection dams and flooding the areas. Thousands of people have also been marooned in many areas of the hill districts of Chittagong as they went underwater after incessant downpour and flash-floods. In Moulvibazar, persistent rain and steady onrush of hill waters have raised the water levels of Monu River in Sharifpur of Kulaura upazila by 175 centimetres above the danger level. Local journalist and resident of Hajipur area in Kulaura Saiful Alam said: \"Due to incessant rain for the last three days, the water levels of Monu and Dholai rivers have increased dangerously since the early hours of Tuesday. \"Locals are trying to stop the water flow by using makeshift dams,\" said Saiful. \"The waters in Monu River near the Monu railway bridge and station in Hazipur union are flowing over the danger level. The dams in Matabpur, Madanagar, Chak Ranchap, Hashimpur, Baroigao, and Mondira are in risky situations.\" Since Tuesday afternoon, the dams around Chak Ranchap, Madanagar, and Nischintapur, Chatla Bridge, Chanpur, Amtola BGB camp area, and Datta village of Sharifpur union stand at risk of breaking down. Local mosques are using loudspeakers to ask aid for the locals, while the locals are trying their best to reinforce the dams. On the other hand, the water levels of Dholai River in Kamalganj upazila have also increased above danger level, causing floods in localities and croplands. Md Jewel Ahmed, mayor of Kamalganj Municipality in Moulvibazar, second from right, visits an area flooded after the water of Dholai River went above the danger level on June 13, 2018 | Dhaka Tribune As a result, parts of the dam in nine places in Dholai River, including Madhabpur of Kamalganj upazila, Islampur in Kamalganj Sadar, and Adampur union, are now at risk of being overflowed. Water Development Board Inspector Abdul Awal informed: \"The waters of Dholai River are flowing 25 centimetres over the danger level. The rate at which rainfall is going on, the waters might increase further.\" In Karimpur village of ward no 1 of Kamalganj municipality, waters have entered localities and croplands by shattering the dams. The water level is still on the rise.  Mayor of Kamalganj municipality Md Jewel Ahmed said: \"Over 200 people have become trapped inside the village due to Dholai river erosion.\" A 100-foot area in the Dholai River dam was eroded due to constant rainfall in Surandpur village of Munshibazar union in Kamalganj upazila. As a result, 250 families in Surandpur village have become trapped inside.  In total, around 500 families have become trapped in Karimpur and Surandpur villages in Kamalganj. Due to water entering through two eroded parts of the Dholai River dam, the streets of Karimpur and Surandpur have become submerged under 2-3 ft of water. Kamalganj Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Md Mahmudul Haque and Mayor of Kamalganj municipality Md Jewel Ahmed have inspected the areas around Surandpur and Karimpur where the dams have been damaged most seriously. Persistent rain and steady onrush of hill waters have raised the water level of Monu River in Moulvibazar's Kulaura upazila by 175 centimetres above the danger level | Dhaka Tribune Ranendra Sankar Chakrabarty of Water Development Board in Moulvibazar said: \"The dams in three places have eroded due to the overflow of Monu River. The waters are increasing due to flooding, and might increase further. \"Everything is in a risky position,\" said Ranendra. \"The flood water this year is greater than last year's. On Tuesday, water flowed 80 centimetres above the danger level in the Monu River.\" He added that without any government allocation, he had personally renovated the dams in Monu and Dholai Rivers by spending more than Tk8 crore in the past.  Meanwhile, in Habiganj, the water levels of Khoai River besides Habiganj town have increased by 170 centimetres on Tuesday due to torrential rain in hills in Tripura province of India. As a result, the villages around Habiganj town are at risk of flooding.   Alarmed villagers have been keeping a keen eye on the dam in Khoai River so no leakages occur at any place. Habiganj Water Development Board Executive engineer Tawhidul Islam said: \"The waters in Khoai River have been flowing 170 centimetres above the danger level since 9:30am on Wednesday.  \"The water level would have decreased if the overflow from Tripura province was dampened,\" said Tawhidul. \"Right at this moment, Habiganj town dwellers are at risk.\" Tawhidul informed that to fight the overflow of water, Water Development Board has additional sacks of sand in stock. \"We are paying attention so that we can take immediate measures if leakages are found at any place in the dam.\" However, he said the water level may decrease by afternoon. A house submerged in floodwater in Feni is seen in this photo taken on June 13, 2018 | Dhaka Tribune In Feni, parts of the dam in eight places around Muhuri River have broken due to heavy and torrential rain in India, causing streets, croplands, homes, and fisheries to be submerged in Parshuram and Fulgazi upazilas. Due to waters flowing three centimetres above danger level, the parts of the dam broke in these areas. Kohinoor Alam, executive engineer of Feni Water Development Board, said: \"Two parts of the dam in Chitholia union of Parshuram upazila, and parts of dam in eight places in North Daulatpur of Fulgazi Sadar upazila, Dhanimurar, Bairoya, and Banik para broke down.\" He said the work for reinforcing the dams at these places could not proceed due to the heavy water flow. The Water Development Board is working to find out the number of villages that have submerged under water, said Kohinoor. Meanwhile, the goods in shops in Fulgazi bazar have been damaged due to water entering the shops, while streets in Parshuram have gone under water as well. In Rangamati, at least 14 villages in Baghaichhari upazila were submerged due to rain and onrush of hill water for the last three days, rendering 60,000 people marooned, according to UNB. Torrential rain flooded different villages including Karengatoli, Baghaihat, Bangaltoli, Rupkari, Kadamtoli, Tulaban, Gucchagram, Muslim Block, Imam Para, Master Para, Gunia Para, Sarkar Para, College Para and Old Marishya. A vast area of cropland went under floodwaters, forcing people to take shelter in nearby schools, colleges and madrasas.

AKM Mamunur Rashid, deputy commissioner of Rangamati, said several villages were flooded as the water level in the Kachalong River rose following the rain. Several shelters were opened for the flood-affected people, and around 10 tons of rice was distributed among them, he said. In Khagrachhari, the flooding situation has not yet returned to normal.  Several hundred houses and businesses were flooded, as water levels in the Chengi and Maini rivers rose on Monday following rain. Md Rashedul Islam, deputy commissioner in the district, said they had already taken necessary preparations to shelter vulnerable families during any natural calamities."

      "text": "Kurigram, Jamalpur, Bogra, Sirajganj and Tangail districts are likely to bear the brunt of this monsoonal flood The northern part of Bangladesh should brace for heavy flooding within the next two days, especially in the Brahmaputra basin, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) has warned. The flood situation was already worsening in different areas of Kurigram on Friday, with the swollen Brahmaputra, Teesta, Dharla and Dudhkumar rivers leaving around 50,000 people marooned. Water had also started to inundate many areas of Islampur upazila in Jamalpur, while a number of villages in Nilphamari's Sadar upazila were deluged following the onrush of water from hills and incessant rainfall upstream. \"Kurigram, Jamalpur, Bogra, Sirajganj, and Tangail districts are likely to bear the brunt of this monsoonal flood, as the water is gradually coming down from Assam in India,\" FFWC Executive Engineer Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan said. According to the FFWC - an arm of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) - the water level of the rivers in the Brahmaputra basin was still rising on Friday, and would continue to do so \"for the next three to four days.\" Following the rainfall, 54 of 94 river monitoring stations were experiencing rising water levels, while the level fell in 39 stations and remained unchanged at one station. It meant that 10 distinct points along the Surma, Kushiyara, Old Surma, Dharla and Teesta rivers - located in the country's north and north-eastern zones - were already flowing above the danger level. Of those, water levels of the Dharla at Kurigram were 31cm above the danger level, BWDB officials said. The FFWC were also forecasting more points along the Brahmaputra basin to be flowing above the danger level by the end of Friday. Next door in India, the country's meteorological department has projected that the Assam and Meghalaya states will see widespread rainfall until July 11. This spells bad news for the north-eastern region of Bangladesh, which is located downstream from Meghalaya state and has already been experiencing flooding for the past few days.  Flood hits Kurigram Low-lying areas of many unions in the district's Sadar, Bhurungamari, Phulbari, Rajarhat, Ulipur, Chilmari and Nageshwari upazilas were flooded on Friday, leaving thousands of people marooned in more than 50 villages. Hundreds of families, who have lost everything in the flood, are yet to receive any kind of relief. Road communications in all these areas were also cut off due to the rising waters. Apart from Dharla, the water level in the Brahmaputra went up by 35cm, in Dudhkumar by 32cm, and in Teesta by 25cm in only 24 hours. The unions that were either flooded or facing inundation due to the overflowing rivers, collapsing dams and erosion included Holokhana, Bhogdanga, Panchgachi, Gharialdanga, Begumgonj, Buraburi, Thetrai and Ranigonj. The flooding has destroyed crops and vegetables in numerous fields around the district.  Local BWDB officials said they were working on repairing the dams damaged due to the overflowing water in different upazilas. Parts of a village inundated by floodwater in Kurigram after water in nearby rivers rose above the danger level on July 6, 2018 l Dhaka Tribune Also Read- Floods likely in the north this week Water enters Jamalpur The water flowing from upstream had started flooding the low-lying areas of Shapdari, Noarpara, Chinaduli, Belghacha and Kulkandi unions in the district's Islampur upazila on Friday. \"The water in Brahmaputra was flowing 40cm below the danger level at Islampur's Bahadurabad Ghat point at 5pm,\" the local BWDB deputy assistant engineer, Ashraful Islam, said on Friday. \"At this rate, the water level would cross the danger mark within the next 24 hours.\" The flooding in the district has also severed road communications between different upazilas, adding to the sufferings of the people. Nilphamari hit Around 20 chars and villages in the district's Dimla and Jaldhaka upazilas were inundated by floodwater, leaving hundreds of families marooned. BWDB sources said the Teesta River was flowing 6cm below the red mark on Friday afternoon. \"All the sluice gates of the Teesta Barrage have been opened to manage the pressure of water,\" Rafiqul Islam Chowdhury, BWDB executive officer at Dalia point, said. Sylhet getting better The situation improved in Sylhet on Friday, however, with floodwaters receding far enough in Gowainghat and Companiganj upazilas to enable vehicles to return to the Sari-Gowainghat and Sylhet-Gowainghat roads. The onrush of water from the hills on the Indian side had been slow up to Friday, keeping the water level in the Sari and Piyain rivers below the danger mark. However, local farmers reported that seed beds and arable land in large swathes of the upazilas had already been destroyed due to the floods. Meanwhile, the body of Abdur Rashid, 26, who went missing after a boat capsized in Gowainghat upazila on Wednesday, was found floating in the floodwater around 2pm on Friday."

      "text": "\nTeesta River dries up, ecosystem threatened\n\n\n\n\nMoazzem Hossain, Lalmonirhat\n\n\n\n\n Published at 09:23 pm March 26th, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nDue to India's withdrawal of water from the Teesta River, the part of the river that flows through Bangladesh has dried up. Experts are saying that due to lack of water flow, the ecosystem of the Teesta River is in peril.\nIndia has built an irrigation barrage on the Indian portion of the Teesta River at Jalpaiguri district's Malbazar town. This is creating a major water diversion which has caused the Lalmonirhat's Teesta barrage irrigation area to dry up. The river bed is now filling up with piles of sand.\nThe Teesta River enters Bangladesh through Lalmonirhat's Patgram upazila's Dahagram. From its entrance to Hatibandha Teesta barrage, the water flow is around 800-900 cusecs (a unit of flow, especially of water, equal to one cubic foot per second). However, the flow is much lower from Teesta barrage to Lalmonirhat-Rangpur's Kaunia area. The water flow there is around 300-400 cusecs.\nLocal farmers are planting corn and pumpkin on the dry river bed. The Hatibandha Teesta barrage is almost empty. There is virtually no water from Teesta barrage to the Lalmonirhat-Kaunia area.\nThe Teesta River is around 315km long. The 115km it travels across Bangladesh is in a critical state.\nBangladesh and India have had many meetings regarding the river but none have proved to be fruitful. The ecosystem and biodiversity are suffering due to delays in resolving the water sharing issue.\nWith the national polls up ahead, discussions regarding the river Teesta is coming to light again. The people living near the river hope the government will sort out the matter soon. But no one knows for sure when that will happen.\nNegotiations on how to share the water of the Teesta have been going on since 1983.\nIn 2007, a meeting between Bangladesh and India Joint River Commission decided that they will divide 80% of the water between them and the rest 20% will be kept free to maintain the flow of the river. Mamata Banerjee disagreed to this and the deal remains unsigned.\nA 2011 interim deal - that was supposed to last 15 years - gave India 42.5% of the Teesta's waters and Bangladesh 37.5%. This deal was ultimately left unsigned too.\n[caption id=\"attachment_255345\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] In 2007, a meeting between Bangladesh and India Joint River Commission decided that they will divide 80% of the water between them and the rest 20% will be kept free to maintain the flow of the river. Mamata Banerjee disagreed to this and the deal remains unsigned Moazzem Hossain/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nMore than one lakh hectares of land across five districts in Bangladesh are severely affected by withdrawal of the Teesta's waters in India. Several districts in Bangladesh face acute shortages during the dry season.\nAccording to experts, if this goes on, the existence of the river will be severely threatened in the next few years. The ecosystem surrounding the river is already critically endangered.\nAccording to sources from Bangladesh Water Development Board's Teesta barrage irrigation project, a 650-metre long structure with 52 gates was constructed from 1979 to 1990. The project was officially inaugurated on August 5, 1990.\nThe project was first attempted in 1937 by the then government; the main project plan was accepted in 1953. Later in 1957 the project started to take off but was cancelled due to complications.\nHistory of the Teesta River\nThe Teesta River originates in Chitamu Lake in the Sikkim Himalayas at an altitude of about 7,200m and comes down first to the Darjeeling plain and then to the Duars plain of West Bengal. It flows through a gorge known as Sivok Gola in Darjeeling. It is a wild river in the Darjeeling Hills where its valley is clothed with dense forest, but its drainage area in the mountains is only 12,500sq km. It enters Bangladesh at the Kharibari border of Nilphamari district.\nUp to the end of the 18th century it flowed directly into the Ganges. The excessive rains of 1787 created a vast flood and choked the original Atrai channel. This resulted in the Teesta bursting into the Ghaghat which at that time was a very small river. After passing through Lalmonirhat, Rangpur, Kurigram and Gaibandha districts this deluge falls into the Jamuna south of Chilmari riverport. The total length of the river is about 315km, of which nearly 115km lies within Bangladesh.\nLand movement, earthquakes, floods, and geological structural changes in the northern part of Bangladesh affected the original flows of the Karatoya, Atrai, and Jamuneshwari rivers. The present Teesta is the result of these changes and the accumulated flows of the Karotoya, Atrai and Jamuneshwari rivers. The Bangla name Teesta comes from Tri-Srota or three flows. The river has a mean monthly discharge of about 2,430 cusecs. A number of old channels that were occupied by this river and the Karatoya through which it joined the Ganges are still known as the Buri Teesta or Old Teesta.\n[caption id=\"attachment_255350\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] The Hatibandha Teesta barrage is almost empty. There is virtually no water from Teesta barrage to the Lalmonirhat-Kaunia area Mozzaem Hossain/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\n What the locals are saying\nA local by the name of Motabel Hossain lives near the Teesta road bridge area. Land owned by his family and neighbours was destroyed by flooding from the Teesta river. In the dry season, since the riverbed is exposed, he cultivates garlic, pumpkin, and corn on the land. He said: \"If there is no water in the river, we will be in an even worse state. If there is water in the river we will be able to farm in the nearby lands. Due to the lack of water, the plants surrounding the area are dying. There is no more fish either. If the treaty between Bangladesh and India is signed, both the countries will benefit from it.\"\nHatibandha upazila's Goddimari union chairman Atiar Rahman said: \"The artificial flood created by India greatly harms the locals and we face major damage. This whole upazila's tragedy is the flood we face each year. But in the dry season, the river is utterly dry and that harms us too. The fishermen are changing their profession. There is not enough water for irrigation either. This is affecting the lives of the people and the ecosystem is a very negative way. We want the Teesta water sharing agreement to be finalized as soon as possible. Both the Bangladeshi and Indian government need to step up and take necessary steps.\"\nWhat the authorities are saying\nThe Teesta barrage irrigation project expansion officer Rafiul Bari said: \"Even though we built Teesta barrage irrigation project-1 to provide 11 upazilas with water for irrigation, due to lack of water in the river, the farmers are not benefitting from it. We are able to provide water to only five upazilas. Even that is irregular. We were only able to give 500 cusecs of water in the last five years. The river contains less water now. The Teesta water sharing agreement should be finalized as soon as possible so Bangladesh can finally have its fair share of water. The river will come to life again and we will be able to use the water for irrigation.\"\nTeesta Barrage Water Development Board executive engineer Rafikul Alam Chowdhury said: \"We need around 20,000 cusecs of water flow to keep the river flowing properly and to provide the people with water for irrigation. We need around 4,000 cusecs of water to simply keep the river alive; we are not even getting 1500 cusecs of water on average. If this continues, we will not have even a drop of water in the Teesta River in a couple of years. The whole irrigation system will have to be shut down. Bangladesh and India need to sort out the water sharing problem. Otherwise the river will die out for good.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Bangladesh's climate risk ranking is 9th in 2017 against 13th position in 2016 Bangladesh is the seventh most affected country in the world due to \"extreme weather events\" over the last 20 years from 1998 -2017, says a new global report. The other top nine affected countries are Puerto Rico, Honduras, Myanmar, Haiti, Philippines, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Dominica, according to Global Climate Risk Index-2019 released in Poland on Wednesday. Of the 10 most affected countries and territories (1998-2017), eight were developing countries in the low income or lower middle income country group, one was classified as an upper-middle income country (Dominica), and one an advanced economy generating high income (Puerto Rico). Bangladesh's climate risk ranking is 9th in 2017 against 13th position in 2016. The report says massive rainfalls have led to floods across Nepal, Bangladesh and India, which affected more than 40 million people. Around 1200 people lost their lives in these three countries and millions were displaced throughout the region. The floods spread across the foothills of the Himalayas and caused landslides leaving tens of thousands of houses, and vast areas of farmland and roads destroyed. Nepal experienced flash floods and landslides in August across the southern border, amounting to US$ 600 million in damages. Nearly 250 people were killed by collapsed buildings or drowning in regions of India, Nepal and Bangladesh. 950,000 houses were damaged or destroyed in the floods. Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka and Dominica were at the top of the list of the most affected countries in 2017. Between 1998 and 2017, Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar were the countries most affected by extreme weather events. Altogether, more than 526,000 people died as a direct result of more than 11,500 extreme weather events; and losses between 1998 and 2017 amounted to around US$ 3.47 trillion (in Purchasing Power Parities). Storms and their direct implications - precipitation, floods and landslides - were one major cause of damage in 2017. Of the ten most affected countries in 2017, four were hit by tropical cyclones.  Recent science has found a clear link between climate change and record-breaking precipitation of 2017's hurricanes. It also suggests that the number of severe tropical cyclones will increase with every tenth of a degree in global average temperature rise. In many cases, single exceptional disasters have such a strong impact that the countries and territories concerned are also ranked high in the long-term index. Over the last few years another category of countries has been gaining relevance - countries like Haiti, the Philippines and Pakistan that are recurrently affected by catastrophes continuously rank among the most affected countries both in the long-term index and in the index for the respective year. The Climate Summit in Katowice should adopt the \"rulebook\" needed for the implementation of the Paris Agreement, including the global adaptation goal and adaptation communication guidelines, said the report. Furthermore, COP24 must increase efforts to properly address loss and damage, which appears as a cross-cutting issue referenced throughout various negotiation streams, with significant risk of being omitted from final negotiation text, reads the report. The risks of future climate-related losses and damages are far too severe to simply function as a negotiation chip. The Global Climate Risk Index 2019 analyses to what extent countries and regions have been affected by impacts of weather-related loss events (storms, floods, heat waves etc.). The most recent data available - for 2017 and from 1998 to 2017 - were taken into account. The countries and territories affected most in 2017 were Puerto Rico, Sri Lanka as well as Dominica. For the period from 1998 to 2017 Puerto Rico, Honduras and Myanmar rank highest. This year's 14th edition of the analysis reconfirms earlier results of the Climate Risk Index: less developed countries are generally more affected than industrialized countries. Regarding future climate change, the Climate Risk Index may serve as a red flag for already existing vulnerability that may further increase in regions where extreme events will become more frequent or more severe due to climate change."

Globally, assets worth about $163 billion are not insured against catastrophes, posing a \"significant threat\" to livelihoods and prosperity, London-based insurance market Lloyd's said in a report. The value of \"underinsured\" assets has shrunk by only 3% since 2012, it noted. Many countries with the lowest levels of insurance are also among those most exposed to risks, including from climate change impacts, and are least able to fund disaster recovery efforts, it added. \"If insurance is not available, catastrophes can have a much greater impact on economies and lives,\" Lloyd's Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said in a statement. Emerging and low-income economies account for almost all of the global \"insurance gap\", the report said. Insurance penetration rates - total insurance premiums as a percentage of gross domestic product - are on average twice as high in rich nations as those in developing countries, it noted. Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt and Nigeria all have an insurance penetration rate of less than 1%, it said. After a disaster, uninsured losses usually have to be paid from government funds - a problem for poorer countries that cannot afford to rebuild. \"Catastrophes coupled with underinsurance can be seen as one of the significant factors that holds back economic development and perpetuates global inequality,\" the report said. Some risks in richer nations also are not well-covered by insurance, it noted, including earthquakes in Italy and floods in the United States. Slow progress on expanding the use of insurance to protect against risks is \"concerning\", the report said - and remains the case despite many economies bouncing back from recession in the six years since the \"insurance gap\" was last measured. It is particularly worrying given the upsurge in \"more severe, frequent and costly natural disasters, driven in large part by climate change\", the report added. Last year was one of the costliest for natural catastrophes in the past decade - and expected economic losses from such disasters now total $165 billion annually, Lloyd's said. Unafforadable  One of the main barriers to taking out disaster insurance in developing countries is that it is too expensive for many. Limited understanding of its value and lack of trust in insurance companies also stand in the way of policies being sold, the report said. But insurance, combined with investment in improving resilience to disasters, can cut losses, the report said. Studies suggest each dollar invested in reducing disaster risk saves about $4 in recovery costs. Another report also released on Monday by Lloyd's and the UK-funded Centre for Global Disaster Protection outlined four innovative financial instruments that could generate cash to invest in resilient infrastructure and boost insurance coverage. They include loans that incorporate insurance to keep interest payments low, and bonds whose payments are linked to the success of resilience measures. Another idea is \"resilience service companies\" that would retrofit buildings to better withstand natural hazards, for example, reducing risks and lowering insurance premiums. Daniel Stander, global managing director of Risk Management Solutions, which worked on the report, said the instruments aimed to ease the initial costs of building to withstand disasters, and to finance the risks that remain. \"In this way the benefits of insurance can be enjoyed by those who need it most,\" he said in a statement. But some climate change experts argue that insurance is not the best method to help the poor cope with the growing damage caused by wilder weather and rising seas as the planet warms. In a September report, the Heinrich Boll Stiftung North America, an environmental foundation, said regional insurance schemes, from which African, Caribbean or Pacific states can buy coverage, had paid out too little, too late in recent years. It proposed other options to support developing countries, such as international funding to build up social safety nets, relocate vulnerable communities and develop new ways of making a living for those at risk. Carnegie-Brown of Lloyd's said that, for poorer nations such as Bangladesh, buying insurance was a \"low-order issue\" compared to other economic problems. He urged donor governments to work with financial markets to find ways to use aid money to boost protection, adding that current efforts are fragmented and not expanding fast enough. \"The developed world is not really assisting the countries least able to afford the resilience investment that we think they need,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation."

      "text": "In Barisal's wholesale fish market in the Port Road area of the city, prices are dropping every day The haul of ilish from the coastal Bay of Bengal and the Meghna estuary is exceptional this year, bringing good news for consumers and traders, but bad news for the fishermen. In Barisal's wholesale fish market in the Port Road area of the city, prices are dropping every day. River ilish, however, is rarer this year. On Wednesday and Thursday, this correspondent found more than fifty fishing trawlers, carrying ilish netted from the Bhola coastal area, anchored at the Barisal Port Road Ilish Mokam. The fish were netted from the coastal Bay of Bengal and Meghna River estuary. Nirob Hossain Tutul, secretary of `Port Road Matso Arotdar Samittee,' the fish traders' association, said on average 2,500 maund (approx. 40kg) of ilish from the sea are coming to the market daily. Most of the ilish are 500-600 grams and due to the massive supply, the prices are lower compared to the last year. Ilish, the most popular fish in the Bangali cuisine, provides employment to about 450,000 fishermen and its trade involves another four to five million. According to 2015 data, the national fish of Bangladesh contributes about 12% of the total fish production and about 1% of the GDP. Nirob said traders and their workers were busy packing the fish with ice to be sent to Dhaka, Chittagong and other districts of the country. The going price for ilish from the sea is Tk19,000 - 23,000 per maund, and for ilish netted in the rivers it is Tk35,000 - 36,000, he added.  \"The supply of ilish netted from local sweet water rivers has dropped and therefore its price is higher,\" he said. Ilish netted from sweet water is considered tastier and fresher.  Bimal Chandra Das, district fisheries officer (ilish), said mother ilish enter the rivers to lay eggs and then return to the sea.  The young fish, Jatka, start their journey to the sea around two to three months later.  Round the year restrictions against catching and selling Jatka appears to have increased the ilish stock, the officer said. \"But due to rough weather prevailing in the sea this season, fishermen had not been able to fish for ilish,\" he added. Rashid Majhi, a fisherman from Bhola, said this year the rains started late but still he had netted a satisfactory amount of ilish. However, big hauls had caused the price to drop. Samad Majhi, another ilish trader from the Charfasson coast of Bhola, said if the weather conditions were better, even more fish could have been caught. Awal Majhi, from the same area, said: \"I was at the sea for a week with 13 crew and fishermen. We brought in a giant haul, but on reaching the Barisal market, I felt disappointed with the falling price.\" \" I am anxious now, not about repeating profits, but about recovering my costs,\" he added. On other hand ilish trader Bazlu Mia from Kalapara, Patuakhali, said he had come to Barisal with truckloads of fish instead of selling his haul at Patuakhali in the hope of better prices. \"But it was of no use. We are now thinking of preserving the fish supply in ice to get a better price in the future,\" he added. Retail ilish trader Akbor Hossain said the massive supply had lowered the price because ilish is a perishable item.  "

But, the local markets are yet to reap the benefits of the decision.\"\nVisiting a number of local retail markets in the capital, the correspondent has found that the local onions are being sold at a price of Tk60 to Tk65 Kg, and imported onions are being sold at Tk55 to Tk60 per Kg.\nThe traders defended their price by saying that the onions that are currently being sold were bought with a high price and the new imports of onions are yet to arrive in the markets.\nJust a few weeks ago, the local onions were priced at around Tk130 per Kg, and onions imported from India were available at Tk110.\nCompared to January, 2017, the price of onions has increased by at least Tk20 to Tk25 in January this year.\nLast season, the production of onions in India went down due to a severe drought, which in turn increased the prices both in India and in Bangladesh.\nThe prices saw yet another increase after torrential rain caused floods in several states of India last year, further pushing the onion price to Tk120-130 per Kg in most markets throughout Bangladesh.\nAround two years after withdrawing the MEP, the Indian central government re-imposed MEP on onions on November 23, 2017 at a price of $850 (Tk70,472) per ton, which was reduced to $700 (Tk58,036) on January 19 this year.\nIn a latest development on February 1, the Indian government completely removed the minimum export price (MEP) on onions.\nOn February 2, directives regarding the removal of MEP arrived at the Hili customs station, effectively withdrawing the requirement of minimum export prices, and it came into effect on February 3, 2018. The customs server has also been updated with accordingly.\nSources from the Hili customs station have confirmed the matter to the correspondent.\n\nAlso Read- India removes minimum export price on onions\n\nThe correspondent has also learned that two of India's largest marketplaces named Lasalgaon Onion Market and Kashik Onion Market, had witnessed a major drop in onion prices only a few months ago.\nIn August, 2017 per one hundred Kgs of onions were priced at 2,600 Rupees, but the price came crashing to 900 Rupees in September the same year.\nOther marketplaces in India also witnessed the same trend of onion price drop. But the onion prices in Bangladesh are not reflecting the major price cut in India. Compared to major marketplaces, the onions prices are even higher in markets littered around different neighbourhood in Dhaka, frequently reaching Tk65 per Kg.\nThe Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB), however, claimed in a recent statement that the price of onions has gone down by Tk10 since the last week.\nTo counter the price hike of onions in the Indian market during July, 2017, decision was taken to import onions from Egypt.\nCommenting of the matter, Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed at the parliament recently said: \"No syndicates interfered with the production, import, distribution and caused the skyrocketing prices of onions. Bangladesh's primary source of onion import is India.\"\nHe pointed out that the floods in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra last year had damaged onion production there, causing the MEP to hit $850.\n\"The high import cost affected the local markets of Bangladesh but onion price is starting to drop, and it will drop further soon,\" Tofail said.\nAccording to the sources from the Commerce Ministry, Bangladesh has an annual demand of 2,200,000 to 2,500,000 metric tons of onions. Last season, the country produced 1,750,000 metric tons of onions, while the deficit of around 700,000 metric tons is usually covered through imports.\nThis article was first published on bangaltribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

More than 10,000 people are trapped in the flood water, so far, reports UNB. The trans-boundary Teesta River was flowing 8cm above the danger level at Doyani point on Tuesday morning. The officials of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) said the situation became worsened when India opened the sluice-gates of the Gazaldoba barrage. \"Now, water is gushing into Bangladesh,\" they added.  Meanwhile, 44 gates of the Teesta barrage have been opened to control water flow. Additionally, the temporary dams of Dhurni village of Hatibandha upazila in Lalmonirhat are also at risk, they said. According to locals, the water level started to rise on Monday morning and the condition is gradually worsening. BWDB Executive Engineer Rafiqul Alam Chowdhury of the Teesta Barrage Irrigation Project said the situation will be worse if the onrush of water from upstream hilly areas continues."

      "authors": "Reuters, Kochi",
      "text": "India's national carrier Air India will operate ATR flights from the naval airport in Kochi to Bangalore and Coimbatore, starting Monday A deluge in India's flood-stricken southwestern state of Kerala finally let up on Sunday, giving some respite for thousands of marooned families, while authorities feared an outbreak of disease among two million people crammed into relief camps. Incessant rains since August 8 have caused the state's worst floods in a century, and at least 357 people have perished, many of them killed by landslides. The beaches and backwaters of Kerala are top destinations for domestic and international tourists, but far fewer visit during the monsoon season. The India Meteorological Department forecast heavy rainfall only at one or two places of Kerala on Sunday and withdrew a red alert in several districts. Flood waters too began to recede from several places. Using boats and helicopters, India's military has led rescue efforts to reach people in communities cut off for days by the floods, with many trapped on roof tops and the upper floors of their homes, and in desperate need of food and potable water. Rescue teams were focused on the town of Chengannur on the banks of the Pamba River, where some 5,000 people are feared to be trapped, officials said. More than 200,000 families have taken refuge at relief camps set up across the state, an official at the Kerala State Disaster Management office said. Kerala's chief minister had earlier said two million people had taken shelter in camps since the monsoon rains began three months ago. Anil Vasudevan, who handles disaster management at the Kerala health department, said authorities had isolated three people with chickenpox in one of the relief camps in Aluva town, nearly 250km from state capital Thiruvananthapuram. He said the department was preparing to deal with a possible outbreak of water-borne and air-borne diseases in the camps, where an estimated two million people have taken shelter since the monsoon rains began three months ago. Kerala, which usually receives high rainfall, has seen over 250% more rain than normal between August 8 and August 15, causing the state authorities to release water from 35 dangerously full dams, sending a surge into its main river.  As the rain abated on Sunday morning, one resident in Cheranelloor, a suburb of Kochi situated on the banks of the Periyar river, visited his home to see when he and his family could return. \"The entire house is covered with mud. It will take days to clean to make it liveable. All our household articles, including the TV and fridge have been destroyed,\" 60-year-old T P Johnny told Reuters. Kochi's airport is closed due to waterlogging, and Jet Airways has arranged additional flights from Thiruvananthapuram for passengers holding confirmed tickets from Kochi. India's national carrier Air India will operate ATR flights from the naval airport in Kochi to Bangalore and Coimbatore, starting Monday. Late on Saturday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that there was no shortage of food in the state as traders had stocked up ahead of a local festival. \"The only problem is transporting it,\" he told reporters. \"The central government and public have cooperated well in this effort to fight this disaster.\" He also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who visited the state on Saturday, announced an assistance of Rs5 billion against his request for Rs20 billion. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of the United Arab Emirates, where many Keralites work, has also offered assistance to the state."

      "text": "\nWho is behind the rice price hikes?\n\n\n\n\nBilkis Irani\n\n\n\n\n Published at 01:59 am February 1st, 2018\n\n\n Last updated at 02:01 am February 1st, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nBangladesh imported over two million tons of rice between June and December last year. It is extraordinary when one takes into account the scanty 7,100 tons imported in the previous fiscal year.\nFloods and pests had a devastating effect on major rice basins during both the Aman and Boro seasons, prompting the government to import rice in a vain attempt to stabilize prices.\nThe leap in rice prices at the consumers' end reflects the increased price of paddy sold by the farmers. Since most farmers suffered huge losses because of the floods and pest attacks, the increase in price can be considered a tawdry compensation.\nAzizar Rahman was issuing instructions to farm labourers he hired to harvest the crop on the morning of December 1. Azizar, a farmer from the village of Makhmalpur in Naogaon, needs the extra hands during the harvest like most large-scale farmers.\nIn the previous Aman season, he sold coarse paddy varieties at the rate of Tk800 for every 40kg (1 maund*). This time around, brokers scouting the neighbourhood are offering as much as Tk1,000.\nBut the yield this season has been disappointing. A storm in October ravaged the paddy fields, cutting down the output of every bigha of farmland (1 bigha = 33 decimals) by at least 200kg.\nAzizar could usually harvest around 3,200kg of paddy from his lands, but his final yield was only around 2,000kg.\n\"I had to buy seeds at Tk35 per kg. I spent money on fertilizers and insecticides. The market price of paddy is around Tk980-1000, this cannot cover my expenses. I could only make a profit if the price was Tk1,200 or more.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_244023\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Workers are seen drying paddy out on the floor of a rice processing mill Photo: Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nNurullah Miah, who brought his fresh harvest to a haat (weekly market) in Mohadevpur on December 2, said: \"Brokers usually offer low prices before the harvest. I brought my harvest to the haat so that I can directly sell to miller agents to fetch a higher price.\"\nHe complained that brokers and millers are the ones who control the price and reap the benefits when the rice is sold at higher prices in cities.\nNurul Islam, a broker at Mohadevpur haat, claimed buying the paddy before the harvest is the only way to make any profit.\nSeveral other brokers agreed, noting that they lack the facilities to stock paddy. Brokers make a profit of Tk10-50 for every 40kg of paddy when they sell to millers, who in turn make profits of Tk10 for every 40kg.\nThey also claim that paddy prices have risen because the millers' demand is always greater than the market supply. When compounded with the drop in supply due to disasters, the rice price hike is the result, according to several brokers.\n\"The government has fixed Tk39 per kg to buy Guti Swarna (coarse rice) from us, but after processing, it costs Tk41 per kg. We are now purchasing paddy at Tk1,013-1,020 for every 40kg,\" he added.\nMd Anisur Rahman, proprietor of Messers Tosiron Automatic Rice mill in Naogoan sadar, said the wholesalers in big cities and brokers who buy rice from the millers are the ones who manipulate the market price.\n\nDhaka's wholesalers, however, denied the allegation saying: \"A wholesaler in Dhaka can store 50-60 tons of rice at most. Auto rice mills can store at least 1,000 tons. You tell me who can hoard enough rice to manipulate the price,\" said Rafiqul Islam, organizing secretary of Babubazar and Badamtoli Wholesale Rice Market Owners' Association.\nThe market price does not establish that wholesalers and their agents are making a lot of profit. Sacks of 50kg of rice was bought at Tk1,950 in early December. The rice was sold at Tk41-45 in Dhaka, a profit of roughly Tk1-6.\nCurrently, retail price of coarse rice in Dhaka stands between Tk45-46 per kg\nDr Asaduzzaman, research fellow at Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, told the Dhaka Tribune that the rise in rice prices was to be expected due to the twofold floods and pest attack.\nHe, however, pointed out that the government acted promptly by cutting import duties to increase rice import to meet the shortfall, and the current erratic nature of the price is out of fear and speculation.\n\"Maybe farmers are afraid, and they are hoarding some. Maybe the millers also feel the same way and stockpiling,\" he observed.\n\"There is no denying the production loss this year. But if about two million tons of rice has already been imported - it is a record amount and far surpasses the estimated crop loss - the market must have been flooded with rice. The government should not have let permitted such a huge import of rice.\nThere should have been conditions on the importers to sell whenever the government asks. The state can always regulate, if it is willing,\" he added.\nA recent report by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecast that the Aman output in 2017 would stand at 13 million tons, down by 350,000 tons from 2016.\nFloods ruined 591,647 hectares of Aman paddy field in 32 districts last year, according to a government estimate.\nDhaka Tribune correspondents from Nilphamri, Naogaon, Sylhet, Narail, Habiganj and Chapainawabganj also reported pest attacks late in the Aman season.\nThroughout March-April, a series of flash floods hit the northeastern districts. The government admitted the Boro output would be some 450,000 tons less than the 19.1 million tons target.\nAccording the Ministry of Food, as of December 21, 2017, about 464,000 tons of rice was imported by the government and 1.705 million tons by private importers in the current fiscal year.\n \n\nAdditional reporting by Sazzadur Rahman Sazzad, Khondaker Md Abdur Rouf, and Md Faruk Hossain\nNote: In rural Bangladesh, paddy is usually measured and sold in bulk using the maund unit of measurement. 1 maund = 40kg.

      "text": "Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable nations when it comes to climate change. It has already observed seasonal variations due to the adverse effects of climate change. For instance, we hardly notice the spring season in Bangladesh anymore. There is hardly rain (like before) in the monsoon but, surprisingly, there is a good amount in winter. The temperature in the atmosphere is increasing alarmingly, and the pattern of rainfall has become unpredictable. Due to environmental degradation, Bangladesh encounters natural disasters like floods, cyclones, storms, sea level surges, riverbank erosion, earthquakes, intermittent droughts, salinity intrusion, tsunamis. There has also been a drastic drop in air quality, as well as frequent thunderstorms and hailstorms.    A report of BBS revealed that Bangladesh has lost Tk18,425 crore due to natural disasters from 2009 to 2014 -- while the total cost of damage and loss by hailstorms was Tk1,147.169cr. The latest deadly storms and lightning in different parts of Bangladesh reflect the wrath of nature. Every year, many people and animals are killed or injured by lightning. In Bangladesh, more than 80 people have been killed by thunderstorms and lightning in the last two months. This is a result of climate change. The air we breathe  Bangladesh has been repeatedly ranked as the most polluted and unliveable cities in the world. It is widely acknowledged by scientists that air pollution is one of the key effects of climate change. It not only fuels climate change, but is also a major threat to human health. It is one of the major environmental concerns in Bangladesh due to our inadequate and dysfunctional disposal sites that create acute health problems. The continuous inhalation of particulate matters consisting of dust, fumes, mist, and smoke cause long-term health problems such as chronic respiratory disease, lung cancer, heart disease, and even damage to the brain, nerves, liver, or kidneys. Repeated exposure to air pollution affects children's lungs and can worsen or complicate medical conditions in the elderly. According to a World Bank report, 15,000 people are killed due to air pollution every year in Bangladesh. Among the top 10 causes of death in Bangladesh, five of them are: Lung cancer (13%), lower respiratory tract infections (7%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (7%), ischemic heart disease (6%), and stroke (5%) -- all related to air pollution.  According to the National Institute of Diseases of Chest and Hospital (NIDCH), nearly seven million people in Bangladesh suffer from asthma -- over half of them children. However, the big questions are: How can we curb air pollution? What are the causes of pollution? Who is responsible for such pollution? How are we responsible for this? A few decades ago, scientists began warning us. However, we were very reluctant to accept that human activities are responsible for climate change. But we continued to pollute the air with exhaust fumes and smoke from our vehicles, factories, and industries. We contribute to greenhouse gas emissions by burning fossil fuels, gasoline, diesel, and other fuels. In order to protect human lives and the environment, it is high time that we create public awareness of all these environmental issues Reckless activity Deforestation is another eminent reason for thunderstorms, which accelerate the greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere -- the heat generated by electricity production, unplanned and unregulated operations of brick-fields, frequent rain-forest fire calamities, industrial productions, black fume generation from the fuel burning engines like street-plying vehicles, water-vehicles, buses, and trains. All this has a monumental impact on the environment. In order to protect human lives and the environment, it is high time that we create public awareness of all these environmental issues via print and electronic media. These frequent deadly storms are yet another wake-up call for all of us. Last but not least, there are a few things that should be considered by policy-makers to save our environment. For example, people of all classes must be concerned with improving the sanitation system, minimizing waste generation, promoting recycling, improving the disposal system, increasing the number of landfills, sorting waste, and more. Moreover, relevant authorities should update the drainage system, impose taxes on polluters, reduce deforestation, and promote plantation by the roadsides without delay.

We do not know more than this. We just sell to our customers.\"\nOnion was sold on Tuesday at Tk60-70 per kg in many markets, the price for which was around Tk20-28 on same day last year, according to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB).\nCoarse rice was sold at Tk35-38 per kg and fine rice at Tk55-68 per kg, while they were priced at Tk42-45 and Tk48-56 respectively, on the same day last year, TCB mentioned.\nPotato was sold at Tk20-25 per kg on Tuesday, price of which was Tk12-18 same time last year, TCB cited.\nWheat flour (atta) was sold at Tk28-38 and flour (moyda) at Tk45-48 per kg, prices of which were Tk26-34 and Tk38-40, respectively, at the same time in 2017.\n\nCinnamon was being sold Tk350-420 per kg as opposed to prices of Tk280-350 last year.\nFive litres of soybean oil were being sold at Tk510-535 as opposed to Tk465-500 same time last year.\nBeef was sold at Tk420-440 per kg last year as opposed to current prices of Tk480-500.\nMutton was being sold at Tk700-780 per kg, price for which was around Tk550-600 same time in 2017.\nLocal chicken local was being sold at Tk350-380 per kg but it had been sold at Tk330-360 last year.\nFull cream instant milk powder (Dano) was being sold at Tk580-600 as opposed to prices of Tk560-585 same time last year, TCB mentioned.\nThe year 2017 witnessed vast sufferings of the people in low and fixed income groups, with the added pressure of the recent floods in the northeastern districts of the country, and the recent Rohingya issue.\nResidents of Dhaka alleged that some unscrupulous businessmen created this situation in the market and drove up the prices by hoarding goods. Heavy rain and the recent flood resulted in crop damage and vegetable supply crunch multiplying woes of the people.\nTabassum Tania, a resident of Kalabagan in Dhaka, said: \"We have to survive and there is no alternative to buying these goods. We are bound to buy whatever the price is.\"\nAccording to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, food production dropped by 943,000 tons in FY2016-17. Due the recent flood, crops, vegetables, livestock and fish stocks, and household food reserves have taken a major hit.\nFloods and heavy rain damaged vegetables on 900 hectares of land for which farmers of 42 districts of the country suffered immensely.\nSM Nazer Hossain, vice-president of the Consumer Association of Bangladesh, said: \"Flood, the Rohingya issue, and the government's indifference are the causes behind these hike in prices.\n\"We are now especially dependent on India as we have become import dependent for these daily goods. That is why the prices have increased,\" he also said.\n\"The prices have gone up because of manipulation by some unscrupulous businessmen. The government could bring the prices down by giving subsidies and instructing the Food Ministry to sell these goods in the open market. But we did not see such steps,\" Nazer Hossain added.\nHe also said the government could sit with the people involved and look for alternative countries to India where prices for these goods are cheaper.\n\"The government should encourage farmers to cultivate more food and vegetables. They are not interested now to cultivate these following losses day after day. So the government must assist them directly and buy the food crops from them instead of third person,\" he further said.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "authors": "UNB",
      "text": "Some 93% of education sector's requirement for Rohingya emergency remained unmet in 2017 International support is vital for countries like Bangladesh to make the shift towards inclusive education ensuring literacy for Rohingyas living in Bangladesh. The statement was made in the new global- The 2019 Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report - Migration, displacement and education: Building Bridges, Not Walls- published by Unesco on Tuesday. Bangladesh is one of only two countries in the list of top 10 host countries not providing inclusive education to refugees, though Bangladesh officially does not term Rohingyas as refugees, the report said. Some 93% of the education sector's $26 million requirement for the Rohingya emergency in Bangladesh was not met in 2017, while the food security sector exceeded its target. The report analysed the impact of the movement of people on education systems but also the impact education can have, supporting societies to respond to the challenges and opportunities posed by migration and displacement. Among the top 10 countries hosting refugees, Bangladesh has so far excluded Rohingyas from its national education system, while Pakistan has had an ambivalent stance, the report said mentioning that even there, one of the provinces, Balochistan, includes refugees in its education plan. Between the end of August 2017 and early May 2018, around 800,000 Rohingyas arrived in Cox's Bazar district fleeing targeted violence in Rakhine state, Myanmar. Over 90% resides in spontaneous and makeshift settlements or host communities in over 1,600 locations in Cox's Bazar, a district close to the Myanmar border. The government of Bangladesh also has come a long way in changing its approach, the report observed. For decades, Bangladesh refused to recognize the majority of Rohingya residing in the country as refugees since 1978. Bangladesh, according to the report, was reluctant about addressing their education needs, did not accept international assistance, to the extent that it would dismantle centres set up by humanitarian organisations, and it was sensitive on the language of instruction. In 2016, Bangladesh revised its Strategy for Myanmar Refugees and Undocumented Myanmar Nationals, listing education as an intervention area for the first time. This encouraged humanitarian efforts and sensitised local authorities before the massive influx. The report has not only listed problems but also collected evidence from all over the world about changes of heart. It mentioned that governments are rapidly embracing the inclusion of refugees in their education systems. Bangladesh, along with Malaysia and Thailand, has not ratified key treaty commitments to non-discrimination, the report said. Without this legal status and protection, Rohingya children are often denied access to education. Instead, education for refugees continues to be in separate, community-based or private schools, which may or may not be certified. The report cited the government's reluctance to support non-UN agencies providing language services during the Rohingya crisis, a key element for inclusion. Globally, only a third of the funding gap for refugee education has been filled. Had the international community used only humanitarian aid, then a tenfold increase in the share education receives would have been necessary to meet refugees' education needs, the report stated. The report called for development aid to help fill the gap and provide much needed long-term and predictable resources to national education systems for supporting refugees and host communities.  Director of the Report Manos Antoninis said considerable changes are being made in countries from Chad and Uganda to Lebanon and Turkey to let refugees attend school alongside with nationals, which they are not yet seeing in Bangladesh, Pakistan or Thailand. Antoninis said: \"Positive steps were taken to list education as an intervention area for the first time in 2016, but the government must now lead on that initiative and stop treating refugees differently.\" \"Bangladesh is signing up to the two new global compacts on refugees and migrants which shows that they recognize education as an opportunity. We hope this will be a much-awaited turning point away from discrimination in education,\" the director added. Internal Migrants & Slums Mass migration to slums has left millions without basic services, including public education in Bangladesh. Out of school rates for children and adolescents in Bangladeshi slums in 2016 were twice as high as in other urban areas, the report says. A slum settlement survey in Dhaka, Bangladesh, showed that there were fewer than 300 government primary schools in slums, and only about one-quarter of slums were estimated to have a government school. These needs are going to grow, the report said mentioning that a government census showed that, between 1997 and 2014, slums increased from 3,000 to 14,000. Globally, the 2019 GEM Report estimates that there could be 80 million more children in slums, equivalent to 2.6 million classrooms of children by 2030. Internal Migrants & Seasonal Workers In Bangladesh, more than 2.6 million rural migrant workers were employed in construction outside the agricultural seasons in 2010. Such seasonal migration can disrupt education and expose children to child labour and workplace hazards, forcing them to leave school. Internally Displaced Earthquakes, storms, floods and rising sea level damage 900 schools each year in Bangladesh, on average. A household and school survey around the time of the 2004 flood showed that, while 30% of schools closed at some point because of flooding, about 15% closed for two weeks or more. Affected schools were closed an average of seven days more than in the previous year. Attendance was one-third lower of schools that were open on affected days. The report praised the government's aim to make its education systems prepared and responsive to such disasters. The report recommended protecting the right to education of migrants and displaced people, include migrants and displaced people in the national education system, understand and plan for the education needs of migrants and displaced people, and represent migration and displacement histories in education accurately to challenge prejudices. The report suggested initiatives to prepare teachers of migrants and refugees to address diversity and hardship, harness the potential of migrants and displaced people, and support education needs of migrants and displaced people in humanitarian and development aid."

      "text": "The influx of refugees is wreaking havoc on the environment through the depletion of natural resources Accommodating nearly a million Rohingya refugees in Cox's Bazar is taking a significant toll on the environment. As the Rohingyas cut down trees for timber and firewood, the forests of Cox's Bazar are at immediate risk. The United Nations' Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) published a report which said the Rohingya refugees collect 700 tons of firewood every day. In order to acquire that much timber on a daily basis, forestland equal to the combined size of four football fields would have to be cut down. So far, around 2,000 hectares of forestland has disappeared. The Energy and Environment Technical Working Group of the ISCG expressed concern that the entire forestland of Cox's Bazar is likely disappear by 2019, if the current rate of deforestation continues unabated.   The humanitarian crisis is well on its way to a rapidly escalating environmental crisis as landslides and flash floods are becoming more and more frequent. The rapid and extensive deforestation has led to destruction of key watersheds causing mass erosion, landslides, flash floods, and a dramatic reduction in the recharge of ground water reserves, the report said. The Cox's Bazar area is undergoing heavy loss of topsoil and an increased risk of flash floods due to denuded slopes and hillsides.     According to the report, 86% of drinking water wells have been contaminated with hazardous bacteria E.coli from unmanaged faecal matter. Irrigation wells are not functioning due to watershed destruction and diminished water table. Agricultural lands near the refugee camps have been facing siltation and contamination from faecal matter. Massive cooking activities and garbage burning are increasing the level of air pollution. The report estimates that at least 1,500 hectares of wildlife habitat have been eradicated so far. Wild Asian elephants and other species have lost their habitats and had their natural lives disrupted. Besides, the influx of refugees has depleted marine resources due to overfishing and destructive practices. The increase in the number of fishing vessels using harmful techniques has disrupted the reproductive cycle of key species and has had detrimental impact on fish stocks.  The report says the situation requires creating awareness among fishing communities on legal standards and fishing regulations (seasonal bans and appropriate technology) as well as providing alternative income generating opportunities.  Furthermore, it recommends immediate action like providing alternative clean fuel like LPG to the Rohingyas to avoid the total loss of forestland."

The reserves dropped to $31.93 billion from $33.36 billion between February 28 and March 8, according to the central bank.\nOfficials of the central bank say import costs have increased, particularly after the rise in onion and rice prices in India. Moreover, the reserves took a hit after clearing payment for imports of Asian Clearing Union (ACU).\nA Bangladesh Bank official says there is no reason to panic at the decline of the reserves mainly because of a rise in import cost. \"It will be possible to foot import bills for the next six to seven months with the current reserves,\" the official added.\nAccording to the central bank, the import cost increased by 25.78% in the first six months of the 2017-18 fiscal compared to the same period the previous year. During July to December, food import (rice and wheat) increased by 212%.\nThe import of necessary machinery for setting up industries rose by about 35% during this period while the import of fuel oil and raw material for industries increased by 28% and 15% respectively.\nIn the first six months of this year, Letters of Credit (LC) worth $40 billion were opened. The amount is expected to cross $60 billion at the yearend.\nBangladesh's foreign currency reserves stood at $33.01 billion on June 21 last year. It came down to $32.31 billion on January 17 this year.\nThe country was witnessing a rise in forex reserves over the last few years but the import cost jumped in the election year, putting pressure on the reserves. However, remittance inflow and export income are increasing.\nBangladesh Institute of Development Studies researcher Dr Zaid Bakht said there was no reason to panic even though the forex reserves had declined a little due to increased import cost.\n\"The works of some big projects like Padma Bridge and metro rail are going on in full swing. The cost for importing necessary equipment for these projects is increasing,\" he noted.\n\"On the other hand, the import of foodgrains increased after floods destroyed crops. This is also putting pressure on the reserves,\" he added.\nInternational standards require a country to have reserves to meet import costs of at least three months. With Bangladesh's current reserves, it will be possible to meet foot import bills of more than eight months.\nMeanwhile, a big balance of payment deficit has emerged with the increase in import costs. In the first six months of the current fiscal, the amount stood at $4.767 billion.\nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "BRAC University is providing a three-year course to train midwives to improve maternal and neonatal health services in Bangladesh  Scores of midwives are working in the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar to ensure health security, deliver babies and help young mothers. About 148 midwives, who completed a diploma course under the Developing Midwives Project from Brac University,are working in the camps to deal with any critical situation, provide treatment to pregnant women and newborn babies.  They also provide emergency services for those affected by sexually transmitted diseases and sexual violence, and family planning for the displaced Rohingya community, said Dr Sharmina Rahman, strategy adviser of the project. The midwives from Brac University have so far delivered about 3,200 babies in the last six months, she said. Midwives working in the Kutubkhali Rohingya campsaid initially the Rohingya women did not want to meet doctors fearing that sensitive issues will become public.  But the situation has changed now, said Nazma Akter, a midwife who works at the Lambashia Brac village in the Kutubkhali camp.  \"Rohingya women now trust midwives as they know that we are helping them secure their health,\" she said. Language also acts as a barrier for the midwives to reach the Rohingya women, said Nazma, who completed a three-year diploma in midwifery education under the Developing Midwives Project at James P Grant School of Public Health of Brac University.  Brac University supplies midwives to the Hope Foundation that provides healthcare to underserved women and children across the country as well as Rohingyas. The foundation's Country Director Commander (Rtd) SM Ferdousuzzaman said midwives are working tirelessly in field camps to provide basic healthcare needs to the refugee population.  \"Midwives in Hope clinics have been providing maternal, newborn, and women's healthcare to ensure basic women's rights and healthcare to the Rohingya women,\" he said. Ferdous added that midwives are also working very intensively with pregnant Rohingya women who were tortured and mentally traumatized. However, he admitted that even with limited number of midwives, Hope Foundation is ensuring qualitative and successful healthcare to the Rohingya people. The midwives are working as part of a national program backed by the Bangladesh government and supported by UNFPA and the World Health Organization to improve maternal health and reduce infant mortality, particularly in rural areas. The midwives at the Rohingya camps have been trained for crisis situation, including floods. The Developing Midwives Project has been implementing a three-year diploma in midwifery education under James P Grant School of Public Health, Brac University with a vision to improve maternal and neonatal health services in Bangladesh since April 2012 with UK Aid funding from the UK government. It has targeted to train 1,317 midwives by 2021."

      "text": "Plastic waste constitutes more than 60% of the litter found in the beaches of Bangladesh, according to a survey Bangladesh, as a part of the South Asian Seas (SAS) region, currently faces the worst case scenario of sea pollution due to plastic - one of the worst pollutants that are harming the seas and oceans around the world.Marine litter or debris, which include plastic wastes, are the persistent, manufactured, processed solid material found in marine and coastal areas - predominantly the result of poor waste management - is a fundamental problem due to its harmful effect on the environment, wildlife and human health in the Bay of Bengal, says a country report based on the reviews of scientific and policy documents together with a recent preliminary survey on marine litter along four beaches of Bangladesh.The report, titled \"National Status including Database, Proposed Recycling Enterprise and Interventions on Marine Litter,\" is the outcome of a South Asian Seas Program (SASP) called the Preparation of Regional Action Plan on Marine Litter in the SAS region.The Department of Environment under the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change prepared the report, is the first of its kind in Bangladesh, with technical support from the South Asia Cooperative Environment Programme (SACEP) and funding from the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep).According to the report, marine litter reaches the ocean from the land through river runoff, drainage system, wind action and intentional or unintentional discharge of materials in the sea due to human activities.A total of 6,705 pieces of waste products were found on a 18.5km stretch of the four sea beaches - Laboni and Inani in Cox's Bazar, and Ananda Bazar and Patenga in Chittagong - in Bangladesh during the survey.Among the litter, 63% were found to be plastic, 13% foamed plastic, 2% cloth, 1% glass and ceramic, 1% metal, 9% paper and cardboard, 3% rubber, 1% wood, and 7% other materials.Plastic bags were found to be the most common type of litter: at least 2,182 pieces of plastic bags were found on the beaches. The survey also found 589 pieces of insulation and packaging foam, 470 pieces of cigarette butts and filters, and 300 bottles.The survey also found bottle caps and lids, drums, jerry cans, buckets, disposable utensils, straws, stirrers, drink packaging, food containers, bags, gloves, cigarette lighters, syringes, baskets, crates and trays, mesh bags, fishing gear, and many other kinds of plastic waste on the four beaches.The report made a number of recommendations to bring down and control the reckless dumping of plastic waste on the beaches. Origin and impactsAccording to the report, there are two sources of marine litter: sea and land.The sea-based sources include merchant ships, ferries and cruise liners, fishing vessels, offshore oil and gas platforms, and fish farming installations, while the land-based ones include sewage, municipal and industrial wastes.Around 80% of the litter on the beaches, including industrial products and waste, come from the second source.Most of the industries in Bangladesh are situated near the major river systems such as the Buriganga, Shitalakkhya, Balu, Turag, Karnaphuli, Rupsa, and Meghna - all of which end up in the Bay of Bengal.These industries directly dispose their industrial waste into these rivers without proper management, which ultimately end up in the Bay.Globally, plastic is one of the most dangerous pollutants for seas and oceans. It is directly affecting the ecology and biodiversity of the oceans because of its non-biodegradable nature.Plastic lasts up to a 1,000 years, and accounts for nearly 90% of the debris in the oceans around the world. Plastic also kills up to one million sea birds and 100,000 sea mammals and countless fish every year.Also, plastic litter breaks into small pieces called microplastic, which affects many species, including seabirds, marine mammals and fish through entanglement and ingestion, and humans after entering the food chain. Microplastic beads can also cause cancer in humans.  Experts and DoE's takeThe Department of Environment (DoE), together with other government and non-government agencies, have introduced many policies and strategies to control the plastic pollution over the years.\"It is the duty of the city corporations and municipalities to properly manage waste, not the DoE's,\" said Dr Fahmida Khanom, DoE director of natural resource management and research, regarding the report. \"We can ask them to collect the waste and keep the beaches, seas and ultimately the environment clean. But what we ultimately need is productive coordination among all the authorities responsible for waste management across the country.\"She further said: \"This is the first study we have prepared. The results do seem bad, but it is the starting point of something good.\"Prof Md Kawser Ahmed of Dhaka University oceanography department, who was a consultant in the survey, said: \"We surveyed only macroplastic in the beach areas, not underwater. We still do not know the microplastic scenario. We need to conduct a lot more large-scale studies to know the underwater pollution and microplastic situation.\"Environment and Social Development Organization (ESDO) Secretary General Dr Shahriar Hossain added that there was no alternative other than banning plastic from all stages in society. \"As long as it's not, we should manage our waste properly. Single use plastic materials should also be banned immediately.\"In 2002, Bangladesh became the world's first country to ban thinner plastic bags after they were found to have choked the drainage system during devastating floods. All types of production, marketing, carrying, and using of plastic bags were made a punishable crime.However, they are still widely used, ignoring the ban.Measures and recommendationsThe report recommended formulating different strategies and action plans at the regional, national and local levels to minimize the impact of plastic wastes and other marine litter.The 3R's - Reduce, Reuse and Recycle - policy has achieved much attention of many countries in tackling the issue, according to the report. Two other R's - Refuse and Redesign - were also added recently to the policy.The National 3R Strategy for Waste Management was launched in Bangladesh in 2010. The city corporations and municipalities are making efforts to incorporate the concepts and guidance of this strategy in improving their solid waste management activities.Similar strategies should be initiated and implemented on an urgent basis for better management of marine litter in the country, the report said.It also recommended raising awareness about littering through academic activities and information campaigns to convey the effect of littering - near the marine areas as well as in general - to the public and initiate a long-term behavioural change."

      "text": "Onions, the most consumed spice in the country, are a quintessential ingredient in many popular Bangladeshi delicacies, especially ones involving meat Every year as the second most celebrated Muslim festival, Eid-ul-Adha (Feast of Sacrifice), approaches, cost of two of the most essential elements of the festival- cows and onions- most certainly skyrocket in Bangladesh regardless of their flow in the market.  Onions, the most consumed spice in the country, are a quintessential ingredient in many popular Bangladeshi delicacies, especially ones involving meat. The demand for it is always high--but it multiplies twofold during festivals like Eid-ul-Adha, as does its price.  The Bangladeshi grocery market, known for being perennially unstable, predominantly offers two varieties of onions- homegrown and Indian - with the price of the former variety being comparatively higher than the latter.  Like every year, both the homegrown and imported onions have seen a sudden surge in prices ahead of Eid and marked a big rise in wholesale and retail markets of Dhaka over the last few days. The hike would be understandable if the supply of onions in the market were intermittent or halted like last season, when the production of onions in India went down due to a severe drought, which in turn increased the prices both in India and in Bangladesh. The prices saw yet another increase after torrential rain caused floods in several states of India last year, further pushing the onion price to Tk120-130 per kg in most markets throughout Bangladesh. The fluctuating onion prices in the Indian market and the resulting minimum export price (MEP) usually affects onion prices in Bangladesh due to the short supply of local production and the higher import costs of Indian onions. Nevertheless, in February the Indian government completely removed the minimum export price (MEP) on onions and as of 2016, the Bangladeshi government withdrew all taxes on onion import aiming to keep prices stable in the local market, according to sources at Benapole Customs House, which eventually should have brought the price down.   But defying the rule of economics, the price just kept increasing for most of the year. Compared to January, 2017, the price of onions has increased by at least Tk20 to Tk25 in January this year. \"Each ton of onion is being imported at a cost of $205 (Tk17, 200). So the import cost of each kg is Tk18 and on top of that, transport costing is Tk2 per kg,\" Rafiqul Islam Royal, owner of Royal Enterprise, a Benapole-based clearing and forwarding agent, said, \"Adding to that, the price is being hiked in the local market because of the shortage.\"  Benapole port authorities said that 4,738 tons of onions were imported into the country from India through the land port in the last six days (until August 13). Yet, the Indian onion is being sold in local markets at Tk35 per kg while the local variety is being sold at Tk55-60 per kg.  Behind this fake crisis-driven price hike is a money-grubbing syndicate, according to Shaheen Reza, an onion importer, who controls the commodity price in the local market. Despite all the endeavors by both governments, consumers from this side of the border failed to reap the benefits of the adjustments because of this syndicate, since some unscrupulous businessmen known for increasing the onion price, cash in on the situation. \"We sell onion to the wholesalers after keeping a minimum profit, but they sell these to others keeping a huge margin,\" he said, adding that the authorities should ensure a strong market.  Market sources also blamed lax monitoring for the sudden surge in onion prices.  According to the sources from the Commerce Ministry, Bangladesh has an annual demand of 2,200,000 to 2,500,000 metric tons of onions. Last season, the country produced 1,750,000 metric tons of onions, while the deficit of around 700,000 metric tons is usually covered through imports. A study conducted by International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), predicted that the demand for onions is expected to increase by 51 percent this decade--from 1.23 million metric tons in 2010 to 1.86 million metric tons in 2020--under the business-as-usual scenario, while under an optimistic income growth scenario, it's expected to increase by 69 percent to 2.08 million metric tons. Under the circumstances, it is now imperative for Bangladesh to decrease dependency on India for onion import and vulnerability to climate-induced losses by importing onions from alternative sources. However, a careful assessment of the impacts of onion imports on prices to avoid reducing prices - so much so that they become a disincentive for Bangladeshi farmers to produce onion - is also a prerequisite.  The IFPRI study recommended that the government ensure a structured and regulated flow of the locally produced onions by being vigilant against speculative storage between September and December, when Bangladesh is most dependent on onion imports. They also suggested that in order to mitigate the dependency on onion imports, steps must be taken to increase domestic production. "

      "text": "The prime minister said the government in its National Integrated Multimodal Transport Policy has put forward a strategy that will seek to strengthen the position of inland waterways in the transport system Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday underscored the need for proper utilization of the maritime sector for massive socioeconomic development of the people of this region. \"There is a huge potential in the maritime sector in South Asia and utilizing the sector, it is possible to make a big lead into the socioeconomic development of the people of this region,\" she said while addressing the inaugural session of the Second South Asia Maritime and Logistics Forum 2018 at a hotel in Dhaka, reports BSS. \"We don't think only about our own country, we also give importance to the socioeconomic development of all people of this region through regional cooperation and maintaining contact,\" the premier said. Sheikh Hasina said her government is committed to improving navigability of the rivers and ensuring safe and secure river routes for transportation of people and goods. \"Initiatives have been undertaken to dredge the rivers to maintain navigability,\" she said. The Ministry of Shipping in cooperation with the Colombo International Maritime Conference Events and India's Gateway Media Pvt Ltd has jointly organized the two-day event to attract investment in the infrastructure and innovation of new technology in the shipping sector. Shipping Minister Shajahan Khan, Indian Union Minister for Shipping and Road Transport Mansukh Mandaviya, Sri Lankan State Minister for National Policy and Economic Affairs Dr Harsha De Silva, Editor-in-Chief of India's Gateway Media Pvt Ltd Ram Prasad Ravi and Bangladesh's Shipping Secretary Md Abdus Samad also spoke at the function. A short audio-video presentation on Bangladesh's maritime sector was screened at the function. Pointing out that water transport is low-cost, energy-efficient and environment-friendly; Sheikh Hasina said restoring the primacy of inland water transport as a logical and competitive mode of transportation is one of the key priorities for the government. \"We've taken steps to reopen the closed river routes,\" she said, adding dredging is highly economically justified for Bangladesh.  According to experts, she said, savings of transportation costs of cargo resulting from the use of water transport rather than road are estimated at Tk7.5 billion whereas the cost of dredging is estimated at Tk0.6 billion per annum. The prime minister said the government in its National Integrated Multimodal Transport Policy has put forward a strategy that will seek to strengthen the position of inland waterways in the transport system. \"As Bangladesh is dubbed as the country of rivers, it is also famous for building river crafts,\" she said. Sheikh Hasina said the shipbuilding industry flourished here in the ancient time and in continuation of the past, shipbuilding industry shows the path renew of the past glory. \"The ships built in Bangladesh are being exported to various countries including, Denmark, Germany and Poland,\" she said. Quoting statistics, Sheikh Hasina said that the total import-export through waterways was 43.17 million metric tons in the fiscal year 2010-11 which has increased to 73.21 million metric tons in the fiscal year 2016-17. \"With the support of multilateral and bilateral development partners, we will scale up our investments to provide sustained navigability of our waterways, modernize existing river ports, build new ports and inland container depots to improve cargo and passenger handling, and ensure efficiency and safety of all vessels plying our waters,\" she said. Noting that Bangladesh is the largest delta of the world, the premier said its river and floodplains, which make up 80% of the country, support life, livelihoods and the economy. The prime minister said the country faces major inter-related delta challenges in water safety, food security and socio-economic development and is prone to natural calamities such as floods, cyclones, and droughts. Sheikh Hasina said there is already high pressure on the available land and water resources in the delta. She said the government of Bangladesh, in cooperation with the government of the Netherlands, has prepared and endorsed the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. \"One of the main components of Delta Plan is to accelerate the GDP growth through proper utilization of water resources,\" she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh is a country of boundless potentials. \"In the water transport sector, new business opportunities exist such as the development of container transport at home and abroad, as well as the further expansion of dredging programs, ferry services, port management and operations by the private sector,\" she said."

      "text": "Photos posted on social media purportedly showed houses and farmland covered in water and mud after the Panjshir River broke its banks At least 10 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed in a remote area of northeastern Afghanistan after melting snow triggered a landslide, officials said Thursday. A mountain lake in Panjshir, a province north of Kabul known for its snowcapped peaks, overflowed and sent water and mud cascading over Peshghor village, Omar Mohammadi, spokesman for the disaster management ministry, told AFP. Jamil Ahmad was lying in bed just before midnight when he said he heard a sound like \"jets\" flying overhead. \"Somebody shouted 'Flood!' and I ran away with my family to higher ground,\" Ahmad told AFP by telephone.   \"The people started firing (weapons) into the air to warn others about the flood.\" The water and mud had inundated most of the houses in the village, and destroyed a religious school, two mosques and the main market, Ahmad said. \"Three women from my neighbourhood and two labourers who didn't hear the warning were taken away by the flood,\" Ahmad said. Villagers had been worried about the possibility of landslides after several days of increasingly warm weather, Ahmad said. Most survivors were staying on higher ground for fear of more, he added.   Photos posted on social media purportedly showed houses and farmland covered in water and mud after the Panjshir River broke its banks. Villagers using shovels and other tools were desperately searching for survivors in the debris as rescue teams were deployed to the area, Mohammadi said. \"We have deployed everything at hand to help the people,\" he said. \"Some people are missing.\" Disasters such as avalanches and flash floods often hit in mountainous areas of Afghanistan as snow melts in the spring and summer. It is made worse by deforestation. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who is in Brussels for the Nato summit, said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the latest natural disaster. \"A number of people have lost their lives\" in the landslide, Ghani said in a statement. He ordered \"relevant authorities to provide urgent assistance to the affected people.\" The landslide comes as the country is in the grip of a nearly 17-year war between Afghan security forces and the Taliban.

      "text": "GDIC Deputy Senior Vice President (Underwriting Management) Ali Tareque Parvez spoke to the Dhaka Tribune's Syed Samiul Basher Anik and Mahadi Al Hasnat about their hopes for the project Bangladeshi farmers are vulnerable to climate change induced adverse weather events, such as unseasonal and heavy rainfall, droughts, and floods. These can all destroy crops, endangering their livelihoods. To help farmers secure themselves financially against such risks, Green Delta Insurance Company Limited (GDIC) is piloting a new project called \"Weather Index Based Agriculture Insurance\". The project was recently awarded third prize and a grant of US$12,000 at Inclusion Plus, a global competition from Metlife Foundation that recognizes entrepreneurs who scale up innovative projects aimed at accelerating financial inclusion in the country. Why did you create 'Weather Index Based Agriculture Insurance'? In Bangladesh, 45% of the population - or about 72 million people - depend on agriculture, (but) devastating weather and climate change are affecting this sector and our poor farmers are suffering.  Agricultural crises still cause complete losses of livelihoods, whereupon people migrate to urban centres in search for work. We are determined to solve the adverse weather issues and protect our farmers from losses. Weather Index Based (WIB) Agriculture Insurance is something that might mitigate farmers' risks (so) GDIC and International Finance Corporation (IFC) of World Bank Group joined hands to develop and deploy insurance products to address weather-related risks faced by both lenders and farmers in Bangladesh. How does the product connect with the farmers? The product is purely customer feedback driven. GDIC Agri Teams work across Bangladesh, regularly visiting farmers and identifying (their) risks and needs. Farmers receive a Bangla SMS every week with weather forecasts and crop advisory as a value added service. There is a call center with free calls for the farmers (and) GDIC also does yard meetings with farmers to raise their awareness. After designing and implementing the product we do yard meetings and awareness programs to identify the best solution for farmers. Throughout the policy period we monitor weather data in that location and give updates if any trigger is locked for claims.  How do affected farmers make a claim? Data monitoring and claim management is based on regular data from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department and will be done by an Indian company called Skymet Weather Services. With the automated claim monitoring facility, farmers do not even report for loss to GDIC to claim the insurance.   WIB Agriculture Insurance has given out claims to more than 3,000 farmers for crop damage due to weather, equipping them to bounce back and reinvest for the next season.  Which crops are covered under the pilot? Under the WIB project, we have designed products for several crops, like cassava, industrial potato, hybrid rice seeds, cucumber, bitter gourd, tomato, peanuts, mung beans and rice.  We are capable of designing insurance for any crop in any season across Bangladesh using historical weather data from 1981, and satellite data. This is a totally new concept for Bangladeshi market.  How do you define innovation?  Innovation is the actions required to create new ideas, processes or products which when implemented lead to positive, effective change. Innovation also implies a value system which seeks to derive a positive outcome from the inventive act. The first step of innovation is identifying the opportunity, challenge or problem. However, innovation is sometimes challenging because if you are thinking out of the box, sometimes it is not accepted or welcomed. A person has to be creative and a dreamer to be innovative. Training can help, but without creativity it will not work. The financial industry is always looking for innovative products to change the tradition. Any innovation which can give more benefit is important for the industry. What is the future for this product? Bangladesh is now in the path to economic and social development. A strong economy needs to drive innovation forward or it will not reach the target. So a country like Bangladesh need lots of sustainable products for its financial strength. GDIC is working on more digitalization and bundling this insurance with agriculture microfinance, seed bag germination, crop clinic, input, debit card for input purchase, bank loan and portfolio level products.

Over the last 15 years, quantities of 10 species of fishes have drastically decreased and are on the verge of extinction.  According to the Fisheries Department, in 2000-01 the total number of fish caught from inland water bodies was 1,475,039 tons and in 2016-17 the figure rose to 3,496,958 tons. Data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Bangladesh show the number of country's threatened fish species in 2015 as 64, compared to 54 in 2000, showing about an 18.5% increase in threat to different species of fish.  The globally recognized Red List 2015 made by the IUCN said 253 species were assessed, of which, 64 have been found close to extinction - 25.3% of the total. The threatened fish comprise of nine species as critically endangered, 30 as endangered and 25 species as vulnerable. Twenty seven species were assessed as Near Threatened (NT), 122 species as Least Concern (LC) and the other 40 were considered Data Deficient (DD).  However, in IUCN's previous assessment in 2000, it was seen that266 species of fish were assessed, of which, 54 were considered as threatened.  Among the assessed, 12 species were Critically Endangered (CR), 28 were Endangered (EN), 14 species were Vulnerable (VU), 66 species were Data Deficient (DD) and thebalance 146 species were considered as Not Threatened (NT). Around 53% of the threatened fish belongs to carps, barbs and loaches (Order Cypriniformes), followed by catfish (Siluriformes) and perches (Perciformes).  Fisheries experts have blamed over exploitation and excess use of pesticides for agriculture as major causes of depleting the variation of indigenous fish resources.  \"This situation is not only in Bangladesh, but across the world,\" said Dr Mokhlesur Rahman, executive director of Centre for Natural Resources Studies (CNRS). Regarding the increase in the amount of total inland fish catches, he said: \"This is a clear result of initiatives, taken to increase culture fishes.\" Faruk, a fish wholesaler from Natore said: \"The fish I mostly trade comes from cultured fish like carps- Ruhi, Katla and others.  Local fish like Tengra that come to the market are cultured, these days.\" Dhaka Tribune's local correspondents have reported the availability of indigenous fishes in the regional marketfrom different districts. In most cases, the correspondents said the availability of indigenous or local fish species are now rare, and cultured fish have filled in their places. Local people expressed their dissatisfaction for not getting enough of indigenous fish in the market as these taste better. 76-year-old Asgar Ali from Nilphamari expressed his helplessness by saying: \"Even 30 years back, there was plenty of fish that we got from any wetland after the floods.  \"People caught fish together. That was a spectacular scenario. We dried a large part of them to be used later.\" The current generation will not believe it.\"  "

The data also confirmed that the industries sector is making the most impact on this projected growth.\nOn Tuesday, Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal highlighted the growth in the Industries sector during a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.\nAccording to the minister, the projected growth in the industries sector for this FY is 11.99%. Contribution of this particular sector to the GDP has increased by 2% compared to the previous FY, which was 10.22%.\nAccording to sources, contribution of this sector in the GDP has exceeded 32%. Bangladesh currently has around 1,000,000 small and medium industries.\nThese SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) are contributing to 23% of the GDP and providing 80% of the total employment opportunities in this sector.\nSpeaking to the correspondent, Research Director at the Center for Policy Dialogue (CPD), Khandaker Golam Moazzem said: \"The BBS data clearly highlights the industries sector's huge contribution to the GDP.\n\"Growth in all three types of industries, large, medium and small, is quite good compared to the previous FY. The export and the domestic industries sectors both have moved forward.\"\nWhat about other sectors?\nThe BBS data revealed that the growth in service sector has slowed down. But there are doubts regarding whether the slowdown is affecting the employment rate.\nAddressing the issue, Golam Moazzem said: \"There are confusions about the BBS growth prediction for the agriculture sector, as floods severely damaged crops across the country, especially the Amon paddy this fiscal year.\"\n\"Because of the floods, rice prices increased, leading to a spike in food grain imports, which could affect growth in this sector negatively.\"\nExplaining the growth prediction, the planning minister had earlier said: \"The production of Aush paddy and jute crops have increased, along with the production of fish. The industries sector witnessed increased production capabilities due to improved supply of gas and electricity.\n\"Production in sectors such as garments, pharmaceuticals, cement and cattle feed has increased. Wholesale and retail dealings in the service sector increased compared to the previous FY.\"\nThe minister continued: \"The construction sector also witnessed growth. Projects such as Padma Multipurpose Bridge and Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit Development have provided a boost to development activities.\"\nBangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) Research Director and also Agrani Bank Chairman Dr Zaid Bakht believes that the industries sector is making a huge positive impact on the GDP growth.\nSpeaking to the correspondent, he said: \"Government investment has increased in this FY, which also caused the private investments to go up. Import of industry machinery and raw materials has increased. These factors are contributing to the GDP growth.\"\nAccording to the data revealed by the planning minister, the projected GDP growth for the current fiscal year is 7.65%. As part of the prediction, the agriculture and the service sectors would see 3.06% and 6.33% growth respectively, while the industries sector would achieve 11.99% growth.\nSources from the BBS pointed out that in the previous FY, the agriculture sector witnessed a growth of 2.9%, industries sector of 10.22% and service sector of 6.69%.\nEmployment and labour force\nThe labour force survey report by the BBS revealed that a total of 3,700,000 people gained employment in FY 2016-2017.\nIn the industries sector, only 200,000 people gained employment during the same period.\nAccording to the bureau, the growth of new employment opportunities in the industries sector has been slow so far.\nIn 2013, this sector employed around 12,100,000 people, which stood at around 12,200,000 in the FY 2015-16, and 12,400,000 in the FY 2016-17.\nThe BBS report further stated that among the effective workforce of around 109,100,000 people, around 2,680,000 currently remain unemployed.\nA total of 1,400,000 people have achieved \"paid employment\" status and another 1,000,000 found jobs and work abroad. The growth in new employment currently stands at 2.2%.\nOf the growth in employment sector, male employment increased by .07%, while female employment increased by 4.8%.\nThe service sector employed a total of 23,700,000 people in the FY 2016-17, which increased by 1,700,000 in the current fiscal.\n\nThe BBS data also mentioned that the projected GDP growth was exceeded for the first time in Bangladesh's history in the previous FY. The government had projected a growth of 7.2%, but 7.28% growth was achieved that FY.\nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

Maidul and Saiful, two local residents, said a herd of elephants had crossed the border Sunday night, destroying crops and causing disturbance.  As the locals tried to drive them away, they witnessed an elephant falling down near the border. BGB Baraibari camp Company Commander Subedar Shafik confirmed the incident, telling reporters that a dead elephant had been spotted near the 1067/6S pillar area. He added that the cause of its death could not be determined, but the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) had been informed and would retrieve its body soon.  There have been a number of similar incidents in the areas near the Bangladesh-India border over the last several years, where Indian wild elephants have strayed into Bangladesh - sometimes entering human habitats. Some of these stray elephants died or were killed in conflict with humans.  Shortage of food and destruction of habitats, as well as natural disasters such as floods, forced the elephants to venture out and into human territory, according to forest officials.  The governments of Bangladesh and India have been in talks to create safe \"corridors\" for wild elephants to ensure trans-boundary conservation of the elephants.  However, the last bilateral talk between the forest and wildlife officials of thetwo countrieson wild elephant conservation took place in July 2017. "

The data also confirmed that the industries sector is the key driver of this projected growth.\nOn Tuesday, Planning Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal highlighted the growth in the industries sector during at a meeting of the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec).\nThe growth of the industries sector for this fiscal has been predicted to be 11.99%, according to data presented by the minister at the meeting. BBS data show that the industries sector had witnessed 10.22% growth the previous fiscal year.\nAt present, the sector's contribution to GDP exceeds 32%. There are nearly a million small and medium enterprises (SME) in Bangladesh. The contribution of these SMEs to GDP is an estimated 23%.\nNearly 80% of all the jobs in the industries sector are offered by the SMEs.\nCenter for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Research Director Khondaker Golam Moazzem said: \"The BBS data clearly highlights the industries sector's huge contribution to GDP.\n\"Growth in all three types of industries - large, medium, and small - is quite good compared to the previous FY. The export and the domestic industries sectors have both moved forward.\"\nBangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) Research Director and Agrani Bank Chairman Dr Zaid Bakht believes that the industries sector is making a positive impact on GDP growth.\n\"Government investment has increased in this FY, which also caused the private investments to increase. Import of industry machinery and raw materials has increased. These factors are contributing to GDP growth,\" he said.\n\nWhat about other sectors?\nThe BBS data revealed that the growth in the service sector has slowed down. But it is unclear whether the slowdown is affecting the employment rate.\nAddressing the issue, Golam Moazzem said: \"There is confusion about the BBS growth prediction for the agriculture sector, as floods severely damaged crops across the country, especially the Amon paddy this fiscal year.\"\n\"Because of the floods, rice prices increased, leading to a spike in food grain imports, which could affect growth in this sector negatively.\"\nExplaining the growth prediction, the planning minister had earlier said: \"The production of Aush paddy and jute has increased this fiscal, along with the production of fish. The industries sector witnessed increased production capabilities due to the improved supply of gas and electricity.\n\"Production in sectors such as garments, pharmaceuticals, cement, and cattle feed has increased. Wholesale and retail dealings in the service sector increased compared to the previous FY.\"\nThe minister continued: \"The construction sector also witnessed growth. Projects such as Padma Multipurpose Bridge and Dhaka Mass Rapid Transit Development have provided a boost to development activities.\"\nAccording to the data revealed by the planning minister, the projected GDP growth for the current fiscal year is 7.65%. As part of the prediction, the agriculture and the service sectors would see growth of 3.06% and 6.33% respectively, while the industries sector would achieve 11.99% growth.\nSources from the BBS pointed out that in the previous FY, the agriculture sector witnessed a growth of 2.9%, industries sector of 10.22%, and service sector of 6.69%.\nEmployment and labour force\nThe labour force survey report by the BBS revealed that a total of 3.7 million people gained employment in FY 2016-2017.\nIn the industries sector, only 200,000 people gained employment during the same period.\nAccording to the bureau, the growth of new employment opportunities in the industries sector has been slow so far.\nIn 2013, this sector employed around 12.1 million people. The number of employees stood at around 12.2 million in FY 2015-16 and 12.4 million in FY 2016-17.\nThe BBS report further stated that among the effective workforce of around 109.1 million people, around 2.68 million currently remain unemployed.\nA total of 1.4 million people have achieved \"paid employment\" status and another one million found jobs and work abroad. The growth in new employment currently stands at 2.2%.\nOf the growth in employment, male employment increased by 0.7%, while female employment increased by 4.8%.\nIn FY 2016-17, the service sector employed a total of 23.7 million. This increased by 1.7 million in the current fiscal year.\nThe BBS data also mentioned that the projected GDP growth was exceeded for the first time in Bangladesh's history in the previous FY. The government had projected a growth of 7.2%, but 7.28% growth was achieved that FY.\nThis article was first published on banglatribune.com\n\n\n\n\n"

Bangladesh Navy has been tasked with the rehabilitation efforts.\nEach of the total 1,440 houses under construction will be four feet high from the ground, in order to protect the refugees from the high tidal waves.\nThe process to construct 120 cyclone shelters in Bhashan Char is also underway.\nThe ground floor of the cyclone shelters is four feet above the ground and the first floor is 10 feet above the ground floor.\nAs a result, the refugees on the first floor of the shelters should be safe from tidal surges with a height of 14 feet.\nConstruction work of a 13km flood defence embankment is in progress on the island to shield it from tidal surges, with a height of three metres and width of 37 metres on a layer by layer basis.\nThe construction work is likely to be completed within the next rainy season. Moreover, construction work of a 2.1-km long shore protection is also in the process.\nWork for other establishments including security houses and administrative building is also on-going.\nApart from these, process is underway for purchasing and manufacturing necessary water vehicles to rescue the people inhabiting the island during any natural calamity.\n[caption id=\"attachment_228021\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Bhashan Char is located 21 nautical miles from Noakhali, 11 nautical miles from Jahajir Char, 4.2 nautical miles from Sandwip, 28 nautical miles from Patenga, and 13.2 nautical miles from Hatiya Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\n \nRohingya families at grave risk of landslide and flood\nNearly 1,33,649 Rohingyas of 31,441 families are at risk of landslide, while 69,351 Rohingyas of 16,375 families are susceptible to flood risks.\nOf them, some 50,000 Rohingyas have already been relocated to safer places.\nAbout 123 acres of land on the north-west side of Kutupalong extension camp under Ukhiya upazila have already been selected as a safe location for relocating the Rohingyas who are at risk.\nMeanwhile, 30 acres of land have been developed for constructing the shelters.\nSome more Rohingyas at greater risks of landslide and flood will be shifted to safer places by March 31.\nTens of thousands of displaced Rohingyas are now staying at the highly congested makeshift camps in Cox's Bazar.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in an interview with Voice of America last September, revealed that the displaced refugees will be rehabilitated in Bhashan Char, until they could return to their homeland in Rakhine state in Myanmar.\nAccording to Chittagong Divisional Commissioner's office, as many as 6,92,437 Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh as of March 12 of this year after a brutal Myanmar army crackdown began on August 25 last year.\n\n\n\n\n"

The monsoon, which lasts roughly from June to September, is heralded by millions of Indian farmers but the relentless rain wreaks death and destruction every year. Last year around 1,200 people perished. In the coastal state of Kerala, where more than 70 people have died so far this year, heavy rains hit overnight, setting off flash floods and landslides that destroyed scores of structures. \"Several rescue and emergency teams have been sent to the affected districts,\" Kerala relief commissioner PH Kurian told AFP.  Forecasters have predicted heavy rains in the region for another 48 hours, forcing the state authorities to declare an alert. Incessant rains have already swelled the level of water to almost full capacity at two dams, prompting authorities to discharge huge volumes of water at one of them. Last month more than 180 people were killed in less than a week in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, while states in the east and west have also suffered fatalities and damage to buildings."

He said the incidents of scam in banking sector took place one after another. But there was no bold step against the scam from the top policymaking level.\nThe CPD's analysis was mainly focused on the banking sector, Rohingya issue and impact of the floods.\nDebapriya said the overall economic situation has been under tremendous pressure following the three major happenings in the country.\nThe necessary reforms which are very essentials for overcoming the banking sector crisis are not advancing much. Rather, those are going backward and situation in banking sector came out to be the biggest example of the economic failure.\nGiving a brief account on the scams and incidents in the banking in the year 2017, he said the amount of non-performing loans and default loans are on the rise while Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) went below the required level in some banks and the influence of some quarters has increased.\nHe said the cash deficit of the state-owned banks was met by the public money from budgetary allocations and ownership of some private banks was changed through administrative measures.\nDebapriya mentioned that the private banks, which were given licenses on the political consideration, failed performing and there were incidents of money laundering through some banks.\n\"But, unfortunately instead of taking any preventive measures, the government has increased the control of the family members of bank owners through amending the banking law and regulations\", he said.\nHe blamed the weakness and lapses in the country's economic management for such a grim situation in banking sector and observed that the Finance Ministry failed to play its due role in tackling the situation.\nHe thought that the lack of courage and initiative made the situation worsened and that was the main problem for the banking sector.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Good hiring practices can increase efficiency and increase revenue In the high noon of a summer, people of Dhaka can scurry to their destination under cool shades. Not shades of trees but rather the shades of the Dhaka skyline. A skyline littered with high-rises and their skeletons.  Workers can be seen binding rods on the higher floors of an under-construction building. Workers hanging off the ledges; hard at work earning their keep.   The growth of GDP and a small, densely populated country has given rise to the high-rise construction business in the country. The average income in the country today is more than 75% higher than in 1990, which has been done even with its vulnerability to natural calamities. The per-capita income has not fallen in a single year since 1990, even in years in which have seen severe floods. Under the Sixth Five Year Plan (2010-2015), Bangladesh government aimed to achieve 8% growth in real GDP by the end of the plan period. However, poor status of infrastructural development is acting as a serious binding constraint to realizing that growth target.  The construction business isn't just about the equipment or the company. It's about the labourers as well. A good hiring practice can increase efficiency in the construction business and increase revenue.  Currently, we are witnessing a continued GDP growth rate of 7.5% per annum. Such sustained growth is necessary to keep up the identity of a middle-income country. Refining the country's infrastructural system will thus be essential for achieving high economic growth, which is important if poverty reduction is to accelerate. The construction business can be ace in the hole for Bangladesh. With the looming emergence of automation in the production sector, regiments of skilled and unskilled labourer can be a boon for the construction business. The construction labourers can be the beacons of a new era with available jobs. In Bangladesh, the construction process is still traditional, ie, it is labour intensive. Even the labourers are traditionally skilled. They learn the work from kin-to-kin basis. A worker often brings a son, or a nephew to learn the tools of the trade and get familiarized with the peers of work. Because in future, they will have to depend on the good grace of the middlemen.   The mechanization of the construction works is still at the beginning level. Construction works utilize machines to crush bricks or the cements are premixed in the factories. But it still remains labour intensive. So, the labour skills are passed down from family members or mentorship. Thus, the workers lack proper skills.   The construction companies often give the responsibility of hiring labourers to other sub-contractors. The nature of employment in the construction sector is informal. Workers are employed daily without any recruitment letter or contract, and there is no practice of giving wage slips or maintaining record books. Safety measures are still not up to the standard expectation due to lack of knowledge, experience, and awareness. According to REHAB, 3.5 million people work in the construction sector in Bangladesh. Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies reported, in a timespan of 11 years (2005-2016), 1,196 construction workers were killed on work sites.   There are several safety measures advised by the National Building Code. But they are treated mostly as guidelines, to be glossed over. Building owners do not feel compelled to follow the rules due to a lack of government inspections. The governing body claims a lackluster manpower. But the problems have a simpler root.  Workers can be easily cheated and denied deserved payment by the contractors. Along with the risks of deprivation of wages, the absence of a safe working environment and termination of job without any notice and/or payment, while female workers are also at risk of harassment and mistreatment. There are also incidents of gender bias in hiring of labourers.  The construction industry in Bangladesh exhibits gender biases in many respects and for many reasons. Construction work requires physically strong labourers and that is why it is referred to as \"masculine work.\" Women construction workers are considered \"weak labour\" in this sector.  Women are also regarded as unskilled, cheap, available, and flexible labourers. Because of these gender stereotypes, women workers in Bangladesh's construction industry are appointed to do simple tasks requiring the least skill, and in addition, as this sector does not offer them equal career opportunities, they also receive unequal pay. These issues can easily be dealt with digitization of the labour force. A digital platform will effectively remove the middlemen from the equation. This platform can function as a labour pool for the construction companies. A bevy of workers at your fingertips, along with their credentials, work experience, and everything.  A digital platform for hiring workers can also work to alleviate the gender biases in the hiring process. The government agency tasked with overseeing the safety measures can also benefit from the platform.  They can use their already limited personnel and use the digital platform. They can have direct feedback from the workers and work accordingly. The construction companies will be able to find better workers. Companies can also invest on the skill development of the workers.  Granted, the proper use of digital hiring platform for construction workers seem like a far-off dream. There is a lot of foundational work to be done. But with proper training and implementation, the digital hiring platform can simply revolutionize the construction sector of Bangladesh.

The district administration has long been working to enhance the menagerie's beauty and animal diversity.\"\nSohel Ahmed, proprietor of Falcon Traders, said the zebras were procured from Mafunyane Game Reserve in Pretoria of South Africa.\nDr Shahadat Hossain Suvo, a veterinary surgeon of the zoo, said the two male and four female zebras were kept in an enclosure previously used for samber deer.\n\"We have renovated the enclosure and the samber deer were shifted to a new one. We will keep a close watch on the zebras. And we hope the mammals will be able to adapt to the new environment,\" said Dr Suvo.\nSet up on February 28, 1989, the zoo is located in six acres of hilly terrain in Foy's Lake area of the premier port city.  It now houses over 360 animals of 67 species.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "\nHoarding: A catalyst for the rice crisis\n\n\n\n\nBilkis Irani\n\n\n\n\n Published at 12:34 am February 2nd, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nFarmers in the majority of the northern districts faced crop loss during the recent Aman growing season because of severe flooding and pest attacks.\nBut a Dhaka Tribune investigation has also revealed that a significant portion of the last season's Boro paddy still remains with the speculators among the traders and millers.\nThere are two types of speculation going on in the rice market. When there is a hint of short supply in the market, comparatively wealthier farmers and traders can wait for about 15 days to one month for the price to rise a bit more.\nOn the other hand, big traders and millers, who have huge storage capacities, can store either paddy or rice for several months and create an artificial shortfall to reap the benefits.\nMd Ashraful, a small paddy trader at Boda upazila of Panchagarh, told Dhaka Tribune that sometimes he holds back one to two truckloads of paddy for a couple of weeks. \"About 200-250 sacks (75kg sack) can be loaded on a truck. I store the paddy to sell it later at a higher price.\"\nMojibur Rahman, a paddy trader at Mohabbatpur under Dinajpur Sadar upazila, mentioned that the small traders like them cannot afford to hold back huge amounts of paddy or rice for long like the millers.\nMojibur also noted that the large-scale millers were able to store a huge quantity of paddy during the Boro season. \"They have stored the lot as paddy instead of processing it. It's a ploy they're using to get around the laws. When the time will be ripe, they will process the paddy and sell the rice.\"\nMeet the rice syndicate\nSmall traders in Dinajpur, Panchagarh and Naogaon were almost equivocal to claim that dishonest wholesalers and millers have formed syndicates to hoard rice.\nWhen there is space in the warehouse of a miller, it is utilized by the miller's cohorts who have surplus stocks of paddy, according to the small traders.\nThis Dhaka Tribune correspondent visited some of the auto rice mills based on the allegations. She had to pose as a researcher because no journalist was welcome to visit the storage facilities.\nAt the warehouse of Sarwar Automatic Rice Mill in Mahmudpur area under Dinajpur Sadar, the stack of paddy sacks were found to be above the declared capacity of the mill, which is 50 metric tons.\n\nAlso Read- Who is behind the rice price hikes?\n\nAdmitting the fact, the mill's owner Sarwar Syed Sohel said he did not own any of the stock of paddy stored in the warehouse at that time.\nHe claimed another rice miller kept the paddy in his warehouse to be processed there within one month.\nDuring a conversation, the workers of Mousumi Auto Rice Mill at Mataji Road in Mohadebpur upazila, Naogoon claiming to have worked on piles of paddy round the year.\n\"We work here on daily wage basis. But we work here at a stretch, seven days a week. We can't even afford to take a day off in a month. We only get a vacation the month of Kartik (between October-November) in the year. It is just before the Aman harvest,\" said a female worker, preferring not to be named.\n\"This year, the operation at the mill was halted for eight to ten days more in the month of Ashwin (between September-October) because of the floods. The supply of paddy during the rest of the time has been normal. We don't find a respite from the work,\" she added.\nHowever, an overseer of the mill workers, who was present during the conversation, mentioned that the stock of paddy existing in their warehouse was actually imported from Panchagarh.\n\nThe correspondent later visited the rice producing areas of Panchagarh. The traders and millers there brushed aside the claim of that their paddy was being transported to Naogaon.\n\"The price of paddy doesn't vary much from Panchagarh to Naogaon. It will not be cost-effective for the millers to buy the rice from here. Besides, Panchagarh doesn't produce much rice to be exported to another district,\" said Hafizur Rahman, a wholesaler in Sakhoa Bazar of Boda upazila in Panchagarh.\nOutrageous capacity of the rice mills\nWhile some rice millers and their employees were very reluctant to give information about the rice stocks in their mill, some of them, on the other hand, expressed quite candidly that they have to store the paddy for months to keep the mills operational.\nAnisur Rahmn, owner of Tasiron Automatic Rice Mill at Rambhadrapur in Naogaon town, said the paddy production in Aman season is generally much lower compared to that of the Boro season, and the rice mills have to store paddy from the Boro harvest to keep the mills operational all the year round.\nToufiqul Islam, owner of Mofiz Uddin Auto Rice Mills in Raninagar upazila of the district, admitted that he had a stock of Boro paddy collected about six months ago.\nThis correspondent found some stock of Chinigura rice processed at Rajia Semi-Auto Rice Mill of the same area. Chinigura is fragrant non-boiled rice variety that is cultivated only in Aman season. During the visit, the paddy of that variety was yet to be harvested.\nWorkers at the mill said the rice was collected in December of 2016. During the floods of August-September, the rice stock was shifted in a godown elsewhere. But the same rice stock returned to the mill to be processed further so that the rice gives a glow and looks fresh.\nNaogaon District Controller of Food, Abdus Salam, however, argued that they had not found any undue rice stock in the mills. \"The millers can store paddy up to five times of the capacity for 30 days, and rice up to twice the capacity for 15 days.\"\nDoes regulation equal anarchy?\nOfficials of the Directorate of Food in Dinajpur also informed that they were unable to trace undue stocks of rice during their inspection. They also noted that there is a direction from the high ups of the ministry not to create panic for the millers while the directorate also lacks the manpower to carry out the inspection in all the mills of the district.\nDr Asaduzzaman, professorial fellow at state-run think tank Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), observed that the rice milling sector has expanded in Bangladesh without much regulation being put into effect.\n\"The number of large-capacity automatic rice mills established over the last decade is superfluous. About 40% of the capacity of those automatic rice mills remains unutilized. So a bulk of the rice produced throughout the year ends up in the hands of the millers. They do have the ability to influence the rice price,\" Asaduzzaman said.\nThere are about 20,000 rice mills across the country that process and market at least 60% of the paddy produced in the country.\nThere were only 200 semi-automatic and automatic rice mills in the country in 2005. But the number has now crossed 800, said AKM Khorshed Alam Khan, president of Bangladesh Auto Rice Mills Owners' Association.\nWhen contacted over phone, Agriculture Minister Matia Chowdhury said: \"They (millers) tend to hoard. There are dishonest quarters among them. Some of them cut the coarse rice and turn it into Miniket (fine rice). They stock the rice. We are monitoring it as best as we can. Would you advise me to send police to each and every mill and end up creating anarchy?\"\n \n\nAdditional reporting by Sazzadur Rahman Sazzad, Khondaker Md Abdur Rouf, and Md Faruk Hossain\n \n\n\n\n\n"

The central bank issued the directive in a circular sent to CEOs and managing directors of scheduled banks on Monday. The facility will continue until December next year.  A similar rescheduled loan policy was announced on February 23, 2015 which continuedtill December2015, according to the circular.  The circular reads: \"As a natural disaster-prone country, farmers are victims of untold sufferings due to floods, droughts, tidal bores, and extreme rainfall. Due to  that, many farmers failed to repay loans even with the former reschedulingfacility. This resulted in a large amount of loanscoming under threat of default.\"  Hence, BB has again decided to rescheduleagricultural loans for farmers, considering the importance of the agriculture sector to the national economy. According to latest data by BB, disbursements of agriculture loans by banks dropped by 13.74% in the July-October period of the current fiscal year (FY19), compared to the same period in FY18.  During the period, state-owned, private and foreign scheduled banks disbursed Tk5,352.07 crore in the first four months of FY19, against Tk6,204.76 crore in the corresponding period of FY18.  The amount of agriculture loans disbursed by banks in July-October of FY19 was 24.55% of the annual target of Tk21,800 crore for the fiscal year."

There are 3,09,468 voters in the constituency The ruling Awami League and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) are both being ravaged by internal feuds in Shariatpur 2 constituency ahead of the national polls expected in December.  The constituency is constituted by Naria upazila and Shakhipur area of Bhedarganj upazila and has 309,468 registered voters.  According to AL sources, a long standing conflict among the party's leaders in the district has bubbled to the surface since 85-year-old Col (retd) Shawkat Ali announced that he has no interest in contesting the upcoming JS polls due to his age.  Shawkat was elected parliamentarian in 1979, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2008 and 2014. During his time in office, he has served on various parliamentary committees, including as chair of the Standing Committee on Ministry of Shipping and Committee on Private Members Bills and Resolutions between 1996 and 2001. He was elected unanimously the deputy speaker of the ninth parliament on January 25, 2009, following a landslide Awami League victory. With the pathway to parliament left clear by Shawkat's imminent retirement, AL aspirants are currently engaged in hectic lobbying to garner party tickets. Central Committee Organising Secretary AKM Enamul Haque Shamim, Former Chairman of Naria upazila Prof Sultan Mahmud Simon, reserved seat MP Navana Akter and Dr Khaled Shawkat Ali, the son of Col Shawkat Ali, are trying to get nominations. While the aspirants have announced their candidature by putting up posters and billboards and by attending various social and religious functions, party insiders say the dispute among them has deepened. Ruling party friction Former Jubo League Central Committee member  and people. Simon, a Freedom Fighter and now a prosecutor of International Crimes Tribunal, has also played a big role in local politics and thinks the party will nominate him \"considering his contributions for the AL and country\".  Reserved seat MP Navana says she has a \"great role\" in the 1/11 movement to free Sheikh Hasina. She hopes the party will evaluate her as she is working for the development of the  constituency as she was elected MP. Dr Khaled Shawkat says he will \"work to implement the vision of his father\" if he is nominated. BNP divided The BNP aspirants are yet to be seen holding public meetings, however, the party's candidates hope to take advantage of the AL's factional feuds in the constituency. Shariatpur district unit former BNP president Shafiqur Rahman Kiron, Central Committee Member Jamal Sharif Hiru, Former MP Dr KA Jalil,  local BNP leader Col (retd) SM Faisal and TM Gias Uddin are all trying to get nominations. According to BNP insiders, leaders and activists of BNP are divided in two groups in the constituency. Kiron leads one faction while Hiru leads another faction.  Although the opposition appears splintered, locals say the ruling Awami League is also on a slippery slope as a section of its grassroots leaders in the constituency have indulged in internal feuds, use of firearms, misconduct and other unhealthy activities over the years. Party insiders say such activities are tarnishing the image of the Awami League. Locals say they want such a representative who will work to protect them from floods, river erosion and for the development of the constituency."

      "text": "Ilish farming in ponds is not commercially viable More research is necessary before the cultivation of ilish in ponds can be made commercially viable, the Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI) has said.  Ilish is considered a delicacy and favourite fish dish among Bangali people. Since 1988, the institute has conducted four phases of research about the possibilities of farming the popular fish in ponds. \"We have not succeeded in commercial ilish farming but have managed to keep the fish alive in ponds,\" BFRI's Ilish Researcher Dr Anisur Rahman said. \"People might farm ilish in ponds as a hobby but more research is necessary for the the fish to be commercially viable.\" Currently, a team of seven researchers and four research assistants are working on ilish farming in Chandpur and have spent Tk6-7 lakh on the project. History suggests they may have their work cut out to turn that investment into a profit. Commercial failures BFRI first took the initiative to farm ilish in two Chandpur ponds in 1988 with governmental financing. The project ended in 1995 as it was unsuccessful. From 2004-2005, researchers unsuccessfully tried to conduct more research on ilish farming.  Between 2010-2011 and 2012-2013, research restarted under the project called \"Jatka Conservation, Alternate Income Generation for the Jatka Fishers and Research Project\". People might farm ilish in ponds but more research is necessary for the fish to be commercially viable Dhaka Tribune \"We researched the possibility of ilish farming in different stages,\"ilish Researcher Dr Anisur Rahman told the Dhaka Tribune. \"From 2012-2013, we collected ilish fry of 8-12cm from sea or rivers and released them into the institute's ponds.\" A year later, researchers examined the fish and found they had a low growth rate and their eggs were underdeveloped. The fish weighed only 300g, whereas ilish from other water bodies usually weigh 400-500g. Dr Anisur said: \"Learning from this experience we made natural food for ilish in the following study. The results were better but ilish still cannot be farmed for commercial purposes.  \"Observing the ilish in ponds, we discovered that they do not consume their food properly. It is very hard to maintain the quality of food and water in an enclosed body of water.  \"However, I cannot say ilish farming is impossible,\" the researcher said. The matter was discussed at the National Parliament before another failed attempt was made from 2015-2016 under the World Fish Center's ECOFISH project with USAID funding.  After that, BFRI concluded it was possible to farm ilish in ponds but not for commercial purposes."

Years have passed with politician after politician pledging improvement, with more broken down roads to show for it. The Gazipur City Corporation was established six years ago. Residents are being taxed, but have seen none of the developments promised. Streetlights have not been installed on many roads, clean water is not being distributed, and the sewerage system is in shambles. Now, voters are determined to take back the bargaining power and hold aspiring mayoral and council candidates to their word. The 1.1 million voters are determined to make the candidates work for their votes. Abdus Sobhan from ward 17 in Gazipur pays Tk2,000 in holding taxes per year. But his life sees very little of the civic facilities a city corporation is bound to provide. Garbage either lines the roads, or is strewn in ignominy on the road. The road itself floods quickly after a brief rain. Other residents of the same ward have similar complaints. Lack of access to clean water, frequent inundations, industrial spillage, and sewerage leaks are the major concerns of Gazipur City Corporation voters.  Political promises seem to have little sway, as voters remain adamant on not disclosing their preferred candidate until they vote. Afzal, a local resident, said he will dwell on his candidate up until the day of the vote. The terrible condition of the roads remains the number one concern. Palanpara resident Delwar says people in his neighbourhood have to use a makeshift trail of clay that cannot even be called a road. And since there are no streets, streetlights are a distant dream. The Gazipur City Corporation polls were scheduled for May 15. But a High Court order moved it to June 26."

The government banned catching; carrying and selling of Ilish during the breeding season, but local fishermen are still going out to catch Ilish in the Padma and Jamuna rivers, eluding local authorities.  They adopt different techniques to sell and carry these illegally caught Ilish. On Friday, Shibalaya Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Mehedi Hasan seized huge quantities of illegally caught Ilish while they were being carried using various new techniques to avoid authorities.  According to sources, local fishermen regardless the ban, were catching Ilish and selling them at the river banks and shores at a very low price. The administration, following a tip-off, conducted a secret operation in the Laxdia Char naval route of the Shibalaya upazila. Ilish buyers were pretending to be passengers on an engine boat.   Nearly 200kgs of Ilish were seized from the buyers who were carrying them in metal containers, school bags, clothes and luggage carriers. Hasan further said \"The buyers were transporting the Ilish via unconventional methods to avoid the administration. The seized fish were distributed to local orphanages and madrasas.\" \"Five fishermen were detained and were punished over different periods,\" he added.  Meanwhile Shibalaya Upazila Senior Fisheries Officer Rafiqul Alam said that during the operation they destroyed 40 boats and two hundred thousand cubic meters of Current Jal."

The $425 million \"Operation for Supporting Rural Bridges Program\" will improve connectivity and climate resilience in 19 coastal districts, affecting about a 100 million people, said a press release. Mahmuda Begum, additional secretary of Economic Relations Division, and Qimiao Fan, country director of World Bank for Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, signed the agreements on behalf of their respective organizations. Speaking about the agreement, Fan said: \"Rural bridges play a key role in Bangladesh's development, and an efficient rural road network can have a big effect in improving rural livelihoods. \"By enabling greater connectivity, these two projects will help rural communities gain safer access to schools, health facilities and markets, reduce transport costs, increase non-agriculture incomes, and expand employment for both women and men,\" Fan added.  Representing the government, Mahmuda said: \"The seventh Five-Year Plan includes a vision for development of rural infrastructure as one of its priority areas. Both projects will contribute to greater connectivity for rural communities, and boost growth.\" This agreement will support existing efforts by the government to plan, design, and manage rural bridges through the rehabilitation of at least 29,000 metres of bridges, and build another 20,000 metres of new bridges in 61 districts across Bangladesh. Furthermore, the program will create jobs by generating about 5.5 million person-days of employment. Meanwhile, the $100 million additional financing to the \"Second Rural Transport Improvement Project\", was also signed on Thursday, will help support the rehabilitation of 1,433 km of upazila and union roads that were damaged from the floods and heavy rainfall of 2017, and the maintenance of almost 6,000 km of rural roads in 26 districts. The project will also promote community road safety campaigns and road safety measures for public and private transport users, in light of increasingly heavy traffic on rural roads. "

      "text": "In an interview with the Dhaka Tribune, World Bank Chief Economist for the South Asia region Martin Rama shares his take on the prospects and problems of Dhaka's urbanization, and the plans mentioned in a WB report regarding East Dhaka. How will moving eastwards address the existing inequalities between the wealthy and poverty-stricken in Dhaka? I think there are inequalities in every city. There are inequalities in earnings, in access to services. Perhaps the biggest inequalities we have seen in cities are in lands and land prices. The owners of land in Gulshan are very rich while those having land in Gazipur are not. If East Dhaka city continues its development at the current pace, I believe the situation will not change much. In East Dhaka, private realtors are increasingly developing entire neighbourhoods which are more like gated communities, with more social segregation. We don't see such a thing in West Dhaka. There are more than a dozen big development companies in East Dhaka that are mainly focused on the upper-middle income group. Developing East Dhaka may not help reduce inequalities, but will push up business. If East Dhaka is well-developed, it will help cut pressure on West Dhaka as people will move to the eastern part of the capital. So, we expect to see the population density of West Dhaka decline.   How does the World Bank propose to deal with freeholders holding property in East Dhaka?  Due to development, the land prices will spiral upwards in East Dhaka, and who appropriates those gains is our concern. For example, a farmer who does have a property grows crops on other's land. When land prices shoot up, the owner sells the land at higher prices and the farmer loses the piece of land. So, we see that risk which is there in every process of rural development. I think this matter has to be addressed seriously, as private developers are always looking to start their projects. We hear stories that suggest that not everything happens (regarding land acquisition) in the proper way. To address the issue, we want a smart and digitized land administration in place. This may help us get information on how many property title holders and households are under a mouja. We'll then be able to know how many people are not actually entitled to a property. A digitized land administration may also facilitate the collection of information on holding tax, exact value of a property, cadastral record, good evaluation of land and other necessary information. So a modern land administration is a pre-requisite to a modern Dhaka.      None of the authors are water experts. Without this expertise, how can this proposed paradigm be considered meaningful?  Though the authors of the report are not water experts, they are well informed on what kind of water expertise is needed in Bangladesh. All of our water modelling came from a world-class institute and we used their simulation, not ours. Their simulations can be used in terms of floods, constructing embankments and regarding canals. As such, we are very confident of the analysis in the report. Will further expansion of Dhaka draw more internal migrants? Is it desirable? Migrants will come in anyway. We conducted a survey on households in Dhaka which shows that the inhabitants of slums in the city have higher living standards than that of the rural people. As such, it is very difficult to imagine that people will stop coming to Dhaka. In fact, even if nothing is done and business continues as usual, the population in Dhaka will be 25 million by 2035. In fact, this is a good thing since productivity, service delivery and access to healthcare is higher in cities. Cities generate a lot of revenue from the apparel sector, which can be used in infrastructure. Service delivery is much cheaper in cities.  Won't greater concentration of power and population in Dhaka further extend big business and big land owners? We see possible transformations in these types of sectors. Of course, when you have urbanization, there will be changes taking place, as more manufacturing and less agriculture will be there. But if Dhaka continues business as usual, it will remain a manufacturing city. If a modernized Dhaka is built, it will be a city of great importance with high value added services. The distinctive feature of present Dhaka is the large investment groups. If the business goes on as usual, East Dhaka will be a series of small cities managed or designed by these groups. "

      "text": "Honesty and integrity, not corruption, is the way to prosperity The geographic area which is now known as Bangladesh has been underdeveloped for a long period of time. Poverty was a common phenomenon in this region. Most of the people here were generally poor, where natural calamities like floods, drought, cyclones, and famine struck the land now and then.  The great famine of 1770, the famine of 1943 and 1970, the storm of 1970, and 1991 are the notable disastrous events in the history of Bengal. Apart from the famines, it is said that people sometimes died due to starvation.  We get the picture of a miserable economy in Bengal for centuries by going through research work, novels, plays, newspapers, movies, etc. The scenario did not change even after the emergence of Bangladesh.  For a considerable period of time, even after the birth of this country, people used to suffer from similar disasters. But in course of time, the situation has changed. Bangladesh is about to be recognized as a developing country soon.  It is a glorious achievement of the ruling government. Many people are financially solvent now and many of them rose to the wealthy classes from middle or lower income strata. Though \"goodbye poverty,\" the most desired and frequently repeated slogan is still far from being materialized, this change is undoubtedly very positive. But can we say that people have become solvent in all respects? Just have a look back. The 1960s were eventful, and life for the masses was quite challenging in the then East Pakistan. People were poor compared to the present time, but always concerned and conscious about their rights.  They used to protest against any type of injustice and inequality or any wrong-doing made by any government or anybody. In course of time, the poor became solvent and rich. But at the same time, it is not unclear why they gradually became timid and selfish. People slowly but surely got isolated and did not think of protesting against any unfairness carried out by any of the social forces.  The question is: Why?   Some economists argue that economic growth brings dramatic changes to human life. The person who has prospered economically can be isolated, and may suffer from a superiority complex.  The argument is that a person is solvent not only financially, but in many ways. Economic freedom makes his life comfortable. Earlier, he was always dependent upon others during the days of his economic hardship.  He used to borrow money from the solvent near and dear ones to run his family. He thought himself quite subservient. He could not send his children to a standard school. He was unable to buy clothes for his family during festivals. Getting unwell was a curse for him.  For all these and many other reasons, his life was miserable, and for that, he had to depend on others. Now, he can take care of himself along with his family, because of financial freedom.   It is apparent, however, that in Bangladesh, many people tried to break the cycle of poverty by getting involved in corruption. Economic freedom came through corruption in many cases; and it made them selfish, self-centred, and morally bankrupt.  It seems, therefore, that economic development, economic freedom, corruption, moral bankruptcy, egocentrism, and selfishness are related terms. Aren't they?  It is difficult to answer the question, raised above, in a word; yet it is true that a person who attains solvency through corruption will be always selfish and morally weak. \"Industry is the key to success\" is an old saying, but it is as though it does not apply in Bangladesh.  The life of an honest and diligent person is usually in limbo here. People want to be rich overnight. But if you consider the developed countries around the globe, you will see a different picture. Most of the rich people in other corners of the world did not become rich overnight. According to the corruption perceptions index (CPI), Bangladesh is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. This is not just a 21st-century scenario, Bengal has been perceived as corrupt for a long time. In Riyaz-us-Salatin (1788), writer Ghulam Hussain Salim depicts the characters of Bengali people in this way: \"... but in affairs relating to bargains of giving and taking and purchases and sales and worldly matters, no race in all four quarters of the globe is equal to the Bengalis in wickedness, duplicity, knavery, and villainy. \"They do not consider loans repayable, and the promises, which they pledge to perform in one day, they do not fulfill in one year.\"  Yet, this statement is not clearly justified or corroborated by other contemporary sources. Anyway, it does not indicate that people in those days were too crazy to become wealthy overnight like today. Many people of this country are apparently undergoing class changes, sacrificing virtues to vices; they are climbing up from lower to middle and from middle to upper classes. Most of the honest and dedicated workers of this country suffer from inferiority complex where people of moneyed class exhibit superiority complex. In this backdrop, making a balanced society requires practicing \"industry plus honesty as the key to success\" in all areas of life.   My observation may make me appear as someone who does not want to see people solvent and the country a prosperous one. I should not be misread. I want a more prosperous Bangladesh full of happy people.  But I want people to overcome their hurdles through hard work and honesty, so that they can realize others' miseries and pain. We need patriotic, courageous, committed, united, honest, and hard-working people to build a prosperous nation with a balanced society.

The centre recognized their efforts at a ceremony organized at its Mohakhali office on Thursday. Of the awardees, 10 were recognized for their work during the early days of the Rohingya influx in September last year, when they conducted an initial risk assessment in the refugee or Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals (FDMNs) camps in Cox's Bazar. They are- scientist Dr Ashraful Islam Khan, project coordinators Dr Md Shariful Islam and Dr Fahima Chowdhury, consultant Dr Tajul Islam Bari, project research manager Dr Shah Alam Siddique, senior research investigator Dr Md Taufiqul Islam, field research officers Md Asaduzzaman, Md Mahmudur Rahman Khan and Tapas Paul, and field research assistant Md Mizanur Rahman. The other 10 awardees were recognized for their contribution in tackling a major diarrhoeal outbreak in Dhaka. They are- medical officer Dr Shoeb Bin Islam, clinical fellow Dr Md Marzan Kabir, study physician Dr Rumana Sharmmin, senior staff nurses Jannatul Nahar and Raushan Alam, fellow nurses Mawsumi Akter and Rebeka Sultana, health workers Halima Begum and Rokeya, and attendant Md Abul Kashem.  According to the icddr,b, it has by itself treated a total of 55,222 diarrhoeal cases between March and May this year, the highest since the 2007 floods. Executive Director of icddr,b Prof John D Clemens chaired the event with Health Ministry Secretary Md Serajul Huq attending as chief guest. Serajul congratulated those who were particularly involved in the vaccination campaign in Rohingya camps and in the management of the diarrhoeal outbreak in Dhaka for their good work. Clemens said: \"It gives us immense pleasure to recognize all our extraordinary staff for having shown commitment, confidence and compassion while delivering excellent services to protect the FDMN population in Cox's Bazar and during the outbreak in Dhaka.\" Established in 1960, the icddr,b is an international public health research institution based in Bangladesh and has been at the forefront of discovering low cost solutions to key health challenges facing people living in poverty and provides robust evidence of their effectiveness on a large scale."

      "text": "It is not unlikely that Kalboishakhi or Nor'westers with hails and lightning will occur during the pre-monsoon season (March-May) in Bangladesh. However, this week we have observed Kalboishaki almost every day, with storm winds of around 80km per hour peppered with lightning storms. Many scientists have linked such unusual extreme weather events with climate change triggered by global warming. Global warming and climate change However, extreme event attribution is the subject of considerable debates and confusion in the media. To overcome this challenge, event attribution research should be conducted in order to investigate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the probability of occurrence of specific events. Multi-model ensemble simulations of the climate model can help detect climate change signals for such extreme events. With the help of high resolution Global Circulation Models (GCM), it is possible to adequately reproduce the dynamics associated with extreme weather events with or without climate change. However, it is also true that extreme event attribution will not be able to provide evidence of any anthropogenic traces for every extreme event. Due to the lack of recorded data or greater computational powers, it is not always possible to conduct such studies which are essential for claiming loss and damage attributed from climate change. A lightning bolt carries around 30 kilo-amps of electrical current when it makes contact with the ground. Considering the rate of mortality from lightning strikes, it is the second most lethal form of natural disaster in the country El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) At this moment, we can observe two active large scale atmospheric processes: After closely monitoring the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the Nino regions in the Pacific Ocean, La Nina, the cooling phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has been confirmed. It has met the criteria of all the four seasons of three months each during which the SST is below about 0.5 degrees Celsius than the long-term (30 years) average. However, it is expected that a gradual return from the La Nina conditions to neutral conditions will be observed from April to May. Under the La Nina conditions, winters tend to feature cooler-than-average conditions. In the first week of January, North America's East Coast is shivering in a record-breaking cold wave termed the \"bomb cyclone\" that dumped snow as far south as Florida. In many parts of the US and Canada, temperatures were fall below -29C, bringing with it record-low temperatures. In Oymyakon, Russia, the temperature was recorded as low as -67C -- the second lowest recorded temperature in their history.  This winter, Bangladesh experienced its lowest recorded temperature in 50 years on January 9, as the mercury dropped to 2.6C in Tetulia upazila, Panchagarh. La Nina also caused heavy rains over Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The teleconnections between La Nina and the heavy precipitation over the Indian sub-continent is yet to be established. However, we have observed severe floods in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basins during the La Nina years, which include 1974, 1984, 1988, 1998, and 2017. Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) Another large-scale coupling between atmospheric circulation known as Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) affect global weather patterns as well as the Indian summer monsoon. This is a travelling pattern that propagates eastward at approximately 4 to 8 m/s through the atmosphere above the warm parts of the Indian and Pacific oceans. It is a pulse of cloud and rains, and has a cycle of about 45 to 60 days. According to Skymet weather report, in the last four days, the MJO has been in the Indian Ocean. Due to its present position, rainfall activity has increased over Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and has even extended up to South India. It will again likely revisit during June of this year when enhanced monsoon rain is expected. Thunderstorms and lightning The influence of global warming, La Nina conditions, and the entrance of MJO in the Bay of Bengal regions for the last couple days should have influence on recent occurrences of strong thunderstorms and lightning. Every year, more than 200 people die in Bangladesh in lightning strikes as per reports from various newspapers. In 2016, the government declared lightning as a disaster after the death of about 65 people within two days, from lightning strikes. Lightning strikes the Earth more than 100 times each second, totalling 8 million times every day. A lightning bolt carries around 30 kilo-amps of electrical current when it makes contact with the ground. Considering the rate of mortality from lightning strikes, it is the second-most lethal form of natural disaster in the country. However, spreading lightning safety awareness can help save a lot of lives. The most important thing to do is take shelter from lightning storms if you are outdoors. When you first hear thunder, you should immediately seek shelter. AKM Saiful Islam is a Professor of the Institute of Water and Flood Management at BUET."

It gave us a range of possible future worlds by regulating greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and climate finance to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels. The previous target of a 2 degrees Celsius rise was thought to be no longer enough. The language used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the UNFCCC is heavy with technical terms - tipping points, parts per million, regulatory science - that aim to warn of future that has deep and significant impact through cultural, social, economic and environmental consequences. So how do we, as non-experts, imagine this future? This is where culture becomes so important - it allows us to make sense of technical descriptions, and also to understand how we then must change to, adapt to, or mitigate climate impacts.\nBangladesh has a rich tradition of songs, novels, poems and paintings that portray joy, pleasure, national identity, and celebration. Amar Shonar Bangla, by Rabindranath Tagore, our national anthem, is a love song to the seasons and the bounty of \"my golden Bengal\" and is integral to our national identity. In Abar Ashibo Phire, Jibonando Das describes a longing to return to pristine nature, away from the language of uncertain and tempestuous natural calamities. On the visual side, the elaborate scroll, Nabanna (1970) by master storyteller and artist of Bangladesh, Zainul Abedin, stands out in national memory in its depiction of a narrative of rural life, with its attendant tribulations and celebrations.\n\nAsmani\nTranslated by: Hasna Jasimuddin Moudud\nIf you want to see Asmani\nGo to Rahimuddin's small house in Rasulpur.\nIt is not a house, a bird's nest made with 'venna' leaves\nThe slightest rain pours water inside.\nThe slightest wind, rocks the house\nUnder its roof Asmanis' live all year long.\nShe doesn't have a full stomach\nThe ribs in her cage are witness to her starving days.\nThe bright smile has gone from her sweet face\nwiped out by cruel poverty.\nShe wears one hundred stiches on a hundred holes in her dress\nMaking a mockery of her golden skin.\nThe bee black eyes do not have twinkle of laughter\nOnly tears pour down in deluge.\nHer flute like voice is wasted by crying out\nShe never had a chance to sing to tune of music.\nNear Asmani's home lies the lotus pond\nWhere tadpoles and moss cover the water.\nMosquitos breed poisonous seeds of malaria germs\nIn its water the Asmanis carry on cooking and drinking.\nHer stomach swells with worms, fever accompanies daily\nThey have no money to call for a doctor.\nKhosmani and Asmanis live in two lands\n Tell me my jadu who will you accept with greater love.\nThe last two lines of Asmani talk about what we now think of as climate justice. The poet wonders: Who deserves our love and compassion, other than the destitute and the dispossessed Asmanis of Bangladesh? Another of his poems, O Bajaan, Chol Jai Chol, describes destitute farmers who struggle through draught and floods to raise crops for the country but go to bed with empty stomachs. The inhumanity - and farmer suicide - brought on by old agricultural practices and natural disasters, is a form of realist visualisation that is a hallmark of climate consciousness.\nO Father Come Let Us Plough\nTranslated by: Hasna Jasimuddin Moudud\nO father come let us go\nTo the field to plough\nPlace the ploughs on oxen shoulders and\nPush, push, push.\nWe who bring out food\nFrom the depth of the earth\nWe who provide food for the whole world\nWhy can't we eat can any one tell us?\nMy wife has hanged herself\nShe could no longer bear hunger,\nNow I plough deep into soil\nIn the hope of seeing her again.\nWe plough the fields\nOur bosom is always flayed\nBut from the fields we get harvest\nNone from the scarred bosom.\nWe shall plough no more for rice\nBut to see how far it is to graves.\n[caption id=\"attachment_260526\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"667\"] The famous 'Famine' Sketch by Zainul Abedin Wikimedia[/caption]\nI must return to Zainul Abedin and the Bengal Famine of 1943. He visited Kolkata and saw for himself the kind of horror it takes to claim four million lives. The emotion of watching destitute mothers holding babies on the verge of dying is something that transcends dry famine data. His Bengal famine sketches aim to not just visualise the human aftermath of agricultural failure, land politics, the Raj's aid denial, cyclones, storm surges and flood damage, but also to bear testimony through cultural production. It was Abedin the artist, expressing himself as the activist.\nPerhaps the greatest masterpiece of Bangladeshi climate art is Zainul Abedin's Monpura (1970). Following the Bhola cyclone, Abedin painted the masterpiece of cultural testimony to climate disaster. He became known as the artist for the downtrodden. The scroll now hangs in its majesty at the National Museum in Shahbagh, stunning visitors to silence.\nSanjukta Sunderason, in Shadow Lines (2017), says about Monpura: \"When a huge coastal storm on the island of Monpura killed thousands of people in November 1970, Abedin rushed to the affected areas. The artist's wife, Jahanara Abedin's recollection of his disquiet in an interview is telling: \"Upon his return from Monpura, he just sat there with his head in his hands. Seeing such loss and desperation shook him from within. He didn't paint immediately. He sat contemplating for a long while, feeling the need to do something practical to help those people. Much later, he painted scenes of what he saw in Monpura, working tirelessly ...\"\nSo how should we think about climate change now? And where? Who will get to record it? Who will tell our story as survivors of climate damage? We need a space for thinking about our collective uncertain futures. Having this space for reflexive and reflective interaction with the \"hard sciences\" of climate change might lead to a more energetic and inclusive understanding of what climate change and climate action mean. This space must be collaborative between scientists, artists and the common people - with their contested agencies, disagreements and dissent. The hard facts of climate change have its own value and space (albeit with its own controversies and contentions), and it needs to be complimented with cultural interpretations and documentation, beyond \"soft communications\" with expert driven narratives that follow international climate conferences. It is a challenge to the imagination of the creative community and carries with it some urgency as the world is changing with every season.\nWe must think of climate art as our art - it is a product of our collective struggle. We create art, depicting our struggles, processing our memories and understandings of climate trauma through fresh experimentations. Songs of suffering, change, beauty and joy will evolve through our collective recording and retellings. We must think of climate art as a means of giving meaning and value to our past, present, and future. Art has always been an important means of processing trauma - Guernica being an icon in that sphere - be it cyclone damage, hunger or displacement. An artist's creative empathy and consciousness are the most important elements that will form cultural memory and imagination. It is our cultural conscience that we must bring to climate discourse.\n\nDr Shahpar Selim is a visiting researcher at the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) at IUB.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "World emissions grew by 1.6% last year and will increase even more this year due to the sustained use of coal, oil and natural gas Global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rise nearly 3% this year due to continued fossil fuel use, scientists said on Wednesday, dashing hopes that an increase in 2017 was temporary after two years of slowdown. World emissions grew by 1.6% last year and will increase even more this year due to the sustained use of coal, oil and natural gas, an annual report by the Global Carbon Project showed, a group of 76 scientists in 15 countries. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were roughly flat from 2014-16, which led to hopes that emissions had peaked in 2013. The data, presented during talks among around 190 nations in Poland on implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement climate accord, are a setback for a global goal of curbing emissions to avert more floods, heat waves, and rising sea levels. The world is on track for a 3-5 degrees Celsius rise in global average temperature this century and if all known fossil fuel resources are used the rise will be even bigger, the UN World Meteorological Organization warned last week. \"The projected growth in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industry is 2.7% in 2018, but uncertainties persist and growth rates between 1.8-3.7% remain possible,\" the Global Carbon Project report said. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels, cement and industry, which make up the bulk of manmade greenhouse gases, are on track to rise to a record high of around 37.1 billion tons this year. CO2 emissions from all human activities, including fossil fuels, industry and land-use change, will reach around 41.5 billion tons, the report said.  Despite growth in low-carbon technologies, not enough is being done to support policies which limit emissions, said Glen Peters, one of the leaders of the study at the Center for International Climate Research in Oslo (CICERO). \"The rise in emissions in 2017 could be seen as a one-off, but the growth rate in 2018 is even higher, and it is becoming crystal clear the world is so far failing in its duty to steer onto a course consistent with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement in 2015,\" he added. Nearly all countries have contributed to the rise in global emissions: either by growth in emissions, or reductions that are slower than expected. China's emissions are set to rise around 4.7% this year, as it is still expected to be reliant on coal over the next decade even though it has been deploying renewable energy, the report said. Due to strong economic growth and continued use of coal. India's emissions are expected to grow by 6.3% this year. US emissions are seen rising around 2.5% this year, after falling 1.2% a year since 2007. However, it is expected that US emissions will decline again in 2019 as cheap gas, wind, and solar will continue to displace coal. The European Union should experience a slight decline in emissions of 0.7% this year. In the rest of the world, accounting for 42% of global emissions, a rise of 1.8% is expected. This group is mainly developing countries and the five contributing the most to emissions growth in the last decade are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Iraq and South Korea."

The actor speaks to the Dhaka Tribune Showtime's Sadia Khalid about acting alongside Shakib Khan in a new movie and a mega-budget commercial When is your film with Shakib Khan coming out? It's coming out next year hopefully, maybe March or April. It's called \"Shahenshah.\" Where is the film shooting? We have shot the songs in Thailand and in India. Now we're shooting the rest of it in Dhaka. Almost 75% of the shooting is done by now.  How was your experience co-starring with Shakib Khan? It was good,because the team is very powerful. It's my second film with Shamim Ahmed Rony, the director. We have great coordination. It's my fourth film with a script from screenwriter Anshuman Pratyush, from India. So, I've worked with the whole team, even the DOP (director of photography), before. I have that comfort zone with them. The combination is really good. When the technicalities fall into place, the production organically turns larger than life. It's my first official Bangladeshi film. So far you've worked in Indian and Indo-Bangla productions. Now you're acting in a Bangladeshi film. Do you find any difference in the professionalism of these two industries? It all depends on you. Of course, there are some differences. We're in a progressive mind-set now. People make films because they love films and they respect this profession. They really want something great out of it.  What I found really positive in this film is that everybody has an enthusiasm for doing the best and looking the best; starting from the lightman to each and every technician. They want to give it their best shot. I really appreciate this positive mentality. This film contains the hard work of a lot of people. In \"Shahenshah,\" there's a touch of positivity in every scene.  Everyone always tells me that whenever Faria comes to the screen, her presentation is \"Wow.\" They kept the glow and the glamour part intact in this film. Starting from my intro, each and every one of my scenes was choreographed. That's why it's looking very nice. I'm very hopeful.  Five or six years back, when Bangladeshi actors started going to Kolkata regularly to act, they said there's a huge difference in the professionalism between the two countries. Do you think the gap is shrinking?  It's nothing like that. I've done eight films. Five of them are officially Indo-Bangla, three are also somewhat mixtures of Bangladeshi and Indian. I think it depends on how serious you are. They are very serious. They have a different way of looking at stuff. We have a different way of looking at stuff. They're very strict; we're very emotional. But we both love our work. So, I won't say that they're professional and we are not. We're also professional. Otherwise, I couldn't survive here, because I'm too professional. It all depends on how you look at things.  Nusraat Faria and Shakib Khan at the shooting of a dance sequence for a Banglalink commercial | Courtesy  What was the first scene you shot with Shakib Khan in \"Shahenshah?\"  I'm very chilled out as a person. Whenever I'm on set, I'm only concerned about how I'm looking and if I'm doing my acting right. My \"equation\" is with my director, my DOP and my light team. As a co-artist, of course he's very good. He's very co-operative.  I'm very professional and calculative on set. I'm focused on my work. It's almost 2019, we don't have that thing (stars acting like divas) anymore. It's an extremely friendly environment. We all work together. I think it's very important to be friendly on set. That's healthy for work.  We met for the first time in Thailand,where we were shooting a song. We started with a romantic sequence and that was it. We said \"Hi. Hello,\" shot the scene, we saw the monitor, looked at each other and agreed that the shots were OK. It was a done deal. We knew the chemistry was working well, the shot was looking good. So that was our concern as artists, whether the chemistry looked good on screen. You released a song \"Pataka.\" Will you release more songs soon? Yes. I'm planning on it. \"Pataka\" wasn't so much \"me.\" Pritam and I were discussing the kind of songs we can do. And he said, let's do something that's really rough and not mellow and doesn't go with your image. I said \"OK. Let's take the risk.\" We did take the risk and in some way, I am successful I would say... Now, I am coming up with something different. So, let's see; maybe in the beginning of next year.  How did you handle the criticism of \"Pataka?\" Well, it comes with the fame. I think that's completely fine. Your actions will have a reaction. If I think it is logical, I appreciated it and learn from it. If I think it is not logical, I will not pay attention to it.  What is the next film you're working on after \"Shahenshah?\" We are reading a couple of scripts. I am very picky about my films. Because, thanks to Allah, I don't have a flop.  Tell us about the Banglalink commercial you are shooting now. You haven't appeared on TVCs in a while. It's my comeback in commercials. I shot two commercials back to back with the same production house, Run Out Films, one was Huawei and now this. I have always had a good relation with mobile phones and telcos. The last commercial I did was also with Banglalink. It was the first time they tried \"Phantom Shots.\" It was four years ago, when I was still hosting radio shows.  It (this TVC) is kind of massive. I am looking forward to it. I am hopeful. The arrangement they are providing is quite big. I have worked with this team before. They are from Bombay (Mumbai). It is very comfortable for me to work with them.  We started shooting at 11am in the morning. We started with a close-up of me. There is this superstition that if the heroine's close-up is looking nice, then the day will go swimmingly. I asked the DOP, \"Are you happy,sir?\" He was happy. Everybody was vibrant. Hopefully, it will be a good TVC."

Those are: GDP growth, inflation, interest rate, excess liquidity and money supply, clarity in deposits and non-performing loans, advance deposit ratio, etc.\nOther indicators include the exchange rate, productive investment, capital adequacy, current account and trade balance, forex reserve position, private and public sector credit, borrowing by government, etc.\nSome important factors to consider when analyzing these indicators are: Efficiency of state-owned enterprises, institutional accountability, job employment opportunities, cost of doing business, political risk, elections, etc.\nLaying the groundwork\nThe country's economy is, at present, beset with major challenges, so that before we can see the sustained results that monetary policy can produce, we have to be prepared to lay the necessary groundwork first. Doing so would entail some short-term costs but will help us immensely in the long-run, especially since not doing so would almost certainly threaten our future progress and stability.\nFor instance, a strong and healthy growth propelled by increased private and public investment along with public spending can lead to higher investment-related imports, pushing the current into a modest but manageable deficit. But the returns from those investments will bring us back to equilibrium. It's also a good idea to keep the public debt-to GDP ratio at moderate levels while working to raise the revenue-to GDP ratio.\nGiven existing challenges like an increasing savings-investment gap, unsatisfactory collection of tax revenue vis-a-vis target resulting in revenue short-fall, infrastructural under-development, institutional weakness, and slow-down in investments, to name a few - maintaining the current rate of output growth would require not only prudent macro-economic policies, but also upgrading the macro-economic policy-making practices and institutions.\nIt is essential to restore discipline and balance in the financial sector if we want to achieve our country's dream of becoming a knowledge-based, middle-income country by 2021, and eventually, eradicate poverty and ensure overall development of people's living standards.\nManaging problem areas\nA strong financial system is a must for successful implementation of monetary policy.\nNow, the running crisis in the banking and financial sectors due to a staggering increase in non-performing loans reflects institutional weakness in our financial system, which needs to be addressed.\nThe increasing gap between investment and savings is a major red flag indicating illegal capital flight.\nThe huge amount of missing funds representing an unaccounted transfer of money is a big blow to the economy as it means loss of investment and revenue income for the government.\nThese are some of the issues with our system that must be looked into for monetary policy to be effective.\nKey indicators to watch\nOur monetary policy should therefore be designed in a way that it keeps some key indicators on track.\nInflation, which took an up-turn in July 2017 and climbed to 5.59% by December 2017, is one of those indicators.\nSome economists predict far higher inflationary pressures in the near term as the country is facing some supply-chain problems with rice in addition to last year's floods that caused severe crop damage and lower productivity. Embracing a flexible inflation targeting approach is a possible solution.\nAs for interest rates, the declining trend coupled with higher inflation is creating ample liquidity and an increase in competition in the banking systems, where spreads between lending rate and deposit rate should be kept at a reasonable and minimal level.\nPrivate sector credit growth is slightly on the rise but still very low. If we want to achieve our desired rate of GDP growth, private sector credit should be accelerated somehow.\nThe current account and trade balance recorded a deficit due to higher import growth relative to export growth, and slow-down of remittance inflows during the last couple of months.\nAs a result of deterioration in the balance of current account and trade balance, unsatisfactory performance occurs that could be improved by adopting a cautionary and   consistent monetary policy.\nTo promote financial stability with sustainable development of banking and financial institutions, a sound, comprehensive, and effective monetary policy is needed to optimize all the different indicators which help the economic growth of the country.\nGreater priorities\nThe central bank needs to consider the effects of the welfare-oriented government budget and private sector investment on prices and the external sector stability.\nLikewise, it is necessary to appropriately manage the existing excess liquidity in the banking system in order to support development activities and investment promotion.\nExcess liquidity, low interest rates and interest rate differential with the neighbouring economy are some of the challenges facing the economy.\nIf this situation prevails for long, it could be disastrous for the economy, because such a scenario is ideal for informal capital flight, dominance of imports along with luxurious consumption and increasing speculative businesses, all of which eventually make the country worse-off.\nConsidering the likely impact of such a situation on financial stability, monetary policy must focus on managing liquidity, inflation rate and interest rate at an appropriate level and channeling the financial resources towards productive sectors that benefit the whole nation, not just the wealthy elite.\nUnder the current backdrop of low levels of financial inclusion, limited access to financial services, and low levels of financial literacy among the general public, especially in remote, rural, and high poverty areas, utmost priority must be given to address these concerns.\n\nAbdus Sobhan is a deputy general manager at Bangladesh Krishi Bank.

      "text": "Worldwide, over half a billion people live in delta areas Sand mining from rivers is depriving many low-lying Asian deltas of the sediment they need to maintain themselves, raising the risk of worsening land loss to sea level rise, researchers say. Combined with losses of soil-holding mangroves and accelerating groundwater extraction, which can lead to land sinking, the mining is increasing climate-related threats for those living in low-lying coastal areas, they said. \"We have created a recipe for climate disaster,\" said Marc Goichot of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Deltas dependent on the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Mekong and Yangtze rivers are now sinking and shrinking, according to research carried out by WWF - a situation worsened by climate-related warming and rising sea level. That is a problem not only because the deltas are home to millions of people but because they produce a significant share of the region's food. The Mekong delta, for instance, home to 17 million people, is a major source of rice for the region and underpins a quarter of Vietnam's GDP, Goichot said. \"It is 40,000 square kilometres - larger than many countries - and most of it is sinking,\" he said. More floods, more salt At the heart of the problem, Goichot said, is a lack of enough sediment moving down the rivers - and much of that is the result of mining of sand as a construction material and for other uses, he said. In some major rivers in Asia, such as the Mekong, Yangtze and Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, as much as 90% of the sediment that once travelled down the system is now collecting in reservoirs or being mined, WWF's research showed. That means much less material is arriving in delta areas to replace soil lost to coastal erosion and other natural processes. For those living in the deltas, it can mean growing risk of floods, inundation from coastal storm surges and worsening salt contamination in drinking water. Kusum Athukorala, former chair of the Sri Lanka Water Partnership, said the loss of sand also means less water-storage capacity in rivers, and less water flowing in to restore aquifers. That is a particular problem as climate change brings longer and hotter dry season and growing water stress, he said.  Worldwide, over half a billion people live in delta areas, WWF said. According to the UN Environment Programme, though record keeping is poor, global consumption of sand and gravel likely exceeded 40 billion tonnes in 2012, up from 9 billion tonnes in the 1970s, making it one of the world's most extracted resources by volume. \"To give a sense of its use, for every bucket of cement, five to seven buckets of sand are used in concrete. For every kilometre of road built, 30,000 tonnes of sand is used as its base,\" Goichot said. But sand is just as important in the river systems it is harvested from, he said. \"Keeping sand in the rivers is the best adaptation to climate change. If a river delta receives enough sediment, it builds itself above sea level in a natural reaction,\" Goichot, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview in Stockholm. Growing demand But sand mining also feeds Asia's rapidly growing cities. New buildings and roads require it and urban land is often expanded by pouring sand into wetlands or rice paddies. The island state of Singapore has expanded its land area 20% in the last 50 years, using sand dredged from the seabed but also imported by Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, said Goichot. Sand mining remains unregulated in many areas, however, and illegal sand mining operations operate in as many as 70 countries worldwide, Goichot said. \"In India unregulated sand mining is really an (escalating) menace,\" said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People (SANDRP). India issues sand mining licenses, he said, which limit the quantities of sand that can be taken and the locations where mining is allowed. But with limited monitoring, \"the actual mining may be very different,\" he said. River sand is preferred for construction in many cases because desert sand is too rounded to bind concrete well, while seabed sand contains salt that can corrode metal and dredging it can be costly. But too much harvesting of river sand is now taking a toll on those living downstream, Goichot said, with the Mekong delta, for instance, losing 12 metres of land along its coast each year, the equivalent of a football field and a half of land every day. In India, insufficient effort is being put into finding alternative sources of sand, including from construction waste or de-silting of reservoirs, Thakkar said. That means \"the rivers and everyone dependent on them are sufferers.\""

      "text": "The trailer underlines the natural and man-made difficulties that the protagonists face in their path to being together The trailer for Abhishek Kapoor's \"Kedarnath\" was released on Monday. Starring Sushant Singh Rajput and Sara Ali Khan, the film traces the love story between a Hindu tourist and a Muslim porter in the titular pilgrimage town against the backdrop of the 2013 Uttarakhand floods that killed more than 5,700 people. The trailer underlines the natural and man-made difficulties that the protagonists face in their path to being together. \"Even if there is a catastrophe, I will never allow the two of you to be together,\" says the father (Nitish Bharadwaj) to Khan's character. \"I will pray and chant for a catastrophe,\" she replies. Also starring Alka Amin and Sonali Sachdev, \"Kedarnath\" has been produced by RSVP Pictures and Guy in the Sky Productions. The film, which marks the acting debut of Sara Ali Khan, the daughter of Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh, will be released on December 7. On Saturday, Ajendra Ajay, a Bharatiya Janata Party leader, approached the Central Board of Film Certification seeking a ban on the film. He alleged that the film promotes love jihad - a term used by the Hindu Right to allege a conspiracy by Muslim men to marry women from other religions to convert them to Islam - and hurts Hindu religious sentiment.  \"By setting a romantic love story against the backdrop of a huge tragedy that occurred at Kedarnath, a centre of faith for crores of Hindus, the filmmakers have shown great disrespect to the followers of the religion\" Ajay told PTI.

      "headline": "Disaster management officials in Switzerland fight increasingly tougher battles as weather conditions intensify",
      "authors": "Saqib Sarker",
      "text": "Scientists fear that continued warming of permafrost can lead to more frequent and disastrous rockfalls and mudslides, endangering communities living in the valleys in the Swiss Alps  With rainfalls and storms becoming more intense than ever, disaster management in the Swiss Alps is getting harder. It is also more challenging because there are more people living in the valleys, where villages are susceptible to rockfalls and mudslides from above. The increasing frequency in stronger rains and storms makes the work of managing natural disasters much harder for people like Raphael Mayoraz, who is in charge of the Forest, River and Landscape Services Office at Canton Valais. His office is under the Department of Mobility, Territory, and the Environment (Department de la mobilite, du territoire et de l'environnement). Mayoraz says that rockfall events increased significantly in 2018 compared to previous years, with about 400 events recorded just in January, which is more than double the amount of rockfalls in the whole of 2017.  Home to the famous Matterhorn, Canton Valais is situated on the southwestern part of the country and it is the most Alpine laden canton in Switzerland. The 5,224 square kilometre canton has a population of 339,000.  Tasked with the job of making sure casualties to life and properties are minimized, Mayoraz works with a group of engineers to manage natural hazards in the canton. \"We have the highest peaks in Switzerland. The local population is about 350,000, and we are actually 18 engineers to take care of that. This includes hydrological or river provinces and all other geological areas, including seismic provinces. But we mostly deal with rockfalls, debris flows, landslides and avalanches,\" Mayoraz said.  As part of the prevention work, Mayoraz and his team create natural hazard maps using data from the field and set up alarm systems. \"The alarm system basically tells us that 'this is moving fast' or 'that is moving but not very fast',\" he said. Raphael Mayoraz talking to EQDA reporters at his office in Sion  Photo - Saqib Sarker  This data is combined with weather forecasts to predict events and take preventative measures. \"Very often we place surveillance systems to see how the terrain moves. We set up webcams and all sorts of equipments that feed to here in our computers. This enables us to carry out the management work,\" he added.  The increase of movements up in the mountains is mainly due to increase in rainfall intensity, says Mayoraz. \"In a regular year like in 2016 or 2017, we had about 150 events. But we got about 400 events just in January this year. This is because of a lot of rain.\" He observes that the rainfalls are not necessarily more than before, rather they are more intense. \"More intense rainfall is the reason for increased risk. If you summarize the old rain during the year, it's about the same. We are maybe getting more frequent rains, but more significantly, with higher intensities. Twenty cm in this area is quite a lot. It's very difficult to contain and manage,\" he said.  There are also a lot of avalanches at the same time higher in the mountains. However, a lot of those don't end up affecting people living down in the valleys. \"About 95 percent of those avalanches don't affect people, because they are really high in the mountain and only animals are exposed to them,\" he added.  While high intensity rains and storms help things further down the mountains, one of the root causes for the increase in movement up on the mountains is attributed to the warming up of permafrost, which causes, among other things, mountains to move. Permafrost is essentially permanently frozen ground. If it thaws, there is a risk of natural hazards like rockfalls or debris flows, as the permafrost function like a glue holding together big chunks of mountains. The temperature of permafrost is permanently below 0degC. Permafrost is mainly found at elevations above 2,500 metres, and covers some five percent of Switzerland's territory. \"The permafrost basically cements big blocks of rocks together that form the mountains. Naturally, enormous pressure is being exerted on them. The rock parts of the mountain basically becomes like the sledge of a skier and glides on the permafrost when warmer temperatures (close to zero) makes it more impressionable or softer,\" said Reynald Delaloye, Professor in Physical Geography at the University of Fribourg.  The warming up of the permafrost, which is holding the highest peaks in place in the Alps, threatens natural calamities like rockfalls, flash floods and mudslides. Prof Delaloye - who works mainly on permafrost monitoring, its evolution over time and all processes related to that - says if temperatures stay below zero then there is no threat to stability.  \"If the temperature of the ice is sufficiently cold, at -5 for instance, then there is no water there. If the permafrost is really cold it is stable. But as it warms up it becomes susceptible to the extreme pressure from the mountain,\" he said.  Prof Delaloye points out that the critical juncture is not really at the permafrost cProfessor Reynald Delaloye explaining how permafrost holds a mountain together in his office at University of Fribourg Photo - Saqib Sarkerompletely disappearing - a distant possibility - but when it comes close to a zero degree. The more imminent threat is permafrost coming close to a zero degree because that will create a lot of water in the permanently frozen ground, which will essentially unstick the big rocky parts of the mountains.  \"If the permafrost is at a temperature close to zero, at -0.5 to -.20, then that is still frozen state but you will have a lot of water because of the pressure,\" said Prof Delaloye.  Team leader of the 'Snow and Permafrost' and 'Permafrost and Snow Climatology' at the WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research SLF at Fluelastrasse Davos Dorf, Dr Marcia Phillips, says that it is difficult to determine patterns in geography without having extensive data over a long period of time. It becomes even more challenging for permafrost, which is a relatively new field of study and does not have extensive records, compared to older fields in geology. However, Dr Phillips says that even though it is hard to discern patterns, there is clear evidence of warming. \"We can say that we have cooling periods, but we have mainly warming. We can see it. We are measuring warming. It's not that easy to measure. Sometimes our instruments show warming even though there isn't one, which can be an electronic problem. You have to be very careful how you interpret the data,\" she said.  But the data that has been determined as accurate shows warning up of ground temperature. \"In 10 and 20 metres depth you can see there is warming,\" said Dr Phillips. At the SLF institute, where Dr Phillips run a monitoring network for monitoring permafrost in the Swiss Alps, her team set up boreholes in different terrains to measure changes in permafrost. The SLF team under Dr Phillips set up boreholes in the rocks up at the top of the mountain, in ice-rich permafrost, and also in between in steep slopes. \"From our measurements we can see that permafrost is getting warmer,\" said Dr Phillips. \"Permafrost is cold, it ranges between -3 and -7. But it's getting warm. The rock glaciers, which have lots of ice in them, gets warmer much more slowly,\" she added.   Rock glaciers can be really fast moving and they are a problem for the villagers down below. \"When it's too steep, the front material can go down with rainfall for example. You either get a mudflow or debris flow. This is very destructive if you have a village below,\" Dr Phillips said.  Like the rest of Europe, in recent years, there have been a large number of heatwaves in summer in the Swiss Alps. There are also long dry periods and then really intense rain falls. \"This is a problem. It's definitely affecting high mountain areas,\" said Dr Phillips.  Because of snow on top, the heat from the air cannot transmit directly to permafrost. The snow acts as a buffer, Dr Phillips explained. But as the snow melts and leave the surface unprotected, the top of the mountain becomes less stable.  \"There are movements on the ground, because we are on slopes. Rock glaciers move because they have ice in them. And we have been seeing massive acceleration in the rock glaciers, except for the last two years and it slowed down again. It tells us that the cooling has an affect on the dynamics of these features. We think when it's really hot the water can penetrate the rock better. And water is what is making these things move,\" Dr Phillips said. Dr Marcia Phillips talking about her permafrost monitoring network at her workplace in SLF in Davos Photo - Anne Rey-Mermet And the effects of these changes are clearly seen by Raphael Mayoraz. \"Higher in the mountain, permafrost is melting. That is producing a lot of unstable rocks, gravels and sand that are ready to go down in debris flow in the valley when you have very bad weather and lot of rains and storms. Especially in the summer when you have local storms that sustain for as long as an hour. It produces a lot of water in the same place and that creates debris flow that can go all the way down to the valley,\" said Mayoraz. The last few years have been particularly difficult for Mayoraz and his team as very intense local storms continue to rage in the region. Weather forecasts, while helpful, cannot predict the exact path of a storm. \"On top of that, if the storms move then the path becomes very difficult to predict. Like last year, there was a very good prediction for a storm following the Southern part of the Rhone Valley. And it was moving very fast at 70km per hour. It originally headed to the North but it ended up hitting the South. And it was so fast that it was impossible to call local people and warn them, because we had about a ten minute window before it started pouring down,\" Mayoraz recalled. While the global climate change continues to cause erratic weather, and consequently instability in the Alps along with all other regions, the contingency plan for disaster management primary comes in the form of better prevention systems. This includes building dams, fences and stopping big avalanches by preemptively creating artificial avalanches by explosives. Mayoraz's team has been successfully preventing disasters through all of these means. \"There is a village in the valley to Zermatt where there has been a lot of debris flow because there is a block of rock glacier on top. And we have been able to create a dam that collects all the debris flow and we can take it out with machines later. This village is relatively well-protected now,\" he said.  Early warning system is also a key tool in preventing damages. Technologies like satellite images and radar measurements are used to observe and take actions by Mayoraz and his team of engineers. \"We can usually detect with satellite or radar measurements that a major part of a mountain is starting to move. And if there is a village bellow we might have to evacuate that,\" said Mayoraz.  \"We had such a movement in an area close to the Great Aletsch Glacier,\" he continued.  \"Millions of cubic metres of rock was moving at a very fast speed - in geological speed. One metre a day is very fast in geological terms. But in this case luckily there wasn't any village below, so we didn't have to evacuate,\" he recalled.  Aside from effective early warning systems, intervention is also important, Mayoraz points out. \"There are various things that we can do. For instance, if we see a big rock is moving, given it's not too big, we can explode it,\" he said. For avalanches, Mayoraz's organization - Geologue cantonal Service de forets, des cours d'eau et du paysage (the forest, river and landscape services office) - has been constructing thousands of kilometres of fences that are holding the snow up in the slopes. The team also regularly triggers explosions to prevent big avalanches. \"If you wait, a slab can build up to four metres of snow, which can be a disaster when an avalanche starts from that. But for every half metre of snow, you can impose an avalanche by blowing it up through controlled explosion. It creates a small avalanche which does not cause a natural disaster,\" explained Mayoraz. His team does this almost every time after a snow storm. There are designated stations where explosions are carried out, using small 2.5kg bombs. \"We also do mathematical simulations to make natural hazard maps. This helps us prevent people from building chalets in risky areas. Because of advances in technologies these simulations are getting better,\" Mayoraz said.  For managing rockfalls, the computers are helping predict major events. \"This enables us to actually regulate where people can build chalets and prepare clear instructions,\" said Mayoraz.  The organization also builds dams at the bottom of mountains. These are right at the outskirt of a village to catch debris flow. \"We spend about 30 million Swiss Franc per year for all these structures (dams and fences),\" Mayoraz informed. Mayoraz's office interacts with its counterparts in other cantons. All 26 cantons in the country have organizations for natural hazards. \"We also interact with foreign countries, with the French in Chamonix and with Aosta Valley in Italy. These are similar regions. We exchange information about satellite measurements and matters like that,\" Mayoraz said. This report is produced as part of a reporting program sponsored and organized by Swiss organization EQDA, which hosted seven teams of journalists from Switzerland, and seven from seven other countries across the world. This year's theme was \"Climate Change: Time to Act\". Dhaka Tribune's Saqib Sarker was selected from Bangladesh to take part in the program by EQDA. As part of the program, Saqib visited Switzerland and wrote this report. He was assisted in the field work in Switzerland by Swiss journalist Anne Rey-Mermet of La Liberte newspaper.  "

We lost him 11 years back. But still now his writings are shining among his followers and admirers from all walks of life for his unique style, free-thinking and impartial writings. For those who are liberal, open-minded and free-thinkers, Azad's writings are still sources of inspiration, and psychological support in gaining moral strength as well.\nAs his eldest daughter, I have seen him from a close distance at home - experienced a lot of sweet times with him, and that's what I would like to share with all his fans and admirers today, April 26, 2018.\nMy father Humayun Azad's first love was his village Rarikhal. He visited many countries in the world, but I never heard him express anything appreciating the life in Europe or America ever. Instead of that he used to talk gladly about his village home Rarikhal and his childhood in Rarikhal. He used to present those memories in his poems and other writings about the beauty of unknown muddy roads, rural flowers, foggy winters, rainfall, sunshine, green fields, rivers, memories of his school life and growing time in the village that remained blended within his heart from the very beginning his life.\nAs an urban citizen, born and brought up in Dhaka city, village life didn't attract me ever as much as my beloved father was devoted to it. But I became amazed and overwhelmed with the beauty of village-life and the rich rural culture reading his heartiest descriptions (especially after his death) in his book \"Phuler ghondhe ghum asena\". While he was alive, Rarikhal was not in my heart as it is today - today my thinking has changed a lot. Now I love Rarikhal as my father loved it, because he is back in his sweet village Rarikhal now and that was his final destination and the place of eternal rest.\nHe used to say, after retirement from university teaching he would go back to Rarikhl and stay there for the rest of his life. Surprisingly it happened years before his retirement - he reached his village Rarikhal. Death has taken the great warrior son to his long desired soil of Rarikhal again.\nRarikhal was his first love and Dhaka University occupied second place in his heart. He studied there, developed philosophically there and eventually taught hundreds of young students there. He used to admit that Dhaka University was the place where he could take a breath of fresh air. Most of his books were written while he was staying on campus.\nWhen he was alive, I couldn't understand how much effort he used to put in completing a book.  But now when I read his books in detail, I realize how much he concentrated on his studies and writings at the same time.\nHe wrote many articles and columns in the weekly \"Purbavash\" and \"Ajker kajog\" during the 1990's. I used to enjoy his newspaper columns because of his simplicity with language. But he didn't continue writing in the newspapers. When I asked him why he stopped, he replied, \"I'll be getting busy with the publication of books and I have to concentrate there\". So he didn't want to waste his time in writing newspaper columns only. Among all his writings, my favorite were his creations for juvenile literature. In the introduction of this book \"Phuler Ghondhe Ghum Ashena\" he wrote - \"Mauli Tomake Boli, Tomar Motoi Ami Chilam Choto, Chilam Grame.\" Almost all his fans became familiar with my name through this book. It was a matter of great pleasure for me. Although I loved my father's articles, columns and poems, his novels didn't attract me that time. After reading his novels later on it seemed to me that he portrayed our fragile and deteriorating social structure so carefully.\nHe gave his highest efforts in writing his famous book \"Nari.\"   He decided to write the feminist book while he was conducting his PhD research in Edinburg. When he returned home from Scotland, he brought back many books with him for helping him with the writing of NARI. I remember he took leave from the university for writing this book. In a true sense he was a real feminist - feminism was a favorite topic in all his writings.\n\nAlso Read- No end in sight for Humayun Azad's murder trial\n\nPeople used to mention the term \"unconventional\" before his name. It was his natural instinct to see anything from a different angle. My parents' marriage was also a bit unconventional in all respects. They got married over telephone in 1975. Moreover, the very significant aspect of his life is that, he changed his real name and took a penname - he became \"Humayun Azad\" from \"Humayun Kabir\". And he continued writing as \"Humayun Azad\" till the end of his life.\nAs the eldest daughter, I had freedoms in all stages of my life because of my father. I learned a lot from him and developed decision making capability in order to apply it independently, which is not possible for many educated women in our society still.\nHis philosophy and ideology were pragmatic and advanced compared to others of his time. He wrote in his poem \"Ami je Prithibike Cheyechilam, Take ami Paini. Tokhono amar Shomoy Asheni. Ami Bechechilam Onnoder Shomoye\". Sometimes I feel he really did live during the time of others.\nI never saw him express regret for any posts or rewards. He was straightforward and never talked to please anyone. Sometimes I used to become surprised to see his courage.  I asked him once \"How do you get this courage\"? He answered, \"I don't want anything from anybody. What I need I acquire myself, so I don't need to praise anyone\".\nThat's why close people around him became his enemies to a great extent. Sometimes I used to regret that his surroundings were decreasing gradually because of his bitterly truthful and straight-forward philosophy. But when he was attacked, people burst out and took to the street like floods in Dhaka city in the middle of the night. People came out and reacted together in favor of honesty and truth, and that was tremendous. They did it for a writer like Humayun Azad who was forever a broad-minded, honest and courageous.\nBangladesh was always in his heart. That's why he wrote, \"Priyotoma Bangladesher Kotha tumi Kokhono amar kache Jante Cheona, Ami ta Muhurteo Shojjo korte Parina, Tar onek Karon roeache.\"\nToday is his 72th birthday. I can see his smiling face always standing before me and asking me about my well being. So it's not possible for me or my family to celebrate this occasion, since we still cannot accept his premature demise at the peak of his powers. Therefore, only tears are rolling down my cheeks today.\nMy heartiest gratitude and love to him on his birth anniversary.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "\nWest Bengal blames Dhaka, Delhi and Kathmandu for floods\n\n\n\n\nAshis Biswas\n\n\n\n\n Published at 01:25 am August 19th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 02:34 pm August 19th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nAs Bangladesh, India and Nepal are reeling under heavy downpour and massive floods, the Trinamool Congress (TMC)-led West Bengal Government is back to what it does best: blaming others, including neighbouring countries for its own failures.\nNot content with accusing the Centre of having caused the \"man-made\" floods in West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has urged Delhi to take up with Dhaka the fresh flooding caused by the swelling Atreyi and two other rivers that flow into North Bengal from Bangladesh \"at the appropriate level.\"\nHer initial complaints were related to the havoc caused by rain and flooding in South Bengal. But, following Mamata's complaints against Delhi and Dhaka, West Bengal's Minister for Irrigation Rajib Banerjee now points out how the excess flow and discharge of water from rivers in Nepal and the Bihar state have added to North Bengal's woes, causing prolonged water-logging and bringing everyday activities of thousands of people to a halt.\nThe complaints Rajib raised sounded more like an elementary lesson on problems of regional river linkages than a serious, fact-based allegation. He did not refer to the prime cause of the ongoing floods and damage to property caused by recent long spells of rain due to repeated depressions in West Bengal and neighbouring areas including Bangladesh. Taking a cue from his chief, Rajib spoke to the media mostly about the situation the state faced because of the high discharge of excess water from Nepal and Bihar. He had visited Malda and three other districts before meeting the media.\nInterestingly, whereas the present death toll in Bangladesh on account of the recent floods has been reported in Indian media at under 20, the figures for Bihar, Nepal and West Bengal are 50, 55 and 45 respectively.\nThis naturally raises questions about the preventive measures taken by respective countries, central or state governments, and other authorities in charge to ensure that the current spell of bad weather did not cause much damage. Not surprisingly, West Bengal's record in providing relief and immediate assistance to the flood-affected people, currently estimated at 5 million, has not inspired confidence.\nAs Kolkata-based TV channels have been showing day after day, from Midnapore to Cooch Behar, there are thousands of marooned people virtually living in the open, without much official help reaching them by way of food, drinking water or medicine. Most rivers are overflowing, and accumulated water has been receding exceedingly slowly. The reasons are: lack of drainage channels, rampant human encroachment along river banks and shorelines, illegal building construction, and reckless sand lifting to carry out illegal constructions, among other factors.\nAs Mohammad Shafiq, a flood refugee in Malda, was quoted as saying: \"Quite apart from the vagaries of the weather, people also have to pay for the greed and corruption of politically backed anti-socials.\"\nWith little or no relief in sight, many people whether in North or South Bengal, have survived barely through the efforts of local NGOs and peoples' organisations. In both parts of Bengal, there have been several instances where official convoys carrying relief materials have been looted by starving, angry mobs, the more so in Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar. There have been allegations of firing by police on such crowds in some areas, but the officials concerned strongly denied this.\nQuite apart from problems of riverbank erosion and attendant issues, Bengal's pathetic failure to protect infrastructure such as bridges and culverts - constructed by Public Works Department, Irrigation Department and other agencies - also came to the fore. There are reports almost every day on how poorly maintained and old bridges collapse, leading to communication breakdowns between the north and the south.\nTwo typical examples: about 48 hours ago, an old bridge on the River Islamari collapsed in Panhati area of Moinaguri, leaving nearly 10,000 people without basic supplies.\nLocals complained that there had been no maintenance at all of the old bridge. And, at flooded Raiganj in Simulguri, an old bamboo bridge on the River Neem was swept away, affecting normal communication, even though a new pucca bridge had been built nearby a decade ago. But the new bridge has never been used in the last 10 years because land disputes prevented the construction of approach roads on both sides.\nShounak Mukherjee, a Kolkata-based economist, said: \"There are numerous examples of such mind-boggling negligence, callousness and the lack of elementary governmental efficiency or interest in ensuring even minimal public relief for taxpaying people in West Bengal.\"\nSuch failures get exposed during natural calamities and blaming others will not conceal Kolkata's own failures.\nTwo researchers point out that unlike Bangladesh or Nepal, where steps have been taken officially to ensure that problems from global warming and flash floods can be handled more effectively, no similar exercise has been carried out in West Bengal. Their study claims that between 1824 and 1930, the smaller rivers and creeks used to act as drainage channels for bigger rivers. From 1950 onwards, as human pressure began to grow exponentially, massive unregulated encroachments and illegal building construction destroyed the flow of the smaller rivers, leaving no drainage channels, even within the greater Kolkata.\nThe outcome of such reckless, politically backed destruction of the environment, caused mainly because of vote bank considerations, can be seen in the prolonged water-logging in parts of Behala in Kolkata and Amta in Howrah, according to environmentalists.\n\n\n\n\n"

In 1988, the water level had reached 20.62m.\nAt present, the water level at Bahadurabad is 64cm above the danger level, following the recent floods and heavy rainfall.\nApart from Brahmaputra, the water level in another northern river, Teesta, has also risen at an abnormal rate in the last two days.\nAccording to FFWC data, the water level in Teesta River's Dalia point was at 60cm above the danger level. In Kurigram, water is flowing at 112cm above the danger level in the Dharla River.\nSazzad Hossain, executive engineer of FFWC, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"The trend of water level rising in the Jamuna is a bit unusual. The water level has gone up by 50-65cm in one day at different points.\"\nHe further added that this trend would continue for at least next three or four days.\nHydrology expert Prof Ainun Nishat said there was a huge possibility that Bangladesh would experience another flood like the one in 1988, one of the worst ones in the country's history with a catastrophic aftermath.\nMeanwhile, the Indian Meteorological Department has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall in Assam, Meghalaya, some parts of Jharkhand, West Bengal and Bihar states in the next few days.\nIf their projection holds, the water level of the Ganges systems in Bangladesh, known as Padma will also cross the danger level by Friday or Saturday.\nThe other river systems in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river basin may also be in the same situation; the water level in several others, including the Surma and the Kushiyara rivers, is already above the danger level.\nIf water levels in the Brahmaputra and Ganges reach their highest and the Meghna is near the danger level by Friday, the situation will be worse as the spring tide is adding more water to the rivers, said Nishat.\nHe predicted that if the situation follows the track he predicted, large swathes of central Bangladesh, including Munshiganj, Faridpur, Madaripur, Shariatpur, Tangail, Kushtia and some parts of Dhaka city, will be inundated for at least 10-12 days.\nDuring the two-week flood in 1988, more than 100 people died while 13 million people were directly affected and around 25,000sq-km areas in 35 districts were under water.\nAlso, 370,000 hectares of arable land were completely damaged and 13,345 hectares were partially damaged.\nFFWC's Sazzad Hossain told the Dhaka Tribune: \"The highest water level at Brahmaputra's Bahadurabad point was recorded at 20.71m on July 29 last year.\"\nThe present trend shows that the water level of Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna might reach their highest at the same time, this weekend, like they did in 1988, leading to a catastrophic flood.\nAfter the recent floods, water is flowing above the danger level at 25 out of 90 points in different rivers in these three basins.\nAt the same time, the water level has also been rising at 77 points of other rivers across the country.\nOf them, the water level at Jamuna River's Sariakandi point was 43cm above the danger level, 68cm in Punarbhaba River at Dinajpur, 81cm at Tangon River's Thakurgaon point, 106cm at Surma River's Kanaighat point and 176cm at Kangsho River's Jariajanjail point.\nVarious parts of the country have also experienced severe rainfall in the last 24 hours.\nWithin that time, Bangladesh Meteorological Department recorded 200mm rainfall at Sunamganj's Loregarh, 198.7mm in Dinajpur, 188mm in Durgapur, 178mm in Chittagong and 132mm in Panchagarh.\n\n\n\n\n"

Therefore the country is expected to produce around 1.5 million tons less Aman paddy this season.\nIn addition, around 5,000 hectares of vegetable crops have been inundated while around 8,000 hectares of Aush paddy has also been badly hit by the floods ahead of harvesting.\nThis year the government set a target to bring around 5.4 million hectares of agricultural land under Aman production.\nThe country produces around 34.7 million tons of rice against its annual demand for 32.4 million tons.\nAmong the paddy varieties, Boro accounts for the bulk of total production - ranging around 19.5 million tons - while Aman production comes second annually.\nMeanwhile, the government has started distributing Aman paddy seedlings in different districts where floodwater is receding.\nSources said there is an acute shortage of seedlings after the flood.\nFood Loss\nJust a few months ago during the Boro season, the country lost around two million tons of Boro rice due to sudden flash floods in six districts along the Haor basin.\nThe food shortage over the last few months hiked the coarse rice price in local markets by Tk18 a kg compared to the same period a year ago.\nWith its limited stocks, the government is struggling to provide support for Safety Net Programmes including Vulnerable Group Feeding, Vulnerable Group Development and Gratuitous Relief.\nAs of on Monday, the government's food reserve stood at 446,000 tons. Of the total, there were 312,000 tons of rice and 134,000 tons of wheat grains.\nThe Floods\nAccording to Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, water levels of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Ganges-Padma rivers are in falling trend while Surma-Kushiyara is rising.\nUnder the influence of current floods, 18 river points out of 90 measured stations in different rivers in all three basins - Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna - have seen water flow above the danger level.\nAt the same time, water levels have been rising in 31 points in the rivers across the country.\nOf them, the Kushiyara River at Amalshid point has risen by 101cm, the Gur River at Singra point by 71cm and the Atrai River at Baghabari point by 19cm.\nIn addition, the level of the Lakhya River has swollen at Lakhpur point by 91cm, the Padma River at Goalanda point by 10cm, and the Surma River at Kanaighat point by 42cm.\nAll of these are above the danger level.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "\nWhy so flooded?\n\n\n\n\nAKM Saiful Islam\n\n\n\n\n Published at 06:43 pm August 26th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nI am often asked by journalists and some colleagues about our country's recent flood situation -- their line of questioning is usually whether we can do anything to prevent it.\nBefore addressing the issue of managing floods of such enormous scale, it is important to discuss the causes.\nCommon sense dictates that prevention is always better than cure, the scale of the devastation caused by these floods can be reduced at some stage if we can work on some of the major human-induced causes.\nGeographically, Bangladesh is located in a delta of the three major rivers: Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna -- commonly known as the GBM basin. Some 57 trans-boundary rivers carry flood-water from four upstream countries: China, Nepal, Bhutan, and India.\nIf heavy rainfall occurs in the upper parts of the catchment for a few days straight, direct run-off generated by excess rainfall will be carried out by these trans-boundary rivers towards our country. However, when normal monsoon floods exceed the danger level, it would cause damage to property, infrastructure, agriculture, livestock, and even risk lives.\nIn the recent past, we have observed major floods in Bangladesh during the monsoon seasons of 1987, 1988, 1998, 2004, 2007, and 2016. In 2017, the peak water level crossed the highest recorded water levels in Brahmaputra, Teesta, Dharala, and Jamuneswari rivers. We may not able to blame nature only for such high flood levels, as there are many human-induced reasons behind them.\nHuman interventions in the natural river systems, and the changes in the land-use pattern of their catchments, make the hill slope steeper, causing frequent, and destructive, floods\nHuman interventions in the natural river systems, and the changes in the land-use pattern of their catchments make the hill slope steeper, and our rivers are now carrying large amounts of sediments than ever before, causing frequent and destructive floods.\nUrbanisation generates more runoff while encroachment of wetlands and embankment confine flood water inside the river channel which raises the flood peak. Moreover, excess sediments raise the bed level and further exacerbate the flood conditions.\nBefore the monsoon season, it is important to ensure that flood control infrastructures are functioning properly. Inadequate and improper maintenance of the embankments and water control structures such as sluices, regulators, etc would also assist with breaches in the embankments and flood inundation in the protected sides.\nMany centres such as National Centres for Atmospheric Research in the US provide long-term seasonal outlooks of precipitation which can be modelled to provide long-term outlooks for our flooding.\nDredging of rivers and canals can benefit from reducing flood peaks and also act a storage reservoir of water during the dry season. It can also help in improving navigability, recharging groundwater, ensuring sustainability of the eco-system, enhancing fisheries, etc.\nDue to global warming, the monsoon has become more damaging in recent decades. But, as a result, our water-holding capacity has increased. The impact of climate change on hydrological cycles and extreme events is still an active field of research.\nMany regional climate modelling results showed us that the mean monsoon flow will be increased by more than 20% in the Brahmaputra basin by the end of this century. Moreover, the sea level rise will be expected to provide additional pressures due to the backwater effect on flood flows.\nA lot of studies show that the intensity of rainfall, and overall precipitation, in a year will only increase in South Asia going forward. If all the countries sharing the common river basin act together and eliminate these man-made causes of floods, it will be possible to reduce the severity of the floods up to a certain extent.\nOtherwise, we have to face such catastrophic disasters much more frequently in the future.\nAKM Saiful Islam is a Professor at the Institute of Water and Flood Management (IWFM) at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET).\n\n\n\n\n"

Bhasan Char is an isolated island in the Bay of Bengal, located more than 20km away from Hatiya.\nThe journey itself is nothing short of an adventure, as we had to wait seven days for favourable weather conditions to make the trip. We could not find any boatmen willing to take us to the island even when the sky was only a little cloudy.\nThe Bangladesh Navy has been tasked with making Bhashan Char habitable for the Rohingya people who have fled Myanmar due to the recent spate of violence in their homeland in northern Rakhine State.\nSeveral government high-ups, including officials from the Ministry of Home Affairs, have visited the island on several occasions. Despite their assessments, confusion regarding the habitability of Bhashan Char still remains among the local administration and people.\nWe arrived at the docks named Chairman Ghat on October 3, but none of the trawlers agreed to make the journey, citing inclement weather as the reason.\nAfter some persuasion, we were able to hire a fishing boat to take us to Bhashan Char the following morning. A number of boat crew members accompanied us in the trip.\nAfter two-and-a-half hours at sea, we reached Bhashan Char. A large vessel of the Bangladesh Navy was moored near the island.\nWe inspected the island from the boat, and found that it was much wider in the northeastern area. Bhashan Char is criss-crossed by several small canals, and a forest can be seen in the distance.\nWe witnessed the construction of several small tin-shed buildings near the dock. A number of navy officials were seen resting in another tin-shed building. There is a helipad and a road nearby.\nA navy official was found on duty there, but he refused to make any comments without the approval of the concerned authorities.\nThe network signal for mobile phones is weak throughout the island.\nWe managed to get in touch with an on-duty official after several attempts. The official stated that any disclosure of information, reports or photographs concerning the project area of Bhashan Char has been restricted by the highest level of the government.\n\"Entry to the project area is also restricted, and no information can be disclosed,\" the official added.\nAfter walking around the island for some time, we noticed that parts of Bhashan Char were becoming submerged during high tide. However, we noticed some comparatively high areas where water did not reach.\nA little further, we found trees that are covered in moss for up to seven feet.\nAccording to our boatman, high tides flood the area during the full moon.\nThe question started gnawing in our minds: is the island really habitable for people?\nWe decided to venture deep into the forest at the centre of the island. We found two shepherds and their buffaloes relaxing at a clearing.\nTalking to the Bangla Tribune, the shepherds said they have been raising buffaloes on this island for the last three years, but they do not live here permanently.\nThe duo confirmed that during the normal high tide, three to four feet of water floods the island, while during the full moon and the new moon, water can rise up to four or eight feet, depending on the area.\nIn the official documents of the Forest Department and local administration, Bhashan Char is mentioned as \"Jaliyar Char\" and is separated by two areas: one is called Jaliayar Char, and the other is New Jaliayar Char.\nAnother small island called Thengar Char is located 5km from Jaliyar Char.\nThe Bangla Tribune has learned that, initially, the Rohingya refugees were to be rehabilitated in the Thengar Char. However, district administration officials on a visit to the project area mistakenly landed in Jaliyar Char instead of Thengar Char. The rehabilitation project started soon after the inspection.\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina later directed that the name Thengar Char be changed into Bhashan Char, as the latter sounds better.\nBhashan Char is riddled with at least 50 small and medium canals that run through the island.\nRiaz Uddin, a fisherman from Nalchira area, was found near one of these canals.\nTalking to the Bangla Tribune, he confirmed that the island is called Jaliyar Char and not Thengar Char by the Forest Department officials.\n\"Thengar Char is located a bit south from here,\" he added.\nHowever, despite the reported misunderstanding, the rehabilitation project for the Rohingya continues here.\nAccording to the fisherman, it would take another 8-10 years to make the island habitable for people. He said the island is not high enough to escape water from the high tide and still suffers from erosion.\nHe posed an important question: \"If the island is uninhabitable for the fishermen and the shepherds, how will other people settle here?\"\nMd Nahid Hasan, the beat officer for Nalchira Range in Hatiya, recently filed a report on the current condition of Bhashan Char.\nThe report states that Bhashan Char is 35km from Boyar Char Chairman Ghat and 25km from the Nalchira Ghat.\nAn official of the Bangladesh Navy, stationed on Bhashan Char, told the Bangla Tribune on condition of anonymity that relocating the Rohingya here would be an inhuman move.\n\"The island is remote, and lacks a good transportation system,\" he said. \"During the monsoon, the communication with the mainland completely snaps. If enough food is not stored in the island, the Rohingya refugees would starve for days.\"\nDescribing the intense flooding caused by the Bhola Cyclone on November 12, 1970, the navy official said: \"There were no survivors in Nijhum Dwip. The sea took everyone who lived there. Bhashan Char is even lower than Nijhum Dwip.\"\nNoakhali Division Forest Department official Md Tohidul Islam was unresponsive when asked to comment by the Bangla Tribune.\n\"I cannot comment on the matter. The government had asked for our opinion, and we provided it,\" he said.\nSpeaking on the matter, Noakhali Deputy Commissioner Mahbub Alam Talukder said: \"We witnessed the same situation there [Bhashan Char].\n\"We will carry out the government's directives. If the government wants us to rehabilitate the Rohingya there, we will follow the order. It is their decision, not ours.\"\n \nThis article was first published on Bangla Tribune.\n \n\n\n\n\n"

The kind of program which shows that, in Bangladesh, we leave no one behind.\nIt is also important that this is not a short-term initiative; we have to help our farmers until the next harvest, so that they have the opportunity to find their footing.\nWhile the government program will save the country from the brink of agricultural devastation, it does come at a price. Since the prices of fertiliser and pesticides have increased, the price of crops will inevitably go up.\nThis does not bode well for the underprivileged.\nAs such, what we have to ensure now is that we are better prepared for flooding in the future. As a nation exceedingly susceptible to the effects of climate change and the volatile weather, it is up to the government to keep this mind in the coming years.\nFlooding has resulted in losses in the crores, and this hurts not just the farmers but our entire economy.\nBut the government has so far done a terrific job of looking after its citizens. Let us keep this going.\n\n\n\n\n"

In such circumstances, it is difficult for us to feed over a million Rohingya people who have taken shelter here,\" he said.\n\"The UN and other development organisations will not always be providing food for them.\"\nCox's Bazar Assistant Deputy Commissioner and Executive Magistrate AKM Lutfor Rahman is involved in the biometric registration of the refugees and told the Dhaka Tribune that the process is moving quite slowly due to a lack of logistical support and personnel.\n\"Additional manpower and logistical support are required to expedite the process. We hope we would be provided with the support by the next week,\" he said.\nLutfor said a large number of Rohingya people are not aware of the biometric registration process and do not even understand why the government is registering them.\n\"We are making them understand that the government registers them so that they can easily be identified and to make sure all of them are getting facilities from Bangladesh and International Organization for Migration,\" he said.\n\"At the beginning, we had written 'Myanmar national' as their identity in the registration cards (but) we are now writing 'Myanmar Rohingya' following their objections, because they said they feel more comfortable with it.\"\nOver half a million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar since August 24, after ethnic conflicts in Rakhine sparked the most rapid human exodus since the Rwandan genocide in 1994. But only around 32,284 refugees had been registered by Friday.\nThey add to the estimated 400,000 Rohingya who were already taking shelter in Bangladesh.\n\n\n\n\n"

Every single year, floods devastate and wreak havoc, a natural force at work that swallows everything in their vast maw.\nAs torrents pour down in the northern part of the country, the rivers Surma and Kushiara have swelled up and covered vast swathes of land in Moulvibazar and Sylhet since Friday.\nMoulvibazar remains unchanged\nAround 300,000 people are still stranded in Moulvibazar as the flood water has yet to recede. The water levels of Kushiara River and Hakaluki Haor, Kawadighi Haor and Hail Haor.\nBoats are now the only means of travel since most of the roads are submerged. The disruption of road communications has severed road connection to Moulvibazar sadar upazila, stranding about 15-20,000 people.\nMoulvibazar Deputy Commissioner Md Tofail Islam said the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief distributed 200 tonnes of rice on Sunday.\n[caption id=\"attachment_72441\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] The deputy commissioner of Moulvibazar distributes relief among villagers affected by the flood on July 3, 2017 Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nMoulvibazar Secondary School Education officer, Abdul Wadud, said: \"The schools near the Haors have been immensely damaged.\"\nA total of 183 schools have been shut down in Moulvibazar - of them, 142 are primary schools and 41 are secondary schools.\nWadud said 42 secondary schools have been shut down as they are all submerged in flood water. The schools will reopen once the water recedes.\n\nAlso Read- Floods wreak havoc in Moulvibazar and Sylhet\n\nFlood worsens in Sylhet\nThe flood situation in Sylhet has worsened. Due to the heavy rainfall in the upstream, the water level of the Surma-Kushiara river system has gone above danger level. Many areas are now under water in Surma upazila.\nSylhet Additional Deputy Commissioner Shahidul Islam Chowdhury said: \"The situation has yet to improve. We have distributed another 200 tonnes of rice. On Sunday, we had distributed about 127 tonnes of rice and Tk2.77lakh in cash.\"\nShahidul also added that Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury, minister of disaster management and relief, and Nurul Islam Nahid, minister of education, were in Sylhet to discuss and distribute relief.\n[caption id=\"attachment_72443\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] The rivers gradually swell, there is no malice or menace in what they do, merely a force of nature consuming everything Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nAwami League Organisational Secretary Misbah Uddin Siraj was also distributing relief along with four others representatives have started to give donations to people from affected areas.\nMisbah Uddin told the Dhaka Tribune: \"We participated in the relief programme organised by Osmani Nagar Disaster Management Committee. Later, we also distributed relief in Balaganj and other areas.\"\nDue to severe flooding, about 195 schools have been forced to shut down temporarily. They will reopen once the water recedes.\nWhere will they go?\nThe rising waters have inundated entire villages, forcing people to move out. Many villagers are taking refuge in the homes of their neighbours and relatives. Although three flood shelters have been opened in Barlekha upazila in Moulvibazar, they are as difficult to get to, hence a small turnout of refugees.\nBarlekha UNO SM Abdullah Al Mamun said: \"At least the water level did not rise, it is still steady. The biggest problem right now is the disruption in communications. Roads have weakened and caved in due to being flooded for so long.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_72444\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] There is no way in, there is no way out, except for boats as floodwater pervades everywhere Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nKulaura Upazila Parishad Chairman Md Azizul Rahman said: \"70% of the houses in my union are under water, where will my people go?\"\nIn South Surma upazila - the unions of Mirzanagar, Manikpur, Inat Alipur, Rautkandi, Sikandarpur, Panigaon, Rakhalganj, Khalomukh, Bhangi, Jolkorkandi, Porairchok, Molagram, Molabazar and Hajipur - are entirely waterlogged.\nAccording to Water Development Board sources, the water level of the rivers is quite above the danger level - Surma is flowing above 57cm, Kushiara is above 77cm, 93cm and 22cm in three separate locations.\n\n\n\n\n"

The vegetable was selling at between Tk50 and Tk55 per kilogram at different city markets on Monday, up from Tk30-35 in late July.\nPrices of garlic, ginger including different spices and vegetables including eggplants, pointed gourd, brinjal also increased while the Eid-ul-Azha, one of the biggest Muslim festivals, is only a few days away.\nThe retails said they were facing supply shortage due to floods, resulting in the price hikes.\n\"Farmlands have been damaged by the floods in different parts, which has contributed to the surge in vegetable prices,\" Tofazzal Hossain, a vegetable vendor at Karwan Bazar, told the Dhaka Tribune.\nTrading Corporation of Bangladesh said the supply crunch of vegetables due to the deluge heat up the kitchen markets in Dhaka and elsewhere in the country and increased the prices of essentials up to 102% in August from July.\nOnion prices shot up by 90-102%, 15 kinds of vegetables by 50-100%, chili by 110%, garlic by 20%, riverine fish except Hilsa by 20-30%, local chicken by 10%, cardamom by 8% and cinnamon by 5% on Friday than the previous weeks, according to the data of TCB and Department of Agricultural Marketing (DAM).\nThe prices of some vegetables have increased by Tk10-20 per kg in last couple of days. In the capital's Gopibagh kitchen market on Monday, tomato was selling at Tk140-160 per kg, brinjal at Tk60-80 per kg, bitter gourd at Tk60-80 per kg, cucumber at Tk60-80 per kg, ridge gourd at Tk80 per kg and okra at Tk60 per kg.\nLuftar Khan, a vegetable trader in Shukrabad kitchen market in Dhaka, said there were fewer supplies in the market as many rail and road transportation system had collapsed in the northern region of the country.\nMohammad Harun, an onion importer, said: \"The damage of crops due to floods and price hike in India are responsible for the rise in onion prices in the local market while heavy rainfall in Bangladesh is hampering transportation, which is also responsible for the hike in local onion prices.\"\nThe market insiders also blamed \"syndicates\" for \"manipulating\" the prices of essentials as the Eid-ul-Azha approached.\n\n\n\n\n"

It will not be very wise to try to prevent them using permanent structures.\"\n[caption id=\"attachment_60448\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Paddy fields in Moulvibazar are submerged after flash flood in early April DHAKA TRIBUNE[/caption]\nAlthough the role of climate change on flash floods is yet to be established, changes in weather phenomenon and increase in extreme weather events have already been observed all over the world that are connected to global warming.\nThe probability of the occurrence of flash flood before its natural time would likely be higher in the future due to climate change, the professor said.\nAsked if there were any early warning systems in the country for such flash floods, he said there are a few existing warning systems but their usability is still questionable.\n\"We are working with Bangladesh Water Development Board and Bangladesh Meteorological Department to develop a flash flood forecasting and early warning system under a project called Flash Flood Early Warning System,\" Prof Saiful said.\nThey are hoping to complete development of the tool before the flash flood season next year. This system would be able to forecast with a lead time of three days, he added.\n\nRecommendations by experts for flash flood control\n1. Construction of rubber dams depending on the topography and sediment load of the river in the area to save Boro crops\n2. Dredging of rivers and canals before pre-monsoon to improve their water carrying capacity\n3. Introducing crop insurance to reduce the flash flood related risks in Haor areas\n4. Introducing short cycle varieties of rice there\n5. Inclusion of economic importance of Haor areas in national curriculum\n6. Building eco-tourism in the Haor areas\n7. Engaging community-based organisations to push local economy around Haor\n8.Leasing water bodies to social organisations instead of individuals by revising the water body regulations\n9. Building better coordination among government agencies for safeguarding natural habitat\n10.Survey on Haor areas to assess economic valuation of Haor resources\n11. Initiating new programmes to diversify agricultural products\n\nPlanning Commission's UNDP-backed project titled Support to Sustainable and Inclusive Planning (SSIP) held the workshop on Thursday that recommended long term action plan along with better coordination among government agencies, engagement of private sector for development in Haor areas, and efforts to be taken to preserve and conserve Haor biodiversity and ecosystems better.\n[caption id=\"attachment_60451\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Flash flood in Kishoreganj. Over 300,000 hectares of paddy crop have been destroyed in the northern districts DHAKA TRIBUNE[/caption]\nSome 52 local environment activists and national stakeholders took part in the workshop.\nSpeakers said the issue needed to be included in national curriculum, particularly for the students of that region so that the new generation would understand their agro-climatic, economic and environmental significance and work for the development of the area effectively.\nBetter coordination would help avoid duplication of efforts and waste of public resources.\nThey suggested a comprehensive survey on Haor areas to assess economic valuation of Haor resources and rolling out new programmes to diversify agricultural products and improve life and livelihood of the people there.\nFakrul Ahsan, Project Manager of SSIP, said ownership of local people is vital for maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance of Haor areas.\nProfessor Shamsul Alam, Member of GED, urged the authorities concerned to conduct benchmark surveys and research on different agro-climatic and social aspects of Haors.\n\n\n\n\n"

The rest of the flood affected people have had to rely on help from NGOs and voluntary agencies.\n\"Because we were unable to provide aid to all those affected by the flash floods, a lot of the food and cash support has come from NGOs,\" said Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) of Sunamganj Kamruzzaman.\nOxfam International Bangladesh has distributed monetary support of Tk1.4crore among 3500 affected families in two districts - Sunamganj and Kishoreganj - through a consortium.\n\"We have tried to support the affected families with direct cash because, other than food, people need the money to get back their livelihoods,\" said Babul Hussain, the team leader of the consortium that consists of five local NGOs in the Haor basin.\n\"But by no means are we able to fully accommodate everyone affected by the flash floods because of shortage of food supply and road connectivity,\" he added.\nThere is also the problem of the mismanagement of resources induced by nepotism in the affected areas.\nAs most of the relief has been distributed in areas that have roads in the Haor basin, remote areas such as Dirai, Jamalganj has not received any relief yet.\nSunil Chnadra Das Ray, a resident of Kamarhati village in Itna upazilla, Kishoreganj district told the Dhaka Tribune: \"We did not receive any government aid because they are provided by the local union parishad and we do not have any delegates from this village there.\"\nAdmitting that there might have been an oversight, Tahirpur Upazilla Chairman Kamrul Hasan told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Even though we have not heard of such complaints from my area, from my understanding remote regions might have been overlooked during the aid distribution process.\"\nFlash floods are common in the Haor basin druing the pre-monsoon period, but poor management of the rivers and embankments, and the decline in the navigability of the rivers have worsened the situation over the years.\nThis year, the flash floods came earlier than usual, while Boro farmers were still waiting to harvest the crop.\n\n\n\n\n"

But the sudden flash floods have destroyed that chance,\" said Nirod Boron Saha, president of Noagaon Rice Whole Seller Association.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, Boro is the largest part of the country's rice production. In the 2015-16 fiscal, Boro made up around 19 million tonnes of the total 35 million tonnes of rice produced in Bangladesh.\nZahidul Haq, deputy director of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) office in Sunamganj district, said the recent downpours have taken their toll on the harvest.\n\"At least a 100,000 hectares of Boro has gone under water in the flash flood in the last few days,\" he said. A similar situation prevails in Netrokona.\nAlthough they have not yet estimated the damage, DAE officials in Dhaka fear that the total Boro paddy loss might have passed 200,000 hectares.\nIf Agriculture Ministry's calculation of an average of 4 tonnes of Boro produced per hectare is applied, the country may lose around 800,000 tonnes of Boro this season.\n\"This shortage will definitely create problems in current rice price hike,\" Nirod Baon Saha said.\nWhy the price hike?\nFor the first time in several years, farmers got a comparatively good price in the last Aman season, selling one maund (37.24 kgs) of paddy for Tk800 to Tk850.\nDue to the good price of paddy, most farmers sold out their harvest quickly, bringing the rice to the hands of traders and millers.\n\"As the millers now have control of the rice supply, they might be playing a role in pushing the prices up,\" Nirod Baron Saha said. Another reason is that rice import by the private sector ground to a halt in the past year after the government imposed a 25% import duty.\nRice reserve is half\nAccording to the Food Ministry, the government's grain reserve is now is almost half of what it was this time last year. As of April 3, the government's rice reserve was 496,000 tonnes; in April 2016, it was 883,000 tonnes.\nThis shortage is the result of a failure to meet procurement targets for both Boro and Aman paddy last year. The government has procured 585,000 tonnes of Boro rice against a target of 1 million tonnes and 440,000 tonnes of Aman against a target of 600,000 tonnes.\n\"The prices would have eased soon, but the sudden flash floods have made the situation worse,\" said Agriculture economist Dr Quazi Shahhabuddin, who is also the former director general of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies.\n\"The government should not have brought the food reserve to this state. If the reserve was good, it could introduce large volumes of Open Market Sale or other mechanisms to reduce the price.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

Shrimp enclosures owners said they have incurred losses worth Tk1crore as  their enclosures washed away in the flood.\nTraffic through the Cox's Bazar road came to a halt due to the situation. But, the recently opened marine drive is being used as an alternative route from the tourist city to Ukhia and Teknaf upazilas.\nThe local Met office recorded 197 millimetres of rainfall in 24 hours until 3pm on Wednesday, forecasting that the heavy shower may continue.\nChakaria Upzaila Parishad Chairman Md Zafar Alam said Matamuhuri River lost its navigability due to indiscriminate pollution, leading to the situation.\n\"As the river is not dredged for quite some time now, it overflowed after the ongoing heavy shower, causing flood. Hundreds of houses have been inundated with road communication getting damaged heavily, leaving 300,000 people of the upazila marooned,\" he said.\nBlaming Water Development Board officials and contractors for the flood, Chakaria Municipality Mayor Alamgir Chowdhury said: \"Due to their negligence in putting concrete blocks and sandbags at the embankments, the flood occurred.\"\nIn the Sadar upazila, at least 2 lakh people were marooned.\nCox's Bazar Water Development Board Executive Engineer Md Sabibur Rahman said they were yet to ascertain how much damage has been occurred in the embankments since the flood situation was worsening.\nWith the water-level of the Matamuhuri kept rising, most of the residents of Chakaria and Pekua upazilas are in great danger of being heavily affected,\" he feared.\nWhen contacted, Cox's Bazar Development Authority Chairman Lt Col MD Forkan Ahmad said the possibility of landslide is also soaring.\nMeanwhile, Cox's Bazar Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ali Hossain said they are all prepared to face the natural disaster.\n\"We have already ordered all the Union Parishad chairmen to gear up their activities in this regard,\" he said.\nInterestingly, there was no update about measures regarding relief for and rehabilitation of the affected people.\n\n\n\n\n"

But even in these difficult circumstances, there is some happiness for everyone at the safe birth of a child,\" said Anderson.\n\n\n\n\n"

Many of these families could not return to their houses which are under water.\n\"The support provided by the government is inadequate to fulfill the victims' needs. We have distributed  80-90 bundles of tin among the flood victims, but it was not enough to help them all.\"\nMany victims alleged that they have been neglected by the government in terms of relief, humanitarian aid and financial support to reduce their plight and rebuild houses.\nMd Bablu Molla, a local farmer from Kutubpur Union under Sariakandi upazila told the Dhaka Tribune: \"The river has engulfed five bighas of cropland including my home during the flood. We had to take refuge on the embankment. All we received was 10kg of rice as relief in mid-September. We heard the government would provide relief and financial support to flood victims, but we are yet to receive a single sheet of tin to build a house,\"\nAnother victim Abdul Mazid, lost 10-15 bighas of land due to river erosion and is currently living in a temporary residence on the embankment.\nHe said: \"Hundreds of farmers like me have lost everything and currently live in dire conditions. We have no option but to depend on the government's support.\"\nGovernment officials claim that the aid distribution process is still underway. However, the local public administration stated that the relief which will be provided will not match the demands.\nAccording to a Department of Disaster Management (DDM) report, at least 150 people have died in the devastating monsoon floods across the country. 79,692,860 people were severely affected and a total of 737,577 homes were completely or partially destroyed in more than 30 flood-hit districts.\nDuring the flood, a total of 104,949 hectares of croplands have been completely ravaged while another 498,660 hectares were partially damaged in northern and east-northern districts of Bangladesh.\nSources at the DDM said that the Department of Agricultural Extension has been working closely with the DDM in order to minimise the loss by providing seeds, seedlings and fertilisers among the affected cultivators.\nDDM authorities are also continuing relief distribution among the victims.\nThe government has allotted a total of 27,207 metric tonnes of rice for 32 flood-hit districts. 17,721 metric tonnes of rice has already been distributed.\nThe government has also allotted a total of Tk89,155,000 in cash for the victims. Tk56,779,227 has already been handed out.\nWhile asked about the displaced people who are currently living on embankments or under the open sky, DDM Director General Md Reaz Ahmed said they are providing financial support and tin bundles so they can rebuild or repair their homes.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "We are currently observing severe floods in the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Meghna rivers and their tributaries for the second time in this year. The previous floods occurred in these two river basins during the middle of July. Water levels currently crossed the Danger Levels (DLs) in the Jamuna, Teesta, Dharala, Atrai, Jamunaswary, Ichhamati, Gur, Little Jamuna, Tangoan, Korotoa, Ghagot, and in their tributaries in the north central of Bangladesh. Similar floods have also been observed in Assam in India, which is the upstream of the Brahmaputra River Last week, we also observed floods in the major rivers of the Meghna basins such as Surma, Kushiyara, Jadukatha, Bhugai, Kangsha, Someswwati, Sari Gowain, and Manu. The north, north-central, and northeast districts of Bangladesh are currently suffering from major floods. Floods in Bangladesh are nothing new, and people are used to natural monsoon floods. However, what is unexpected is the frequency and intensity of flood in recent times. When water levels cross a certain level known as Danger Level (DL), it is considered a flood. Water levels above the danger level often cause damage to property, infrastructure, crops, livestock, and, in some cases, even causes human fatalities. Alarming patterns and statistics This year we have already observed floods in the two basins, and now we are passing through the second wave of the monsoon floods which normally occur between June and September. Severe floods occurred in 1988 (a return period of one in 100 years in the Brahmaputra river), 1998 (prolonged floods lasting more than two months in some places), 2004 (a return period of one in 100 years in some stations), 2007 (also affected Dhaka city) and in 2016 (affecting more than 25 districts of Bangladesh). However, this year, the rise of floodwater will be unprecedented in our recent history, considering the height of the peak flood. It has already crossed the Record High Water Level (RHWL) in various stations of many tributaries of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna river systems such as Mohadevepur in Atrai, Badarganj in Jamuneswari, Kurigram in Dharala, and Dalia in the Teesta. This week, it will cross the RHWL at Bahadurabad in Jamuna river and then Sirajganj in Jamuna river. It may touch the RHWL of the Kusiyara at Sheola in this week. Last year, at Baghdadabad in Jamuna river, peak flood also crossed the previous RHWL, and it was above 11cm above the previous RHWL in 1988 (20.6m).  Such a backwater effect will prolong the duration of the floods and also increase the water level of the peak floods It is alarming that RHWL will be crossed in many stations of this Brahmaputra-Jamuna river again during this monsoon season. This indicates that the severity of the floods have been increased in recent decades in our major rivers of Bangladesh. Blame climate change It was not completely unexpected that the severity of the floods in the major rivers of South Asia would increase due to climate change. In many studies, it was shown that floods in the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna basins would be more intense. Due to global warming, mean global temperatures have already increased by about 1 degree centigrade from the pre-industrial period. It has been predicted by IPCC that Earth will be much warmer at the end of the century due to the anthropogenic green-house gas emissions. Global warming will alter the hydrological cycles, and floods will become more severe in South Asian regions. Results from a recent collaborative study by BUET under a collaborative research project titled \"High End Climate Impact and Extremes (HELIX)\" funded by the EU under the Seventh Framework Program FP7/2007-2013 also confirmed so. This study was carried out to assess the impacts of the extreme climate change in Bangladesh and its impact of the river discharge. Although the Paris Agreement in 2015 brought hope that global emissions will be reduced to such a level that global temperature rise will not be above 2C from the pre-industrial period, UNFCC countries which signed the agreement must make good on it. Otherwise, the most climate vulnerable countries like Bangladesh will suffer the most from extreme climate events like floods. The rise of the sea level due to climate change will put additional threats to the flooding of our country, as it will have a \"backwater effect\" on floods. Such a backwater effect will prolong the duration of the floods and also increase the water level of the peak floods. Perhaps the floods in 2017 will not be as prolonged as the 1998 floods, as the waters in the Ganges river is well below the danger level, and there is not much chance of synchronised three flood peaks of the three major rivers: Ganges, Brahmapura, and Meghna. Moreover, the spring tide will occur in coastal rivers after the new moon on August 21. This will provide enough time for the floodwater in the Jamuna and Meghan river systems to recede in many places. However, there is no doubt that extreme events like severe floodings have become more frequent, and more intense than before. Bangladesh, concerningly, will become more and more vulnerable in the coming days.

It often requires imports to cope with shortages caused by natural calamities like floods and droughts.\n\n\n\n\n"

It will ensure irrigation to 17 northern districts during the dry season.\n\nThe Water Resources Ministry has already called for 'expression of interest' letters from interested organisations to conduct a feasibility study on the planned infrastructure. The cost of the feasibility study has been estimated to be Tk100cr.\n\"The Brahmaputra barrage is necessary to supply water to the northwest as well as north central region of the country,\" Md Aminul Haque, the project director, told the Dhaka Tribune.\n\"We are trying to have the barrage somewhere between Bangabandhu Bridge and Bahadurabad point of the river,\" he added.\nThe Brahmaputra is a major trans-boundary river and contributes to about two-third of the total dry season water flow in Bangladesh.\nThe project will involve a detailed feasibility study, socio-economic, environment, and other hydraulic and hydro-morphological surveys and studies, said Aminul Haque.\nHydrologist Prof Ainun Nishat, however, observed that the authorities should first ensure the economic, social and environmental viability of the barrage.\nAn expert, on condition of anonymity, also noted that the locations proposed for the barrage and the proposed irrigation areas go against the general rules of gravitational flow.\nMany districts where the irrigation water is to be diverted are at a higher plane than the sea-level in comparison to the proposed barrage points, the expert added.\nThe length of the trans-boundary Brahmaputra, from its source in southwestern Tibet to the mouth at the Bay of bengal is about 2,900 km. The length of the Brahmaputra inside Bangladesh is about 240km with a catchment area of about 39,100 square km, according to project documents.\nA study of the Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS) said the average width of the river had increased from 8.5km in 1973 to 12.2km in 2009 due to the erosion.\nThe location the government is considering for setting up the infrastructure is around 10km in width.\nThe water of Brahmaputra, known as Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river in China, are shared by China, India, and Bangladesh. In the 1990s and 2000s, there had been repeated speculations that China was building a dam on the river to divert the waters to its northern territory.\nFinally in 2010, China confirmed it was indeed building the Zangmu Dam on the Brahmaputra in Tibet.\n\n\n\n\n"

Rice prices are already unusually high and market insiders fear that the worst is yet to come.\nThe government is now scrambling to make a quick response and has agreed the first rice imports for six years, ordering 600,000 tonnes.\nAccording to Food Ministry data, the price of 1kg coarse rice is now Tk38, which is Tk14 higher than the same time last year.\nAccording to the Department of Agricultural Extension, around 300,000 hectares of Boro fields were submerged in the latest flash-floods in the northeastern Haor wetlands, namely the seven districts of Sunamganj, Sylhet, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Brahmanbaria, Kishoreganj and Netrakona.\n[caption id=\"attachment_63611\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Rice traders say they have very little rice in reserve this year, unlike in previous years. The government's rice reserve has come down as well. The photo was taken at a wholesale rice market in Ashuganj on November 17, 2012S yed Zakir Hossain[/caption]\nAgriculture Ministry estimates say the average per hectare Boro production in Bangladesh is about 4 tonnes.\nBy that account, the country has lost about 1.2 million tonnes of Boro rice in the flash-floods, though other unofficial estimates have put the figure almost twice as high.\nThis year Boro farmers have also suffered from blast attacks in the Boro field, which may also affect the yield in many areas.\n\"This year I was forced to harvest two acres of my Boro paddy at least two weeks early as a large portion of my field was attacked by blast. I got at least 30% less production than usual,\" said Abdul Kuddus, a farmer from Lalmonirhat.\nHowever, the DAE thinks that the extent of the parasite attack has been overstated by news reports.\nChaitanya Kumar Das, director of field services of DAE, told the Dhaka Tribune that blast will not create any negative impact on overall production.\n\"There were some blast attacks in specific areas but we managed to bring them under control quickly,\" he said.\n\"We hope that this shortage will be recovered soon enough after the Aush harvest as we have a larger coverage of Aush variety than the previous years.\"\nThis year the acreage of Aush paddy is 1.025 million hectares while the last year's coverage was 962,000 hectares.\nAgricultural economist Qazi Shahabuddin believes that this year the country will experience about two million tonnes of shortage in Boro production.\nAccording to the Food Ministry, the government's rice reserve came down to 262,000 tonnes on May 7. In May last year the reserve was about 678,000 tonnes.\nTraders are also saying they have very little rice in reserve.\nNaogaon Rice Wholesalers Association President Nirod Baran Saha, who has been in the rice business since 1978, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"This year the situation is completely different from the previous years. Like the government, the private sector's reserve is almost finished.\n[caption id=\"attachment_63612\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"900\"] Locals in Farmgate, Dhaka queue up in front of a Trading Corporation of Bangladesh truck to buy their daily commodities on Monday Syed Zakir Hossain[/caption]\n\"Usually at the beginning of the Boro harvest, I always have a good amount of rice in my storage from the previous year. But this year my reserve is almost empty.\"\nIn March and Aprill every year there is usually a small increase in rice prices in Bangladesh, when the Aman harvest from late autumn slowly nears depletion and the Boro paddy is still in the fields.\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture, Boro provides the largest part of the country's cereal production. Out of the circa 35 million tonnes of rice produced in the 2015-16 fiscal year, 19 million tonnes came from Boro.\nBut this year there was a sharp spike in rice prices, at least Tk14 higher than the previous year.\nAccording to the Food Ministry, the average retail price of coarse rice is now Tk38 per kg, while the figure was Tk24 in this period last year.\nMarket insiders think that the rice price hike might continue or at least stay at this level throughout the year because of production shortfall and shortage of stock.\nQazi Shahabuddin, former director general of Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), thinks that importing rice in both public and private sectors is the only option to tackle the situation.\n It is a view shared by Nirod Baran Saha: \"To facilitate import, the government has to withdraw the imposed supplementary duty which is 25%. Otherwise, the private sector would not be interested in doing it,\" he said.\nTo make the reserve sufficient, the government has already decided to import 100,000 tonnes of rice initially, something it has not done in the past six years. This figure will rise to 600,000.\nAccording to some estimations, the government needs at least 483,000 tonnes of rice by June 30 to meet the demand of its various social safety net programmes including Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) and Open Market Sale (OMS), especially in the Haor basins where the food shortage is threatening to become acute.\n\n\n\n\n"

Changing climates will mean more extreme weather that would see from heatwaves to hurricanes and floods to famine.\nThe subjective appraisal of the climate hotspots say delta regions, semi-arid countries, and glacier - and snowpack - dependent river basins are all in the frontline. Tropical coastal regions and some of the world's greatest forests and cities are facing the threat.\nAlthough low-lying Bangladesh contributes little to global warming, it is nevertheless one of the worst climate change victims.\nThe country faces major risks from sea level rise, worsening storms, floods, droughts and other climate change impacts.\nChanging climate has made it difficult for residents of coastal areas to grow crops, forcing many of them to try their lucks somewhere else.\nSaleemul Huq, director of International Centre for Climate Change and Development, told The Guardian that they expected five to 10 million people to move from the coastal areas.\nHe said the coast was the most vulnerable area in Bangladesh, a climate hotspot. Most people leaving their homes prefer to move to Dhaka, the capital city.\nHuq, who has advised the Bangladesh government at successive UN climate summits, told The Guardian that there was strong evidence that climate change was impacting Dhaka.\nHe said temperatures had already gone up by 1 degree Celsius that the weather patterns have changed visibly - the frequency of floods, for example. Major floods that used to hit Bangladesh once every two decades were more frequent now.\nHe said he expected to see more extremes.\nLast year, there were four cyclones - Roanu, Kyant, Nada and Vardah - in the Bay of Bengal where there is usually only one.\nAccording to Huq the rise in sea levels and increased salinity in coastal areas were \"slow onset\" that would \"get worse\". This was an unprecedented \"climate change phenomenon\", he told The Guardian.\nUN scientists have predicted that south-east Asia will see some of the worst impacts of climate change and said sea level rise will threaten over 25 million people in Bangladesh by 2050.\nBangladesh produces about 0.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person, much lower than the United States' 16.4 tonnes, Australia's 16.3 tonnes and Qatar's whopping 40.5 tonnes, World Bank figures show.\nHuq, who leads research into how Bangladesh can adapt to climate change, said they researched the most vulnerable hotspots in details.\nThe government, he said, had started investing in a major climate change action plan.\nBangladesh has made a name for itself as an international leader in climate action, particularly in terms of innovative adaptation to climate change.\nThe country spends almost $1 billion annually on adapting to climate change. Sheikh Hasina's government established a $400 million 'Climate Change Trust Fund' in 2009 from its own resources.\nA huge project to harvest rainwater and coastal protection has been undertaken to counter coastal salinity. Scientists are developing saline-tolerant rice.\nBoth the people and the government are participating in the effort, he said, noting that Bangladesh was \"always catching up with the problem\".\nHe suggested developing other towns and cities to make sure people, whose livelihood would be affected by climate change, did not move to the capital city only.\n\nOther hot spots in the list are Spain's Murcia, Malawi's Mphampha, Norway's Longyearbyen, Brazil's Manaus, New York, and Philippines' Manila.\n\n\n\n\n"

If we look across the region, located south of the Megahlaya hills near the Bangladesh-India border, the damage is massive,\" said Zahidul Haque, DAE deputy director.\nAndrew Sholomar from Rajai village in the upazila is one of the biggest victims of this sand intrusion.\n\"I have already lost around 15 acres of my 20 acres of land,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune.\nIf this cannot be stopped, his family might end up starving as it is dependent on that land, he said.\nThe flow of sand and stone chips coming down with monsoon water has been decreasing the depths of the Haor basins, increasing the risk of flash-floods.\nHydrologist Prof Ainun Nishat said although the flash-floods are a common phenomenon in the northeastern wetlands, there has been an increase in its frequency and magnitude.\n\"Water usually carries sediment downstream. This is also true of the northeastern region,\" he said.\nBut the volume of sand intrusion with the water is alarming and need to be stopped at any cost, he added.\nCalling attention to several Beels - small water bodies - in Kharchar Haor in Sunamganj, the expert said many of them have already been filled up with sand.\n\"The frequency and coverage of flash-floods have been increasing in the region as the beds of water bodies are gradually rising up,\" said 45-year-old Kamruzzaman Kamrul, chairman of Tahirpur Upazilla Parishad, who has lived in the area since his birth.\nWhat's going on upstream\nMineral resources including coal, limestone and stones are the biggest part of Meghalaya's economy.\nThe mining mostly takes place in three regions of the state - East Khasi Hills, West Khasi Hills and Garo Hills - all of which border Bangladesh.\nSources in Meghalaya say the state government has relatively little control over the mining industry in these autonomous regions. According to the sources, there are around 1,000 operational mines in those three areas, all privately run.\nAltrisha Lyndoh, owner of a coal mine in West Khasi hills, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"We have been doing this mining business in our own land. We dig the land, extract coal and sell it.\"\nAsked whether she knows about the impacts of coal mining downstream, she said: \"I have no idea.\"\nHJ Syiemlieh, a professor of geography at the North Eastern Hill University in Shillong, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"To extract coal, primarily the miners cut down forests and open pits, which ultimately makes the topsoil unstable and lets it wash downhill with monsoon water.\"\nIn 2015, the Indian National Green Tribunal, a government body, issued a ruling to stop unplanned coal mining in Meghalaya, saying it was destroying the topsoil and the local ecology.\nBut the professor said as there is no strong government control over the issue, many mines have continued to run their operations in an unplanned manner.\nA fateful day\nSand intrusion from Meghalaya has gone up sharply since 2008 when a sudden landslide in the West Khasi Hills of Meghalaya near the Bangladesh-India border sent a massive volume of sand down to Bangladesh.\nThe incident destroyed around 50 acres of land within minutes.\n\"Within a few minutes, the nearby ponds and wetlands filled up with sand and stone chips that day,\" said 46-year-old local Rokon Uddin, who witnessed the landslide.\nMore than 2,000 acres of agricultural land in three villages - Chanpur, Rojoni Line and Rajai - owned by local farmers and villagers, disappeared in that single event which changed the area's ecosystem and robbed thousands of their livelihoods.\nSince then, unplanned mining in Meghalaya - one of India's main source of mineral resources - have been pouring large amounts of sand into the water that eventually flows into Bangladesh and ruins large areas of arable land every monsoon. Mass deforestation, caused by unplanned mining, has also caused the soil in the hills to become more vulnerable to landslides.\nPonchashol Haor, which locals said used to cover a large area near Chanpur village, has now vanished because of sand intrusion from the West Khasi Hills.\nComplaints made earlier\nIn 2009, the Ministry of Environment and Forest in Bangladesh sent a formal letter to the Indian High Commission in Dhaka to inform them of the issue.\nHowever, the issue appears to have been forgotten on both sides.\nOn a recent visit to Meghalaya, this correspondent met Y Tsering, an additional chief secretary of Meghalaya government and also in charge of mining department, who admitted that he was aware of the issue.\n\"All good and bad things go to Bangladesh. Water runs from upstream to downstream,\" he said, smiling.\n\"Just like our river water goes down, the sediment goes down and makes the downstream land fertile. Now the sand goes down with water and makes the land barren,\" he said.\nProfessor Ainun Nishat expressed the need for a joint watershed management for the entire region so that the problems can be managed.\nProf HJ Syiemleih similarly said that the two sides need to work together to find the way to stop this sand intrusion.\n\"India needs the mining and Bangladesh needs to be safe from sand intrusion,\" he said.\nProf Nishat also said that Bangladesh government needed to introduce some initiatives, including dredging the water-bodies and heightening the crop protection embankments to reduce the loss of crops in the Haor basins.\n\n\n\n\n"

The floods also killed 1,180 tonnes of fish and affected more than half of the district's livestock, aside from triggering a fodder crisis.\nMaya then asked participants of the meeting, held at the district's Zilla Parishad office, about how they planned to tackle the crisis. But the officials failed to come up with any plans, angering the minister.\nMaya first asked the district agricultural officer about damage to crops but the latter failed to give him a clear idea.\n\nAlso Read: Paddy production hit by flood in the Haors\n\nLater the heads of the district's fisheries and livestock, executive engineers of public health, Water Development Board, roads and highways; the civil surgeon, LGRD executive officer, district education officer, primary education officer and cooperatives officer, too, failed to answer the minister.\nDC Mushfiqur requested then the minister to provide 75,000 Vulnerable Group Feeding or VGF cards and one open market sale (OMS) dealer for each union.\nThe government has already announced emergency monthly supplies to the affected people in various districts.\nMaya on Sunday said 335,000 families of the flood-ravaged Haor region would receive relief. Each family will get 30kg rice and Tk500 as emergency support under a 100-day scheme.\n\nAlso Read: 30kg rice, Tk500 monthly relief for affected haor families\n\nApart from rice and cash, some 171,715 families will get relief materials through the VGF programme and OMS.\nBut the destruction of more than 200,000 hectares of mature Boro paddy in the flash floods in the northeastern wetlands may further push up the rice prices, traders say.\nMore than half of the rice produced in Bangladesh is Boro. Government data shows that 19 million tonnes out of the total 35 million tonnes of rice produced in the 2015-16 fiscal was Boro.\n\n\n\n\n"

But the country grows only half of the maize it needs, importing the rest from the United States and Brazil, he said, which means rising demand could mean rising prices.\n\"Maize prices will go up if it is used for ethanol production. The price of eggs and chicken will go beyond the reach of common people,\" Rahman warned.\nHe said growing concerns about food security have led other countries - including China - to stop giving permission for new biofuel projects.\nFOOD TO FUEL\nAccording to a study by Bangladesh's energy ministry, the country could produce 18 million liters of ethanol a year, or about 75,000 liters each working day. That would require 60,000 tonnes of broken rice each year - about 3.5 percent of the country's total production.\nAlternately the county could produce the ethanol with 62,000 tonnes of maize (2.8 percent of production) or 97,000 tonnes of molasses (nearly all of the country's production).\nThe study warned that if the government scales up ethanol production beyond those levels, it will raise demand for grain to the point that it could hurt food security.\nBut junior energy minister Nasrul Hamid told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone that Bangladesh needs to go for greener and more varied fuels in the future, like other nations.\n\"So, we are exploring the possibility of using bio-ethanol with other fuels. You can't remain out from the global trend of energy use,\" he said.\nHe confirmed the ministry plans to give permission for ethanol production, and then would judge from early experience whether to scale up the experiment.\n\"Yes, we are going to give permission for bio-fuel soon. Let's see what happens first. Its impact on food security will be considered than,\" Hamid said.\nBut others warn that Bangladesh has decided to burn food grains to produce ethanol without taking into consideration the food security of its 160 million people.\n[caption id=\"attachment_60935\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Bangaldesh grows only half of the maize it needs, importing the rest, which means rising demand could mean rising prices Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nThat is a particular worry in a low-lying country that faces severe climate change threats, including loss of crops and crop land to worsening salt-water intrusion, droughts, floods, storms, sea level rise and erosion.\nAlready many people face daily hunger and can manage meals only once or twice a day, experts say. Last year, Bangladesh ranked in the top 25 percent of the world's most hungry countries, according to the Global Hunger Index of the International Food Policy Research Institute.\nBangladesh today produces about 1.8 million tonnes of broken rice, about 100,000 tonnes of molasses and less than half the 6 million tonnes of maize it needs each year, according to the country's Energy Ministry.\nBesides being used as livestock food, maize is eaten by poorer people, mixed with flour as a cereal or made into biscuits. Lower-income people also eat broken rice for breakfast and make it into cakes.\nBut prices for the grains are rising. A kilogram of coarse rice is now being sold at 42 taka (50 cents) in Dhaka, up 25 percent in price from a year ago, according to the government Trading Corporation of Bangladesh.\nRising food prices are a major concern, with a growing portion of people's earnings now being spent on food. The country's food inflation rate in February was 6.8 percent, up from a record low of 3.8 percent a year ago.\nAbout 13 percent of Bangladesh's people fall below the national poverty line of $2 per day, according to World Bank data.\nThe country produces about enough rice to meet demand but imported 4.5 million tonnes of wheat last year to meet demand for that grain, according to the country's food ministry.\nWRONG-HEADED DECISION?\nDespite rising demand for food, Khan Md Aftabuddin, managing director of Sunipun Organics Ltd. - the company that first applied for government permission for ethanol production - said turning grain into fuel would not pose any threat to food security for Bangladesh.\nHe said the byproducts of ethanol production could be used as poultry or fish food, and that more maize could be grown on delta islands if demand for it rises.\n\"If needed, we will produce maize in char lands of the country as raw material for our plant,\" Aftabuddin said. Bangladesh needs to turn to renewable energy to keep its environment clean, he said. But Mohammad Moinuddin Abdullah, secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, said creating fuel using maize - which is increasingly being imported to make up for rice and wheat shortfalls - doesn't seem to make sense.\n\"I do not see any valid reason for using maize and broken rice for ethanol production,\" he said.\nM. Asaduzzaman, a fellow of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies and a member of the country's climate change negotiations team, said he also disagreed with the move toward producing ethanol from grain.\n[caption id=\"attachment_60936\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"870\"] More demand for maize and for land to grow it will hamper staple food production since Bangladesh suffers from acute farmland scarcity Reuters[/caption]\n\"We have tremendous difficulties in livestock nutrition. If maize is now used to produce ethanol, the cost of livestock production will go further up causing further animal protein deficiency,\" said Asaduzzaman, also a former vice chairman of the International Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change.\n\"This is a wrong-headed decision,\" he said.\nBangladesh's per capita carbon emissions are tiny compared to those of more developed countries, and should not be as great a concern as protecting food security, he said.\n\"When we can't meet basic nutritional need, we don't need to go for clean energy,\" he said.\nKhondaker Golam Moazzem, a research director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue, a Dhaka-based think tank, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that he is concerned that ethanol production, once started, could be scaled up in the future, particularly if oil prices eventually rise.\nThat could lead to more demand for maize and for land to grow it. \"Then, staple food production will be hampered since Bangladesh suffers from acute farmland scarcity,\" he warned.\n \n\n\n\n"

      "text": "\n'India cannot ignore our rights to Teesta water'\n\n\n\n\n\nAbu Siddique\n\n\n\n\n Published at 11:07 pm March 31st, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 09:25 pm April 2nd, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nAs we have learnt, the Teesta Water Sharing Treaty might not be signed during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming visit to India. How will it affect Bangladesh?\nWe need this treaty because we need to know how much water we are going to get from the Teesta during the dry months so we can plan our agricultural projects accordingly.\nIndia has completely dried out the river on our end during lean period by closing all the gates of the Gazaldoba barrage. That is unexpected from a friendly neighbour.\nThis treaty is a formality, but India cannot ignore our rights to the river water.\nIdeally, this treaty should have two mechanisms: ensuring water flow in the dry period and managing water for the rest of the year in the entire river basin. In addition, it should ensure prevention of flood and river erosion during monsoon.\nTeesta's dry period starts in October, and monsoon starts in April-May. I think the crucial period in the Teesta is September-October, when supplementary irrigation is needed in some areas of the river basin for agriculture.\nDuring dry season, the Teesta gets around 6,000 cusecs of water [1 cusec = 28.32 litres per second]. But Bangladesh needs 8,000 cusecs and India needs 16,000 cusecs. Without releasing more water in the river, it is impossible to meet these demands.\nMy second concern is flood. The Teesta overflows during monsoon. Its water flow typically exceeds 300,000 cusecs, but we have a record of Teesta's water flow exceeding 450,000 cusecs one year. In addition, we face massive river erosion in the Teesta during monsoon.\nTo tackle these issues, we need effective flood management, which can easily be achieved by building a reservoir in the upstream.\nWe heard the treaty had been deferred because West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee did not agree on it with the central government.\nWe heard in the news that Mamata Banerjee claimed the Indian union government did not discuss the details of Teesta treaty with her. But I think the issue is not related to West Bengal. The issue is between two central governments. That means Delhi has to talk to Dhaka and decide on equitable water sharing.\nBut it is said without the West Bengal government's consent, the central government of India cannot go into an agreement with Bangladesh.\nThat is absolutely wrong. When Bangladesh and India discuss sharing water of a trans-boundary river, the state government has nothing to say because the issue is within two central governments.\nThe Ganges Water Sharing Treaty will expire in 2026. What should be the next step regarding this treaty?\nThe Ganges treaty is supposed to be reviewed every five years, but it has never happened. The treaty is renewable without any condition. I believe Bangladesh will be able to renew it, but the discussion should begin in the next two years. Also, this time the treaty should not be time-bound.\n[caption id=\"attachment_54387\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Teesta barrage, an establishment which many in Bangladesh accuse for desertification of northern districts of the country. The picture was captured in early May, 2016 Abu Siddique/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nWe know the Ganges treaty is based on the availability of water at Farakka point. We also learnt that the amount of water in Farakka during the lean period is decreasing. If we renew the treaty, should we decide on the same amount of water as before?\nAt the moment, Bangladesh has no way of knowing what is happening in the upstream Ganges. But Bangladesh and India signed a cooperation agreement in 2011, which means the terms of river management between the two countries can be negotiated.\nIt is time for us to discuss some of the terms. According to the Ganges treaty, the upper riparian country should ensure that the volume of water increases gradually. The water flow in the Ganges was good, but after 1975, India has been withdrawing water from the river at different points. But the treaty asks both the countries to ensure water flow in the river for proper basin-wise river management.\nIf Bangladesh can continue the discussion with all stakeholders, the problems regarding water sharing in all trans-boundary rivers could be resolved.\nYou often say that basin-wise river management might bring the best results in the region. Can you elaborate on that?\nBasin-wise river management is a classic idea. It has been implemented for all international rivers, like the Rhine, the Colorado and the Mekong.\nThe demand and availability of water varies in the upstream and downstream of a river. Usually, the water flow in the upstream surpasses the demand, while it is the opposite in the downstream.\nThe optimum solution to balance the supply and demand could be creating proper modelling of the rivers based on water quantity and quality. This way, we can resolve issues like flood, navigation, irrigation, hydro-power and fisheries for the entire basin of a particular river.\nAll this is covered by basin-wise river management.\nDo you think all the countries in this region will come to a common consensus on this issue?\nThere is no need to bring all the countries to a single platform. A commission should be formed to deal with the issues regarding one particular trans-boundary river. For example, for the Brahmaputra, Bhutan, China, India and Bangladesh should form a joint commission and deal with Brahmaputra basin management.\n[caption id=\"attachment_55764\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Teesta barrage, an establishment which many in Bangladesh accuse for desertification of northern districts of the country. The picture was captured in early May, 2016 Abu Siddique/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nBangladesh is planning to set up Ganges barrage in Goalanda, Rajbari. Why? Do you think it will cause floods in the upstream of the river, like in India's Bihar?\nBangladesh has been receiving a certain volume of water through Farakka barrage during lean period. If we divert one-third of that water to the southwestern districts of the country, it will help to reduce the salinity in that region's water. That can be done only with the barrage in Goalanda. There is no alternative, to my knowledge.\nUsing my experience on this issue, I can say that there is no relation between Farakka barrage and the flood in Bihar. Bihar Chief Minister Nitesh Kumar demands for opening the barrage gates. Of its total 108 gates, four or five always remain closed due to technical problems.\nIf they open those five closed gates, there won't be much difference in the water flow. Kumar's actual demand is to keep the gates open from May to September. He also wants the removal of sediment in the upstream of Farrkka barrage, which is a technical matter.\nWhy does Nitesh Kumar want to open all the gates of Farakka barrage?\nHe is somehow under the impression that the barrage gates remain closed during monsoon, and that is what causes flood in Bihar, but it is not true.\nThe problem is, political leaders can be led to the wrong conclusion too.\nDoes the construction of Ganges barrage depend on India's permission?\nIf you are building something with money borrowed from someone, they will demand a say in the project. But that will not happen if you make it with your own money. India built Farakka barrage with its own money, so they had all control over it. However, I believe the Ganges barrage should be built jointly with India.\n\n\n\n\n"

Under ideal weather conditions, it takes about 90 minutes to reach Hatiya Island from Noakhali on the mainland, from where a speedboat takes 30 minutes more to get to the Char.\nAyesha Ferdaus, the lawmaker from Noakhali 6 (Hatiya) constituency, said local people should have no fear as the new centre will be focused on helping the Rohingya to recover from their traumatic experiences.\n\"Through arranging employment after providing them with counselling, the Rohingya will be helped to return to a normal life. There is nothing to worry about,\" he said.\nDelegations of high-ups from the government and experts from government and non-government organisations have been visiting the area every day to check on progress in the challenging project.\nMany of Bhashan Char's low-lying areas have already been filled with sand and the height of the ground raised in several spots to protect the new centre from river erosion or floods. The sand bar was previously uninhabited.\nHelipads, pontoons and roads are among the new infrastructure under construction to improve accessibility and facilitate internal communication on the island.\nChittagong's Divisional Commissioner Abdul Mannan said: \"We are doing experiments to get a clear idea about how liveable Bhashan Char is or if it would be vulnerable to climate change. Nonetheless, these are all still in the primary stage.\"\nThe recent influx of the Rohingya fleeing brutal persecution by the Myanmar army in Rakhine state prompted the Bangladesh government to assign its navy to the rehabilitation camp project.\nCaptain Aminul Islam Khan of the navy, also the in-charge of Bhashan Char Rohingya Rehabilitation Project, said the Char would be a modern refugee camp.\n\"All kind of facilities including educational institutions, hospitals, recreational centres and playgrounds will be here,\" he said.\nThe in-charge said the Rohingya refugees will be brought to the camp in phases, with as many as 120,000 rehabilitated initially. However, the navy did not clarify how long it could take to bring in the Rohingya.\nFinance Division officials have said the estimated Tk1,000 crore project will be funded entirely by the government and will include the major challenge of damming the char to protect it from regular flooding by seawater.\nThe government in February had announced its plans to rehabilitate the refugees who began arriving from Myanmar in October 2016, drawing some criticism internationally.\nA UN estimate says the latest exodus starting on August 25 had seen around 480,000 Rohingya people enter into Bangladesh until Tuesday.\n \nThe article was first published on Bangla Tribune\n\n\n\n\n"

How important is this visit?\nFor us, and especially for the Catholic community, it is a great inspiration to see the Pope in person. The Christian community is very happy that the Holy Father is visiting Bangladesh.\nThe community will gather in droves to listen to him, to see him in person, to experience him closely and if possible, to touch him.\nThe Christian community is very enthusiastic about the Pope's visit. They are spiritually preparing for the experience.\nHow significant is the visit of the Holy Father's?\nThe Pope is coming to Bangladesh as the head of the church, and as a religious leader. He is also coming to Bangladesh as the head of state of the Vatican, a tiny country of 109 acres of land, which has impact all over the world.\nThe Pope will hold meetings with the president and the prime minister of Bangladesh. He will also meet different religious leaders.\nI see it as a state visit and also a visit to the people. He is scheduled to visit the National Martyrs' Memorial in Savar, and will also visit the Bangabandhu Museum to pay his respect.\nThe other thing that I would like to mention is that Pope Francis loves Bangladesh, which he has expressed with his statements.\nFor example, during the collapse of Rana Plaza in 2013, he termed the working conditions of garment workers as \"modern slavery.\" He also sympathises with the victims of the recent floods in South Asia, including Bangladesh.\nPope also supports the victims of the ongoing Rohingya crisis and let us not forget that I, a Bangladeshi national, was appointed Cardinal for the first time in the history of the country.\nIt proves that the Pope wants the world to know about Bangladesh and its people.\nI hope that he will address climate change issues. The Pope recently wrote a book on world environment titled \"On Care for Our Common Home.\" I am sure Pope Francis will appreciate all the steps that have been taken by Bangladesh to fight climate change.\nIn Bangladesh, there is a unique harmony among different cultures and religions, which the Pope will get to experience. The theme for his visit is \"Harmony and Peace.\" The harmony that exists in Bangladesh will be celebrated in the presence of the Holy Father.\nPope Francis is well aware of the Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh. He is happy to know that Bangladesh has not only opened the borders but also opened their heart to receive them [the Rohingya].\nHow do you see the ongoing situation in Myanmar?\nHumanity is under attack in many places, by many people and in many ways. Humanity is under attack across the globe.\nFor us, the oppression of Rohingya is a humanitarian crisis, where we see humanity being attacked before our eyes. They have the right to have land, home and to live peacefully.\nHow do you see Bangladesh's handling of the crisis?\nThe example that Bangladesh has set by letting them [the Rohingya] enter, should be a lesson for the people in Myanmar. It should appeal to their moral compass.\nI believe that our attitude towards the refugees has been best expressed by the prime minister. The Rohingya people are her brothers and sisters, and she is with them.\nCould you please elaborate on your perspective about the religious harmony in Bangladesh?\nFirst of all, the people of Bangladesh are religious. In Bangladesh, secularism does not automatically mean absence of religious view, contrary to some other countries. In Bangladesh, secularism allows every religion to coexist. This is the kind of attitude and mentality that we have.\nHowever, once in a while, we witness conflicts over religious issues, but in reality those are mostly political problems. There are some militant groups that are trying to disrupt the communal harmony and peace in the country.\nI will try to explain this in my own way. Winds can create waves in a river, but underneath the water there is calm, peace, and harmony. These are the treasured values that we have.\nWhen the two terror attacks occurred in Sholakia and in Gulshan, I said that they [militants] do not belong to our culture. Their so-called ideology is something imported from outside.\nFollowers of all religions have the responsibility to safeguard our culture and our values. No one should destroy our core identity. Let us be religious.\nHow can religious views and values play a role in pacifying this Rohingya crisis?\nAs long as our focus is on the people, as long as our focus is on the victims, we will be able to find a solution to the ongoing crisis.\nPeople can face oppression for a multitude of reasons, be it historical, political or religious. For example, I learned that the Rohingya people are being thrown out of their homes and some of the big countries are backing this atrocity, because Myanmar has promised them industrial zones in the region.\nCan this be a valid reason for displacing people from their homes?\nPeople have the right to live on their land and we should focus on that. We must not view the crisis as a religious, ethnic, political or a geopolitical issue.\n\nAll the religions call for peace, harmony and humanity, but why is the image of these religions being tarnished by criminal acts and terrorist activities of some groups of people?\nReligion has not been understood in the proper sense. The core ideology of religion is about eliminating divisions among people. If the foundation of a religion is God, people will see that He [God] does not discriminate.\nHe [God] does not say that I will not shower rain on Hindus or I will not protect the Christians.\nReligion does not divide, nor does it support discrimination. Devout people are usually the silent majority in a religion.\nHowever, there are people who use their religion to justify bigotry and discrimination. Why?\nOne thing is very clear to us. God has given us intelligence. We have been created in the image of God. We have intelligence to know or understand what is good and what is not. We have freedom to take decision in favour of good or in favour of evil.\nWe must decide how to act according to the instructions of God.\nWhat is your call to the people in tackling this humanitarian crisis?\nI would appeal to keep politics aside when it comes to this crisis and to not view it from a religious perspective. It is humanity that is under attack.\nAs a Christian, I feel for them. With all my heart, I am ready to do everything on my part to be at their [Rohingya refugees'] side. Through Caritas, I am trying to help the Rohingya refugees.\nOne of my favourite quotes from Saint Irenaeus is: \"The glory of God is man fully alive.\"\nA man is really a human being fully alive through his freedom, his intelligence, and his humanity.\nDo you believe that Myanmar will respond to Pope's call for peace and humanity?\nHe has already called for peace in Myanmar on the Rohingya issue. The Holy Father will surely address the issue, but, he will do so with respect to the internal affairs of the country.\nThe Pope will not compromise with his values. He will talk about peace and about the rights of the people.\nEvery country has its internal problems to deal with but the core values of humanity should not be compromised.\nThe right of the people to live must not be compromised.\nThe Holy Father does not claim to be a religious leader for everyone but he does address important issues, be it economics, politics, business, climate change and other things happening in the world because he is a spiritual leader for the people, not a religious leader.\nHe is here for every one of us and not just for the Christians. That is why he is considered as the voice of the conscience of the world and people respect him. He goes beyond the boundaries of nations, cultures, groups and, or religions.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Rapid industrialisation all over the world has given people cushy lives. It is undeniable that energy is the cornerstone of development in the modern era. With the passage of every single day, the demand for energy is climbing to its peak, and countries are now busy competing with each other to meet the growing demands of energy. But unhealthy competition in the energy sector has brought environmental issues like climate change upon us. Now we frequently have to withstand the devastating impacts of climate change-induced disasters like storms, cyclones, floods, etc. Evidently, Bangladesh is the most vulnerable country in this respect in the South Asian region, which means we have to immediately rethink the energy landscape to combat the climate change-caused natural disasters. Examining the world energy profile, it appears that demand of the global energy will further grow up to 40% by 2040. At present, gas is a dominant fuel in generating energy. In the upcoming days, coal will replace gas and hold the first position in the energy sector -- producing more emissions across the globe. Bangladesh is no exception. It is predicted that reserve gas will be exhausted by 2020 and so it's looking for an alternative source of energy. It is eying to increase coal use from 2% to over 50% in electricity supply by 2030. Dozens of coal-run electricity-generating plants are in the pipeline including a controversial one like Rampal. It is expected that Rampal alone will provide alone one-fifth of the country's total production of electricity comprising 1,320 mega watts. Coal has become appealing for countries like Bangladesh and India for different reasons. Being cheap, coal is cost-effective, and so it opens doors to opportunities to produce new energy plants. Alarmingly, China and India are following the easy and economic way by introducing coal-run energy plants. Bangladesh should explore alternatives to coal for securing a better future for the next generations of Bangladeshis From 2002 to 2012, the global coal trade has doubled -- where China and India account for the majority of coal imports. Then the question may rise: Are we not counting the risks of coal energy in this region? Risks and fatalities  Bangladesh is a densely populated country, and pollution from coal energy will be catastrophic. Air pollution will be the direct result of coal-run electricity plants -- worsening the situation, further damaging the environment. Coal pollutes the air, water, and soil all together leading to negative impacts on human and other species as well.  Environmental specialists and activists are already protesting against the Rampal project, which can be detrimental to the Sundarbans. There have been many controversies over the Rampal project. Both countries should take rational decisions considering its environmental impacts in the Sundarbans region. Bangladesh should explore alternatives to coal for securing a better future for the next generations of Bangladeshis. Currently, gas ranks number one in the energy sector of Bangladesh, accounting for about 80% of total energy. It is expected that Bay of Bengal can be a good source of gas fields. Bangladesh needs to invest in exploration to take advantage of Bay of Bengal resources. Renewed hope  Moreover, the much talked-about renewable energy sources should be considered, as they are environment-friendly. Being blessed with lots of rivers, Bangladesh has good potential in producing hydro-electricity, utilising the current of the rivers. Solar is considered to be the most viable source of renewable energy. Bangladeshis striving to generate more energy from solar system by 2020 according to its seventh five year plan. Other sources like wind and biomass sources also should be explored for renewable energy. Due to several constraints and challenges, renewable energy is still not popular in Bangladesh. First of all, in many cases, renewable energy becomes costly for the producers. We have had bad experiences like the Kaptai project -- which did not bring the desired results, and ultimately emerged as a development disaster. Moreover, there is a lack of incentives from the government and non-government agencies in this sector. Right now, at a macro level, governments should provide incentives by granting loans to renewable energy-oriented enterprises. Innovation and entrepreneurship should be encouraged by the governmental and non-governmental sector in the renewable energy sector. On the other hand, at a micro level, consumers should be more conscious and wise while using electricity. Solar panels can be used as an alternative source of power in households that can afford it. It's time to turn to clean energy. Naim Ebna Rahman is a graduate student of development studies."

The situation is even worse on the routes that have ferry services - which are frequently getting disrupted due to strong currents in the rivers.\n Due to these problems, a trip is taking three or four times longer than what it would normally take, bus owners said.\nRoad Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said there was no need for the holidaymakers to worry about travelling on the roads.\n\"We have taken all necessary steps to ensure smooth travelling by repairing all the damaged roads,\" he said on Friday during a visit to Chandra intersection in Gazipur. \"All the engineers of the Roads and Highways Department are working on this problem. They have been warned not to neglect their duties using the excuse of rain; they are to take necessary precautions so the roads are protected from rain.\"\nHowever, sources in the bus services said there had hardly been any progress in the repair work and the trips were still taking painstakingly longer than normal.\nAdded to the outward rush of homeward-bound people is the trucks carrying sacrificial cattle into the capital city. There are also the makeshift roadside cattle markets that are taking up space on the roads and highways and disrupting the traffic, creating bottlenecks at important junctions and making an already bad situation worse.\n\"Amid this circumstance, if the rain continues, it will get even more difficult for people to go home,\" said a transport worker.\nHighways in dilapidated conditions\nThe recent floods have severely affected the country's road network, especially in the northern and northeastern districts.\nFour of six major highways that connect all 64 districts in the country with Dhaka - Dhaka-Khulna, Dhaka Sylhet, Dhaka Barisal and Dhaka-North Bengal - are covered with potholes and/or submerged in floodwater.\nAccording to the Roads and Highways Department, flood has cut off 17 roads from the country's road network. Dinajpur and Kurigram districts are completely disconnected, and road transport in Netrokona has collapsed as five of the district's major roads are under water.\nThe situation is similar in Jamalpur, Faridpur and Shariatpur districts.\nAround 600km of roads in the northern districts of Rangpur, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Bogra, Gaibandha, Joypurhat, Dinajpur, Thakurgaon, Panchagarh and Nilphamari have been damaged by the floods. These roads include 73 national and regional highways as well as district roads. At least 19 bridges and culverts have been damaged as well.\nRoad Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader recently visited Sirajganj recently where he instructed to make the roads usable in 10 days, our Sirajganj correspondent reported.\nFollowing the instruction, the road and transport authorities started implementing the \"herringbone system\" - laying up bricks on the damaged roads - as a temporary solution, but it is failing due to rain.\nInsiders in the Roads and Highways Department said Eid rush puts excess pressure on the roads even when the roads are in good condition. If a small part of a highway is unusable, it creates huge traffic congestion.\nFerry services in deep trouble\nThe Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) operates 19 small and large ferries between Paturia ghat in Manikganj and Daulatdia ghat in Rajbari to carry thousands of vehicles across the Padma River.\nBIWTC sources said most of these ferries were old, and they were facing immense difficulties in operating their services due to the strong current in the Padma. Each ferry is barely making 20 trips across the river every day, whereas normally the ferries can make 30 trips.\nBesides, three of the ferries are out of commission, putting extra pressure on the ferries that are in operation.\nUsually, it takes around 45 minutes for a ferry to cross the Padma, but due to the current state of water flow in the Padma, it is taking at least one and a half hours, the sources said.\nAs a result, the queues of vehicles waiting for the ferries are getting longer, making the duration of the journey two or three times longer.\nWorkers at the ferry ghats said because of this situation, there will be long tailbacks on both sides of the river with an average waiting time of three hours. Most buses will miss their schedule, they added.\nFerry service on Shimulia (Mawa)-Kathalbari route is facing the same problem; ferries are taking almost double the time to cross the Padma due to the currents.\nBus owners, passengers worried\nTraffic congestion has already gotten bad on Dhaka-Chittagong, Dhaka-Khulna, Dhaka-Mymensingh and Dhaka-Sylhet highways.\n\"Buses are already getting delayed, takes almost double the time due to the damaged highways in the northern districts such as Rajshahi and Khulna. Sylhet-bound roads are also in a sorry state,\" Bangladesh Bus-Truck Owners' Association President Faruk Talukder Sohel told the Dhaka Tribune.\nNarrow bridges, long wait at the ferry ghats have slowed down the traffic on the highways to Khulna, Jessore and Barisal, he said.\n\"At this rate, I am worried that the trips may take double or even triple the usual time as Eid approaches.\"\nHe further said if the government had taken timely actions to ensure uninterrupted ferry services ferry and properly planned passage through the bridges, the situation would not have gotten so bad.\n\"The Dhaka-Chittagong highway has been upgraded to four lanes, but the three major bridges on that highway are still two-lane,\" said Green Line Paribahan General Manager Abdus Sattar.\n\"As a result, it takes hours to pass through Meghna and Gumti bridges and creates huge traffic tailbacks. Because of that, a six-hour trip is now taking nearly double the time,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Bangladesh has been able to reach impressive heights on the economic growth scale over the past few decades. As per a World Bank report, our Gross National Income (GNI) shot up from $100 to $1,220 between 1972 to 2015. Notwithstanding this fact, Bangladesh is still under-performing relative to its goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2021 -- an aspiration that demands an approximate annual growth of 8% per year. A lot of our successes are being eaten up by natural calamities, vulnerabilities, and episodic pressure or onslaught on the economy. This is where the insurance sector comes in. The presence of a well-rounded and diligently crafted national insurance framework reflects sound risk management; which helps in mitigating uncertainty and reducing costs of financing, thus boosting both household and organisational confidence. This eases the process of investing on higher risk-return activities and ultimately powers long-run economic growth. The sad statistics In comparison to the escalating trend of per capita income ($1602 as of 2017), the insurance penetration rate in Bangladesh is alarmingly low -- a shocking 0.7% in global comparison during 2016, out of which only 0.2% consists of life insurance. To put it in further perspective, the highest insurance penetration in the world is at 18%, belonging to Taiwan. According to the World Bank, only 4 out of 1,000 people in Bangladesh have life insurance, coupled with prevailing property risks arising from frail general insurance penetration. The institutional infrastructure of Bangladesh's insurance sector, namely the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority (IDRA), is struggling, especially in terms of an impoverished regulatory capacity, as well as the lack of qualified personnel -- which itself might be critically stemming from the weak operational capacity of the Bangladesh Insurance Academy (BIA). All in all, the 0.7% is without a doubt, an awfully dire piece of data for a country of 163 million. The geographical position of Bangladesh exposes the nation to a wide range of natural disasters, like floods, earthquakes, and cyclones. Such forms of force majeure risks could pose hefty monetary tolls on an economy, with recovery and reconstruction costs reaching billions of dollars. Only 4 out of 1,000 people in Bangladesh have life insurance, coupled with prevailing property risks arising from frail general insurance penetration Cyclone Sidr of 2007 for instance, cost an estimated $1.67 billion. In cases like this, a sturdy insurance market can dramatically cushion the adverse impacts on government spending. Due to the compressed radar of insurance services in Bangladesh, majority of the population, especially the ones living in rural regions, suffer the most during ta catastrophe. By bolstering our insurance regulation, and modernising our systems to facilitate deep and organised network penetration of micro-insurance throughout Bangladesh, a strong level of economic resiliency could be gained at the face of unanticipated forces, especially in rural Bangladesh. In recent times, we have seen how the Thail government avoided large erosion in their national balance-sheet and budgetary priorities during the recent floods and asset losses, with most of its assets being insured and appropriately re-insured.  Boosting our economy The insurance regulatory reform is not just an aid for a catastrophic aftermath; it can also be a driver of exponential economic growth. By streamlining the regulatory infrastructure in terms of data warehousing, governance, systems, resources, and processes in adjustment with international insurance standards such as the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS); Bangladesh can exhibit a reliable and well-balanced insurance platform. This, in turn, can boost investor confidence, leading to an increase in both local capital investments as well as FDIs. Furthermore, high influx of capital commonly translates to a rise in infrastructure development projects. These types of projects typically seek long-term borrowings, while the insurance market pursues long-term investments. Matching these two vital requirements translates to massive economic synergies, thus bolstering the insurance market much further. From an alternate perspective, amplification and enhancement of the insurance industry can also help generate more jobs in the economy, and thus, support our employment scenario. In short, rehabilitation of insurance regulations could result in multifold positive impacts on the economy of Bangladesh. Bring about a reform Firstly, there must be clarity and integrity in the policies and sales practices. Insurances happen to be fairly more complex in nature than most other products and services, which provides a platform for information asymmetry. This means that unfair policies and malpractices could be undertaken by piggybacking on the customers' comparatively minor level of technical knowledge, hence generating inefficiency in the insurance market. Stringent monitoring and evaluation of the regulatory framework is thus required as a result to create failsafe standards that can help curb corruption and negligence from the insurers' side. Secondly, the system needs to become more customer-oriented. We must start by re-examining the traditional framework and learn to reconstruct an insolvency regulation which is in alignment with evolving and varying customer needs. Further research and development will thus be required in the technical and financial paradigms to bring about more innovative features to providing insurance solutions; an increase in insurance awareness initiatives, and much importantly, a robust program for extracting and refining a pool of innovative and sincere professionals. Bangladesh seems to be an untapped gold mine for the insurance industry. A global report by Lloyd's projected that a meagre 1% rise in penetration in Bangladesh could contribute to as much as $4.4bn in savings. Nevertheless, a bumper harvest such as this could only be reaped by taking a sincere and gigantic step to modernise our insurance framework, starting with facing and examining its deep-seated weaknesses and loopholes. Embracing technology as a solution-builder would also make our engagements more rewarding here. Mamun Rashid is an economic analyst and partner at PwC."

The administration has started making a list of the estimated 1,300 affected farmers for financial support.\nOver the week, many farmers were seen cutting down unripe paddy for fear that the flood would continue and the crop would be destroyed.\nSingra upazila Agriculture Officer Sazzad Hossein said water entering the Beel from the Atrai and Gur river through a canal had flooded about 40-50 hectares of paddy in Sardahnagar Chougram, 10 hectares in Patkol in the municipal area, Berabari and Kawa-Tickri of Dahia union, 10-15 hectares in Tajpur Beel, and 10-12 hectare in Satardighi area.\nThe administration on Tuesday called on farmers to volunteer to build a barrage at Sherkol area to block the water. In light of the recent flooding and destruction of crops in the northeastern districts, the farmers were panicked and begun cutting down their green paddy.\nThis season, Singra farmers have cultivated paddy on 37,200 hectares of land, the officer said.\nAlmost all of the paddy is now ripe, Sazzad said, but the BRRI 29 paddy might take another 15 days to ripen.\n\"Farmers cutting down this BRRI 29 paddy now will face losses as they will lose about half of their yield.\"\nCosts go up\nFarmer Nasir uddin of Patul village of Naldanga upazila said he cultivated paddy on around 20 bigha of land.\n\"I faced losses in the BRRI-29 Paddy, and I am going to face losses in the Miniket because labour costs have suddenly gone up,\" he said.\n[caption id=\"attachment_60313\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\"] A boat filled with harvested paddy in Natore's Chalan Beel.

Or about Tk800 per day against the usual rate of Tk300-350 per day.\nFarmer Golam Azam of Dakkhin Damdama village in Singra said all of his ripe Miniket paddy is underwater now.\nThe cost of labour has gone up, he said. Added to that is the cost of boats for transporting the paddy. The boats are also demanding double or triple their usual rate, he added.\nAgriculture Officer Sazzad Hossein said he had asked the upazila education officer to direct to all primary schools, high schools and madrasas to permit farmers to use their grounds for harvesting.\n\n\n\n\n"

Instead, it is creating water stagnation throughout large parts of the city after each rainfall.\nAccording to sources involved with the project, nine mechanical scanners redirect Dhaka Water Supply and Sewage Authority's (Wasa) drains and water from surrounding houses into Hatirjheel after the rains. But the scanners are unable to handle the water flow if rainfall exceeds 50mm, flooding the entire region. The flooding of Hatirjheel was at fault for the stagnant water in Dhaka's Dhanmondi, Karwan Bazaar and adjacent areas on July 26.\nJamal Akhter, the director of the Haitrjheel project, said: \"We use mechanical scanners to filter and clean the water that is redirected into Hatirjheel. But when there is excessive rainfall, the scanners cannot handle the pressure. We are then forced to open the lids of the scanners, which allow dirty water from the households nearby to flow into the water body and pollute the environment.\"\n\"If we want to stop the pollution of Hatirjheel's waters, we will have to separate the storm drainage and rainwater drainage systems. But Wasa is not at all concerned with this. If we could have separated the two, we could just have let rainwater flow directly into Hatirjheel since rainwater is not dirty. It would also have reduced the time it takes to clean the sewerage line's flow of water. Now, since they both get mixed together, we have to filter both the waters together.\"\n\nAlso Read- Can Dhaka's waterlogging problem really be resolved?\n\nHe said the capital city's canals and drainage systems are extremely ineffective, causing water to stagnate each time it rains. The Hatirjheel's scanners cannot clean the combined water flow from sewage lines and rainfall at the same time. This was the chief cause of the flooding that occurred after the rains on the night of July 26.\nProf Mujibur Rahman, head of Buet's Civil Engineering Department, said: \"From the very beginning we had warned that Wasa's drainage capacity was not sufficient to supply the nine scanners at Hatirjheel. This causes water stagnation because of improper water flow. The Dhaka Wasa's drains are clogged with solid waste. They have not improved their drainage systems in the last 40 years. This forces the scanners to be opened during excessive rainfall, which pollutes the Hatirjheel's waters.\"\n\"Our advice was to create a sewage treatment plant to filter sewage flow. It was supposed to be built 5km from Rampura bridge. The plant was supposed to keep waterflow constant after filtering the sewage. But no one listened to our advices then,\" he added.\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"690\"] People have to use whatever they can to get by the waterlogged streets Mehedi Hasan/Dhaka Tribune [/caption]\nAccording to Dhaka Wasa data, almost 600,000 tonnes of sewage from the area between Dhanmondi and Rampura flow through Hatirjheel into the Balu river and eventually into the Shitalakkha river.\nAt an event on July 16 hosted by the Dhaka North City Corporation, the FDC flyover between Hatirjheel and Karwan Bazaar was said to be at fault for the waterlogging situation in Karwan Bazaar and surrounding areas. The area's water drainage systems were said to be closed because of the flyover, resulting in the whole area becoming waterlogged.\nOne of Hatirjheel's mechanical scanners, placed adjacent to the Sonargaon Hotel, intercepts sewerage and rain waterflow from Karwan Bazaar, Panthapath, Dhanmondi, Kalabagan, Kathalbagan, Bangla Motor and surrounding areas. But on Wednesday, the whole area was submerged after only 65mm of rain. Mogbazaar, Modhubaag, Ulon, Mohanagar Project, Daspara, Rampura, Merul, Badda, Gulshan, Tejgaon and other areas near Hatirjheel were also similarly flooded.\nThe DSCC's Superintendent Engineer Asaduzzaman said: \"Not enough water can pass through the Hatirjheel's sluice gates. There are three mechanical scanners at each of the gates. This causes some resistance to the usual flow of water. The gates are also not that wide. This makes it impossible for them to operate during heavy rains. So the gates are forced to be opened, causing situations like that on Wednesday.\"\nThe project was approved in October 2007. Although the project was supposed to be completed in three years by June 2010, work on it began in December 2008. The project was later redesigned and allotted another 1.5 years. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the project on January 2, 2013 and opened it to the public. The Bangladesh military's Special Works Organisation (SWO) was in charge of overseeing the project.\nThe article was first published on the Bangla Tribune\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Monsoon floods and landslides have killed at least 66 people across Nepal and India but officials fear that figure could almost double as rescuers search for dozens believed lost under mud and in submerged villages. Authorities Sunday upgraded the death toll from flash flooding across landlocked Nepal to 49 as the water kept rising, forcing thousands to flee for higher ground. \"Another 17 are missing. Search and rescue works are underway but the water levels have not declined yet,\" said Shankar Hari Acharya, the chief of Nepal's national emergency centre. The Red Cross estimated a higher death toll of 53, with dozens more missing and injured and thousands of homes destroyed. In neighbouring India, rescuers were desperately trying to reach two packed buses swept into a gorge by a landslide so powerful it destroyed an entire stretch of highway. The coaches had stopped for a tea break around midnight Saturday in Himachal Pradesh when tonnes of rock and mud cascaded down a mountainside. Seventeen bodies have been recovered from the accident site in the Himalayan state, said Sandeep Kadam, a senior official at the scene. But dozens were still missing somewhere at the bottom of the ravine, with soldiers and rescuers clawing through the mud and rock to reach them. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended his condolences and prayers for those affected by the accident. \"Pained by the loss of lives due to landslide-related accidents in HP's Mandi district,\" he posted on Twitter, using the acronym for Himachal Pradesh state.  The disaster followed days of heavy rain, which loosens the soil on steep hillsides and threatens villages at the foot of mountains every monsoon season. Hundreds have died across India in torrential rain, floods and landslides since the onset of the wet season in April. In Nepal the toll from this year's monsoon - which typically lasts from late June until the end of August - has already eclipsed last year, with more than 100 people confirmed dead. Last weekend in the central lowlands, four girls from the same family drowned when they fell into a flooded roadside ditch. Nepal's weather department warned that heavy rain was expected to continue for another day, following days of torrential downpours. Footage aired on Nepali TV showed villagers wading through waist-high water with their belongings and using boats to reach higher ground. Families perched on trees with young children overnight as flood waters swept away homes in a village in the southern district of Chitwan, local media reported. In the popular jungle safari resort of Sauraha in Chitwan, hotels were forced to shift their guests to higher floors as water rushed in. Biratnagar airport in the eastern district of Morang was closed after being submerged in a metre of water, authorities at the international terminal said. \"I have already instructed authorities concerned to rescue flood victims, move them to safer locations and immediately provide relief to them,\" Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba said in a video recording Saturday."

Four in every five of these are supplied by local farmers, with the rest of the demand met by cattle from Myanmar and India, according to the Department of Livestock Services (DLS).\nDLS data shows that of the 54.6 million animals reared on 525,000 farms across the country, 11.6 million of them are reared for Eid-ul-Azha. In 2016, a total of 10.5 million animals were sacrificed and this year, the DLS estimates the number will rise to 11.5 million.\n\"There is an adequate number of (locally-reared) animals to meet the demand,\" DLS Director General Ainul Haque said.\nBangladesh Meat Merchants' Association Secretary General Robiul Alam said: \"To control the meat market we have to reduce the dependency on foreign cattle.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "\nBangladesh towards 100% renewable energy\n\n\n\n\nDipal Chandra Barua\n\n,\n \nDipal Chandra Barua\n\n\n\n\n Published at 12:42 am August 12th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nRapid urbanisation, fuelled by stable economic growth, has created a huge energy demand in Bangladesh. It is well known that energy plays a vital role in poverty eradication, economic growth, sustainable infrastructure development, and ensuring security of a country.\nIn Bangladesh, electricity is the most widely used form of energy. Future economic growth significantly depends on the availability of electricity. At present, about 72% of the total population has access to electricity, and electricity supply is not adequately reliable.\nBangladesh is starving for energy for last few decades since its power generation is mainly depended on imported fossil fuel and natural gas. The present government has successfully increased electricity generation, yet grid electricity is not reachable in the remote areas of the country due to lack of infrastructure and longstanding distribution facilities.\nIn recent years, the world is moving towards green electricity generation to reduce carbon-dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas emissions. Traditional electricity production is the primary source (29%) of greenhouse gas emission.\nAt present, greenhouse gas emission affects the climate directly by raising the global temperature. Bangladesh is one of the top climate vulnerable country among 48 nations. It is facing the impact of climate change such as rising sea levels, increase of salinity, heavy rainfall, floods, and landslides.\nAs a vulnerable country, both private and public sectors of Bangladesh have taken multiple initiatives to move towards renewable electricity production to protect the environment and for better living conditions. The government has established SREDA to provide policy support and guidelines for sustainable growth of renewable energy.\nThe government of Bangladesh has set an ambitious goal of providing electricity connection to every rural household. Solar and other renewable energy can be the key component of this ambitious goal.\nIn some rural areas of Bangladesh, people live distant from the main grid connection to have reliable, affordable, and efficient electricity connections for their development.\nTo ensure energy access, energy security and pollution free clean electricity for all there is not much alternative available for Bangladesh except Renewable Energy especially solar energy.\nSolar energy has very small share in the present energy mix in Bangladesh. We host the fastest growing Solar Home System program in the world with over 50,000 SHS unit installations per month in the recent past.\nAs of 2017, Bangladesh has the world's largest SHS program with about 5 million SHS. Over 30 million people are benefitting directly from solar energy and over 100,000 new employments have already been created.\nBangladesh is blessed with year round sunshine (over 300 days per year) and has an enormous potential for solar energy. We have been utilising solar power wisely and using its experience towards diversifying renewable energy (RE) for maximum use.\nThe country has made significant progress in the rural renewable energy development by installing SHS in the off-grid areas. Back in 1996, SHS became popular among the rural people of Bangladesh for its affordable monthly installment-based financial model at the price of kerosene.\nGreen Technology Centers (GTC) were established in rural areas to train rural women, for capacity-building, and after-sales services at clients' door steps. A strong network of supply chain and branches also help SHS become popular and acceptable.\nAt present, people can easily charge their mobile phones, watch television, use fans, children can study better, and people can do their important household chores at night with the Solar Home System (SHS).\nBangladesh government has taken a systematic approach towards renewable energy development. The initiative includes development of awareness, legal and regulatory framework, institutional development, and financing mechanism to drive the RE sector.\nSome Systems (SHS) in Bangladesh has ignited the future prospects for solar energy, and will expedite to make the country the first solar nation in the world. Along with the SHS, 617 Solar Irrigation Pumps (SIP) have already been installed, along with solar street lights in Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, and remote rural areas of the country, 7 solar mini-grids in remote islands, urban rooftop solar program, and solar-powered arsenic water treatment plants are complementing the effort to generate clean power.\nCommunity-based solar approach such as solar irrigation pumps, solar mini-grid, arsenic water treatment plants, and solar street lights have the potential of benefitting the community people by ensuring food security, arsenic free pure water, improved socio-economic conditions in off-grid areas of Bangladesh etc.\nIt's possible to produce additional electricity of 30,000MW from the utilisation of solar PV at schools, colleges, universities, mosques, temples madrasahs, government buildings, factories, bus stations, train stations, unused lands, community-based PV plants, and grid tie mega projects.\nAt present, more than 1.6 million irrigation pumps are there and among them 1.3 million pumps are run by diesel. To replace traditional diesel-run irrigation pumps, 617 solar irrigation pumps have already been installed. By replacing all these diesel-run pumps, about 10,000MW electricity can be produced by solar energy.\nAs we know, Bangladesh is committed to achieve 17 Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, which includes combating climate change and increasing energy access from renewable energy sources.\nAs a climate vulnerable country, and for sustainable energy development and energy security, a Bangladesh solar mission needs to be designed to achieve SDGs by 2030 and to build the foundation to reach 100% renewable energy (RE) in the future.\nBangladesh has huge potential, but it must overcome many challenges, especially the challenges of global warming and energy crisis along with poverty reduction to realise its full potential. We can dream of a future where RE technology is the major contributor to our energy mix.\nWe can dream of providing all the modern facilities to thousands of rural villages through the next decade. Moving towards renewable energy can bring a true green revolution for the rural people by developing agricultural output, offering food security, providing modern facilities, creating new businesses and jobs for both men & women.\nFrom the experiences of the last two decades, we can say that solar energy has become very familiar and accepted by the people of Bangladesh.\nProper planning and implementation of a sustainable technological, financial, and socially accepted business model articulated through Bangladesh's solar mission, strong government policy, proper investment policy for investors, ensuring affordable technologies and quality products, and strong research and development will gradually transform the nation towards 100% RE, and we can dream of Bangladesh to become the first solar nation by 2041.\n\n\n\n\n"

Last year, the price stood below the Tk500 mark.\nHigh prices at the mill gate have already led to the increase of retail prices. Now unpacked refined salt is selling at Tk25 a kg, whereas the rate was Tk18-19 just a week ago.\n\"The government will take stern action against the unscrupulous salt traders if they increase the prices abnormally ahead of the Eid,\" the commerce secretary told the Dhaka Tribune.\nThe Bangladesh Tanners Association (BTA) has also been protesting the salt price inflation.\nUsually, a total of 30,000 tonnes salt is needed to process the raw hide that is expected to be collected from across the country during Eid-ul-Azha.\nBut in a press conference in Dhaka on August 19, the BTA alleged that some unscrupulous businesspeople had increased the prices of salt creating an artificial crisis in the market ahead of the Eid-ul Azha.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "\nWill everyone have electricity by 2018 or by 2021?\n\n\n\n\nAminur Rahman Rasel\n\n\n\n\n Published at 01:14 am August 27th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nGetting electricity to everyone in the country is one of Awami League's election promises. In its 2014 manifesto, the party set a deadline of five years to accomplish this task.\nAlthough the government appears to have made significant progress in the direction of hundred percent electrification, it is unclear if the goal will be achieved by 2018.\nIn a speech made in a special book published on the occasion of National Power and Energy Week 2016, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina hoped that they would be able to provide electricity to every home by 2021.\nHowever, the State Minister for Power Nasrul Hamid maintains that it can be done by 2018. The minister reiterated this in a seminar at Biduyt Bhaban in the city on August 19.\nCritics are not convinced. Consumers Association of Bangladesh Energy Adviser Prof M Shamsul Alam said the government's statements did not match the actual progress.\n\"This is nothing but political stunt. There is no similarity between the statements and the progress made in the reality. We expect the government to meet the target to make satisfactory developments,\" he said.\nThe Rural Electrification Board (REB) is playing the key role between six distribution agencies and companies to accomplish the task. They have already implemented several projects and a number of projects are ongoing.\nOfficials and contractors related to REB project implementation said around 47% of the consumers were getting electricity when the government took charge in 2009.\nAccording to REB, around 80% of the population now avails electricity. However, 80% coverage does not mean that 80% of the country is connected to the grid in terms of area.\nThere are 491 upazilas in the country; three of them are islands that can only be connected to the grid at a massive cost. So REB's target is to get power to 488 upazilas.\nOut of 488 upazilas, only 16 upazilas have electricity connections in their entire areas. There are 10 other upazilas where this has been accomplished, which the prime minister was scheduled to inaugurate on August 20, but this was cancelled due to floods.\nREB says another 35 upazilas are now ready to launch full electrification. By December 2017, the REB is expecting to add another 50 upazilas to this list.\nPut together, all of these only covers 111 upazilas or less than one fourth of the target upazilas.\nOfficials said the 2021 target would be more appropriate considering the prevailing status of the project.\nPower contractors remarked that whereas it had taken 39 years to bring electricity to half of the country's upazilas the government is trying to connect the remaining half in 10 years, which is a difficult task.\nAfter the government took power, there was a project for 1.8 million consumers which was delayed for two years. In addition, four other projects taken for divisional areas also saw delays, which are core reasons for the current situation, officials said.\nLack of raw materials used for the task, manpower crisis and difficulties in assigning people for the projects led to this situation.\nPower Division officials who wished to remain anonymous, said much of the progress in rural electrification was attributable to the current REB Chairman Moin Uddin, who they described as a hard-working and sincere official. But the officials said his work was bogged down by many incompetent and insincere officials in REB and the Palli Bidyut Samity.\nThe government took a number of projects for supply of electricity, but the volume of transmission, distribution lines and sub-stations was insufficient to meet the target. There is also a crisis in power production, leading to uncertainty in meeting the target.\nAn official of REB seeking anonymity said there were at least 15 Upazilas that REB cannot bring under 100% electrification by 2020 due to lack of progress of work.\n\"If we can bring 90% of the villages under electrification by 2018, that would also be a major success,\" REB Chairman Maj Gen Moin Uddin told the Dhaka Tribune.\n\"We are expecting to bring rest of the upazilas by bringing 70-80% of them under electrification and that would be a major satisfaction for the consumers, also a success for us,\" he added.\nHe said that places that were difficult to connect to the grid would have mini-grids with renewable energy as source.\nTo achieve the goal, REB needs to establish over 10 million new power connections and extend distribution lines by around 100,000 km.\nMaj Gen Moin Uddin said to achieve the target by 2018, three years earlier than the previous target, is a big challenge.\nAccording to estimates, by 2021 the number of power consumers will raise from 9.7 million to 23 million, an increase of almost 230%. The peak demand will rise from 4,500MW to 9,200MW, an increase of 100%.\n\"At present, REB is running 16 consumer connection projects estimated to end by 2019. In order to implement the 2021 target we are going to take on seven new projects,\" the REB chairman said.\nEstablished in 1977 to ensure rural people's access to electricity, REB has been working in association with 80 Palli Bidyut Samitys.\nState Minister for Power Nasrul Hamid said: \"We are hopeful about doing this by 2018. But it may take more time. It is not a fault if we miss the deadline.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "\n22 Bangladeshi products waiting to get GI certification\n\n\n\n\nAbu Siddique\n\n\n\n\n Published at 12:20 am September 10th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 01:29 am September 10th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nAfter the successes of Jamdanee sharee and Ilish, Bangladesh will receive Geographical Indication (GI) certifications for more products including Fazli mango, Langra mango, Kataribhog rice, Kalijira rice and honey from the Sundarbans.\nAccording to the Department of Patents, Designs and Trademarks (DPDT), they have already received 25 applications for 22 different products originating in 15 districts.\n\"All applications are under process now and once it is complete, we will issue a gazette notification for each of them separately,\" said Md Sanowar Hossain, registrar of DPDT.\nOn November 17, 2016, the government certified Jamdanee sharee as the first GI product in Bangladesh under the Geographical Indication Act 2013.\nOn June 1, the government issued a gazette notification announcing Ilish as the other GI product in Bangladesh.\n\nAs per the rule, any person or organisation from across the world can raise objection against the notification within two months of the gazette notification.\nAccording to the Geographical Indicative Products (Registration and Protection) Act 2013, if someone wants to claim a certified GI product as their own or has a complaint against the decision, they have to lodge the complaint within two months of the gazette notification. Otherwise the decision will be granted.\n\"As no complaints or objections have been lodged against the certification, Ilish can now be considered a Bangladeshi GI product,\" Sanowar Hossain said.\nAccording to the act, geographical indication (GI) is a sign which defines the source and contains the goodwill of a product that originated in a particular area, like Ilish from Padma, chamcham from Tangail and kataribhog from Dinajpur.\nThe objective of introducing the act was to protect the interest of producers by allowing them to use a particular sign through registration.\nThe validity of a particular registered GI product will remain for five years. The producer will have to apply for re-registration after the validity expires.\n\nRegarding the applications under process, the registrar told the Dhaka Tribune: \"An application does not ensure that all of them will get registered. We have to ensure that the products have the specific characteristic and the unique quality.\"\nEarlier, Bangladesh formulated an ordinance named Geographical Indications of Goods (registration and protection) Ordinance 2008, which identified 66 products as the country's GI products.\nOf them, three were fish, eight were vegetables, 14 were agricultural products, 48 were food items and 18 were other products including Jamdani Saree and Nakshi Kantha.\nThe government formulated the GI Act 2013 in line with the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement signed on January 1, 1995 among the World Trade Organisation and member nations.\n\nRegarding the process of getting certified as a GI product from Bangladesh, the DPDT registrar said: \"Applying for GI certification is not an easy process. The applicant has to show the historical background of the product like ancient documents and the product's uniqueness, which is difficult.\"\nFor instance, he said that Department of Fisheries took around a year to submit the application for Ilish.\nRegistering a particular product like Jamdani with a GI sign would benefit producers by giving them more financial and business opportunities due to its goodwill.\n\nBangladesh has already lost its famous products like Nakshi Kantha and Fazli mango for failing to pass the law in due time.\nAsked about the GI products that India has already registered as its own, Registrar Sanowar said Bangladesh could also register those products because of their origin and market them with the GI sign.\nAccording to India's Geographical Indications Registry, Nakshi Kantha was registered as a GI product from the country in 2008, and Fazli Mango and Jamdani Saree in 2009.\nThe registry refers to Jamdani Saree as \"Uppada Jamdani Saree\" - a handicraft item produced in its Andhra Pradesh state, Nakshi Kantha produced in West Bengal and Fazli mango grown in the Malda district of West Bengal state.\nHowever, Bangladesh has registered Jamdanee with the name of 'Jamdanee'.\n\n\n\n\n"

Between 9am on Sunday and 9am on Monday, 165 mm of rainfall was recorded.\nLarge areas of Khatunganj, Chaktai and neighboring Korbaniganj and Rajakhali located on either side of the Chaktai canal were submerged in knee-deep to waist-deep water.\nThe water congestion damaged large quantities of perishable commodities, including onions, garlic, rice, lentils, sugar, tea and spices after water flooded into the shops and warehouses at the wholesale markets.\nThe water congestion forced traders to raise the height of the doorstill of both shops and warehouses in an effort to prevent water from coming in. However, even this was not enough as water managed to seep in through the walls.\nThe traders of the century-old business hub said the problem was worsened further because of the solid waste and filth choking up the Chaktai canal.\nEvery year, rainwater from the Karnaphuli river floods the shops and warehouses in the area through the various canals, including Chaktai Canal which also serves as the main drainage system for all the rainwater in the city alongside the usual sewage outlets.\nThe commodity hubs house about 3,000 businesses and more than 5,000 warehouses.\nAccording to the Khatunganj Trade and Industries Association, the daily turnover in the wholesale market stands at Tk1200-1500cr.\nThe traders said they had to incur huge losses due to the chronic water-logging problem.\nSyed Sagir Ahmad, general secretary of the Khatunganj Trade and Industries Association, said traders had yet to calculate their actual losses as they were too busy trying to protect what remained of their goods.\n\"Every year we have to suffer huge losses and we want to solve the chronic water logging problem. The government should put special emphasis on Chaktai- Khatunganj since it is a major commercial hub of the country. Chaktai canal should be dredged and excavated on a regular basis,\" said Sagir.\nSpeaking to the Dhaka Tribune, Solaiman Badshah from the Chaktai-Khatunganj Warehouse Owners and General Merchants Association, said the long-standing water-logging problem had now turned into a tragedy for the commodity hub of the commercial capital.\n\"Chaktai-Khatunganj is a long-neglected business hub of the country. Nobody seems to be concerned about the development of the wholesale market,\" regretted the trade body leader.\n\"Many parts of the Chaktai canal have been filled up as a result of land-grabbing and lack of regular dredging water-logging, causing the traders untold misery. We, on behalf of our organisation, had submitted memorandums to different government offices including the Chittagong City Corporation to press home our demands,\" he added.\nEarlier, the traders from the Chaktai-Khatunganj Warehouse Owners and General Merchants Association had placed a seven-point charter of demands, including evicting all illegal structures from the banks of Karnaphuli river, restoration of navigability of the Karnaphuli and its connecting canals through regular dredging, construction of permanent protection dams and a sluice gate at the mouth of the canal while keeping avenues for the movement of boats and trawlers transporting goods, and constructing a truck terminal on the river bank at Chaktai area.\n\n\n\n\n"

For those who have a knack for scientific nomenclature, the species is called Botia dario. In English, it is also known as Bengal loach.\nThe six to seven inch loaches are sweetwater bottom-dwelling fish having barbels around the mouth.\nBangladesh, India and Bhutan are the only countries to offer the delicacy of rani fish curry on one's platter, notwithstanding the beauty of the species.\nRani fish were once enlisted among the endangered fish species from Bangladesh.\nBut thanks to the demarcation of some water bodies in the haor as fish sanctuaries, local fishermen say their recent catches have turned up increasing number of rani, an evidence that the population of this species is beginning to bounce back, said Kulaura Upazila Senior Fisheries Officer Md Sultan Mahmud.\nIn 2012, the government declared 12 water bodies in the haor as permanent fish sanctuaries. There are reports that some other endangered fish species have also made a comeback in the haor since then.\nThe senior fisheries officer also noted that this year's fish catch from Hakaluki Haor is likely to break the record of the last seven years.\nKirendra Das, a fisherman from Hakaluki Haor, told the Dhaka Tribune that they used to catch only one or two rani fish during a day's haul in the recent past. \"But over the last couple of years, the fish population have multiplied. And after the floods, they are schooling around in great numbers.\n\"Though the population has revived, it takes three to four days to catch one kilogram of rani fish. If one wishes to buy rani fish, he has to contact us before we go fishing. We can put together the catches of several fishermen and provide one kg rani fish in two to three days. It costs Tk2,000 for one kg rani fish.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

This will help us,\" said KM Layek Ali, general secretary of Bangladesh Auto, Major and Husking Mill Owners' Association.\nEncouraging the private traders, the commerce minister said: \"From now on, import and market rice in whatever packaging you can. I'll notify the NBR and Customs. No one will stop you. This will remain effective for next three months.\"\n\"There is no food shortage in the country. Even if there is any shortage, we'll meet the demand through government to government agreements and private sector will import the rest,\" he added.\nTofail said he also would talk to the concerned authorities in getting rid of the hurdles in rice import.\nTo meet any shortage, Food Minister Qamrul said: \"The government will soon launch open market sell (OMS) of rice at upazila level while suspending programmes like Food For Work immediately.\"\nMeanwhile, the Food Directorate's recent OMSs witnessed lacklustre response as people are not habituated with unboiled (Atap) rice, OMS representative Syed Bin Kawsar told the Dhaka Tribune.\nAfter the latest price hike, the OMSs were launched at Dhaka's different points for the lower income people, selling per kg unboiled rice at Tk30 and flour at Tk17 a kg.\nKawsar said they were suffering losses as most people were only buying flour.\nMillers and importers on Tuesday also complained that using jute sacks when importing rice raises their cost by Tk1 per kg. But plastic sacks cost just 15-16 paisa.\nThey claimed using plastic sacks will curb the import cost by at least Tk2 per kg, and gradually bring the rice prices in the local markets down.\nPrices of all types of rice at the kitchen markets in Dhaka have increased by Tk10 per kg in the past week, due to several reasons including floods and illegal storage by millers and traders.\nAccording to Trading Corporation of Bangladesh, the markets have seen Tk18-20 hike in per kg rice from last month's prices and Tk29-50 from last year's prices.\nOn Tuesday, Najirshail rice was sold at Tk70-72 per kg and different coarse rice (Swarna and Paijam) at Tk55. Last week, coarse rice prices were between Tk42 and Tk44.\nFine grain Miniket's price is also up to Tk65 from Tk55 per kg, and BR-28 is at Tk58-60 from Tk48-50.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "\nBad loans cripple the banking sector\n\n\n\n\nShariful Islam\n\n\n\n\n Published at 12:58 pm October 6th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 01:24 am October 9th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe persistent increase in bad loans has crippled Bangladesh's banking sector, mostly affecting the state-owned banks.\nAs of June this year, the amount of accumulated default loans stood at around Tk1,19,000 crore, which is 12% of Bangladesh's GDP. To give a more vivid parallel, the sum is enough to construct four Padma bridges.\nEconomists and bank officials said the rising trend of bad debts might paralyse the banking sector and the economy. Analysts have suggested taking effective measures to rein in default loans.\nExperts say loan default is an indispensable part of the banking sector as there are ups and downs in debtors' businesses and sometimes there are other problems in the loan recovery process.\nThey expressed concerns about defaulters who intentionally refuse to make payment on loans in spite of their abilities. This type of defaulters contributed to almost 85% of the total default loans until June 30, Bangladesh Bank (BB) data show.\nBangladesh's loan default scenario\nThe defaulted amount rose to Tk74,148cr on June 30, from Tk62,172cr in December last year, BB data show. The defaulted amount is 10.14% of the Tk731,000cr credit disbursed by 57 commercial banks.\nThe default loans of eight state-run and specialised commercial banks amounted to Tk40,098cr, while it was Tk31,729cr for private banks and Tk2,321cr for foreign commercial banks.\nExperts said the figure would have been much higher if badloans had not been written off. As of June 30, banks have written off loans of around Tk45,000cr. It means, the accumulated default amount at the end of June stood around Tk119,000cr.\n\nThe defaulted loan is 12.56% of Bangladesh's GDP which is Tk947,542cr as per the constant price. The constant price of Indian GDP is $27,400cr while its defaulted loan is $15,400cr, 7.43% of the GDP.\nThe amount of unpaid loans has been increasing by leaps and bounds since 2011 when the total defaulted loan was Tk22,644cr, an amount equal to 6.12% of the total disbursed credit till that period.\nState-owned banks have always had the largest amount of defaulted loans. But in recent times, bad debts of private banks are rising alarmingly.\nIn the first six months this year, the defaulted loans of 40 private banks increased by Tk2,002cr. At the end of last year, private banks' defaulted loan was Tk29,727cr.\nMore loan default this year\nLoan defaults in the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector have been low, BB data showed. But, the amount of defaulted loans could rise this year as floods have affected the low-lying regions of the country, experts said.\nThe central bank issued a circular on August 24, relaxing loan rescheduling rules and suspending loan recovery for six months from farmers and SMEs in the flood-hit areas.\nAccording to the circular, banks will relax conditions for down payments in case of rescheduling farm loans, SME and cottage loans and micro credit. Debtors will get six months to pay instalments after rescheduling their loans.\nMoreover, affected borrowers will be allowed to get fresh loans without repaying existing dues. Banks will provide new loans to farmers and small entrepreneurs under the relaxed policy until June 30 next year.\nReasons behind the default\nEconomists and bankers said the major reason behind default loan is the distribution of credit on political consideration, which made it quite difficult to recover the credits.\nAB Mirza Azizul Islam, former finance adviser to the caretaker government, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Lack of good governance is behind the increase in default loans. For this, a large number of habituated defaulters affiliated with political parties take loans and the banks failed to recover them.\"\nBesides political affiliation, experts also blamed the culture of impunity, abuse of power in loan disbursement, weakness of existing laws and lack of technical expertise that help defaulters swindle money from banks.\n\"Default loan is on the rise since bankers did not maintain rules and regulations while disbursing and recovering loans,\" Islam said. \"Some vested quarters are manipulating existing laws to take loans and turn into defaulters.\"\nManaging Director and Chief Executive Officer of Rupali Bank Md Ataur Rahman Prodhan told the Dhaka Tribune: \"In recent times, default loans have risen but the number of defaulters has decreased as we are more cautious in disbursing loans.\"\nHe further clarified that BB had asked banks to include previously excluded defaulters in the list, making the list appear longer.\nSpeaking about the weaknesses of existing laws, he said, \"If we sue any defaulter, that person files a writ petition against us. When the court rejects the appeal, he can file the writ again. This is a hindrance towards recovering default loans.\"\nBankers also blamed the bank management. They noted that in most of the default loan-hit banks, the chairmen, MDs and directors were found abusing their power in distributing loans.\nAs the director of a private bank cannot take loan from his bank, he sets up a syndicate with directors from another bank and they grant each other big amounts of loan through their banks. Rules and regulations are flouted and they take the loans to be defaulters. They also siphon off the money, accrding to bankers.\n\"If you look at the default-hit state-owned banks' previous chairmen or MDs, you will see that they sanctioned the defaulted loans the most,\" said former BB deputy governor Khandakar Ibrahim Khaled.\nHe also blamed the government which offered rescheduling and restructuring facilities for default loans, saying these steps encouraged debtors not to repay the loans.\nAbout 10% of the total bank loans were rescheduled in 2016, according to BB's Financial Stability Report.\nFinance Minister AMA Muhith recently said bankers were responsible for loan defaults as they always tried to show their clients as defaulters to avoid being held accountable for loan defaults.\n\"When a client approaches a bank for loan, what comes first to the bankers' minds is how to show him or her as a loan defaulter. The bankers set terms and conditions in such a way that the client becomes a defaulter. Every bank does it to avoid being held responsible for loan defaults. This is a very bad culture in our banking sector,\" he said.\nChairman of the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh (ABB) Anis A Khan, also the managing director of Mutual Trust Bank, rejected the allegation. \"It's not true,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. \"We have declared war against default loans. What can we do if businesses do not pay back the debt? We cannot arrest them. Many of the businesses fled the country after taking big amount of credit from banks.\"\nBankers said the banks do not have enough technical expertise to properly analyse the loan files.\n\"Banks lack technical expertise in analysing eligibilities of individuals or companies seeking loans. Many banks do not even go through the Credit Information Bureau report to check eligibility of a client. Corruption in approving loans is another factor. The borrowers evade some of the conditions in exchange for money,\" Research Director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Khondaker Golam Moazzem said.\nBankers said the defaulters were not being punished as the bankruptcy court was out of commission and this encouraged people to become debt dodgers.\nImpact of default loans\nExperts say default loans hit the banks' profit, shrink the scope of business expansion and thwart plans for job creation.\nBanks cannot turn savings into loanable funds as they have to set aside the amount equivalent to bad loans as provision. As a result, banks' costs of funds rise while lending rates go higher and the deposit interest rates go down.\nAccording to BB data, the average lending rate at the end of June this year stood at 9.46%, while the average interest rate on bank deposit stood at 4.84%.\nMirza Azizul said, \"Default loans create trouble in money and share markets. Banks' shareholders are deprived of profit as banks have to fund provision to make up losses incurred by defaulted loans.\"\nBanks also have to face capital shortfall due to defaulted loans. The situation is awful in state-owned banks that require injection of capital from public money to remain functional.\nBB data showed that in June this year, the total capital in the banking system was Tk89,959cr, up from Tk 84,424 crore in March this year. Of the amount, eight public banks had a capital shortfall of Tk12,683cr.\nThe government injected Tk13,705cr as recapitalisation fund into the state-owned banks from FY2009-10 to FY2016-17, all of it was the taxpayers' money, according to a Centre for Policy Dialogue report.\nThe Finance Minister proposed to allocate Tk2,000cr for recapitalisation during 2017-18 fiscal.\nDue to defaulted loans, banks are now afraid to issue big and long term loans, leading to exceeding liquidity in the banking sector. Banks currently have an excess liquidity of Tk126,000cr, according BB.\nHow to get rid of the curse?\nStakeholders have long been demanding reform in the financial sector to bring accuracy, accountability and good governance as well as to rein in the loan default culture.\nBad loan keeps rising despite government steps like loan rescheduling and restructuring facilities.\nExperts observed that these measures are insufficient and stressed good governance in the banking sector, amending existing laws, improving expertise and ensuring punishment of the defaulters.\nBangladesh can follow India's example, they suggested. India is planning to make loan default a criminal offence and has set an example by getting back a defaulter from abroad through diplomatic channel.\nDirector General of Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM) Dr Toufic Ahmad Choudhury told the Dhaka Tribune: \"Good governance will not be fully established in the banking sector unless people like former BASIC Bank chairman Sheikh Abdul Hye Bacchu are punished for corruption.\"\n\"Bangladesh's Artha Rin Adalat Ain (Financial Loan Court Act) needs to be upgraded so that no one can take advantage of procrastination and escape unharmed. Bangladesh can declare defaulters bankrupt but it must have transparent and proper law in this regard,\" CPD's Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem said.\nRupali Bank MD Prodhan said: \"We need to modernise the laws related to realising default loans.\n\"Political consideration in loan disbursement has to be stopped as 85% of the defaulted loans were distributed based on political consideration.\"\nMirza Azizul told the Dhaka Tribune: \"It is very difficult to come out of the bad culture of default loans in the absence of political will from the political parties.\"\nLatest BB data showed that most of the defaulted loans are big. BB Governor Fazle Kabir said, \"Banking sector has to come out of the default loan culture for the sake of maintaining stability in the financial sector.\"\nHe directed bankers to give priority to SME loans to reduce the ratio of large loans in the total credit disbursement.\nBB Deputy Governor SK Sur Chowdhury asked banks to appoint good lawyers to take legal actions against big loan defaulters.\nIs there any hope?\nThough most of the loan defaulters are always affiliated with the party in power, it is very hard for the government to stem default loan culture, said experts.\nFormer BB governor Khaled said: \"Political will is important to end this practice. The incumbent government apparently has no intention of stopping this like its predecessors.\"\nEconomists, too, stressed the need for political decision to come out of the loan default culture. There is a very little scope to end the culture in near future as big businesses are involved in such anomalies, they added.\n\"In India, the Modi government has taken steps to stabilise the financial sector soon after coming to power. It was impossible before the election year,\" an economist from one of the country's leading independent think-tanks told the Dhaka Tribune.\n\"In Bangladesh's context, the time to bell the cat is gone. One has to understand the political economy in this regard,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Scriptures say, we should all visit graveyards because they have a sobering impact on the living. The atmosphere calms the senses, brushes out the angst, makes us realise the inevitability of death, and, most importantly, gives us precious moments to reflect. On a sun-drenched tranquil Friday afternoon, when I stepped into the Commonwealth War Graves in Dampara, Chittagong, life's all other pressures were minimised for a few hours. The day to day priorities seemed distant, and, to an extent, superfluous. Like countless other places around the world, homage was being paid to the soldiers of the two great wars that have shaped the current world. Arranged by the British High Commission in Bangladesh with the cooperation of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the Bangladesh Armed Forces, the day, as those present would have felt, was not just for remembering sacrifices made in the great wars but for all struggles aimed at ensuring freedom and human rights. A link to deaths long ago Someone once asked me the relevance of observing Remembrance Day, stating rather callously that soldiers killed in a forgotten time ruled by a defunct/defective ideology do not have any value today. Well, it's of course very easy to dismiss the past and go on with the present, but, if we do, then we actually dishonour those who laid down their lives in the belief that their deaths would ensure a brighter future. Whether the world became better or not is a matter of debate but countless men went to the frontier with the determination to fight till the end and make the sacrifice for others. Just for that, we have reason to remember and honour them. Remembrance Day is about reinstating our gratitude to fighters who fell to give us the chance to enjoy sovereignty, independence, and an honourable identity But there is also another valid cause -- many of the men killed were our own, fighting at that time for the government they served. And this means, not only the men on the side of the allies but also for the axis powers because no matter which side a soldier was on, in the end, it's his/her life that was sacrificed. At the entry of the War Cemetery in Chittagong, on the right side of the gate is a large record of merchant seamen, all from this part of the world, who died, not in action but while providing vital service to the war effort. And there is also a section where Japanese soldiers fighting for the axis powers are buried. It's not about who won and who lost, it's about showing our gratitude to young men, who left life, love, merriment to face death. About all freedom fighters The day is not marked solely to recall the soldiers of the world wars only; over the decades with the world's dominant ideology undergoing transformation with more emphasis placed on human rights and the just cause, Remembrance Day is about reinstating our gratitude to fighters who fell to give us the chance to enjoy sovereignty, independence, and an honourable identity. For me, on that serene Friday morning at the Chittagong war cemetery, thoughts were about our valiant freedom fighters who went to battle with the dream of a free country for others to live in. Prayers swirled around a certain freedom fighter, a 22-year-old vivacious student of English literature at the University of Dhaka who went to war in 1971 because he was outraged when his fellow countrymen and his favourite teacher Jyotirmoy Guhathakurta were killed.  Caught by collaborators, he was shot and, as witnesses later told his relatives, had the Bangladesh slogan on his lips till the end. His name was Naseem Mohsin, the uncle I never got to meet. There were many like him, who went to war because they felt the need to give their lives to create Bangladesh. Again, the Bangladesh they gave us faltered, fumbled, often looked hopelessly unstable, was ravaged by famines, floods, and strife but she has made it through all the tribulations and, today, is firmly placed as a nation which confidently looks forward to middle income status. We can now open our borders for the less fortunate to come and find security. So, no sacrifice goes in vain; maybe the soldiers who died in the two great wars could not give us a perfect world but since 1945, there has not been any major global conflict. Well, I call that a success. The overarching message of peace Remembrance Day recalls soldiers who died in battle while the overarching message is that of peace. As the British High Commissioner to Bangladesh, Alison Blake said at the cemetery: \"We solemnly pay respect to the young men who gallantly left youth and life so others could live on, but at the same time feel that we must always strive for peace so young lives are not cut short anymore.\" In our often clinical assessment of human history of warfare, we swiftly divide a conflict in two parts: The victors and the vanquished. While doing so, the soldiers who died in battle become a perfunctory number. Remembrance Day is all about making the soldier the focus and so, at the end of the ceremony, the poignant lines of Phillip Hendy Davies reverberated across the graveyard: \"The sunlight fades as the rainbow dims; and the day is done/  He lies cold on wet barren earth and we know him only as someone's son/  Killed by a sniper's perfected hand, his rifle resting on a firm bag of sand/  That bullet forever depriving him of seeing again his green and pleasant land.\" Towheed Feroze is a journalist working in the development sector."

      "text": "A study by the Asia Development Bank says Asia will endure extreme heat, rising sea levels, growing losses from severe weather and increasing food insecurity in coming decades as climate change raises temperatures and alters weather patterns across the globe. The survey released Friday by the Manila-based lender paints a grim outlook for many communities in Asia, home to about 4 billion people. It's based on the latest scientific research, with or without more aggressive efforts to curb carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. Even if global warming is limited to 1.5degC to 2degC above pre-industrial levels, from mountain communities in Japan to the tropics of South Asia and deserts of Australia, rising temperatures are altering ecosystems, damaging crops and causing thousands more deaths each year. The report forecasts that Asian summer temperatures could rise by 6degC by 2100 if warming trends are not curbed. India suffered heat waves in 2015 and 2016 with temperatures at times around 50degC. Sea levels rose about 19cm globally over the past century and are forecast to rise by about 2.3 meters for every degree Celsius of global warming as glaciers and ice caps melt, the report says, citing past climate observations. Losses due to coastal flooding of the world's biggest cities are expected to rise to $52 billion a year. Indonesia will be the worst affected in Asia, with 5.9 million people flooded out each year by 2100. But across South Asia, 130 million people living in low-lying areas may be displaced under worst-case scenarios.  Changes to the jet stream can bring on unprecedented rainfall and massive flooding. Floods in Pakistan in 2010, the worst ever, killed about 3,000 people and left millions homeless. While some areas are suffering extreme droughts, in Southeast Asia, the number of record-setting daily rainfall amounts doubled over the past three decades. Up to a quarter of Bangladesh is inundated in a normal year, and century-level flooding could put 60% of the country under water, the report says. Storm surges from tropical cyclones, destructive winds and landslides are other risks from weather extremes. A 3degC rise in regional temperature is likely to cause grain output to fall by up to 10%, the report says, causing tens of millions of people to go hungry. Weaker wheat yields in China and loss of rice paddy in Vietnam due to rising sea levels and extreme weather are among the changes expected in coming decades. At the same time, desertification is spreading in Central Asia, a region where about 7-8% of the population lacks secure access to food. Growing ocean acidity due to changes in the atmosphere and warming temperatures are meanwhile straining marine ecosystems, hurting fisheries that are a crucial source of food across the region.

      "text": "\nPrices of cattle food go up ahead of Eid-ul-Azha\n\n\n\n\nAnwar Hussain, Chittagong\n\n\n\n\n Published at 12:49 pm July 30th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 12:50 pm July 30th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nCattle and dairy farmers of Chittagong region are gravely concerned as the prices of cattle fodder has gone up recently.\nThe soaring price of animal food may trigger a hike in cattle price during the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha, the Muslim festival of sacrifice.\nShahed Ayatullah Khan, a cattle farm owner, has 25 bulls that he intends for fattening, and 70 cows in his dairy farm, located at Patenga area in the port city.\nHe told the Dhaka Tribune that the dairy and cattle fattening business had turned out to be a loss project due to sudden hike in prices of fodder and low price of milk.\n\"High prices of hay, oil cake and wheat bran are affecting cattle farming. Milk production is now at stake as we cannot afford the pricey fodders,\" he said. \"A local cow provides two to three litres of milk a day which is sold at Tk50/litre on an average, while the fodder and other costs sum up to at least Tk60.\"\nSome other cattle traders said they preferred local cross breed - Horiana, Australian Frizian, Shahiwal and Pabna breed of cattle - for fattening.\nThe prices of fodder witnessed a sharp rise following the recent floods which damaged grazing fields. The cattle farm owners also put part of the blame on the syndicates for the sudden price hike.\n\"In the rainy season it is not possible for cattle to graze as the lands go under water. And it takes time for new grass to grow,\" said Shahed Ayatullah, who is also an executive member of the Chittagong Dairy Farm Association.\nThe farmers said that the prices of all types of fodder like wheat bran, straw, soybean meal, oil cake, granular rice and pulse powder had been increased in past few months.\nNow each kg of straw is selling for Tk15-17 compared to previous price of Tk8-10.\nOne kg of wheat bran is sold at Tk33 against previous price of Tk20, granular rice Tk45 against Tk25 and pulse powder is sold at Tk37 against previous price of Tk25.\nMoreover, the prices of oil cake and green fodder like Napier and local varieties have increased in the market.\nSoybean cake or meal, a major source of protein for the cattle, is manufactured through crushing soybean seeds, price of which has also risen sharply. Now each kg of soybean meal is sold at Tk53 against a previous price of Tk30.\nMustard oil cake now sells at Tk38 per kg against a previous price of Tk25. Molasses used to be sold at Tk20 per kg, but now it is sold at Tk30.\nOne kg of pulse powder is now sold at Tk37 against a previous price of Tk25.\nAccording to Chittagong District Livestock Office, there are around 1,500 dairy farms and 4,100 cattle fattening farms in the district. Of the dairy farms, only 450 are registered.\nOn the other hand, the cattle fattening farms are not registered as seasonal cattle raisers do not feel encouraged to go for the registration.\n To be dubbed as a dairy, a farm should have at least 3 cows, while a farm should have heard of at least 10 to be termed as a cattle fattening farm.\nDr Md Reajul Huq, district livestock officer, however told the Dhaka Tribune that the price hike of animal food ahead of Eid-ul-Azha was not abnormal.\n\"To recoup the price hike, the traders usually shoot up the cattle price. However, the farmers need not worry over the hike of animal foods. We always advise the farmers to adopt the scientific method of cattle fattening which is cost-effective too,\" the livestock officer added.\n\"The scientific method of fattening cattle is to feed a mixture of urea, molasses and straw (UMS) to the cattle at right proportions. Ten kilograms of straw mixed with 6-7 litres of water, 2.5kg molasses and 300gm of urea make ideal UMS food for cattle fattening. An adult cow may take only 4-5kg a day and the animal should undergo de-worming beforehand,\" said the official.\n\"The mixture should be fed for a period of six months along with other balanced food. After keeping the mixture in a closed container for eight days it should be dried in the sun to make it ready for use as fodder,\" Dr Md Reajul added.\n\n\n\n\n"

Andharmanik is one of the five river spots declared to be Ilish sanctuary, and Golachipa is the migration route for the fish.\nThe other sanctuary - Tentulia River in Bhola - is merely 10 kilometres upstream from the power plant site.\nHaving a coal-based power plant this close to two Ilish sanctuaries - which together produce around 10,000 tonnes of Ilish every year - is detrimental for the life of the Ilish in those areas, said Dr Anisur Rahman, prinicipal research officer at Bangladesh Fisheries Research Institute (BFRI).\n\"Ilish is one of the most sensitive aquatic species in the world. It requires careful handling,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune. \"A heavy industry like coal-fired power plant will definitely have a negative impact on the sanctuaries, especially if the authorities concerned do not put proper measures to protect the environment in place.\"\nIn addition, the coal, to be used to generate power in the plant, will be transported via the Golachipa River, the migration route for the Ilish that goes to the Andharmanik.\nAnis said coal will adversely affect the growth and sustainability of the Ilish, but to what extent the fish will be affected has yet to be determined as not enough research has been done on this issue.\nThe Environment Impact Assessment report of the project, however, says the ultra-super critical technology used to establish the power plant will protect the environment of the rivers.\nSyed Nazmul Hasan, director at the Department of Environment, the government agency that issues environmental clearance, also assured that this project was safe for the sanctuaries.\n\"We issued the environment clearance for this project after we were sure that it had proper environmental management plan,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune.\nYet, doubt remains among the experts.\n\"The power plant authorities told us that they will take water from the river, but they will not release hot water to the river,\" said Jahid Habib, project director of Ilish conservation initiatives under the Department of Fisheries. \"But I think the chances of pollution still remains as the power plant will likely release different chemical by-products in the river, which will harm the Ilish population.\"\nThe project, a joint venture between Bangladesh and China, is being implemented by Bangladesh's North-West Power Generation Company Ltd (NWPGCL) and China's National Machinery Import and Export Corporation. It is expected to start generating power by the end of 2018.\nNWPGCL Managing Director AM Khurshedul Alam also told the Dhaka Tribune that an ultra super-critical technology would be used to generate power at the plant which would both cut back the use of coal than usual and would not release hot water in the environment.\nIlish: a national treasure\nAccording to the Fisheries Statistical Report of Bangladesh 2015-16, Bangladesh annually produces 395,000 tonnes of Ilish which bring in a substancial amount of foreign currency through export.\nOf that amount, 65% comes from the marine sources and the rest from inland rivers.\nThere are three other Ilish sanctuaries in the country: the stretch of Meghna River between Satnol and Char Alexander, the Shahbazpur channel of Meghna, and a part of the estuary of Padma and Meghna rivers in Shariatpur.\nThe national fish of Bangladesh contributes to 12% of overall fish production in Bangladesh, which is equivalent to around 1% of the country's GDP.\nAround half a million fishermen are directly dependent on Ilish production for their livelihood, and another two million are dependent indirectly.\nDue to high demand in both home and abroad, excessive catching of Ilish in the past couple of decades has led to concerns regarding its endangered existence.\nIn order to conserve this species, the government has taken several initiatives, one of which is ban on Ilish catching during two breeding seasons.\nThe first ban of the year is in March-April, in all Ilish sanctuaries except for Andharmanik River.\nThe second ban is in November-January in the Andharmanik sanctuary.\n\n\n\n\n"

It is just as difficult to arrange feeds and a caretaker to look after the animals.\nMohammad Ali, a retired service-holder living in Mirpur, Dhaka, is unable to visit the cattle market due to his old-age complications and had to resort to buying a cow online for the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha.\n\"After getting to know about e-commerce, I bought a cow and have been relieved of the tension of rearing the cattle as the service provider will send it to my house before Eid day,\" said Ali.\nSome young tech-savvy entrepreneurs have made Eid easy for city dwellers like Ali.\nNow one can buy an animal sitting at home, without having to physically go to the cattle market. And the animal will be delivered to one's home from the farm.\nAt present, a number of e-commerce sites and meat processing companies are selling sacrificial cattle online and offering home delivery, in Dhaka. The cows are reared through animal husbandry and no fattening drug is used on them.\nAn expatriate Bangladeshi can now buy a sacrificial animal online for his family back home. For such purchases, he will have to pay through a recognised payment method and provide his home address.\n\"In today's busy life, people want things delivered to their doorstep. Considering these aspects, a few years back, we started an online service to sell sacrificial animals. Within a short period, the service has gained popularity,\" Ataur Rahman, CEO of www.amardeshamargram.com, said.\nHe continued: \"We have networks in different districts from where we collect products, as well as cattle for Eid-ul-Azha. This year we have collected animals from Narsingdi and Kishoreganj.\"\nHe said the supply of cow is lower than that of last year owing to the floods in the northern districts.\n[caption id=\"attachment_174364\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"690\"] Preview of an online cattle market  Collected [/caption]\nAtaur said they try to create a direct link with farmers in different districts online, which helps them get better prices for cattle.\nSome of the online shops offer unique facilities such as slaughter service and distribution to addresses mentioned by the customers.\nBengal Meat Processing Industries CEO AFM Asif said that although Bengal Meat usually provides processed meat, it has now introduced online cattle shopping, considering its popularity in the city.\nThis year Bengal Meat has put up 300 cows on its website and already over 100 of them have been sold. Last year, Bengal Meat had sold 150 cows.\nAsif said their cattle are reared under the supervision of registered veterinarians.\n\"The cattle are given natural feeds and health checks on regular basis to ensure supply of disease-free healthy cattle for Eid-ul-Azha,\" he said.\n\"For consumers, it is tough to visit farms. But by visiting our website one can choose and buy his/her cow for Qurbani,\" he said.\nBengal Meat also offers slaughter and meat processing services. The site www.upohar2me.com is another online portal which offers cows for sale and delivery.\n\"The rise in sales and involvement of new entrepreneurs in the online cattle marketplace is a positive sign for the emerging e-commerce sector,\" said Rajib Ahmed, president of E-Commerce Association of Bangladesh (ECAB).\n\"To bring more business through the e-commerce platform, the government must provide policy support,\" he said, pointing out it would also help in the progress of Digital Bangladesh.\nMeanwhile, some online shops are providing farmers with a chance to display their cows from where a consumer can choose and directly contact the farmers.\n\"We have displayed cows on bikroy.com and other online marketplaces. We are getting response from the buyers. It is a good place to sell,\" Mohammad Jalilur Rahman, a farmer in Ashulia, told the Dhaka Tribune.\nSalek Shahriyar, head of Marketing and Communication office of Crown Cement, said, as a service holder, it is difficult to manage time to go to the cattle market.\nOn other hand, involving an outsider in the buying process of animal is also troublesome, he said.\n\"But after being informed about the online marketplace, I decided to buy a cow for Eid-ul-Azha from online shops.\"\n\n\n\n\n"

It is a strategically important border district and came briefly under Chinese control during the 1962 war between the two neighbouring countries.\nThe Mi-17 V5, which is mainly used for military transport, is produced by Kazan Helicopters, a subsidiary of Russian helicopters.\nIndia's Air Force has a high rate of crashes owing to its ageing fleet. More than 170 pilots have lost their lives over the last three decades.\nMost of the accidents involve Soviet-era MIG planes, earning them the sobriquet \"flying coffins\".\nIn July, an IAF chopper crashed in the same state, killing three crew members and a soldier. That advanced light helicopter was on a rescue mission during devastating floods when it crashed due to inclement weather.\nLast year, a Russian-built AN-32 military transport plane went missing over the Bay of Bengal with 29 people on board.\nIn 2013, all 20 people on board an army helicopter were killed when it crashed in northern India.\nIndia, the world's largest arms importer, has been trying to revamp its ageing and outdated military aircraft, with some of the fleet virtually on its last legs.\nThe country has been trying to develop its own war planes but delays and technical shortcomings have marred progress.\n\n\n\n\n"

In the current fiscal year, the growth rate reached 7.4 %, despite damages and losses caused by flash floods across the country.\nThe government expects that the country's economic sector will face no major disruption due to political unrest in the next FY, despite the upcoming 11th general polls due to be held by early 2019.\n\"There will be nothing new or innovative in the budget as this is the last budget of our government's tenure,\" the finance minister said. \"But as we are optimistic that we will form the government again, we want that budget to be implemented.\"\nMuhith pointed out that the next fiscal year revenue collection growth rate will be 13%, while in this fiscal year it is only 11%.\nThe size of the Annual Development Programme fund is likely to be Tk 178,296 crore in the next fiscal year, an increase of Tk24,945 crore (16.28%) on the outlay this fiscal year.\nThe government plans to source 72.08% or Tk91,845 crore of the new budget deficit by borrowing from local banks and by using savings instruments.\nThe amount of borrowing from local resources is estimated to be at Tk52,900 crore. The budget of 2017-18 fiscal year set the target at Tk60,252 crore.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "headline": "Why are rice prices rising?",
      "authors": "Forrest Cookson",
      "text": "The rice price has increased significantly over the past year, and there is much discussion as to why this happened. A brief review of the rice market concepts: The farmer sells paddy to whoever buys it and this ends up at the rice millers. Of course a lot of rice is milled locally in small mills for consumption in rural areas. The price of paddy will vary with location and time but the paddy market is reasonably integrated. There is another price ex mill for milled rice. There will be variations of quality rices so this ex mill, wholesale price will cover a range of values. The urban wholesale markets will have prices slightly different that the ex mill price due to transportation and trade mark ups. Finally, there is a retail price, at which the consumer purchases the rice. It is this retail price for coarse rice that we will focus on as a representative price for the whole spectrum of prices for different rice types. All of these prices should move more or less together as if one gets too high demand will decline and the price will fall. The rice price in Bangladesh is closely connected to the Indian rice price. If the taka/rupee exchange rate and the import duties are stable then the Bangladesh price will track the Indian price. This will not be exact, but if the prices differ too much, rice will move across the border. There is always potential for movement of rice in the informal transport channels. This channel will move rice in either direction according to the price. There is really a single market for rice between India and Bangladesh and price variations are temporary and will be removed by this arbitrage of rice moving both in formal and informal transport channels. In July 2014, the price of coarse rice was Tk3.1 per kg, and fluctuated around Tk3 per kg during the year. The price declined slowly during the period July 2015 to June 2016 with the price fluctuating around Tk2.6 per kg. Government actions over the past year are correct: Explain that there is plenty of rice, import more rice, reduce the import duty Then the price increased rapidly from Tk2.6 per kg in July 2016 to Tk4 per kg by June 2017, an increase of 53%. An increase of that size will increase the urban CPI by 3% and the rural CPI by 12%. The official estimates however, do not indicate such increases. The typical explanation for this increase was the reduced availability of rice from the floods and the outbreak of blast disease. Other explanations were that the millers were not releasing milled rice into the market and that \"syndicates\" were withholding rice, driving the rice price higher. In Asia, the standard explanation for rising food prices is that the business men in the food chain are withholding food from the market, having formed a conspiracy to manipulate the price. The standard Asian government response is to attack the millers and the traders. To send government officials to markets to discover and discipline these monopoly \"blood suckers\" as they are usually known. This Kabuki ritual is performed every time there is a spike in the grain prices. Most of the time, no one takes this very seriously, but it gives everyone someone to blame.  Conspiracies involving many businessmen are impossible to maintain; in Bangladesh, a conspiracy with more than three persons soon becomes public knowledge. A few words about rice production and consumption   First, estimates from the BSS and the Ministry of Agriculture indicate that Bangladesh produces about 34 million mt of rice every year. The consumption is about 26 million mt. There is some retention of paddy. However about 15% of the rice crop is just lost in the process of milling or trading. The implication of this is that rice stocks at any time are typically 6-8 million mt. There is always quite a large amount of rice inside Bangladesh. There are supplies in every house, in every retail shop, on every farm as well as well as in the millers' warehouses. Bengal has had its share of crises over the rice price. Some of these have been disasters leading to famine. Some have led to widespread intervention in the rice economy. The research of Amartya Sen on Bengal famines sets out the reasons and authoritative explanation of these price crisis that have occurred from time to time. The reasoning emerged from a determination that even in the most terrible famine there was plenty of rice available. What drives the changes in rice prices is the expectation that prices are going to rise. When there is widespread belief that there is a shortage of rice and the price is going to rise, then the public reacts by buying more rice. This action results in higher prices. The expectations of the public are influenced by what is believed about the availability of rice and also by an individual's idea about what other people think. If you think that everyone believes the rice price is going up, then you buy more rice now even if you think that there is plenty of rice in the country. Sen has taught us that one should look to expectations when there are sharp price spikes. During this past year, there was widespread belief that there was a shortage of rice. This came from reporting on crop losses and low levels of rice in government stores. The amount of rice that might have been lost from floods was never more than 2-3 million mt and even this level is now probably proving too high. The government rice stores always get a lot of attention, but the level of stocks is less than 10% of production -- significant but not that important. In addition, there is always reporting about the efforts of the millers to withhold rice and drive the price up. All of this together generates expectations in the public that the price of rice is going to rise, and leads to increased stocks of rice being purchased and held everywhere. The higher demands arising from these expectations then increase the rice price. Government actions over the past year are correct: Explain that there is plenty of rice, import more rice, reduce the import duty. All of these actions may lead the public to change their expectations away from increasing prices. Ultimately, the rice prices will return to the level established by the Indian rice market price, the taka/rupee exchange rate and customs charges. Forrest Cookson is an American economist."

      "text": "\nCtg canals on their deathbed, 12 have vanished\n\n\n\n\nAnwar Hussain, Chittagong\n\n\n\n\n Published at 09:01 pm June 5th, 2017\n\n\n Last updated at 09:24 pm June 5th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nChittagong city saw at least 12 canals vanish in the last 48 years, during which time the waterlogging problem exacerbated.\nIn a recent survey, jointly conducted by Chittagong City Corporation and Chittagong Wasa to draft a drainage and sanitation master plan, a mere 22 canals were found to be emptying into the Karnaphuli River.\nHowever, there was no trace of 12 canals in the premier port city, the survey says.\nThe draft of this master plan plan will shortly be sent to the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development and Co-operatives for approval.\nJR Snell, a USA-based engineering firm, in a 1969 master plan on \"Storm Drainage and Flood Control Master Plan and Feasibility Report for Chittagong,\" had identified 34 canals.\nThe canals, stretching from Kalurghat Bridge to Naval Academy, had been found with their outlets flowing to the Karnaphuli.\nEngineer Ali Ashraf, a Chittagong-based city planner, attributed the canal disappearances to mindless encroachment.\n\"Unfortunately, eight of the 22 existing canals are dying. The ones that have vanished can easily be reclaimed following a Revision Survey. These should be restored and the dying ones should be taken care of immediately to address the waterlogging problem,\" he said.\n[caption id=\"attachment_67330\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"795\"] This April 2, 2017 file photo shows that soil has filled parts of Mirza Khal in Chandgaon, Chittagong city. Indiscriminate hill cutting causes soil to wash down with the rainwater and fill drains and nearby water bodies Rabin Chowdhury/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nDied out, grabbed canals worsen waterlogging\nUnlike other cities in the country, Chittagong is gifted with a natural drainage system, having a long network of canals, to drain out storm water to the rivers and the Bay of Bengal.\nHowever, nearly a third of the city goes underwater every monsoon while its southern part gets inundated during high tides even with no rainfall.\nCity planners blame unplanned urbanisation, illegal refilling and encroachment of canals and drains for obstructing the free flow of water.\nAll sorts of solid wastes worsen the situation, especially in the rainy season, they say.\nMoreover, due to indiscriminate hill cutting in the city, soil is washed down with rainwater and fills drains and nearby water bodies, causing water stagnation.\nAccording to the draft, major canals lost 42% carrying capacity due to siltation, with 87% of the existing silt traps being dysfunctional. Existing tertiary drains cover only 45% of the total drainage area.\n\"The proposed master plan does not concretely mention any reclaiming of the vanished canals,\" lamented Ali Ashraf, and said that policymakers consider water congestion a transient problem, instead of a serious issue.\n\"The policymakers take up one plan after another, caring little for their implementation,\" he alleged.\nArchitect Zarina Hossain said: \"Open spaces, including the canals, used for retaining rainwater or storm water, are disappearing fast in the city. But the government agencies are failing to stop the building of illegal structures in these open spaces.\"\nCommodore Zulfiquar Aziz, member (engineering) of Chittagong Port Authority, said: \"Even a light shower floods the city due to a lack of adequate water bodies necessary to retain storm water.\n\"Thus, the existing water bodies and open spaces should be preserved somehow,\" he said.\n[caption id=\"attachment_67331\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"793\"] City planners blame unplanned urbanisation, illegal refilling, garbage accumulation, and encroachment of drains and canals, as is the case at Mirza Khal, for obstructing the free flow of water Rabin Chowdhury/Dhaka Tribune[/caption]\nThe city mayor as well admitted that waterlogging in the city had taken a severe turn.\nAddressing a programme on May 11, Chittagong City Corporation Mayor AJM Nasir Uddin said: \"Illegal structures have been built over the years, eating up the canals. Moreover, the indiscriminate dumping of solid waste has also worsened the situation.\"\nPinning the blame partially on unplanned urbanisation, he then bemoaned the fact that the master plan of Chittagong Development Authority (CDA) remained unimplemented even after 22 years as no mention was made of which organisation would execute it.\nThis master plan had been drafted in 1995 to develop the drainage system in five phases by 2015, but in vain.\nMeanwhile, at a civic dialogue in May this year, Shahinul Islam, CDA chief town planner, said they often have to face pressure from the politicians when removing the illegal structures.\n\"The waterlogging problem will reduce significantly if the illegal structures are pulled down from the canals,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Hurricane Maria churned toward the Turks and Caicos on Friday after lashing Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands with winds and rain that destroyed homes, flooded streets, crippled economies and left at least 32 people dead. Maria is the second major hurricane to hit the Caribbean this month and the strongest storm to hit the US territory of Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years. It knocked out the island's power and several rivers hit record flood levels. At least 15 people were killed in Puerto Rico, El Nuevo Dia newspaper reported. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello told cable TV news channel CNN he had reports of at least 13 people on the island being killed. Fourteen deaths were reported on the island nation of Dominica, which has a population of about 71,000. Two others were killed in the French territory of Guadeloupe and one on the US Virgin Islands. The death toll in the Caribbean is likely to rise when searches resume at daybreak. Rossello imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew through Saturday for the island's 3.4 million people. He said about 700 people have been rescued from floodwaters and communication was difficult with the southeastern part of the island. US President Donald Trump told reporters the island had been \"totally obliterated\" and he planned to visit.  Puerto Rico was already facing the largest municipal debt crisis in US history. Maria is a Category 3 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, with sustained winds of up to 205kph. It was 55km east-northeast of Grand Turk Island as of 0900 GMT, the US National Hurricane Centre said. It was forecast to bring storm surges of up to 12 feet to the southeastern Bahamas as well as the Turks and Caicos, it said, adding that a gradual weakening was forecast for the next 48 hours as it heads north in the Atlantic Ocean. Maria was expected to bring as much as 40 inches of rain to Puerto Rico and an island-wide flash flood watch was in effect. Between eight and 16 inches of rain was expected on Turks and Caicos, which could cause flash floods and mudslides, the NHC said. Utility crews from the US mainland headed to Puerto Rico to help restore the power grid and the US military sent ground forces and aircraft to assist with search and rescue. More than two months remain in the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30."

      "text": "\nIn DR Congo, fight for sanitation is also a fight for dignity\n\n\n\n\nAFP\n\n\n\n\n Published at 03:52 am November 19th, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nFrom crouching over a small hole with a sheet for privacy to defecating in the open air, for millions of people in the Democratic Republic of Congo going to the toilet is a daily act of misery.\nThe UN has estimated more than 2.4 billion people worldwide are in a similar situation, with Sunday's World Toilet Day planned to raise awareness.\nThe vast majority of DR Congo's more than 70 million residents do not have access to \"improved\" toilets - latrines, sewerage or cesspits that hygienically separate human waste from human contact, according to the United Nations children's agency Unicef.\nThe problem has become even more pressing this year as the huge African country wrestles with a resurgence of cholera.\nKnown as a \"dirty hands disease\" for the way in which faecal germs are transmitted, there have been more than 44,000 suspected cases of cholera and nearly 900 deaths so far this year, compared with 29,000 cases in 2016, according to World Health Organisation (WHO) figures.\nIn the capital Kinshasa, the quality of toilets varies greatly depending on social status - islands of wealth thrive in the city of 10 million amid an ocean of poverty.\nRunning water and clean toilets are the norm in Gombe, a wealthy district home to the presidential palace, embassies, ministries, business headquarters, expats and the city's wealthiest citizens.\nBut it is a very different story in the other 25 districts of \"Kin-la-Belle\" (Kin the Beautiful), as Kinshasa was once known - and which some locals now derisively call \"Kin-la-Poubelle\" (Kin the Rubbish Bin).\nIn the district of Matete, Junior, 25, does not complain much about the toilet block built in the yard, away from the family house.\nThere is no running water, but it does have a tap and a bucket to clean the toilet, as well as an adjoining shower with white tile walls and an only slightly blackened ceramic floor.\nWastewater and excrement are collected under a concrete slab in a pit, which is emptied by a service every two or three years.\n\"It's not luxury, but it's a bit clean,\" said Junior.\n'We suffer here'\nConditions are very different for neighbours living on the edge of a rubbish dump just a few streets away - and several rungs down DRC's implacable social ladder.\nHere, a clean, decent flushing toilet only exists in dreams.\n\"We suffer here. If it rains, it floods the slab. The toilets overflow. The waste floods into the house,\" said an angry young father in front of his toilet block. The contents of the latrine can be seen through the concrete slab.\nAnother toilet, next to an outdoor place of worship, is a simple hole dug in the ground, protected from view by some corrugated iron and a sheet.\nAccording to residents, the sewage runs into a river that flows between Matete and a military camp. On both sides of the water is a mountain of rubbish.\n\"Sooner or later, there will be people who get cholera. For the moment we suffer from typhoid,\" says theology student Nadine Bondo.\nIn rural areas of DR Congo, where 60 percent of the population lives, the situation is even worse.\nOpen-air defecation remains a cause of disease, according to Unicef, which started a programme for sanitation in schools and villages, such as Kisthini, 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Kinshasa.\n\"Before, we were cleaning our toilets in an outdated way. We dug small holes. Now, the notions of sanitation and hygiene are ingrained in the students,\" says the deputy head of the school in Kisthini.\n\n\n\n\n"

A type of rice's price had shot up to Tk43 from Tk38. However, now it has come down.\"\nHe said: \"Prices of rice and paddy are not the same. Why cannot the government see that? We could not provide rice to the government in the last Aman season. At that time, paddies were priced at Tk23 and rice at Tk33. How do we incur this much loss? Millers agree to face a 50-paisa loss, but how can they incur a loss of Tk3 to Tk4. So, why would the mill owners be blamed for the imbalanced prices set by policymakers and the government?\"\n\"The prices of paddies are higher than rice in the market. Hence, we could not supply rice to the government warehouses. We had asked the government to give us an incentive, but to no avail. So, we could not supply rice. How can we do so while suffering losses?\" Layek said.\nHe blamed the imbalanced prices of paddies and rice set by the government for the crisis.\nGovernment should take responsibility for the rising rice prices\nBangla Tribune Planning Editor Nazrul Kabir blamed the government's dependency on import for the price hike of rice. \"Due to the emphasis on import, mill owners expressed discontent and raised the prices as well. The government should take responsibility for this.\"\nHe said: \"At a press conference, the food minister said the media has increased the rice prices but one doth the scathe, another hath the scorn. Kawsar Alam Khan also did the same by blaming the retailers for the price hike.\"\nNazrul further added: \"It is not right to hold one accountable for another's deed. Even when the government was providing rice at Tk10 per kg, the price in the market rose to Tk70. The government must take responsibility for this too.\"\nHe said: \"Importers predict the rice crisis. Every business sector has an exclusive group who creates a syndicate and therefore increases the price of goods to make more profit. It is the common people who then come under the pressure of the soaring prices.\"\nIn order to reduce the prices, Nazrul said the government and rice traders will have to work together to find solutions and take actions.\nRetailers not reducing prices\nKawsar Alam Khan, vice-president of Bangladesh Rice Merchant Association, claimed that retailers were the ones who were not curbing the prices. \"I myself had to sell rice at higher prices. I sell rice at the wholesale level. How will the retailers manage to sell rice at lower prices then? They are the ones who push up the prices.\"\nHe said: \"The retailers used to make a Tk1 profit in one kg of rice. But they currently make a profit ranging from Tk3 to Tk5 per kg. These retailers are not reducing the prices.\"\nThough no crisis, rice worth Tk38 is being sold at Tk52\nBangla Tribune Business In-Charge Shafiqul Islam told the discussion that the only rice crisis the market saw was during the flood in the haor areas in early March. \"Rice traders had taken advantage of that situation. But there is no crisis right now. Yet the rice, which is worth Tk38 is now being sold at Tk52.\"\n\"However, as a journalist, I have found out is that the rice prices have started to decline at the wholesale level, which is good news.\"\nHe said: \"After the flood affected the haor areas and the crisis begun, rice mill owners like Abdur Rashid and Layek Ali stopped supplying rice to the government warehouses. Maybe they have rice hoarded in their warehouses. Maybe they slowly supplied from that stock to the market and raised the prices gradually.\"\nShafiqul continued: \"Soaring rice prices also impacts the other daily essentials and leads to instability in both the market and society. This year's price hike is unprecedented in Bangladesh's history and has badly affected the society. The Food Ministry is also responsible for failing to control the hike when it started following the rice crisis caused by the flood in the haor areas.\"\nAddressing Commerce Secretary Shubhashish, he said: \"The government alone can figure out the reasons behind the price hike and the solutions. Deploy monitoring teams to the markets and have them only check the vouchers, you will easily find out the rates rice are being bought and sold at. Only the government can stop the price hike and it needs to step in to solve the crisis.\"\nRice prices slightly down at wholesale markets\nAccording to Commerce Secretary Shubhashish Bose, the prices at wholesale markets have somewhat dropped. \"But that is not the case in retail markets. We have had a meeting at the Food Ministry in this regard. We have also decided on several steps to reduce the prices.\"\n\nHe said: \"Even though the Food Ministry was supposed to reserve some rice, not much was stored. Since we have been producing various other crops for past few years and did not encounter any natural disasters, we were not worried about storing rice. Compared to the government's target, more rice is usually produced.\"\nRegarding the price hike of rice, Shubhashish said: \"Illegitimate hoarding of rice is responsible for this. Even though there is a policy on storing grains, nobody followed the rules.\"\nFlood in haor areas spurred rice price hike\nExplaining the cause of the rice price hike, Bangladesh Rice Mill Association Chairman Abdur Rashid said: \"The unwanted truth is the rice prices are soaring. The crisis started because of the immense loss of paddy in the floods in the haor region. As the haor region only produces coarse rice, the current crisis is basically for those types of rice, which has also made coarse rice import necessary. That's why rice prices are going up. \"\n\"The government is informed about the price hike. Though the importers were given special facilities to bring in more rice to tackle the crisis, they kept the rice shipments for a few days at the land ports in the borders and delivered late. Consequently, those special facilities did not help,\" he added.\n\"Prices of the coarse rice have only increased, as there is no crisis of fine rice. But the prices will not go beyond control. The government needs to figure out the right policies to tackle the crisis and bring down the prices. Only the government can solve this,\" Rashid further added.\n\n\n\n\n"

He also denied that 5,000 hostages held by the group had been freed.\nBoko Haram, whose attacks have increased since the end of the rainy season in late 2016, wants to create a state adhering to a strict interpretation of Islamic laws in northeast Nigeria.

His removal consolidates the crown prince's control of the kingdom's security institutions.\nTo analysts, Prince Mohammed's meteoric rise has seemed almost Shakespearean in its aggression and calculation. In June, he edged out a 58-year-old cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, to become heir to the throne.\nAt the time, Saudi television channels showed the bearded Prince Mohammed kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence. Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities.\nAlready viewed as the de facto ruler controlling all the major levers of government, from defence to the economy, the prince is widely seen to be stamping out traces of internal dissent before a formal transfer of power from his 81-year-old father King Salman.\nAt the same time, he has projected himself as a liberal reformer in the ultra-conservative kingdom with a series of bold moves including the decision allowing women to drive from next June.\nForeign diplomats predict that Prince Mohammed, set to be the first millennial to occupy the Saudi throne, could well be in control of Saudi Arabia for at least half a century.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "\nAuthorities all over the world are continuously justifying their wrongdoings in the name of the greater good. This time, the Sundarbans has become the victim of that notion. \nThe mangrove forest is about to be sacrificed in the name of the greater good but at a price that we cannot afford. It was not long ago that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina strongly accused developed countries for their contribution to global warming and urged them to compensate the sufferers, ie developing countries like Bangladesh, but now she has signed the death verdict on the Sundarbans. \nThe human race has been honoured with the highest dignity not just because of its independent thinking but for its ability to take care of wildlife, nature and the environment. \nBut the intentional destruction of the Sundarbans is not only a suicidal move, it is also a violation of natural laws. It will make Bangladesh more vulnerable than we can imagine. \nThe Sundarbans, shared by Bangladesh and India, and the largest mangrove forest in the world, is an enclosure for the coastal areas and gives the country protection from major natural calamities, such as past hurricanes like Sidr and Aila. \nIt is enriched with huge natural resources and is a safe-house of diverse wildlife. Most importantly, it is a natural holder of the ecological balance and our ecosystem. It provides livelihood to a great number of local inhabitants. \nIn spite of all this, the government is advancing to install a coal-based thermal power plant of 1,320 MW capacity which will occupy almost 768 hectares of land and is barely 9km away from the Sundarbans. \nThough, the government is considering this as a safe distance, the partner of this project, India, has passed its own law where they are not allowed to install such plants within the 25km radius of forests in their territory. Ironically, they are doing just that in our homeland and our government is acting like our resources belong to India, not to us. \nIf this plant is installed, a huge amount of coal will be transported through the Possur River. The noise pollution and other waste produced from the plant will damage the biodiversity substantially. \nThe fish in the confluence of the rivers will face extinction. The area will become uninhabitable, and the air will be so polluted that no living creature will be able to breathe there. \nThe water of the rivers will be contaminated. The climate, topography, faunal and floral diversity will be destroyed. Allegedly, the materials which will be used in the plant contain hazardous chemicals such as sulphur, carbon dioxide, cadmium, radium, arsenic, lead, mercury and nickel.  \nThese toxic chemicals could affect the health of the inhabitants, even those living in government-certified safe areas. According to rough estimations, this plant will immediately displace about 5,000 families from their land. \nA large number of forest-dependent poor people like honey-collectors and fishermen will get unemployed. The Sundarbans is a tourist attraction, a sector which will take a hit once the project starts. \nMany studies have already been done by different think-tanks, researchers and journalists but no one could credibly claim that the benefit of this plant will outweigh the costs. \nIt is true that our demand will increase day by day, but that does not mean that we should destroy all our natural treasures just to satiate our demands. There are many other viable options to produce energy. \nSolar power, windmills and biogas are options. The Sundarbans are unique and irreplaceable. As a lower riparian country and with low lands, we are vulnerable to coastal floods, cyclones and hurricanes. Without the Sundarbans our people cannot survive. \nWe Bangladeshis are very good at seeing the near future and short-term benefits which cause us to lag behind other nations. It is high time we gained some wisdom. We must act before it is too late. \nProtesters of the initiative have been labelled \"impractical\" and \"anti-development\" by ministers and government advisers. \nOther than the Hasina administration, not a single person has supported the idea of generating power at the cost of the destruction of the Sundarbans. This project will bring no benefit to our unborn generations, and the Sundarbans is not just an asset of Bangladesh, it belongs to the world. \nIt is a world heritage site and the home of the world-famous endangered Royal Bengal Tiger. I implore all Bangladeshis as well as the world community to not turn a blind eye on this issue, but to listen to their conscience. \nThis is a time of moral crisis.\n "

      "headline": "Decoding the Bangladesh Paradox",
      "authors": "Jyoti Rahman",
      "text": "\nBangladesh is getting quite the attention from the world. But unlike the seventies and eighties, not for the catastrophes - natural or man-made - alone. Though, its rather sensational political upheavals aided by frequent fatalities - some of which are sometimes caused by sheer negligence - still flash through the media almost routinely, there also emerge some extraordinary, unusual success stories from the very same country - such as its impressive progress in a number of human development indicators or its consistent GDP growth amid political turmoil. \nJust as the catastrophes, these stories not only evoke emotion but are also analysed by the media. As though, they unearth a Bangladesh Paradox. Yet, perhaps a focussed research effort can crack the paradox. \n\"The macroeconomic fact is, in the last decade, under all three governments, per capita GDP have grown by around 4.5% a year. At that rate, average real (that is, inflation-adjusted) income doubles in 16 years ... This is impressive stuff, for which every recent government deserves some credit.\" \nThat's the conclusion from the article on real GDP per capita growth under different governments. Of course, real GDP per capita is a means to the end, not the end in itself. What we really care more about is the standard of living that higher real GDP per capita entails - that is, it's the development record, and not just the growth, under different governments that we want to know. \nThis, however, raises two questions. First, how do we attribute to any particular government the growth and development record when policies under any particular government are likely to have long-term consequences? And second, how do we explain the Bangladesh Paradox: \n\"The belief that growth brings development with it - the 'Washington consensus' - is often criticised on the basis that some countries have had good growth but little poverty reduction. Bangladesh embodies the inverse of that: it has had disproportionate poverty reduction for its amount of growth.\" \nThat quote is from a November 2012 Economist article. That article, and accompanying editorial, had a go at explaining the paradox. Dhaka Tribune's Joseph Allchin had a crack more recently in the NY Times. The suspects are usual: garments, remittance, NGOs. But we economists are a parsimonious lot, or so we like to think. \nWe would like to know exactly what contribution each of these factors made, what was the channel through which the factors affected growth and development, what role, if any, did government policy play, and what all that means for future. \nI haven't seen a comprehensive analysis of the Bangladesh Paradox. And no, I am not going to provide the answer in this article. Rather, here is a research agenda on how to analyse the Paradox. \nLet's recap the Paradox with the \"Wealth and Health\" Table from the Economist. \nThe first thing to explore is whether Bangladesh is compared with an appropriate benchmark? Is it that Bangladesh has done better with its growth and income, or is it India (or Pakistan) that is the exception? \nThe Economist notes that Bangladesh has a few features that India or Pakistan lacks: \n\"Because of its poverty, it has long been a recipient of vast amounts of aid. With around 150m people crammed into a silted delta frequently swept by cyclones and devastating floods, it is the most densely populated country on Earth outside city states. Hardly any part is isolated by distance, tradition or ethnicity, making it easier for anti-poverty programmes to reach everyone. Unusually, it has a culture that is distinct from its religion: although most Bangladeshis are Muslims, their culture and language are shared with the non-Muslim Indian state of West Bengal. Religious opposition to social change has been mild.\" \nHas Bangladesh received more aid per capita than other poor countries? How does Bangladesh's growth-development trajectory compare with other densely populated monsoon deltas - say, countries along the Mekong? Or perhaps, Bangladesh should not be compared with India and Pakistan as a whole, but with the four Pakistani provinces and 32 Indian states? \nDoes a paradox remain if the comparators change? Does Bangladesh still perform better in terms of development/living standard given its growth/level of income? A proper research agenda would answer these questions first. Suppose the answer is yes, that the Paradox still remains, its resolution will rest on a two-part investigation. \nThe first part would explore the GDP story in detail. That Bangladesh does better given its GDP does not make GDP irrelevant. Quite the contrary. Bangladesh was a wretchedly poor place until the 1980s. It's not a coincidence that things started getting better as the economy started accelerating. We would want to know what is it about the GDP growth process that may have contributed to the development in a relatively favourable manner. \nWhat do we know about the growth story of the past few decades? From a strictly growth accounting perspective, we know that while favourable demographic transition and female workforce participation have helped, it is multifactor productivity that explains the GDP acceleration.  \nFrom a sectoral perspective, we know that agriculture's share of the economy has shrunk, that of manufacturing has risen, and services have become more productive. And we know the particular industry that has led the charge - readymade garments. \nSo far, this seems like a straightforward export-led, manufacturing-driven growth story a la our neighbours to the east and north. \nYet, it's not so clear-cut when we look at the expenditure side of GDP. Unlike the Asian fast industrialisers, Bangladesh has not experienced an investment boom. In fact, low private investment relative to GDP may be the single most important problem facing the country's economy. \nOf course, why investment hasn't grown is a question that needs further exploration - and the answers will have obvious policy implications. But is there something to the consumption pattern as well? Particularly, have remittance and microcredit affected consumption above and beyond what would be implied by wages growth coming from industrialisation? \nIn addition to the macro trend, do industrialisation, remittance and microcredit interact in a way that have microeconomic - that is, household and firm level - impact favouring consumption over investment even after accounting for various market and government failures that inhibit investment? \nWhat am I getting at here? Well, how about a stylised, and very speculative, story along this line -- while RMG has meant women entering the formal workforce, migrant worker boom has sent a lot of risk-taking men overseas; aided by the NGOs and microcredit, households have smoothed consumption and invested in human capital of their children; but they have not invested in physical capital, avoided entrepreneurial activities, and have not pushed for a more investment-friendly polity. \nWe would want to explore this story further. We would also want to explore the income side of GDP, and tie it into a political economy analysis. \nThe remittance boom, for example, should see the labour share of the economy rise. Of course, the question is, what happens to the money that is remitted back? It's reasonable to assume that unskilled labourers are from the poorer parts of the society. \nSo, in the first instance, any remittance back to the villages is a good thing in that it reduces the direst type of poverty -- that is it stops things like famine or malnutrition. But what happens after that? My tentative hunch is that a lot of remittance has been saved but not invested in a productive way, rather they ended up fuelling land/stock prices - this is an area that needs to be explored in detail. \nWhat about the RMG boom? Theoretically, proceeds of the manufacturing boom should accrue to both labour and capital. Has that happened? Has the process of distribution been dynamic or static? Here, by dynamic I mean whether the industries are going up the value chain - from the cheapest t-shirts to more expensive designer brands to leather and other fancier fashion items to toys to cheap electronics to expensive electronics to stuff that requires more skilled labour. If the process has been dynamic, then we should expect less tension between labour and capital, because both wages and profits rise over time. \nIn addition to the detailed exploration of the growth process, the research agenda will need to focus on the factors that explain the development above and beyond what might be expected from the growth itself. \nAs a starting point, let's take the four factors listed by the Economist: government spending and policies on social programmes that assisted family planning and empowered women; the green revolution; remittance; and NGOs. \nLet's think about these factors in a systematic way. The \"Fertility in Bangladesh\" graph from the Economist illustrates the female empowering social transformation. But how important has the government, and NGO, interventions been relative to the advent of the RMG sector. As far as girls' education is concerned, Mushfiq Mobarak of Yale finds the garments made the difference (this is a subject of a detailed post). We would like to see the relative impacts of industrialisation, direct government policies, and NGO activities analysed across various metrics. \nThe green revolution is a relatively straight-forward story, and remittance we have discussed above. In addition, we would want to know how, if at all, the impact of these factors have changed (and is likely to change) in a more rapidly urbanising Bangladesh. \nFinally, we would want to analyse the economics and political economy of the NGOs - what the Economist calls the \"magic ingredient.\" \nLarge NGOs such as BRAC are as much business conglomerates as philanthropies. In fact, the Economist compared BRAC to Korean chaebols. Is that a reasonable comparison? Do we understand the microeconomics of NGOs? Does our view of Bangladesh Paradox change at all if we viewed these NGOs as little different from Korean or Japanese business houses at comparable stages of development? And what about the impact of the NGOs on public finance, and indeed the state's capacity to build institutions in general? \nNeedless to say, this is a pretty ambitious research agenda. But it's hardly impossible. Is there anyone out there to tackle this?"

      "text": "\n\"Are you from Bangladesh?\" a very humble Indian delegate from Hyderabad, coming to attend the ongoing South Asian Conference on Sanitation in Kathmandu, during a tea break, asks me in Urdu. \n\"Yes, I am, but how did you know I was from Bangladesh?\" I ask curiously, in English. \n\"I saw you asking questions during the civil society meeting. I was sitting at the back. Those were interesting questions,\" he tells me, again in Urdu. \nI understood his first question, but I had a little difficulty to get the full meaning of his second question. \"I don't speak Urdu,\" I tell him. \n\"Why, don't Bangladeshis speak Urdu?\" he seems quite appalled, adding, this time in English: \"I thought all Bangladeshis speak Urdu.\" \nIt's now my turn to be appalled. I keep quiet, staring at him with eyebrows raised. \"Where did you learn that Bangladeshis speak Urdu!?\" I ask with a tinge of anger in my voice. \n\"I always thought Bangladeshis speak Urdu in their country,\" he says innocently. \n\"But we speak Bangla, we've always spoken Bangla, it's our mother's language. How come you missed that information?\" I ask him, this time not with anger. \nHe turns quite apologetic and says: \"I'm really sorry, I never knew about the language about Bangladesh, no one has ever told me. The information about you we get all the time are about politics, garments and cricket.\" \nI become more curious, suspicious whether he knows that Bangladesh is an independent country. \n\"But you must be knowing that we are an independent country,\" I inquire. \nHe gives a blushing smile and says: \"Yes, that I know, of course, but I didn't know about your language. It can happen; can't it?\" \n\"Of course, it can happen,\" I continue my conversation. \"Have you ever heard of International Mother Language Day?\" I keep pressing.  \n\"No, I didn't. No one actually knows about it where I live,\" he admits, with an inquisitive body language. \nI start telling him the whole story of how the process of our independence had started with the language movement in 1952. He listens to me for about ten minutes and expresses his admiration. \n\"I'm sorry brother, it's my failure that I didn't know about this great history all these years,\" he tells me. \n\"No, no, it's nothing to do with you. It's our inability that we couldn't let the world know about our magnificent history,\" I tell him submissively. \nBack in my hotel room, when all plenary sessions ended, the episode with my fellow summiteer kept on haunting me. I really had no idea that a person from South Asia, and that too from a bordering country, wouldn't know that we speak Bangla in Bangladesh. \nDid we actually fail to let the world know about the origin of our independence? The world knows about our politics, our garment industry and our cricket, but not everybody knows about our language, our birth! \nOne may ask: Why should everybody have to know about the history about your language movement? True. There are a zillion things on earth that a billion people don't know about. Well, I accept that, but when I find a man from our nearest neighbour wouldn't know that we speak Bangla in a Bangla land, it hurts. \nWith the note, the question also crossed my mind as to what actually we, as Bengalis, as many other nations do, have communicated about ourselves to the people of the world. We've only transmitted negativism with our own actions in the last forty-two years. \nExcept for floods, hunger, political violence etc, we haven't really upheld ourselves so that the world would cheer us. \nCommunication is so far the best tool that nation-states have used for spreading their message across. We have so many success stories: Our family planning programme, our sanitation reach in South Asia and our agriculture are the examples for many countries to emulate. \nOn top of everything, there's no match in the entire world with our language movement. But we haven't spread the information of what we nationally call \"our pride.\" \nThe people, like my fellow summiteer, who don't know about our glorious practices, aren't to be blamed for not knowing. It's we who couldn't make us heard in the global arena, it's we who are keeping ourselves from improving our image, it's we who are fighting against each other and it's we who don't let things happen for us."

      "text": "\nThousands of people living inside the Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra (DND) dam areas do not see an easy way out of the water-logging that makes their life unbearable in monsoon. \nThe chronic problem this year began even before, with the cyclone Mahasen that caused heavy rains in Dhaka too. \nMany roads, fields and other open spaces in the area went under ankle to waist-deep water like the past because of the downpour, causing immense sufferings to the residents of the area. \nPeople living inside the DND embankment area expressed dissatisfaction over the role of the Bangladesh Water Development Board, which is the responsible state-run organisation to maintain the DND dam. \nMoin Uddin, a freedom fighter who now runs a grocery shop at Sarulia Bazar, said it is the WDB's responsibility to drain stagnant water out of the area. \n\"But this year WDB has not taken any additional step to pump out the excess water even after days of heavy rainfall,\" he said. \nNot to mention about putting in place additional equipment in time of need, WDB does not even have all its existing pumps ready to be used. Maiz Uddin Miah, a resident of East Dogair said, \"WDB has four pumps and now they use three. One is out of order.\" \nThe WDB announced a long time back that they would set up another pump in Pagla area, but they forgot about it as usual, he recalled. \nMaiz Uddin alleged the pumps are old and poorly maintained, and they are not capable of draining huge amount of water after a heavy rainfall. Wastes and water hyacinth clog the mouth of pumps as well as canals, he added. \n\"Fish farms have mushroomed near the WDB pump stations. These enclosures also contribute to water-logging inside DND area,\" he said. \nEncroachment is also common. Unauthorised structures, built by local influential over the years, also blocked natural flow of water and led to water-logging. Local people know them, but their voice is too feeble to be heard by authorities. \nWhen local MP Habibur Rahman Mollah visited some waterlogged area earlier this week, local residents requested him to take step to remove illegal buildings that block water flow. He renewed the assurance, which was never materialised. \nLatifa Begum, a field worker of Sarulia Union Health and Family Welfare, trudges through water every day between home and work. Like all others living in the area, she accepts the suffering as no remedy is in sight. \n\"Water-logging has become a regular feature in the whole DND area in monsoon. We are facing this every year, so we are used to this situation.\" \nThere was no major rainfall in the last few days. But roads and open spaces in areas inside the DND dam, including Matuail, Konapara Pora Dogair, Mogholpara, Rasulpur, Dholesshar, Adarshapara, Sarulia, Dogair, Deillah, Munsibagh, Baghmara, Boxonagar, Sarulia Bahir Tengra, Kandapara and Mredhabari were seen under water even on Tuesday.  \nLocal people said water-logging this year began since the Mahasen that caused incessant rains in Dhaka as well.\nMost of the areas looked like stagnant ponds, making every day life of thousands of people miserable. In some places rickshaws and vans are the only mode of transports. CNG run-auto rickshaws, cars and other motorized vehicles do not ply there. \nWhile everybody points finger at the WDB, the agency has also a point to make--shortage of fund. \nRuhul Amin, Executive Engineer of WDB (Dhaka O&M Division- 1) told the Dhaka Tribune, \"Every year the government sanctions Tk 15-20 million (1.5 to 2 crore) for drainage work, but this year the amount is less than the previous year's allocation.\" \nThe water official however said the government has taken an initiative to solve water-logging and end the suffering of thousands of people living in the DND area. \nA feasibility study was done back in April 2010 and the report was submitted to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) in November 2011, he informed. \n\"But it was returned from ECNEC for lack of fund from the government fund and still it is waiting for sufficient fund,\" he said. \nLocal MP Habibur Rahaman Mollah came to WDB's defence saying the agency has been trying to clear the logged water from inside DND dam. Huge amount of logged water has already been pumped out, he informed. \n\"People too have some faults. Some residents dump waste in canals. Few people have encroached on canals and open spaces. Most of the canals are filled in. So heavy rains lead to water-logging for long,\" he said. \n\"We have been trying to free all canals to ensure smooth flow of water out of the areas,\" he told the Dhaka Tribune on Tuesday. \nThe ruling party lawmaker said he was aware of the fact that the ECNEC did not approve a development project for DND area, but did not know why. \nWDB high officials said the government had implemented a Tk130 million (13 crore) project from 2006 to 2009 to improve the drainage system. \nThe DND project was executed during 1962-68 as Flood Control Drainage and Irrigation (FCDI) project primarily to protect Dhaka and Narayanganj towns from floods, and to save croplands from overflowing rivers. It was then a part of an exclusive irrigation project aimed at achieving self-reliance in food grains production. \nBut the area continued to develop as an unplanned residential area after the country's independence, with lower middle income people buying land and building homes haphazardly. \nThe trend gained pace after the 1988 flood, inviting more people inside the dam area. As a result most of the agricultural land was transformed into residential, small business or even heavy industrial zone without any plan."

      "text": "\nTwo women including a mother and a daughter were killed in a mudslide in Chittagong early Sunday, following a heavy overnight downpour. \nThe incident occurred at the Tankir Pahar area of Lalkhan Bazar in Chittagong around 5:30am. \nFatema Begum, aged 35, and Kulsum Begum, aged 15, worked for the local Four H Garment factory and lived in a semi-pucca house at the Akbar's Colony. \nThe accident was the latest addition to the long list of deaths caused by hill-slope erosion during monsoon in the port city. \nAn eyewitness, who was a victim of the mudslide and was rescued later, gave a graphic account of the tragedy. \nShahnaj Akhter, a tea seller living next door to the victims, told the Dhaka Tribune she was inside her hut and making breakfasts around 5:15am, when she heard the sound of heavy objects falling nearby. \nShe dashed out and saw a large chunk of earth made of mud and rocks coming downhill. \n\"I came out and saw a large mass of mud falling on the roof of Fatema's residence. They were sleeping inside.\" \n\"I was literally petrified. My first reaction was to shout for help and I did. I heard them scream and writhe inside the house. Fatema was shouting 'save us, save us.' \n\"She managed to say that a couple of times before another mass of mud fell over them and silenced them. There was no more sounds afterward,\" said Shahnaj, in tears. \nSoon Shahnaj herself was also trapped under muds but was fortunate enough to have averted a fatal injury. \nLater, locals together with fire service officials recovered Shahnaj and the two dead bodies from under the debris. \nAkbar, who owns the colony, couldn't be found immediately for comments. His family members, however, claimed he had been admitted to hospital with illness.  \nJasim Uddin, a deputy assistant director of Fire Service and Civil Defence Headquarters of Chittagong, said the erosion was a result of heavy overnight rain. \nThere was another colony uphill, owned by a traffic policeman named Belayet, around 20 feet above the ground where the deceased mother and daughter resided. \n\"The large chunks of mud came down from that colony and killed the two women. The entire area is at risk now. The same incident can happen again if preventive measures, such as evacuating those in danger, are not taken,\" he said.   \nAfter the incident, Additional Deputy Commissioner (revenue) of Chittagong MAH Humayun Kabir and city mayor M Manjur Alam visited the spot. \nHumayun Kabir said the district administration had already ordered hill-slope residents to evacuate the area and settle in safer places. \n\"We will take measures in this regard, but people should be aware of the perils associated to living on the slopes,\" he said. \nIn this regard, Manjur Alam, the mayor, told the Dhaka Tribune: \"We are working to rehabilitate the people living in risky hill areas in the port city.\" \nThe district administration has announced a condolence fund of Tk40,000 to be handed over to the relatives of the deceased, sources said.  \nAccording to locals, Akbar's Colony was built 25 years ago. In 1995, four people died in mudslide in the same area where Fatema and his daughter lived and died on Sunday. \nAt least 180 people were killed in mudslide in Chittagong in the last seven years. Of them, 127 people died on June 11, 2007 - the largest death toll from mudslide in Bangladesh. \nAccording to Chittagong district administration, there are 13 risky hills in the city and about 5000 families living there. \nRecently, the administration temporarily rehabilitated about 200 hill families in different playgrounds in the city."

Aarong issued a statement of apology on its official Facebook page on Sunday. The social enterprise of BRAC also said it would remove some of the pictures from its current campaign. The new advertisement picture of Aarong shows the models posed for the ad in a room filled with water. It has drawn huge criticism on social media.  \"We can understand why it may be perceived as being insensitive to the sufferings of the flood-affected people. This was not our intention and we apologise,\" it states. In the statement, Aarong said it introduces new themes every year in its ad campaigns and promotional materials. This year's theme around monsoon and Bishorjon was conceptualised and developed before the onset of the recent floods, it said."

      "authors": "Towheed Feroze",
      "text": "It is a well-known fact, or I can assume a lot of people are aware, that in 1971, the US government was not in favour of a liberated Bangladesh. At least, the White House was actively against the idea of a dismembered Pakistan. Declassified records, as mentioned in several books related to the 1971 War of Independence in Bangladesh, state unequivocally that the Nixon administration was unwilling to see dents in their relations with the West Pakistan junta. Pakistan was a key player at that time in improving US relations with China. Therefore, even after heart-wrenching telegrams were sent by US diplomat Archer Blood from Dhaka about the atrocities committed, the reaction in Washington was diplomatic silence. Blood later on was admonished and, reportedly, his career path made difficult for his candid appraisal of the situation on the ground. Whatever the case, within the USA, the opinion was split as further declassified papers, mentioned in BZ Khosru's book, clearly state that a large number of common Americans plus many serving lawmakers opposed the stance of the White House and also resorted to strategic filibustering to delay shipments of weapons to the invading army. Yet, even after so many years, if a political analyst is asked to comment on the role of the USA and then the USSR during the 1971 war, the former won't be painted favourably. If you are the devil, then you are vile out and out ... no chance for the little virtues to be noticed. After all, history only remembers decisions made at the top. The fact that many Germans within the German defence system wanted to depose Hitler and end a war begun on lunatic whim is usually brushed aside when WW2 is deconstructed. Anything to do with Hitler's military might is regarded with suspicion, though efforts were made right within the German military by Claus von Stauffenberg to kill the dictator in what is known as the \"20 July plot.\" Come to the Vietnam War, where the US role is still enveloped in infamy. At the height of the Cold War, poking a nose, and then directly getting in warfare, in Vietnam turned the US into the new imperial juggernaut. Within the US, millions of people, imbued by the 60s philosophy of peace and spiritual emancipation, protested, though this hardly did anything to improve the US image globally. In the then East-Pakistan, a wave of socialist ideals spurred by Fidel Castro's defiance of the US and relentless struggle of the Vietnamese people had transformed a generation. The 1971 American aloofness only cemented an anti-Western feeling. To be precise, for about a decade after liberation, young men wanting to enter politics had to embrace socialist values and reject what they termed \"Markin shamrajjobad\" (US imperialism). However, as we step into the 43rd year of independence, maybe history should be interpreted not by acts of the government only but also by humanitarian deeds of the general people.  A recent news of four US Hercules planes helping India transport floods of refugees from the then East Pakistan after the March 26 crackdown, opens up a new hitherto unknown dimension to the compassionate American involvement in the war. Of course, if we look at the overall picture, Nixon's lethargy in acknowledging genocide in Bangladesh and the subsequent sending of the seventh fleet will always overshadow all the other acts that were in favour of Bangladesh. Even then, sometimes good deeds need to be recognised. One cannot forget the role of the American missionaries based in Dhaka, Narinda, and Kaliganj who came to the help of the common people during those turbulent times of hopelessness. Nor can we forget Senator Edward Kennedy who stood at Congress supporting the cause for Bangladesh. As we approach Victory Day, the role of the USSR during the war cannot and should not be sidelined either. They indirectly hinted that if any superpower entered on the side of Pakistan, the USSR would act, thus ruling out the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh from turning into a major cause for global conflict. Later, it was the Soviets who cleared the ports of Bangladesh of thousands of planted mines and scuttled ships. Of course, to take a wide-angle perspective, the 70s was the period of high communism-capitalism tensions. Any state-to-state episode of warfare was inevitably caught in the vortex of the ideological divide. One may ask why these nuances from another era matter so much. After all, the Cold War is over and there's nothing called the Soviet Union. Well, for starters, accurate history is essential because unless the facts are known, new generations' understanding of the political evolution of the sub-continent will be distorted. Just a concluding point, leading Arab countries from where millions of Bangladeshis now send back much needed foreign currency did not recognise Bangladesh's struggle for independence on the rationale that the movement was aimed at dividing a Muslim country. Saudi Arabia gave formal recognition to Bangladesh in 1975-1976. Today, the Saudi government is a generous friend to Bangladesh. On the eve of Victory Day, let's also try to understand a little bit of global politics and how they have evolved, with Bangladesh now firmly secured in the global map as a developing country. "

      "headline": "Bangladesh is no basket case",
      "authors": "Marianne Scholte",
      "text": "One of the most overlooked development success stories of the past decades has been steadily unfolding in one of the poorest and most populous countries: Bangladesh. The little attention the country attracts in the international media tends to focus on floods, cyclones, allegedly deplorable labour conditions in the textiles industry and poor governance. Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index places the country near the bottom of its ranking. Bangladesh's reputation of desperate misery is decades old. Henry Kissinger, the influential US secretary of state in the 1970s, famously derided it as a \"basket case.\" The international public has barely noticed Bangladesh's achievements in terms of income levels, food security, industrialisation, health, family planning, education, disaster prevention and the empowerment of women. Perceptions only began to change slowly at the end of the past decade, when World Bank experts, for instance, noticed the \"development surprise.\" This surprise results from several factors that cannot be easily replicated: Governance was often better than its reputation. There is indeed reason to complain about corruption, overblown and manipulative partisanship. Politically motivated violence has occurred, top leaders have been assassinated, the military grabbed power several times. In spite of these downsides, however, the state apparatus did focus on specific development goals with considerable success. Bangladesh has a vibrant civil society. It spawned many path-breaking non-governmental organisations (NGOs) which supplemented government action and - where such action was lacking - often substituted for it. Many of them pay special attention to improving the lot of women and empowering them. Entrepreneurs have acted dynamically and built strong new businesses. International donor agencies played their part. Well-targeted social-development programmes always found donor support, and the donors knew they could rely on competent and committed local staff. Bangladesh is a small but densely populated country. Its culture is unusually homogenous for a developing country: 98% of its people speak Bangla as their first language, and almost 90% are Muslim. These characteristics have proven helpful. What works in one village is likely to work in the next village as well - and the next village is never far away. Moreover, development workers only need a bicycle to reach many thousands of clients. Traumatised by war Bangladesh became a sovereign nation in late 1971 after a war of independence that left millions dead and destroyed the country's infrastructure. At the time, the country's future looked bleak. A whole generation of intellectuals and professionals had been murdered by the Pakistani army, and hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi women had been systematically raped. Two years later, a devastating famine killed another estimated 1.5 million people. There was reason to doubt that the new nation of 72 million people squeezed into an area of only 144,000 square kilometres had a future. Its population was larger than West Germany's, but its territory was 40% smaller. However, the Bangladeshis were determined to rebuild and develop their country. Massive amounts of foreign aid arrived and civil-society groups and government agencies distributed the assistance to destitute people. A number of important NGOs were started as part of the relief effort. Some of them, for instance BRAC and Grameen Bank, have become internationally active organisations with world-wide recognition and millions of members. In the 1970s, government relief efforts quickly evolved into effective development policies. The massive donor-funded food distribution programmes of the post-war period were transformed into rural infrastructure development programmes, headed by the Local Government Engineering Department (initially the Rural Works Programme) and its charismatic leader Quamrul Islam Siddique. Among other things, the extensive, meticulously planned network of rural roads, bridges, markets and boat landing sites dramatically increased the volume of marketed rice and contributed to falling real prices of rice.  High-yielding rice and wheat varieties were introduced in the 1970s and 1980s, and the markets for farm-inputs were liberalised. The introduction of various kinds of tube wells and surface irrigation boosted the dry-season rice crop. Rice production steadily increased from 10 million tons in 1972/73 to 34 million tons in 2011/2012. Today, Bangladesh is basically self-sufficient in food. Budding industries The war destroyed the country's small business sector and it took several years until the private sector - including the ready-made garment industry (RMG) - began to emerge. Today, there are around 3,000 RMG factories. They export more garments than the textiles sector of any other country except China. Garment exports from Bangladesh were worth $24.5bn in fiscal year 2013/14 and accounted for 81% of export earnings. The sector provides direct employment to more than 3.5 million people - the majority poor rural women - and indirect employment and income to millions more. RMG production clearly dominates Bangladesh's manufacturing sector, but other industries - including generic pharmaceuticals, leather products and ship-building - are also gaining strength. Since 2004, two Bangladeshi ship-building companies have exported ships worth $200m. Industrial production now accounts for almost 30% of GDP. A massive flow of remittances from millions of Bangladeshis who live abroad has helped. The World Bank reckons that remittances amounted to almost $13bn in fiscal year 2011/12.After an average annual GDP growth rate of less than 4% a year in the 1980s, Bangladesh's GDP growth averaged 4.8% in the 1990s and 5.9% in the 2000s, according to official statistics. Per-capita income increased by an average of 1.7% per year in the 1980s, 2.7% in the 1990s and 4.5% per year in the 2000s. Making the most of growth Economic growth matters, but there is much more going on here. Social development has outpaced rising incomes. With a per-capita GNI of $900 in 2013, the World Bank still ranks Bangladesh as a low-income country. The UN lists Bangladesh among the least-developed countries, taking into account additional indicators for education, health and people's vulnerability to shocks. Nonetheless, Bangladesh is on track to meet key Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The share of the people below the national poverty line fell from 56.6% in 1992 to 31.5% in 2010. Bangladesh is one of the few countries that are likely to achieve the MDG of reducing infant, child and maternal mortality by two-thirds. It is also on track to immunise 100% of its one-year-old children against measles and achieve 100% net enrolment in primary school. Gender disparity has been eliminated in primary and secondary education. The country will meet or has already met most of the targets for fighting HIV/AIDs, malaria and tuberculosis. In regard to family planning, Bangladesh surprised the world long before the MDGs were even defined. The nation reduced its total fertility rate from 6.9 children per woman in 1970 to 3.3 children per woman in the mid-1990s. Experts had believed that such a decline would only be possible in the context of rapidly rising incomes, increased levels of education for women or a powerful non-familial welfare system such as in China. In Bangladesh, however, the dramatic drop in the fertility rate was the result of strong and persistent government commitment to an innovative, multi-layered programme: Family-planning information reached almost every village in the country through the media, local elites, NGOs and even religious leaders. Contraceptives were widely advertised and made available at low-cost, subsidised prices. The heart of the programme consisted of 23,500 female family welfare assistants who brought health and family planning information as well as free contraceptives to women in their homes. The assistance was backed-up by clinical services. By the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Health was employing 44,000 family planning personnel - all financed at that time by donor agencies. In 1970, East Pakistan (Bangladesh) had approximately 69 million and West Pakistan (Pakistan) 62 million people. They had the same fertility rate. Today, Bangladesh has a population of approximately 150 million, while Pakistan's has grown to more than 176 million. The fertility rate for 2012 was 2.2 children per woman in Bangladesh and 3.3 in Pakistan. The successful family-planning programme is perhaps paradigmatic for Bangladesh's social development in general. Government agencies and NGOs typically cooperate on implementing comprehensive policies in selected sectors and rely on international funding. It is noteworthy, for instance, that Grameen Bank had received $148m in grants and $85m in loans from international donors by the end of the 1990s. Today, around 2,000 development NGOs in Bangladesh are active in education and health services, micro-finance and women's empowerment. Many of them contribute to the spectacularly successful disaster-risk reduction system. Before cyclone Sidr hit the coast of Bangladesh in 2007, some 3.5 million people were evacuated. The storm killed about 3,500 people, but that number has to be put in perspective. A cyclone of similar strength had claimed 138,000 lives in 1991 and the region's most devastating storm of all times left half a million dead in 1970. In view of a growing population and a rising sea level, this kind of progress is very important. Today, NGOs are crucial to the path-breaking rural solar-energy programme that has brought solar home systems to over 7 million Bangladeshis since 2002. The programme, once again, was initiated by a government-owned company, is promoted by local NGOs and relies on international funding. "

But last year, she cut the cake before the usual time.\nSenior Awami League leaders, including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, have for years requested the BNP chief not to observe her birthday on August 15.\nA Gulshan office source said an unofficial directive was sent to the front and associate organisations not to throng to the Gulshan office with cakes at night.\nReportedly after being elected as prime minister in 1991, Khaleda Zia started celebrating her birthday on August 15 in 1993. Till 1996, Khaleda celebrated her birthday at home but made it into an organisational event from 1996 when she became the opposition leader.\nLast year, Awami League General Secretary Syed Ashraful Islam charged Khaleda saying, \"There can be no consensus with those who celebrate fake birthdays on the National Mourning Day. We have extended our hands to her in the past, but Khaleda did not accept it. Even if it really is her birthday, she can celebrate it on August 16 to show respect for Bangabandhu. We do not object to her celebrating her birthday.\"\nIn a phone conversation in 2014, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina asked Khaleda Zia not to observe her birthday on August 15.\n\"You visited our Dhanmondi Road 32 residence several times. You saw Sheikh Russel. When you observe your birthday on August 15, do you not remember Russel's face?\"\nIn reply, Zia asked, \"If someone is born on that day, can't they celebrate their birthday?\"\nPro-BNP intellectual Zafrullah Chowdhury also suggested that the party chief should not observe her birthday on that day.\nAccording to Khaleda's marriage certificate, her birthday is September 5, 1945. Her first passport reportedly says her birthday is August 19, 1946.\nAccording to a curriculum vitae distributed to the media after taking oath as prime minister of Bangladesh in 1991, Khaleda was born in Feni on September 19, 1945.\nKhaleda's biography published by the Parliament Secretariat mentions her birth year as 1945. Several biographical books and the Banglapedia also mention Aug 15, 1945 as her birthday.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "text": "Bangladesh is one of the most heavily river laden lands in the world. The beauty of its flowing rivers zig-zagging through the country is simply mesmerising. However, during the monsoon or rainy season, water levels rise dangerously. As a consequence, every year the country faces serious and chronic flooding. As per a report from the beginning of this month, some 3.2 million people across 16 districts of Bangladesh were affected by monsoon-induced floods and the death toll went over 42. Apart from the floods, nearer sea ponds, ditches, sewage canal and other water bodies lead to several deaths. In July this year, two children died after falling into a sewage canal in Rupnagar. There are numerous instances where people drown while swimming in beach areas or bathing in rivers. Children in Bangladesh face the gravest threat of death by drowning. Dr Jahangir Hossain, programme co-ordinator for the Centre for Injury Prevention and Research Bangladesh (CIPRB) refers to it as a hidden epidemic in the country. According to CIPRB estimation, every year deaths from drowning claim 20,685 lives and among them approximately 18,000 are children under the age of 18. This means approximately 50 children die everyday by drowning in Bangladesh. The Asia based group Alliance for Safe Children found from its survey that Bangladesh has the highest rate of child drownings in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) say drowning is among the top five causes of death for children under 15 years.    In recent years a number of NGOs and other civil society organisations have been conducting swimming teaching program aiming to bring down deaths from drowning. These seem to have made little impact on the ominous situation as newspaper pages are still filled with news of people dying by falling into ponds, ditches, rivers and other water zones almost everyday. This has prompted Mohammad Asaduzzaman, Jafrina Jabin, Ahmed Masud Chowdhury, Imran Ahmed and Ahmed Shafa Shovon to develop a portable and handy floating device that may help save a drowning person. Currently under construction, the ambitious project is designing \"FloBuddy\", a prototype floating device that will be able to help a drowning person float until help arrives. The device is designed to be worn like a bracelet. It will be attached with a cylinder, an air-bag and a press button. Thus anyone trying to stay afloat in water can press the button and engage the device which will enable the person to float for a certain amount of time until rescuers come. Any endeavours regarding matters as supremely important as saving lives should aim to seek perfection. With that in mind, the team has been tackling a lot of challenges since they invented the prototype. To make it as impeccable as possible, the designers are considering matters such as how portable the device should be. They are also striving to make the mechanism simple and trying to figure out a way to maximise the number of days the device will be able to keep people afloat. There is even the issue of making it look stylish for the young generation. \"We are very passionate about developing the device with zero flaws. So far, our test runs proved the device works all water bodies. At this point the device is able to keep a human floating for one and half days,\" said Mohammad Asaduzzaman, one of the concept developers of FloBuddy.  The team has planned to add a light and a whistle, thus enabling the victim to use it in dark and solitary conditions. Another area of their main focus is keeping the system as simple as possible so that it can be understood and used by people of all ages and educational backgrounds. Complex operation would be harder for general people to understand and even worse for illiterate people. Keeping the device accessible in terms of its affordability is the prime priority of the FloBuddy team. They are trying to produce every component of the device in Bangladesh. \"We are planning to keep it as inexpensive as possible,\" Asaduzzaman said. After three months of tireless work, the team has been spending each day combating flaws and weaknesses and gradually perfecting the device. They believe a life-saving device can only be trusted by people when it is perfect. Hoping to finish making the error-free prototype within the next four months, the team has big plans afterwards. \"We have planned to start awareness promotion in different launch terminals and other places where we will be able to make people conscious about certain issues and trivia about the device,\" Asaduzzaman said.    They are also planning to distribute FloBuddy free of cost among children and simultaneously promoting learning swimming as another vital tool for saving people from drowning. Initially the idea of floating device was being developed by participants of EMK Makerlab TechClub (a platform for youth development) as part of their idea development session. Later on, the participants of EMK Makerlab TechClub formed a team and participated in Make-A-Thon (a competition that enables makers to come under one roof and build anything) on May 28, 2016 where they have secured third place. The project recently received the Innovation Fund for Product Development from the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). EMK Makerlab will be one of the partners of this project with Better Stories as the incubation partner."

      "text": "\nFarakka barrage, engineers and hydropolitics\n\n\n\n\nNilanjan Ghosh\n\n\n\n\n Published at 04:44 pm September 20th, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nThe recent call by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to remove the Farakka barrage has added a new dimension to the ongoing debate on the utility of the barrage. Located in the Indian state of West Bengal, roughly 16.5km  from the border with Bangladesh, the barrage was planned to enhance the flow of Bhagirathi-Hooghly branch of the Ganges to resuscitate the port at Kolkata.\nWhile the Farakka barrage has earlier been blamed for reducing water flow, causing salinity ingress and drying up of the Sundarbans delta, the problem with the management of sediments has recently taken an ugly turn with the floods in the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.\n[iframe id=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d28972.31491745864!2d87.934987!3d24.811222!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x39fa5ead1fefa8b1%3A0x88d87c07a1508783!2sFarakka+Barrage%2C+Gobindarampur%2C+West+Bengal+732215!5e0!3m2!1sen!2suk!4v1474366215313\"]\nThe government of Pakistan (which encompassed the present state of Bangladesh) was critical of the project. It had feared that by enhancing the flow into Bhagirathi-Hooghly, the barrage would reduce the dry season flow of the Ganges (known as the Padma in Bangladesh) downstream.\n\nAlso read: Farakka is a hindrance to peace\n\nThere were members of the Indian technocracy who also opposed the project, such as Kapil Bhattacharya, then chief engineer of West Bengal. He was singled out and marginalised. Since then, the construction of the barrage has been a crucial factor affecting Bangladesh-India relations and perceptions of transboundary environmental issues.\nShort term solution\nThe Farakka barrage stands as a classic example of engineering solutions that looked at short-term economic benefits and ignored long-term sustainability concerns. This way of thinking was promoted during the British colonial period. This was the time when such large scale endeavours were being experimented with all over the world, with civil engineering being established as a discipline in the 19th century. The establishment of Thomason Engineering College at Roorkee, now the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee, which began as a class for engineers in 1845, before being named after its founder, James Thomason, in 1854, provided young Indian students with training in the European knowledge of water engineering. This form of water management spread across engineering colleges in India over time.\n[youtube id=\"58eVzSZ0GKU\"]\nThis thinking dominates the Indian water engineering scenario even today, and has led to enhanced damage, livelihoods losses and eventually conflicts at both international and inter-state levels. The Farakka barrage is a classic example.\nWhen the barrage was planned, knowledge about the complex ecology, hydrology and sediment flow of Himalayan rivers like the Ganges was either not available or ignored. So, the possible impacts of building a barrage were not perceived at the design stage.\n\nAlso read: Farakka still a fracas\n\nThe most significant knowledge gap in river engineering was and is related to the understanding and management of the sediments, which are integral parts of water flows. Without consideration of the sediments, the Bangladesh-India treaty of 1996 on the sharing of the dry season flows at Farakka turned out to be merely an arithmetical exercise on amounts of water to be shared, without looking at overall impact on the river systems.\nFloods are regular phenomena in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. From the perspective of natural science, floods are integral components of the eco-hydrological cycle. They cause damage, but also, as the floodwater recedes, it leaves behind rich silt and sediments, which have made the Gangetic plains the \"rice bowl of South Asia\". The real problems start when the floods become severe, or when they start depositing sand instead of silt.\n[youtube id=\"BUvC3Rito4o\"]\nBut what happens when the silt is blocked by a barrage? The Bihar chief minister says the sediment build-up upstream of the Farakka barrage has raised the riverbed, which is worsening the flood situation. It also diverts the water meant for the Bhagirathi-Hooghly branch of the Ganges into a narrow channel in Malda district of West Bengal, leading to bank erosion and flooding.\nWithout the barrage the river would have carried the sediment to the delta and flushed some of it out to the Bay of Bengal. The Bengal delta is built on the huge sediment load carried by the Ganges and the Brahmaputra. Now the Farakka barrage seems to have incapacitated the river's potential to perform this function. The barrage and subsequent lack of sediment separation technology seem to have punctured the \"soil formation\" service of the river further downstream. The avowed purpose of resuscitating the Kolkata port has not been satisfied either.\nCure worse than disease\nNevertheless, the removal of the barrage may create other problems, and might escalate the conflict between states and between nations. There is no doubt that one benefit of the barrage is amelioration of the water problem during lean seasons in the densely populated areas of West Bengal, due to the flows through the Bhagirathi-Hooghly channel. The drinking water and sanitation problems of the burgeoning Kolkata metropolis seem to have been reduced due to the Farakka barrage, which has not only resuscitated the surface water flow in the channel, but may have also ensured groundwater recharge. Removal of the barrage will negatively affect the populace and ecosystem services in this part of the state, leading to resistance, and possibly conflict.\n[iframe id=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=15nLXsXaox0RRCk62MhE20H8eVMA\"]\nBut at the very least, the problems created by the Farakka barrage should inform new projects. There are good examples of how to build a barrage and use the sediments at the same time.\nBut at the very least, the problems created by the Farakka barrage should inform new projects. There are good examples of how to build a barrage and use the sediments at the same time. The Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze designed by Chinese experts helps in flood control, and also uses the peak flow to flush the sediments downstream for floodplain cultivation. However even Chinese officials admit the negative impact of this controversial project due to unintended build up of sediment behind the dam, and devastating landslides are becoming more frequent around the site.\nWhile India needs to evolve better ecologically informed engineering, we also need to pay serious attention to the management of Himalayan rivers. Especially when discussing ideas of integrated river basin management, we need to consider river basin commissions with powers to mediate between states so as to avoid escalation of inter-state conflicts on river waters.\n\nNilanjan Ghosh is Senior Fellow and Head of Economy and Development, Observer Research Foundation Kolkata; and Senior Economic Advisor at World Wide Fund for Nature, New Delhi, India.

Kamrul Hasan\n\n\n\n\n Published at 08:05 pm November 23rd, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \nAccording to the study, some 10,882 people were killed, while more than seven million people were affected between 1996 and 2006. Comparatively, the number of deaths came down to 9,906 with 4.5 million people were affected between 2006 and 2015.\nMozharul Huq, general secretary of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS), said: \"The improvement of preparation taken against any disaster has assisted Bangladesh to bring down the number of deaths in recent natural disasters.\n\"Bangladesh suffered the catastrophic blow of deaths between 3,00,000 and 5,00,000 during the Cyclone Bhola in 1970.\nThrough better preparation, casualties were reduced to a little over 3,000 during Cyclone Sidr in 2007, and a mere 190 during Cyclone Aila in 2009. The number is shown to be continuously decreasing, as the number of deaths from all natural disasters totalled 290 in 2015.\"\nHuq added: \"If the progress continues, the damage and death would come under control by 2030.\"\nAfter unveiling the report as chief guest, Disaster Management Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya said: \"To achieve more advancement in this regard, the government will build 220 more cyclone centres across the country.\"\n\"At present, there are 153 centres and some 55,000 volunteers in the country,\" the minister added.\nVice Chairman of BDRCS Mohammad Habibe Millat MP said: \"In international meetings, Bangladesh is cited as the model for disaster management and the country has to keep up the pace of progress.\"\nHe urged the minister to ensure the Bangladesh government's official involvement in the IFRC 1 billion Coalition by signing with the UN for a permanent mission of the country.\nEarlier, senior advisor of IFRC Bangladesh office, Shammi Ahmed, elaborated on the 1 billion Coalition campaign saying: \"People need to be aware as 4.4m people were affected by disasters in 2015 alone. Furthermore, they were suspecting that some 18m people would be affected by climate-induced displacement next year.\"\n\"1,00,000 children are dying each year from diarrheal diseases. 63M people lack access to sanitation throughout the world and 21m lack safe water\" she added.\nThe report said, according to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), 371 disasters were triggered by natural hazards and 203 by technological hazards in 2015 worldwide.\nThe number of natural hazards (DTNH) was the fourth highest of the decade, close to its decade's annual average (375), and the number of technical hazards (DTTH) was the third lowest of the decade, 13 percent below the decade's annual average (234).\nFloods remain the most frequent DTNH, but their number was down to 154 in 2015, 10% below the decade's annual average of 172. With 114 disasters, storms were in the second position, but this number was the highest of the decade, at 18% above the decade's annual average 97. The number of 33 disasters triggered by droughts was the highest of the decade as well, being 38% above the decade's annual average of 24.\nThe number of deaths caused by DTNH is 22,724 which is the fifth highest of the decade, but still remains 67% below its annual average of 69,808, far from the peaks of 2008 (242,215 deaths) and 2010 (314,503 deaths).\nThe deadliest DTNH of 2015 was the earthquake which hit Nepal in April and killed 8,831 people. This is very far from the number of deaths - 138,375 deaths - caused by cyclone Nargis in Myanmar in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n"

As the name implies, Khokon's work is in black and white.\nAbu Taher Khokon has worked in many different newspapers in Bangladesh since 1986. He was staff photo journalist at the Daily New Nation from 1986 to 1995. He was then chief staff photographer at the Morning Sun for about five years. He was also the chief photo journalist at New Age from 2003 to 2010.\n\"There are innumerable children in this country whose lives are colourless and engulfed in darkness. In other words, they are black and white. These poverty stricken children do not see the glistening colours of life as we see them. Their journey through life is filled with tribulations,\" Khokon described the philosophy behind the work in his book.\nThe book showcases 65 brilliantly captured images. The photos are often bleak and harrowing. Themes explored include childhood, laughter, playing, labour, heat of summer, drought, winter, flood, unnatural deaths, solidarity, drugs, uprising, education and patriotism.\nThe launching ceremony for the book was held in New York September 30 this year. The founder of Joyeeta Publication and renowned photo journalist Yasin Kabir Joy chaired the event. The programme was achored by journalist Akbar Haidar Kiron. The editor of Shada Kalo Nizam Chowdhury, the editor-in-chief of Weekly Thikana Muhammad Fazlur Rahman, editor of Weekly Ajkal Manjur Ahmed and CEO of Times TV Abu Taher spoke at the event.\nKhokon delivered the welcoming speech at the event. Senior journalist Kazi Mintu spoke on blcak and white photography. One of the main convener of the programme was popular expat photo journalist Nihar Siddiki.\nThe 65 photos in the book are categorized under 14 categories. The first photo from the \"childhood\" series embodies the picture of underprivileged, repressed, and poverty stricken children. They too have the aspirations. But they live with uncertainty.\nKhokon's vision is optimistic despite the grim overtone in his work. He likes to capture laughter a lot. The photo of poor children playing cricket on a big garbage dumping ground is jubilant from the universal mirthful excitement of children. But at the same time there is a surrealistic aura in it, particularly because of the hoards of kites in the background. Khokon does not shy away from capturing that too.\nBut sometimes it's not possible to be optimistic. The photos of landslide victims are hard to look at. They are as agonizing as they are real. Hope is also difficult to find in the life and death struggle during floods and bone shuddering winter under the open sky.\nKhokon has a special eye for finding union between people and animals. His photos capturing dogs finding shelter with humans and monkeys taking refuge on the shoulder of a man during flood is mesmerizing.\nThe \"narcotics\" category shows the devastating pictures of street children sniffing drugs en masse. Khokon also captured how children are used and abused by state and political powers.\nThe last photo of the book again snaps a little girl smiling, apparently oblivious to her hapless state and lack of material possessions. Despite its focus on children, the book is an anthology of Bangladesh and the realities of the country. The tonality of the photography imprints a melancholic impression on the viewers.\n\n\n\n\n"

      "authors": "Tribune International Desk",
      "text": "War and poverty in the Middle East and Africa have forced record numbers to flee their homes, fuelling Europe's largest refugee and migrant crisis since World War II. Some 1.4 million people have headed to Europe in the last two years, triggering disputes between countries over how to handle the influx and boosting support for anti-immigration populists. In the United States, President-elect Donald Trump, who made immigration a key campaign issue, has promised to build a wall along the Mexican border, deport millions of undocumented immigrants and ban immigration from countries that have been \"compromised by terrorism\". Here are some facts on migrants and refugees: The number of international migrants has increased over the past 50 years to nearly 250m in 2015, from about 79m in 1960. International migrants - those living in a country that is different from their country or territory of birth - make up 3.3% of the world's population. Migrants and refugees often travel in the same way. But economic migrants leave their country to improve the future economic prospects of themselves and their families, whereas refugees are fleeing conflict or persecution. At the end of 2015 there were 65.3m forcibly displaced people. They included 21.3m refugees, 40.8m internally displaced and 3.2m asylum seekers. One in every 113 people globally is either an asylum-seeker, internally displaced or a refugee.  More than 4,700 migrants have died attempting treacherous sea journeys to Europe this year, the deadliest on record. Italy has become the top destination for those heading to Europe by boat, with more than 179,000 arrivals. The US has more international migrants than any other country, ahead of Germany (12m), Russia (11.6m), Saudi Arabia (10.2m) and Britain (8.5m). The US-Mexico migration corridor is one of the most travelled routes in the world. During fiscal year 2016, which ended in September, the number of people detained along the border surpassed 408,000, a 23% jump from last year, although it was less than in 2014. In 2015, migrants around the world sent nearly $600bn dollars back to relatives in their home countries. Nine in 10 refugees are hosted in developing regions. Turkey has the largest number with more than 3m refugees. As weather extremes strengthen and sea levels rise, migration experts have warned that forced migration linked to climate pressures is poised to become a problem that could dwarf refugee flows.

      "headline": "Things to know about likely-dead Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau",
      "authors": "Tribune International Desk",
      "text": "Nigeria claimed on Tuesday that its air force had killed a number of senior Boko Haram militants, possibly including the group's elusive and notorious former leader, Abubakar Shekau. Government planes attacked the fighters in the village of Taye inside the Sambisa forest in Borno State during a raid on the Islamists' northeast heartland on Friday night, Reuters reports. Army spokesman Colonel Sani Kukasheka Usman said, in a statement, that \"Their leader, so called 'Abubakar Shekau', is believed to be fatally wounded on his shoulders.\" However, this is at least the fourth time Shekau's death has been reported. Despite the military declaring him killed in 2009, a man purporting to be Shekau reappeared in videos posted on the internet less than a year later, when he ridiculed suggestions of his death. The Boko Haram militant, named among TIME's 100 Most Influential People in 2015 as the \"scourge of Africa,\" was reportedly ousted from his leadership position by IS chiefs earlier this month. Here's what we know about him: Ruthless ideologue Abubakar Muhammad Shekau is believed to have been born between 1965 and 1975 in Shekau village in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe, according to the BBC. He was a theology student and is fluent in his native Kanuri language, as well as Hausa and Arabic, and appears to understand English too. Shekau has been described as having an \"intense ideological commitment and ruthlessness.\" He has demonstrated a blood-thirsty nature, saying in one video: \"I enjoy killing anyone that God commands me to kill - the same way that I enjoy killing chickens and rams.\" Journey to becoming a warlord The jihadist group Boko Haram, whose name translates roughly to \"Western education is forbidden,\" was founded in 2002 by Mohammed Yusuf. Shekau took over as leader in 2009 after Yusuf was paraded and then executed in front of a crowd by Nigerian security forces, retaliating after 70 Boko Haram fighters attacked a mosque and police station in the town of Bauchi. Shekau is said to have married one of Yusuf's four wives and adopted their children, following the former leader's death. Shekau then began to stage increasingly daring kidnapping and killing raids on schools, police stations, federal institutions, churches and mosques thought by Boko Haram to be violating their interpretation of Islam. Under Shekau's leadership, Boko Haram has killed some 20,000 people and displaced more than two million, according to the International Business Times. In 2013, the US government's bounty for Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau stood at $7m - $2m more than what was offered for the Afghan Taliban's top man, Mullah Omar. He formally pledged allegiance to IS's self-styled caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in March 2015, and gave IS its first franchise in sub-Saharan Africa. International pariah  The abduction of over 270 schoolgirls in April 2014 brought Boko Haram into the international spotlight, with many using the #BringBackOurGirls hashtag to raise awareness of the campaign to find the abductees. In a series of videos posted online at the time, Shekau admitted to kidnapping the girls and said he would sell them. \"I abducted your girls. There is a market for selling humans. Allah says I should sell,\" he said, grinning. \"He commands me to sell. I will sell women. I sell women,\" he added, occasionally laughing throughout the segment. Some of the abducted Chibok schoolgirls have been killed by Nigerian military air strikes, according to a new video appearing to come from Boko Haram, which shows one kidnap victim pleading for authorities to bow to the extremists' demands that they release detained militants in return for the girls. It's not clear how many have died among the 218 who remain missing. Ousted by IS leaders At the time of his reported death Shekau had been in a leadership battle with Abu Musab al-Barnawi, who was named by the Islamic State group as the new leader of what it calls its West Africa Province on August 3. An audio speech released the following day, purporting to be from Shekau, criticized his rival and said al-Baghdadi did not respond to letters in which he claimed al-Barnawi is \"an infidel\" preaching \"false creeds.\" According to the Associated Press, Shekau's speech highlighted ideological differences with al-Barnawi, who has promised to end the attacks on mosques and Muslim markets that had become a hallmark of Boko Haram. One of many deaths In 2009, rumors of Shekau's death by security forces did the rounds in Nigeria - however many believed that the announcement was \"merely a ruse, designed to provoke Shekau into making a public appearance or statement, in the hope of flushing him out\", The New York Times reports. He then appeared in a videotaped interview with a local Nigerian journalist in July 2010, as Boko Haram's new leader, a position he had held since taking over from Yusuf the year before. In 2013, an army spokesman announced that Shekau \"may have died\" between July 25 and August 3 during a shoot-out with security forces. And one year later, the Cameroonian military released photos believed to be of Shekau, suggesting he was killed during a cross border raid inside Nigeria. At the time, Ryan Cummings, a security analyst, said \"Is this his fourth or fifth death? He dies more often than an iPhone battery,\" according to the UK's Times newspaper. After Shekau's third death in 2014, theories circulated that the body was that of an impostor. The Washington Post reported that the Nigerian military issued a statement saying a corpse photographed by Cameroon military's photograph was that of \"a doppelganger, masquerading as the leader.\" Tuesday's statement made no mention of a doppelganger. Only time will tell if this fourth reported death proves to be terminal. [This is an excerpt from a Time Article, Which can be found at http://ti.me/2biHK0l]"
