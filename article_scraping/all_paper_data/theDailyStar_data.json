      "text": "The haor basin in the northeastern part of Bangladesh is currently experiencing severe flash floods, causing considerable hardship to people, and destroying crops and other infrastructure. Some people are asking if this flood can be attributed to human-induced climate change. Firstly, it is important to distinguish weather events (like rains, cyclones and floods, etc.) from climate. The former happens on a short timescale (several days) while the latter happens in much longer timescales (months and years). The weather can change from day to day but the climate changes over months to give us different seasons each year. Both weather and climate vary over time in a natural pattern and have done so since the beginning of time. However, in the last few decades we have begun to see a change in the patterns which is possibly due to the fact that since the Industrial Revolution almost two hundred years ago we have been emitting greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide, from burning fossil fuels like coal, petrol and natural gas. These greenhouse gases trap the sun's heat and raise the temperature of the atmosphere above what it would normally be. Already the global mean temperature has been raised over one degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This may not seem very much as temperatures can vary by over ten degrees between day and night every day. However, even a few degrees of rise in the global mean temperature can cause considerable adverse impacts around the world. That is why in the Paris Agreement on climate change all the countries of the world have agreed to keep global mean temperatures below two degrees and if possible below 1.5 degrees. When it comes to attributing the adverse impacts of climatic and even weather events to human-induced climate change, it is not as simple because not all events or all climatic impacts are equally related to atmospheric temperature increases. I will give below a description of which climatic events are more easily attributed to climate change and which are more difficult (starting with the most easily attributable). As the main effect of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is a rise in the atmospheric temperature globally, it is logical that increases in hot days and even heat waves are the most easily attributable to climate change. The second most easily attributable impact is global sea level rise, which is due to the thermal expansion of the ocean together with melting of glaciers and ice caps in Greenland and Antarctica. In Bangladesh we are already seeing the impacts of this in our coastal areas where people are suffering from salinity intrusion into drinking and irrigation waters. The third most easily attributable impact is the severity of cyclones (but not necessarily their frequency) as the higher the sea surface temperature during a given cyclone, the more severe is the cyclone. The next adverse impact that can be attributed to climate change is droughts, especially repeated or prolonged droughts. In the Barind Tract in the northwest of Bangladesh, we have droughts for part of the year but in the global context these are not really considered as severe droughts. In fact, right now the eastern part of Africa is suffering from a very severe drought which is putting tens of millions of people at risk which, if not tackled in time, will almost certainly unleash one of the biggest migrations in decades. Finally, the most difficult impact to attribute to climate change is floods. This is because the changes in hydrology due to increased atmospheric temperatures vary by region of the globe. Each region needs to be modelled separately as global models are not good enough at these scales. The regional models for the South Asian Monsoon region (in which Bangladesh falls) show that the potential impact of climate change is not likely to enhance the overall precipitation over the twelve months of each year, but rather change the pattern of rainfall so that we will have more intense monsoons and longer drier seasons. Hence, paradoxically even if the overall amount of rainfall during the year does not change much, we will still face more floods in the monsoon season and also longer droughts in the dry season. A final aspect that compounds the difficulty of attribution of climate change to floods is the fact that there are many different kinds of floods, each with a different level of attribution. Hence the flash floods happening in the northeast today are different from the main river floods and coastal floods, which are different from ponding in cities like Dhaka and Chittagong after a heavy rainfall. Thus, as far as the question of whether the current flash floods in the northeast can be attributed to climate change is concerned, it is possible but not with a great deal of certainty. What is possible to say with a great degree of scientific credibility is that Bangladesh is vulnerable to almost every one of the adverse climatic impacts mentioned above and hence we can expect all of them to become more severe as well as more frequent in future years. This has enormous implications for all our future national and regional plans. Hence, business-as-usual plans and actions will no longer be good enough.

      "text": "In a new global index, Bangladesh has been ranked seventh among the countries most affected by extreme weather events in 20 years since 1998. The Long-Term Climate Risk Index listed Puerto Rico and Sri Lanka as the top two affected countries. The index is part of a report, Global Climate Risk Index 2019, which was released at the annual climate summit in Poland's Katowice city yesterday. The report was prepared analysing damages caused by the extreme weather events that took place from 1998 to 2017. According to the annual climate risk index for 2017, Bangladesh stood ninth among the countries most affected last year, up from 13th the previous year. Nepal was ranked fourth and India 14th in the list. Last year, 407 people died in Bangladesh due to extreme weather related events -- floods, landslide, storms and cyclones. The country also suffered an economic loss of about $2826.68 million, says the report prepared by Germanwatch, a Berlin-based environmental organisation. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has already predicted in its scientific report that risks associated with extreme events will continue to increase as the global mean temperature rises. With four countries in the top of the list, the annual risk index shows that South Asian countries are among the most vulnerable globally to the impacts of climate change. The global risk index says massive rainfall led to floods across Nepal, Bangladesh and India, which affected more than 40 million people. As many as 200 people lost their lives in these countries and millions were displaced throughout the region, Germanwatch said. The floods spread across the foothills of the Himalayas and brought landslides, destroying tens of thousands of houses, vast areas of farmland and roads.  According to the report, more than 526,000 people died worldwide and there were losses of $3.47 trillion as a result of more than 11,500 extreme weather events between 1998 and 2017. Globally, 11,500 people died because of extreme weather events and economic damages totalled some $375 billion, it added. Germanwatch in its long-term climate risk report says the poorer countries are the most affected as eight of the 10 countries most affected between 1998 and 2017 are developing economies. The risk index was prepared by using the NatCatSERVICE database of the reinsurance company Munich Re and socioeconomic data of the International Monetary Fund. It said there was increasing evidence on the link between El Nino events and global warming. The occurrence of El Nino, a warm current in the Pacific Ocean, affects the monsoon in South Asia, which is vital for the summer cropping season. The occurrence of such events could double in the future due to climate change, the report said."

      "text": "Can dams actually prevent floods in Bangladesh? Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) has constructed over 15,000 kilometres of embankments and town protection dams all over the country. In the 2015-16 fiscal year, this organisation spent 56.4 percent of its annual budget of BDT 2858.90 crore for the protection of river banks, which included the construction and maintenance of embankments and dams. However, these embankments and dams proved largely ineffective when they were put to the test against this year's flood. For instance, Kurigram district, through which three of the major rivers and 12 of their tributaries flow, was guarded by a 210-kilometre-long embankment. However, 23 kilometres of this embankment have been completely washed away, and more than 60 percent of it has been severely damaged. In total, 280 kilometres of embankment have been damaged and 35 kilometres have been wiped out by the recent floods in the rest of the northern districts. Sarwar Hossain, a local inhabitant of the Kundal area of Nilphamari's Syedpur upazila, says, \"On August 13, at around 11 am, we heard a loud bang from the Patwaripara area. We headed there and found that the dam was demolished and water was rushing in violently.\" As the other parts of the dam were about to collapse as well, Sarwar and other locals hastily tried to repair the dam with mud. Army engineers came to assist and reinforced part of the dam by installing sandbags. As they were repairing the Patwaripara section of the dam, another 100-metre-long section of the structure near Basuniapara suddenly collapsed. \"As the dam collapsed, we realised that we had no chance of survival. We fled from our houses with whatever we could take. Many of my neighbours lost their livestock and other valuables. I took my wife, my two children, and several thousand takas only,\" says Sarwar. According to local inhabitants, the reason behind this otherwise preventable deluge is the lack of maintenance. In fact, Shafiqul Islam, Executive Engineer of BWDB stationed in Kurigram, admitted that 2005 and 2006 were the last times major maintenance work was done on the embankments. On top of that, last year's flood decimated a large part of the embankment, but initiative to restore the damaged section was only taken when the waters of the Brahmaputra and Teesta started to flow well above the danger line. However, it proved too little and too late. BWDB officials say that due to limited budgets, it usually repairs and reinforces embankments as a response to flood warnings and the demands of locals. \"We know better now after this year's flood; we are planning to launch large-scale continuous embankment maintenance projects. We have also gotten permission to recruit 1000 more people. However, we cannot promise there will be no flood next year. Flood control is actually a long-term process,\" says Mahfuzur Rahman, Director General of BWDB. However, this organisation's efforts to control floods with embankments has proved quite ineffective in many cases due to flawed construction and lack of maintenance. For instance, the Chouhali upazila dam, which cost over BDT 100 crore and took BWDB two years to construct, collapsed two times within six months. According to Dr M A Matin, Professor of Water Resource Engineering Department of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, says, \"Quality of construction and proper maintenance are the two factors responsible for the premature collapse of the embankments.\" He argues that if the embankment can withstand an annual flood without collapsing, it can be assumed the design of the embankment is perfect. However, the structure needs regular maintenance, which is one of the biggest challenges in Bangladesh. \"Manmade activities like building human settlements on the embankment, digging holes in the embankment for personal interests, and taking away concrete blocks and earth from the embankment for construction work are some of the common practices in Bangladesh which make the embankment very weak and vulnerable,\" explains Dr Matin. This is why he suggests that the maintenance work of the embankments should include two components: one, repairing the embankments, and two, creating awareness among local people of the significance of this protective structure. In regard to this, Rahman argues that guarding the embankment to protect it from manmade activities is not possible for BWDB due to limited resources. He says, \"We cannot guard every section of this massive network. We have a limited budget for maintenance and a workforce of some 6000 men to perform such huge tasks.\" Considering these challenges of regular maintenance and resource constraints, experts suggested an alternative method of flood control 28 years ago after the deluge of 1988. In 1989, the Flood Action Plan of Bangladesh proposed a method called compartmentalisation. According to Dr Matin, \"Compartmentalisation involves receiving flood waters, then preserving it through enclosed embankments, and finally distributing it through channels in a regulated way to all parts of the country to minimise the impact of flood without negating its contribution to our agriculture.\"  This method was proposed keeping in mind the inevitability of floods in Bangladesh due to its geographical location, its people's natural ability to cope with flood, and the beneficial impact of flooding in enhancing the fertility of agricultural lands. However, BWDB claims that implementation of compartmentalisation has recently faced serious challenges as it requires the availability of floodplains for regulated flooding, which has decreased significantly over the last 20 years. \"Human settlements have occupied most of the floodplains. Urban dwellers do not want any type of flooding, whether regulated or natural. Even our farmers do not want flooding nowadays. They can improve the fertility of their lands by using manure and irrigating with river- and ground-water. So, we have now discarded the compartmentalisation method and gone back to building embankments,\" says Rahman. During the 1960s, the erstwhile Pakistani government prepared the first Master Plan for water management, which focused mostly on flood control through embankments and drainage improvements. Since then, Bangladesh's flood control system has not seen much progress. Failed initiatives like compartmentalisation and the frequent collapse of embankments have already cost us a vast amount of state resources and human lives. On the other hand, the trend of annual flooding clearly shows the growing intensity of floods in Bangladesh and its devastating impact on the country's agriculture-based economy. Without developing a cost-effective and sustainable flood control system as soon as possible, it will not be possible for Bangladesh to keep its wheels of economic growth in motion for long.

      "text": "Recently Practical Action and The Daily Star with the support of Zurich Foundation organised a roundtable  titled ''Flood Early Warning System:   Prospects and Challenges\". Here we publish a summary of the discussions. -Editor Dr. Saleemul Huq moderated the session. At the outset, Kazi Mizanur Rahman, Project Manager, Practical Action presented the prospects of introducing robust early warning for reducing loss from floods. \n Kazi Mizanur Rahman, Project Manager: DRR and CC, Practical Action \n The frequency and severity of various hazards increased over the last few decades because of the changes in climate. The main reason for flooding in Bangladesh is not only the heavy rainfall within the country, but also other issues, including - snow-melt from the upstream countries, deforestation, shrinking of the rivers' capacity, building of dams in the upstream for irrigation and many more. One of the World Bank's studies shows that among various types of hazards, the damage caused by flood is 23 percent while it is 19% by cyclone and 15% by landslide. In Bangladesh, early warning is more prompt and precise for cyclone, but not strong enough for floods. We are aware that the country's disaster management regulatory framework is very strong. The Disaster Management Act2015 agrees that we should ensure the warning through accessible language for dissemination and should coordinate with neighboring countries. Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan pointed \"forecasts are released through emails and website, there is scope for improvement\". Last year, Practical Action introduced a mobile-based early warning system as a test case in cooperation with the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) and local administration. We produced customized early warning voice message taken from the FFWC and sent those messages to 10,000 enlisted persons and Union Digital Centers. The dissemination of the same was boosted by trained volunteers. A post-impact assessment of this initiative showed that the customized voice message turned out to be more useful than the text message since many people cannot understand text message. However, there are some challenges running this system because of high cost and lack of proper setup to disseminate in time and customized way. If Government facilitates in reducing the dissemination cost and the local administration plays an effective role, the early warning system could be established to ensure reduction of loss due to flood. Md. Saiful Hossain, Superintendent Engineer, FFWC, BWDB\n We are using the latest technology in weather forecasting and warning. Using the satellite, we are giving probability forecast for 10 days and it is very good for three days. We have targeted Union Digital Centers to disseminate early warning information swiftly. We have to think about a permanent structure. We are trying to introduce a new system to show where the flood water is rising or reducing, using maps in TV. We can use mobile, FM radio, community radio, IVR. If we develop our products and use those media tools efficiently, we can reduce vulnerabilities. We need sustainable use of our resources. Md. Sazzad Hossain, Executive Engineer, FFWC, BWDB\n People-oriented effective early warning system has four elements - 1. Risk Knowledge, 2. Early Warning Generation, 3. Dissemination and 4. Response. If any one of them doesn't work well, then it will not bring any benefit. Now FFWC are giving ten days and five days forecasts analysing the Basin Scale Hydrological Model. We release information through website and e-mails. We know that the Sendai Framework mentioned for regional cooperation in several places. Kazi Shahidur Rahman, Humanitarian Affairs Specialist, UN OCHA  \n We warn people to reduce loss of life and property. Flood is slow on set and more related to asset than life. If it is related to crop, the warning is often beyond the capacity of the meteorological department. Cyclone warning is working well as it is related to life. Loss from flood is more related to crops and properties and in most cases, it happens because of breaching the embankment. So many components need to be considered for the warning system. Adith Shah Durjoy, Senior Manager, IFRC \n Around 50% of the country's population is young. They can be the change agents for information dissemination. We minimised the death toll by growing awareness but still we cannot minimise the loss of livestock and agriculture. Instead of focusing on few departments for message dissemination, why don't we involve all the related institutions like NGOs, volunteers and other departments like agriculture, livestock, fisheries, education even the students within this process along with govt. institutions? Palash Mondal, Coordinator: Resilience and Climate Change, CARE Bangladesh\n Now our national level forecasting is appropriate. Last year, FFWC forecasted a flash flood and advised us to disseminate the message in the communities. We did it besides the FFWC and the community saved 50% of their paddy because of good response. The remaining 50% could not be saved as the rice variety did not ripe until that date and some people did not respond against those messages. M A Halim, Director, BDRCS\n BDRC and Government have been working for disaster since '72 but still struggling with the signaling system even though we produced a good forecast and gave signals timely. If we cannot make the community understand the message or signal, it will not work. Another big challenge is -many people are poor and illiterate. This group does not want to leave their homes and their belongings. We have to reach those people and involve them in the system. Khairul Hafiz, Country Director, Muslim Aid \n We can think about increasing the meter gauges around the country. Number of shelters has to be increased in flood-affected areas. Messages should be simple so that rural people can easily understand. This can be included in our school curriculum. Md. Abdus Sobur, Chairman, Kaliaharipur union, Sirajganj\n Union Parishad has a disaster management committee and we kept the mobile number of all Imams and Schoolteachers. Last year, we got the warning message and used microphones from mosques to alert people about the imminent flood. If the Union Parishad gets the fund directly from district, then we can use this fund for evacuation, message dissemination and other DRR activities. Mosammat Asinur Khatun, Volunteer, Sirajganj\n We got benefit from voice warning messages in 2016 flood. After receiving the message, we roamed around villages, informed people and helped shifting their belongings. We took shelter in the safer places, started harvesting crops and vegetables early, netted fish from the ponds and minimised the loss. If women are given the messages, they will act faster since men often stay away from home. Md. Anwar Hossain, Coordinator DRR, Practical Action\n Lots of people are living in char areas for their livelihood and we cannot move them out. The gage points of the Water Development Board were installed long ago. Their positions and condition should be reassessed and more new gage points should be installed to provide accurate information. Mobile based early warning system works properly. Habibullah Bahar, Executive Director, MMS\n Decades ago, we worked for searching and rescuing, but now we are providing the warning message. Things have changed. Last year, we got a 5 days early message and sent to the community. The community people repaired a weak point of an embankment and saved nearly 150 acres of crops. If all the sectors have a commitment to the rural community, we could reduce the loss.  G. Nayeem Wahra, Director, BRAC \n Information is aid and if we provide that properly, then no other relief is needed. We can use the community radio for sharing messages and at the same time, local government institutions need to be strengthened. Cyclone center is a temporary shelter where people do not want to stay longer. The elderly people, pregnant women, babies need more space to live and it is not an option for them, they will move from there. We need to think differently. A M Nasir Uddin, Program Manager, Action Aid Bangladesh \n In 2013, we got 3 days early flood warning but the designated person did not share the message to the local people. That community lost corps worth 1 crore taka. We know that 30 districts are connected to big river channels. It is a big job to customise the message for each of the local community. It needs an efficient coordination which is almost impossible without enhancing the local government's capacity. Raihanul Huq Khan, Country Program Lead, RIMES\n We have to think about balancing the whole system. If we can not prepare a good forecast, it is impossible to provide proper messages to the community. If the community can not interpret it, they will not be able to respond to this. In the long run, it will not bring any output. It is all about particular projects taken by some NGOs or Government. Unfortunately, you can not hear from the community or Union Parishad that they are getting information from the DRRO and PIO. So we have to think about how we can relate this system with the local govt. institutions, rather than particular projects or NGOs for a sustainable system. Hasin Jahan, Country Director, Practical Action \n Bangladesh has made significant advancement in the field of disaster management. We are good in response, but there are areas of improvement for overall management--especially, preparedness and early warning systems. We generally consider cyclone as a disaster and often consider flood as a regular phenomenon, not a disaster. If we look at the policy documents, we will see that drought, salinity and even arsenic are considered disaster but we pay least attention on these so far. If we compare the loss that occurs due to different disasters, flood is the highest while drought scores the fourth among all sorts of disasters. Again, if we analyse the loss and damage among different sectors, agricultural sector is the most affected one and farmers are the worst victims. The loss and damage due to drought or flood could be minimized largely by providing agro-meteorological information to the farmers well ahead. Practical Action demonstrates a model in Sirajganj for providing agro-meteorological services to access the farmers for catering their needs by tailoring the agricultural advices into voice message form with support from RIMES, DDM, FFWC, and DAE. The year round information flow prepares the farmers for receiving the messages as a part of their regular practice and thus makes them more prone to respond to the advices during disaster period immediately. Many organisations, including I/NGOs are setting examples of good and workable models which need to be mainstreamed by the government. Dr. Saleemul Huq, Director, ICCAD\n Bangladesh probably established the best Cyclone Warning System in the world. Last year, Cyclone Rouanu hit Bangladesh and nearly 2 million people took shelter at the cyclone centres, because now students know what to do, people know the signaling system and how and when to evacuate. Still we cannot tackle the flood in the same way. Government, NGOs, Media, Academia--all are trying something new and innovative from their own perspectives, scopes and opportunities. We have the latest technologies like smart phone, internet, social media etc. We can improve the system using this set up.  There are three important factors for effective early warning -generating the knowledge and forecasting with the technical expertise, communicating the knowledge through proper dissemination and response of the recipients upon receiving the information. We should think about the long-term solution if we work collectively, we can improve the total system keeping the time horizon in mind. We should invest in the children and youths  to prepare them for making the world more resilient."

      "text": "    Brig. Gen. Shahedul Anam Khan ndc, psc (Retd.), Associate Editor, The Daily Star and Moderator of the Session\n Bangladesh is one of the worst sufferers of climate change. The north-west part of Bangladesh has improved a lot in the last few years in terms of both poverty and employment but the adverse impacts of climate change are putting our progress at risk. We need to address this issue immediately. Today, we want to discuss how we can face this situation and tackle it in the best way possible.             Peter Dietzel, Executive Director, NETZ \n The richest ten percent of the global population is responsible for almost half of the carbon dioxide emissions, while the poorest ten percent causes only one percent of the emissions. The reason for this imbalance is the lifestyle of the rich - people who have money, consume more, buy more and travel more. The people with the lowest income are the least responsible for causing climate change. But they are the most vulnerable to the consequences. In this context, we have organised this roundtable discussion.           Habibur Rahman Chowdhury, Country Director, NETZ Bangladesh\n NETZ has been working on disaster management since the cyclone in 1991. In the last twenty years, we concentrated our interventions in the northwestern region, particularly in Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions. We have tried to address river erosion, flooding, water scarcity and other natural disasters through various programmes. We supported the poorest people to whom government support hardly reaches. We formed small groups and ran awareness campaigns. We provided these people with trainings on various skills and assets and thus created alternative job opportunities for them. Most importantly, we ensured education for their children so that they can break out of the vicious cycle of poverty. So far, we have been able to improve the livelihoods of three lakh people of the region.            Dr. Atiq Rahman, Executive Director, Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS)\n If you consider the world as a whole, you don't think about the poor; it is the change in temperature and climate that comes to your mind immediately. Similarly, if you think of Bangladesh, you think of the effects on the environment, not how people living here are affected. But when we focus on a certain area, we see how much people have lost. That is why we should work on particular areas, one at a time. One thing I have learnt is that it is not the average that matters, it is the extreme that matters. 100 percent of the people in the northwestern area have said that the heat and humidity have both increased over the past few years, which matches our scientific data as well. If the policymakers listen to these people, their climate-related policies will be pro-people and effective.       Dr. Dwijen Mallick, Fellow, Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS)\n In our study, we analysed the data of the last 35 years of some areas of the northwestern region. It was found that the trend in temperature rise in summer over 1981 to 2016 is very high. On average, the temperature in the summer is 36 degrees Celsius. However, in some cases it went up to 42 degrees. It is estimated that in the coming years, it will go up by 2/3 degrees more. In the same way, we see abrupt changes in rainfall as well. The average rainfall in a year remains the same over the years but the timing is changing; sometimes there is more rainfall before the rainy season but less during. We are seeing reflections of the same findings in our household surveys and participatory research studies conducted in the region. This coalescence will help to do a proper vulnerability analysis and find an effective adaptation strategy. The main observation in our research studies is that climate change is resulting in huge adverse impacts on every sector related to the livelihoods of the people in the northwestern region, particularly small farming and livestock. Our research also shows that the indigenous people of the northwest are suffering from food insecurity. They remain unemployed for six months. They don't have enough means to buy three meals. Their food basket is also very narrow - only carbohydrates. Hence, they suffer from malnutrition which directly affects their ability to work. It is a vicious cycle. They are the worst sufferers of climate change. In the existing patriarchal social structure, women are already in a vulnerable position. The climate change factors are pushing them further into the danger zone. Through our research we tried to find out effective adaptation strategies for these vulnerable groups. Although they have their own form of adaptation techniques, they are still lagging behind in terms of knowledge, skills and resources. We have pinpointed some specific sectors where they can find employment such as small farming, courtyard vegetation, and poultry.   Mizanur Rahman Bijoy, Researcher and Coordinator, Network on Climate Changes in Bangladesh (NCC,B)\n The northwest remains neglected in terms of allocation of development resources. For example, if we look at ADP allocation in environment, climate change and disaster management sectors, the northwestern region received the least amount of funds in 2016. Again, Dhaka and Chattogram use up 56 and 55 percent, respectively, of total electricity production in the country while Rangpur receives the lowest amount of electricity, only 32 percent. Still, majority of the solar home systems, which is meant for people who can't afford electricity, was sent to Chattogram and Dhaka! Considering the backward situation of Rangpur region, a government study recommended allocation of at least 10 percent of the ADP to this region. Unfortunately, we haven't seen any reflection of this recommendation in the last five years' development budget. The northwest also remains neglected in the government's climate change related policies and plans. To bring change to this hopeless situation, we must raise our voice and create political pressure on the government. Rajshahi Agricultural Improvement Bank and Barind Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA) are two key institutions that can play a big role in improving the situation of the northwestern region, particularly in tackling climate change effects, if they are properly governed and strengthened with adequate resources and policy support.     Costantina Hasdak, Member, Deopara Union Parishad, Godagari, DASCOH, Rajshahi\n I am a Santal. We live in the north Barind region. For the last few years, we have been suffering badly from the abrupt changes of temperature during both winter and summer. Unbearable heat and cold have also become very damaging for our livestock and crops. Sometimes, the temperature rises so much that there is a shortage of water. We are not even getting water through deep tube wells as the water level in the region is going down. We have to travel 2-3 kilometres to fetch drinking water. Therefore, many people drink water from nearby ponds which is causing serious illnesses. The severity of the water crisis has reached such levels that many Santals are leaving their homes in search of employment. We urge the government to take immediate action to solve the water crisis.          Musammot Arifa Begum, Member of Dak Die Jai village group, Umorpara, Dimla, Pollisree, Nilphamari\n We live along the banks of the Teesta River. Every year we suffer from river erosion. It becomes really difficult for us to find employment. We have to work as day labourers which means we are poorly paid. The situation has been improving due to various interventions by Pollisree. They are creating alternative employment opportunities and providing livestock. Such programmes need to be replicated in the whole northwestern region.           Kagji Bala, Member of Manjhipara Women's Self Help Group, Ramna, Chilmari, MJSKS Kurigram\n I have been a victim of river erosion for the last two decades. I had to shift my house 20 times. This time I had to take shelter on the street and stayed there for a whole month. The support we get from the government is next to nothing. Also, as an old person, I can't travel a long way to receive relief. I urge the government to take immediate action to protect our lives and livelihoods from the wrath of the mighty Brahmaputra. MJSKS has provided us with some livestock. We need more such support in our region.           Shamim Ara Begum, Executive Director, Pollisree, Dinajpur\n We have observed dense fog at the wrong time of the day which harms agriculture. While seeking alternative solutions to unemployment, we introduced crops of different varieties that can withstand the changes. However, it takes time to make local people familiar with the cultivation process of new crops. Now, our priority is to make them aware of the early warning system so that they can communicate with the Water Development Board, meteorological department and department of livestock services to lessen the damaging impact of climate change induced disasters. Due to lack of flood centres people have to seek shelter in local schools during a disaster. Adolescent girls become particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment since there are no separate compartments for men and women in those makeshift shelters.       Akramul Haque, Chief Executive Office, DASCOH Foundation\n Our population census is faulty. It doesn't represent the real number of plain land indigenous people as they are often categorised under different religions. When they are not represented in the census properly, how can we expect proper budgetary allocation for them and ensure that their voices are heard? Policymakers should consider this issue very seriously. There is a lack of coordination between BMDA and Water Development Board. If BMDA can strengthen their management system, Water Development Board can hand over the irrigation projects to them which will improve the overall irrigation system in Barind region. The government has taken an initiative of digging canals in the northwestern region. There is no point in digging more canals unless a proper water storage facility can be developed. Waterlogging is another problem that should be addressed immediately by the Water Board. Dams and roads are built without leaving any room for drainage which causes serious waterlogging.     Shyamal Chandra Sarker, Director, MJSKS\n There are 16 rivers in the Kurigram region. We often suffer from overflooding which makes local people vulnerable and forces them to migrate. Earlier, there was a river port in Kurigram which created employment opportunities for many people. There were also abundant fish resources in the rivers. But now the rivers are gradually being silted and other areas are becoming inundated. The inundation results in fatal consequences, including an increase in physical vulnerability and loss of biodiversity.  Research organisations should step forward to address the damages of this region. Due to irregular funds and short tenure of project, NGO intervention in our region is very limited. To address this gap, we need to set up village-level knowledge and learning banks which will develop action points towards mitigating the climate risks in the region.           Dr. Ahsan Ali, Executive Director, Ashrai\n In the High Barind area, arable lands are being turned into fruit orchards as deep tube wells cannot be set up due to the rock layers. The change in the agriculture system has affected the employment opportunities of the region and resulted in internal migration. Earlier, people from other regions used to come to this area for work during paddy harvesting season. Abrupt changes in weather are also causing an outbreak of various types of new diseases such as kala-azar in the area. To create employment opportunities, we need to develop private enterprises in the northwestern region. There is also an urgent need for establishing technical schools for the indigenous communities so that they can get opportunities to learn new skills.         Md. Shamsuddoha, Chief Executive Officer, CPRD\n Our disaster management policy doesn't extensively address the new types of disasters such as dense fog, heatstroke and flash flood. Therefore, researchers should explore these issues deeply and share the findings with the policymakers. Public goods are now being turned into private assets, either through illegal occupation or with the state's approval. The poorest section of the population, particularly indigenous communities, is heavily dependent on public goods such as khas land to earn a livelihood.   Therefore, we need to ensure good governance keeping in sight the developmental perspective. For example, we can't ensure available drinking water for the water-scarce regions unless the water bodies are not freed from illegal occupation. The Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) has been assigned to dig tube wells for safe water. But we need to keep in mind that if water levels deplete in the northern region and salinity increases in the southern side, we won't be able to extract water, no matter how many tube wells we dig on the surfaces. Public goods should be invested for common people and maintaining strict rules and regulations is required.     Kazi Amdadul Haque, Director, Strategic Planning and Head of Climate Change Adaptation & Disaster Management, Friendship Bangladesh\n There are many indigenous adaptation mechanisms that should be incorporated into our mainstream adaptation plan. During my visit to Kurigram, for example, I learned that local people do not cut down some trees as those plants prevent floodwater intrusion. The union councils and district councils should consider the concept of adaptation when they take up different initiatives. Friendship constructed an oval-shaped shelter for the destitute and proved that this type of construction is helpful for preventing water intrusion. It astonishes me when I see that climate funds are being used to construct flyovers in Banani.           Md. Mudasser Billah, Former Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock\n The most intimidating impact of climate change is on food security and livestock. In winter, a large number of chickens die because of the sharp decrease in temperature. Therefore, people in the northwestern region no longer see rearing chicken as an income-generating option. Similarly, during floods, farmers can't feed and provide shelter to their cows and goats so they have to sell them at a very low price. The government and private sector must come forward to save livestock from the adverse impacts of climate change.             Zunaid Ali Saqee, Media Consultant, Friendship Bangladesh\n While working with the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, I came to know about the new types of disaster, thunderstorm and lightning. In North Bengal, unexpected hailstorm poses threats to mango production. In monsoon, many people are killed by lightning as well.             Bahauddin Bahar, Project Coordinator, PLCCR Project, BARCIK\n BMDA focuses mainly on infrastructural development. However, they do some crop and seed production projects but those are not concerned with crop diversification and generation of new varieties. The market system also plays an important role in determining production of crops. For example, although tomatoes and potatoes are climate-resilient crops, farmers are not interested in the cultivation of these vegetable as they don't get their expected price.           Salim Reza, Programme Manager, Pollisree, Dinajpur\n There should be collaboration between the local academic institutions and NGOs to fight climate change impacts in the northwest part of the country. We also need to encourage young people to participate in these programmes.                 Jahangir Alam, APC, DASCOH, Rajshahi\n Naogaon has long been known for paddy cultivation but last year it became the second highest mango-producing district with 29,000 hectares of land of mango orchards, expecting to surpass the mango capital of Chapainawabganj in the next two years. Therefore, a large number of people including indigenous people are losing their livelihoods. The lands suitable for paddy production are turning into orchards of different fruits due to severe water scarcity. This problem can be resolved only by creating access to adequate amount of water. Rajshahi WASA has taken up a project worth Tk 4,000 crore to bring water from Godagari which is 30km away. If water can be supplied from distant water bodies, the pressure on groundwater will lessen significantly.         Md. Israfil Alam, Member of Parliament, Naogaon-6\n Although half of the country's total population live in North Bengal, the area doesn't get adequate attention from the policymakers. Article 19 of our Constitution which stipulates equality of opportunity should be the basis of all the development programmes in the country. North Bengal is popular for harvesting Rabi crops such as wheat, mustard and peas. Since farmers can't preserve Rabi crops due to climate change effects, they are switching to paddy farming. Unfortunately, farmers do not get their expected price from selling paddy. There is also a serious lack of storage facilities for paddy; the government procurement process is always delayed; and syndicates manipulate prices. At the end of the day, it becomes really difficult for the farmers to get even the production cost by selling their produce. Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank is more interested in providing industrial loans than agricultural loans. Farmers have to go through a lot of hassle to get agricultural loans. They even have to bribe the officials and brokers. Due to climate change our rivers are dying and fishermen are losing their jobs. During drought even ponds dry up and people can't do pisciculture. Many deep wells and shallow tube wells are being placed. As the groundwater level is depleting, sometimes it becomes difficult to get water through deep tube wells. Therefore, we have to free up large water bodies from illegal occupation. Digging more canals will help to reduce pressure on groundwater. There is a lot of money in the climate fund but it is not being allocated properly. The climate fund must reach the people who need it the most.      Fazle Hossain Badsha, Member of Parliament, Rajshahi-2 \n I am currently preparing a document on the northwestern region. The climate change related issues of the region will get required attention in the paper. North Bengal is self-sufficient in rice. It is the main producer of fruits and vegetables. It also provides 80 percent of our total freshwater fish. If the region is severely affected by climate change, the whole country will suffer gravely. In today's discussion, we have talked about the climate change induced disasters happening in the region. I have also brought these issues before the Parliament umpteen times. Unfortunately, the poor people of the region remain neglected in our budget and development policies. Unless and until we can create political pressure on the government, the situation will not change. We also need to be careful about unplanned industrialisation in North Bengal as I have heard of a plan of relocating tanneries to that region. Industrialisation which is not labour intensive and environment friendly must not be extended there.   Peter Dietzel We are accountable mainly to the people who contribute least to climate change but suffer the most. We are accountable to them for whatever we do in our mitigation and adaptation strategies. Those people and their efforts should be supported with topmost priority. This is the key message from today's roundtable.  "

Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC) said heavy rainfall is likely due to the advent of Fani that might trigger flash floods in the north-eastern and northern regions. It has issued a special bulletin warning that the waters of Brahmaputra, Jamuna, Surma, Kushiara, Kangsa, Jadukata, and Tista may rise sharply due to the rainfall. The warning, issued yesterday, is still applicable, especially in the Haor regions, Md Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, executive engineer at the FFWC, told The Daily Star this evening. The flash flood situation that might arise, caused due to rainfall rooted into the approaching cyclone Fani, will subside after the cyclonic storm eases, he said. Tidal surges four to five feet higher than the usual is on the forecast for the coastal regions at Chattogram, Noakhali, Feni, Chandpur, Barguna, Bhola, Patuakhali, Barishal, Pirojpur, Jhalakathi, Bagerhat, Khulna, and Satkhira."

      "text": "The once-mighty Korotoa now barely flows through Bogura district. Issues like unbridled pollution, a regulator that obstructs natural flow, and gradual decrease in water from upstream have almost chocked the river down, said experts and locals. Over a 100-kilometre stretch of the Korotoa now flows with as less width as a canal in different parts of the district throughout the year. Originated from the Himalayas, the river enters Bangladesh through Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts of West Bengal in India. A section of the Korotoa flows over Bogura via Khalshi village in Gobindaganj upazila of Gaibandha. During a recent visit to the village, this correspondent found that the river was reduced to what looked like a drain. Many residential establishments were also seen on both banks of the river. According to locals, the river started drying up after a regulator was constructed at Khalshi village in 1996. The three-vent regulator was constructed with a hope of preventing floods in the area by controlling the water flow. Raja Mia Sarkar, a 65-year-old resident of the village, said, \"The regulator may have saved the village from floods, but the river gradually dried up.\" \"There was a time when hundreds of boats and large vessels used to ply on the river every day,\" recollected 78-year-old Montezer Rahman, another resident of the same village. Contacted, Mahbubul Alam, sub-divisional engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) in Gaibandha, said the authorities set up the regulator at the village to prevent floods in Gobindaganj and its adjacent areas. \"The regulator was a part of Nurulla Beel project,\" he added. He, however, declined to make any comment over the side-effects of the regulator. Seeking anonymity, a WDB official in Gaibandha said any man-made construction that influences flow of river has side-effects. After the Khalshi regulator was constructed, the downstream or down Korotoa's bed started rising and silts started filling up \"turning the river into a sewerage drain\". An official of WDB in Bogura, who also sought anonymity, echoed the statement. Contacted, Mukhlasur Rahman, executive engineer of WDB in Gaibandha, said, \"Khalshi regulator has not been used for a single day in the last 15 years.\" Asked about the purpose of the regulator, he kept mum for a few moments. He then said they prepared a Tk 2,665-crore  project to improve the condition of the Korotoa which is now pending at the planning commission for approval. The three-vent regulator in Khalshi would be replaced by a 10-vent one if the proposed project gets approval. The proposed regulator would increase water flow, he added. A SAGA OF POLLUTION \nThe municipality and some non-government organisations are at the top of the river polluters' list in the district, according to the Department of Environment (DoE) in Bogura.\nAshrafuzzaman, director of the DoE's Rajshahi Divisional Office, said, \"These local-government and non-government organisations have been continuously dumping their waste, both liquid and solid, into the river for years even after repeated warnings.\"\nWaste from hundreds of hospitals, clinics, diagnosis centres, households, marketplaces, are falling into the river through the sewerage drains of the municipality, he added.\nAround three months ago, the DoE served a notice to the municipality mayor to check measures for stopping river pollution. The notice also warned the municipality authorities of legal actions if they did not stop harming the river, he said.\nThe municipality, however, seem to be paying no heed to the notice, the DoE official further said.\nThis correspondent, during his visit to different parts of the town, found that liquid and sold wastes, including the plastic waste, were indiscriminately being dumped into the Korotoa through large sewerage drains of the Bogura Municipality.\nContacted, AKM Mahbubur Rahman, mayor of Bogura Municipality, refuted the allegations.\nHe said, \"We are collecting waste from houses, and sending them to the dumping station in Matidali area. Sometimes, residents of the town drop their household waste to the municipality drains and it goes into the river.\"\n\"Our waste management system is better than many other towns,\" he added.\nAbout the medical waste, the mayor said the municipality was \"not dealing with the medical waste\". There is an NGO called Sapna that maintains the medical wastes, he added.\nThe mayor, at one point of the conversation, admitted that most of the six lakh residents of the municipality were not complying with their instruction of not connecting their toilets to sewerage drains.\nZiaur Rahman, executive director of Sapna, said they collect only the solid waste of 122 hospitals, clinics and diagnostic centres in the town and dispose them at the Matidali landfill.\nGM Suclyan Bitul, secretary of the Bogura District Clinics and Diagnosis Centres Owners Association, said private medical establishments in the town usually collect medical waste in three different bins and give it to Sapna.\nAt times, some clinics' staffers may drop their liquid waste into the municipally sewerage drains, but we have strictly forbidden them from doing it.\nMojumder Products Limited, an auto-rice mill that also produces rice bran oil, is another major river polluter in the district. The DoE has fined the company for discharging untreated water into the river.\nAdmitting that the DoE has fined the company Taka 9.68 lakh in November last year, Ranjan Chakraborty, admin officer of the rice mill, said they were storing the discharged water in a specific place and that they would establish an effluent treatment plant soon.\nZiaur Rahman, secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Bachao Andolan (BAPA) in Bogura, said they found at least 500 small and large drains, including the municipality's ones, discharging contaminated and harmful waste into the Korotoa.\nCHEMICAL SUBSTANCES JEOPARDISING ECO-SYSTEM \nAccording to the latest water analysis report of the DoE, published in December last year, only 3 to 3.6 mg dissolved oxygen (DO) was remaining in each litre of water at the Korotoa for seven to eight months.\nThe ratio is three to four times lower than other rivers in Rajshahi division.\nThe DoE regularly examines water samples at eight points, both upstream and downstream, of the river.\nThe rate of the dissolved oxygen in river water should ideally be between 4.5 and 8 mg per litre, as per the Environment Conservation Rules, 97.\nMoreover, the report shows the presence of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and a lack of biological oxygen demand (BOD) that hampers river's aquatic lives.\nThese chemical substances and acidic water are eventually jeopardising the eco-system of the river, said Masud Rana, a chemist at the Bogura environment office.\n The municipality and some non-government organisations are at the top of the river polluters' list in the district, according to the Department of Environment (DoE) in Bogura.

The ratio is three to four times lower than other rivers in Rajshahi division. The DoE regularly examines water samples at eight points, both upstream and downstream, of the river. The rate of the dissolved oxygen in river water should ideally be between 4.5 and 8 mg per litre, as per the Environment Conservation Rules, 97. Moreover, the report shows the presence of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and a lack of biological oxygen demand (BOD) that hampers river's aquatic lives. These chemical substances and acidic water are eventually jeopardising the eco-system of the river, said Masud Rana, a chemist at the Bogura environment office."

A number of rivers in these districts are flowing above the danger level. Besides, flash flood damaged flood protection embankments, homesteads and crops, worsening the situation. The flood victims have been facing a shortage of dry food and pure drinking water. Several thousands of people have taken shelter at different shelter centres set up by the government. Relief materials have been given to the flood-hit people. Thousands of residents of 90 villages have been waterlogged in two upazilas of Moulvibazar and one upazila of Habiganj in Sylhet Division as the Khowai, Manu and Dhalai rivers swelled up. Floods also hit the Indian state of Assam, which usually has a ripple effect in this division. The Manu was flowing 175 centimetres above the danger level at Manu Railway Bridge point in Kulaura upazila of Moulvibazar, said Shankar Chakraborty, executive engineer of Water Development Board's (WDB) local office. Also, the Dhalai was flowing 52 centimetres above the danger level at Dhalai Bridge point in Kamalganj, he added. The water levels might rise further in the next 24 hours, he warned. The onrush of hilly water damaged flood protection embankments in the districts worsening the flood situation. Thousands of people are facing a food and pure drinking water crisis. A number of villages in Kamalganj and Kulaura upazilas have been inundated due to the swelling of the rivers. Kamalganj Municipal Mayor Jewel Ahmed said five points of the Dhalai river protection dam collapsed, flooding around 30 villages and increasing the apprehension of damaging homesteads and crops. Mohammad Mahmudul Huq, upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) of Kamalganj, said around 30 villages and 3,200 families have been affected by the flash flood and crops damaged on 700 hectares of land. The upazila administration of Kamalganj distributed rice among 125 flood-affected families in Karimpur and Munshibazar areas yesterday. Several hundred volunteers have been working to protect dams on the Manu river at Miarpara and Khandakarer villages, said M Abdul Malik, chairman of Tilagaon Union Parishad. Chairman of Sharifpur UP M Janab Ali said a 200-250-foot stretch of the flood protection embankment collapsed at Chatalghat village, making the bridge over the Manu vulnerable. Chowdhury Mohammad Golam Rabbi, UNO of Kulaura, said around 60 villages and 2,500 families have been affected by flash flood in the upazila. The upazila administration got 50 tonnes of rice from the DC office for the flood-affected families, he added. All kinds of establishments in 60 villages in Kulaura, including schools, madrasas, mosques, temples, cropland and fish farms went under water, the UNO added. The Khowai in Habiganj was flowing 180 centimetres above the danger mark in the town point, said Tauhidul Islam, executive engineer of WDB's Habiganj office. The town protection dyke has been facing a threat of collapse in different points due to the increase in water level, he added. The low-lying areas along the dyke have been inundated, he informed. The upazila administration of Kamalganj has distributed rice among 125 flood-affected families in Karimpur and Munshibazar areas yesterday, said Mohammad Mahmudul Huq, UNO of Kamalganj. In Sylhet, several villages of Rajaganj and Laksmiprashad Purbo unions and upazila sadar bazar of Kanaighat have been affected by flash flood yesterday afternoon. According to WDB in Sylhet, the Surma was flowing at 13.7 metres yesterday afternoon which was 7.89 metres on Tuesday. It is around 145 centimetres above the danger level. The Kushiyara was also overflowing 70 centimetres above the danger level at Amalshid point and 35 centimetres at Sheola point. In Rangamati, several villages in Baghaichhari upazila have been submerged due to heavy rain, making thousands of people marooned. Hundreds of families have already taken shelter at 20 shelter centres opened up by the upazila administration. Many schools have been flooded and road communication has been disconnected with other upazilas. Around 300 ponds in the upazila have been flooded due to heavy rainfall and about 500 acres of land was submerged. Baghaichhari UNO Muhammad Nadeem Sarwar said apart from rescuing the flood-hit people, they were also providing dry food and pure water. Officials of different institutions and many voluntary organisations also took part in the rescue work. Nuyen Khisa, medical officer of Baghaichhari Upazila Health Complex, said they formed eight medical teams for eight unions in the upazila for emergency treatment to the flood victims. \"We are ready for treatment. Our doctors and nurse are working at every union,\" he said. In Khagrachhari, many areas in the Sadar are still under water. The Changi river was flowing above the danger level due to heavy downpour in last two days. Eight shelter centres have been opened for the flood-affected people where several hundred families have taken refuge. In Cox's Bazar, around 20,000 people have been marooned in Garzonia and Kachchapia unions of Ramu upazila following heavy rain. A three-year-old child drowned at Bomangkhil village in Garzonia. The villagers recovered the body later. In Feni, 12 villages have been inundated by incessant rain in last three days with flash flood down from India devouring areas in Fulgazi and Parshuram upazilas, marooning inhabitants. The onrush of water caused breach in the embankment of the Muhuri river at 10 points. In many homesteads, people could not cook due to flood. WDB Executive Engineer Md Kohinoorr Alam said the Muhuri was flowing 300 centimetres above the danger level. In Chittagong, three upazilas were inundated due to incessant rainfall for last three days as of yesterday morning causing several thousand people marooned, reports UNB. Severe flooding has been reported in Hathazari, Raozan and Fatikchhari upazilas that caused untold sufferings to the people. In Hathazari, regional roads, fish enclosures, houses and business establishments were submerged by the rainwater. Besides, embankments of the Halda river collapsed at different points, increasing the woes of the people. The Hathazari-Rangamati, Hathazari-Khagrachhari and Hathazari-Oxygen highways were inundated causing immense sufferings to the commuters, UNB reports. The local administration has taken all-out preparations to tackle any kind of natural disasters, UNB says quoting Akterunnesa Sheuli, UNO of Hathazari. The inhabitants of the low-lying areas have been asked to take shelter in local education institutions, she said.

      "text": "Online sales of sacrificial cows have been met with a setback this year for floods in northern parts of the country and the dengue epidemic.  \"We got a bit of a shock this year,\" said Rezawan Ullah Khan, head of brand and category development at Bengal Meat Processing Industries, the pioneer in this field. Last year, two weeks before Eid-ul-Azha, most of Bengal Meat's cattle were sold. But this year, only 250 cows were sold since sales opened on July 13. Bengal Meat has targeted to sell about 800 cows this year for Eid-ul-Azha, due to be held on August 12. In order to drive up the sales, Bengal has called all its buyers from last year but a good number of them are yet to make their decision, Khan said, adding that they will take orders for live cattle until August 8. Eshita Sharmin, head of marketing of Bikroy.com, which has been selling sacrificial cattle since 2014, echoed the same.\"The response so far is not quite satisfactory. Our prospective customers from cities are still waiting and want to observe the situation, especially on dengue.\" This year, Bikroy.com has targeted to sell more than a few thousand cattle. Last year, it sold 2,293, up 45.40 percent year-on-year. More than 10,000 cattle advertisements are up on Bikroy.com, according to Sharmin. Bengal Meat's average cow price is Tk 80,000, while more than 50 percent of Bikroy's cows are priced less than Tk 50,000. However, Daraz.com is very optimistic about online cattle sales this year. The e-commerce platform is resuming its online cattle marketplace this year after a one-year break. It has launched a project called Nandini exclusively with the ActionAid to supply 100 organically fed cows. The cows were raised in remote areas of Gaibandha and are priced between Tk 42,080 and Tk 159,500. The last date of order is August 5 and the delivery will start from August 9. \"One of the primary objectives of Nandini is to source products and livestock from women entrepreneurs and deliver them to customers from all over the country,\" said Shayantani Twisha, its project lead. The practice of selling cattle online ahead of Eid-ul-Azha was introduced by e-commerce site amardesheshop.com in 2012. Because of the convenience afforded, it fast gained popularity among city-dwellers and expatriate Bangladeshis. Buyers can watch a few second clips of the cattle before they make their purchase decision. The payment can be made online too. The live cattle would be delivered to their doorstep. Not only that, they can also opt for full qurbani service, under which the company will slaughter the cow and deliver the meat. Sheba.xyz, a popular online service marketplace, however, is not supplying butchers this year due to quality control issues, said Adnan Imtiaz Halim, chief executive officer of the company. eCourier, a leading product delivery company in the country, used to transport qurbani meat on the day of Eid but this year it has decided to suspend the service.

      "text": "As we enter the new year of 2020, we are in fact making a very significant transition when it comes to the issue of climate change. The first transition is a semantic one, but nevertheless a very significant one, namely that in 2019 we acknowledged that the climate change problem has become the climate change \"emergency\". This means that we need to prioritise it like we have never done before. In scientific terms it means that the adverse impacts, and associated loss and damage, from climatic events such as floods, droughts, cyclones and wildfires can now be clearly attributed to the fact that human induced climate change has raised global temperature by over one degree centigrade from pre-industrial times and that abnormally severe events have now become the \"new normal\". At the same time a new constituency of activists have arrived on the global scene with the potential to make a significant difference, namely the school strikers led by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. The scientific community had been warning global policymakers for several decades about the potential dangers of human induced climate change and the need to take action. And then the adversely affected vulnerable developing countries like Bangladesh and Tuvalu had added their voices in the last decade and the global leaders were able to agree on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change at the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) in December 2015. However, since the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement by Trump and the election of leaders like Bolsanaro in Brazil and Scott Morrison in Australia, these leaders have decided to block any further action to tackle the climate change emergency. This fact became abundantly clear at the recently concluded COP25 held in Madrid, Spain (but under the presidency of Chile) where despite adding two extra days (and nights!) to the negotiations, they failed to reach an agreement on several critical issues. Thus if the UNFCCC is to retain any sense of credibility, the United Kingdom who will be hosting COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2020 need to think out of the box to change the format of the event as business as usual has been demonstrated to be unfit for the purpose. At the same time, the actuality of the climate change impact around the world brings a new dimension to the task of tackling the climate emergency that all countries will have to deal with locally, nationally, as well as globally. At the global level, we now need to develop coalitions of the willing amongst governments of countries, both developing as well as developed, who want to take action to tackle climate change. Here Bangladesh has an important opportunity to play a leadership role, as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina will be taking over the chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) from President Hilda Heine of the Marshall Islands in mid-2020 and will be chair for the following two years. At the bilateral level Bangladesh can join forces with the UK, as it has already done during the UN Secretary General's Climate Action Summit in New York last September as part of the adaptation and resilience track. The two countries can develop their cooperation further in the run up to COP26 in November. At the national level in Bangladesh, the UK can also provide support, as it has been doing for some time to Bangladesh's Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan which will be revised and launched in 2020 taking it to 2030. One element of such a bilateral strategy between the UK and Bangladesh could be the development of an action research programme to tackle climate change and development related issues which would benefit other Least Developed Countries (LDCs), as well through South-South Cooperation. At the same time, Bangladesh can play a leading role as the global champion of Community Based Adaptation (CBA) and supporting locally led adaptation around the world. This would build on the launch of the locally led adaptation Action Track of the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) to be launched at the Gobeshona conference on climate change research into action on January 20. The government of the Netherlands has offered to help Bangladesh set up a South Asian Regional Centre for Adaptation in Dhaka from 2020, which could become a means of sharing our experience and knowledge with our neighbouring countries in the region as well. Bangladesh is pioneering the application of the concepts of whole-of-government as well as whole-of-society involvement not only in tackling climate change, but also for all 17 of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where we aim to achieve those goals by 2030. Thus the year 2020 can indeed become the start of a new era for Bangladesh, as well as for the world, where we change the narrative from being one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, to becoming one of the most resilient countries, by offering to share our knowledge and experience with other countries both through South-South as well as South-North cooperation. This could indeed become a new foreign policy strategy for Bangladesh going into the new decade.

Besides, many roads of the upazila headquarters went under knee-deep water, causing immense sufferings to the home- bound people ahead of the Eid. The situation worsened after a portion of the embankment on the eastern side of the Sonai river collapsed on Saturday. General Secretary of Bangladesh Paribesh Andolon, Habiganj chapter, Tofazzal Sohel said vast tracts of croplands and vegetable fields in more than 30 villages have been submerged and fish in a number of ponds washed away due to the flash flood. Flash flood also caused waterlogging in different areas of Habiganj town and submerged many educational institutions, markets and residential areas, he said, adding that people of Habiganj town have long been suffering from waterlogging due to unplanned drainage system and illegal grabbing of the Khowai river. Locals alleged that unplanned development work and siltation in the Khowai river have prolonged the water logging problem. Habiganj Water Development Board (WDB) Executive Engineer Tawhidul Islam said many villages have been flooded due to collapse of a portion of the flood control embankment on the Sonai river in Madhabpur upazila. Away in Brahmanbaria, the contractor of a construction firm has dismantled a bridge on an important road in Bijoynagar upazila that connects four unions and an upazila to reconstruct it allegedly without approval of the authorities concerned. Although traffic movement was continuing through a diversion road underneath the bridge, sudden onrush of water from the hills in the Indian state of Tripura on Saturday inundated the diversion road, disrupting vehicular movement on Awlia Bazar-Singarbil-Akhaura regional road.   The contractor concerned and Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) authorities admitted the fact, they are yet to take any steps in this regard."

Many families in char areas of Gaibandha were living in waist-deep deluged houses raising their bedstead above the water level on bamboo poles. Click on the markers on the map and zoom in to see details on the flood situation in 12 districts of Bangladesh.  Meanwhile in Kurigram, water of the Dharla, Teesta and Dudhkumar started receding, according to the district Water Development Board. A portion of the flood protection embankment eroded at Bahuka under Ratankandi union of Sirajganj Sadar upazila around 8:00pm on Thursday, said local Union Parishad Member Md Tarikul Islam. He said water from the Jamuna submerged Bahuka, Shimla, Itali, Balighugri, Chilgacha, Gogaria, Pachthakuri and 30 adjoining villages due to the sudden erosion. Hasan Imam, executive engineer of Sirajganj Water Development Board, said WDB workers along with army men were trying to repair the embankment by dumping sand bags and installing bamboo enclosures, he said. Wazed Ali, a schoolteacher from Shimla, said the villages went under water within a few hours and people could not shift their belongings. \"Most of them left home without their household items,\" he said. District Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Md Abdur Rahim told The Daily Star the villagers mostly took shelter on the flood protection embankment. \"Flood water entered the villages rapidly and schools and other institutions went under water. We could not open any flood shelter.\" He said the district administration distributed 100 packets of relief materials among the victims. In Gaibandha, flood situation remained unchanged yesterday with the Jamuna flowing above the danger mark due to onrush of water from the upstream, reports our Gaibandha correspondent. District Primary Education Officer Aminul Islam Mandol said 141 educational institutes remained closed in flood-affected Sundarganj, Gaibandha Sadar, Phulchhari and Saghata upazilas. Seventy families in Goghat were shifted to other places due to river erosion in the last two days, locals said. Lucky Begum, a housewife at a char land of Purbo Ratanpur under Phulchhari, said in fear of looting of their belongings by robbers, adult family members were staying at home. Gaibandha Deputy Commissioner Gautam Chandra Pal said adequate relief materials were provided to the flood victims. In Kurigram, the Brahmaputra was flowing 34cm above the danger level at Chilmari Ghat point yesterday noon, said district WDB sources. They said water levels of other rivers were below the danger mark. Meanwhile, Relief and Disaster Management Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya yesterday urged doctors to visit shelter centres in flood-affected areas regularly to tackle water-borne diseases, says a press release. \"The absence of doctors will not be tolerated,\" he told a meeting on flood situation at Jamalpur Deputy Commissioner's office.

The confidence of the government was so high that it had actually put in place a plan to export 40-50 lakh tonnes of rice in May last year. However, 12 months on, the scenario is different. Ever since the floods devastated the Haor region, the country's main breadbasket, in March this year, Bangladesh has been frantically working on deals to import rice from Vietnam, Cambodia, India and a couple of other countries. Just when you think you have a surplus amount of food and there is no cause for concern, in comes a devastating flood that compels you to import in order to stay afloat. It just goes on to show how crippling the effect of severe climatic disasters, such as floods, can be. An analysis of the flood statistics in Bangladesh displays an ominous trend. Numbers from the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) suggest that the intensity of floods--when the flood coverage is taken into account--in Bangladesh has been increasing with time. In the last 30 years, from 1987 to 2017, the country witnessed seven floods that inundated or devoured more than one-third of the nation. Prior to that, between 1956 to 1986, this benchmark was surpassed just once, in 1974. Each of these floods has caused plenty of destruction and havoc, and the increase in frequency is not good news. In between 1980 to 1990, more than 35 percent of the nation went under water twice, first in 1987 and then in 1988. In 1987, close to 40 percent of the country was under water, while more than 60 percent of the nation was below water in 1988. The period between 1990 and 2000 witnessed a more threatening trend. From 1995 to 2000, the country witnessed floods, which consistently inundated more than 20 percent of the country every year. This includes the disastrous floods of 1998, which saw 70 percent of the country drown. These were by far the worst floods Bangladesh had ever witnessed. In between 2000 and 2010, 40 percent of the nation went under water in 2004 and 2007. The assessment period for this year is still underway, but it is certain that more than 40 percent of the country has already been affected in 2017. There is a fear that  this number may increase. Dr Atiq Rahman, Executive Director of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS) and an eminent climate expert, agrees that floods are becoming more and more intense every year. He, however, bases his statement on more than just the flood coverage factor. According to him, the intensity of the flood also depends upon how badly the agricultural products are affected. He highlights the recent floods in the Haor region, to explain his point. \"Had the floods arrived to the Haors a little later, the farmers would have cut their crops and they wouldn't have worried about the chest-high water. They would, on the contrary, be happy and singing baul songs because they would have gotten a bumper crop and that would have helped them live without any worries for three years. There are plenty of factors to consider,\" he says. He attributes the recent floods in the country to climate change and states the examples of Rangpur and Dinajpur regions which witnessed the worst ever floods in the last three decades.  \"There was an unprecedented amount of water from the Tibetan Plateau, particularly from the slope coming from Nepal. The rainfall from Nepal and China gushed in during the last few days. The erratic rainfall and sharpness of the rapid flow were factors that were unprecedented. That's why I call it climate change. It goes beyond the variability of 30 years,\" explains Dr Atiq. The lack of preparedness hurt these two places a lot more than the other areas. \"A woman in Kurigram, for instance, will keep dry wood on the rooftop before the season of the floods, because she knows that no matter what happens, she will have to cook. She has a transportable chula. \"But can you expect people in Dhaka or Dinajpur to be like that? The amount of water that came into Rangpur and Dinajpur was unexpected. The floods in that region were not knee-high, not chest-high, but double the human height,\" says Dr Atiq. \"This was also the time before Eid and so they were fattening their animals. Their investment got affected badly. So that just made everything worse,\" he adds. It is not just floods that are displaying an increase in intensity. Tropical cyclones have also shown a similar trend. One of the most crucial factors for measuring the intensity of a cyclone is its wind speed. According to data from the SAARC Meteorological Research Centre (SMRC), between 1991 and 2009, Bangladesh witnessed five cyclones with a maximum wind speed of above 200 kph. On the contrary, between 1901 and 1990, the country had witnessed just one cyclone, in November 1970, which crossed the 200 kph barrier. This goes on to show that severe cyclones, or cyclones with high speeds, were a lot rarer in the early 1900s. Again, the amount of destruction or the number of casualties isn't exactly proportional to the increase in wind speed. For instance, the Bangladesh cyclone of 1991, which had a wind speed of 225 kph, reported more than one lakh casualties. Six years later, another cyclone hit the coast of Chittagong with a maximum windspeed of 230 kph. That cyclone, however, witnessed 155 deaths. What these numbers do show is that over the years Bangladesh has improved its resilience to cyclones with a systematic safety approach. Bangladesh's latest tryst with cyclones was when Mora threatened the country at the coast. The highest possible warning signals were displayed in all the coastal areas and people expected the worst. However, fortunately, the cyclone made landfall during the low tide, which significantly decreased the effect. Dr Atiq explains that the increase in wind speed over the years is a result of climate change. \"The earth's temperature has been gradually increasing ever since the pre-industrial era. As the temperature rises, evaporation increases and the cloud formation has a higher amount of water vapour. It carries more weight. It's like how a heavy-weight boxer packs a bigger punch than a light-weight boxer,\" he says. Aside from causing casualties and plenty of destruction, cyclones also push salt water into the fresh water areas in the coast, which increases the salinity of the water and in turn affects the farmers. Several farmers are then forced to quit their age-old profession and come to the city in order to support themselves. Aside from cyclones and floods, the changing pattern in rainfall is also adversely affecting the country. Professor AKM Saiful Islam, who works at the Institute of Water and Flood Management in the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), explains the erratic rainfall pattern. \"Our study shows that consecutive wet days will decrease in the future, although the total amount of rainfall in the country will increase. Therefore, the intensity of the rainfall will increase in the future, which can lead to an increase in extreme events such as flash floods,\" he says. What he basically means is that while the total amount of rainfall in Bangladesh has not decreased, the intensity has increased because there's more rain arriving in a shorter period of time. This change may not only cause extreme events such as floods, it can also affect the farmers who plan what to grow based on the season. Professor Saiful adds that there is a chance that the Haor regions may witness more flash floods. \"Many studies have already shown the connection between global warming and the changes in the frequency of certain extreme events on a global scale. Our studies have also shown the likely increase of the extreme precipitation in the Haor areas; consequently, flash floods could increase in the future. However, more extreme event attribution studies should be conducted to establish that global warming has added to the severity of flash flood events,\" he says. Floods in South Asia this year have killed more than 1000, affected at least 40 million and prevented more than a million children from going to school. Let's not forget it has compelled Bangladesh's agriculture ministry to change its strategy within just a year. One wonders what more it will take to change the mindset of certain influential world leaders, responsible for a large portion of the carbon up there in the atmosphere, who still don't seem to believe that climate change is real. Numbers related to cyclones and floods don't lie and it's quite clear that drastic measures need to be taken in order to ensure that these statistics don't reach a point of no return.

      "text": "The death toll in Nepal from flash floods and landslides in the past three days rose to 55 yesterday, with dozens missing and injured, the government said. Ten thousand people have been displaced from their homes as incessant monsoon rains pounded many areas in mostly mountainous Nepal since Thursday, submerging large swathes of land, inundating homes, and destroying bridges and roads across the country. The country's Home Ministry said in a statement that 55 people had been confirmed dead and 33 injured. There are 30 missing. India's northeastern state of Assam has also been hard hit by the floods brought by the monsoon, with at least 1.5 million people displaced and 10 dead. And in the Chittagong division of Bangladesh many people died and thousands displaced as 200 villages have been flooded. In Nepal, cabinet spokesman Gokul Banskota told reporters that \"the disaster has caused a big loss to the economy\". The government will make an assessment soon, he added. Nepal Red Cross spokesman Dibya Raj Poudel said the displaced had been sheltered in schools and other public buildings. Television channels showed roofs of houses submerged in flood waters in the southern plains and people wading through chest-deep water with their belongings on their heads. Officials said in some areas rains had eased but some rivers in the eastern part of the country were still above flood level. Authorities asked residents to remain alert. The Kosi River, which flows into the eastern Indian state of Bihar, was among those that had risen above the flood level. Nepal police official Ishwari Dahal said all 56 sluice gates of the Kosi barrage on the Nepal-India border had been opened last night for six hours to drain out 371,000 cusecs of water, the highest accumulation in 15 years. A cusec is a measurement of flow, equivalent to one cubic foot per second. \"Its water level has gone down now,\" Dahal told Reuters from the barrage site in southeast Nepal. The Kosi has been a serious concern for both India and Nepal since it broke its banks in 2008 and changed course, submerging swathes of land and affecting more than 2 million people in India's Bihar state. About 500 people died in that disaster."

      "text": "Where the Teesta grows old The story of Teesta begins 23,386 ft above the sea-level at the Pahunri glacier nestled between the Tibet and India border. Through one arm Pahunri empties into a glacial lake called Tso Lhamo, which spills over to create the Lachen river, one of the two tributaries forming the Teesta. The other tributary is the Lachung river, which too is fed by the Pahunri glacier. Lachen and Lachung crisscross through the northern parts of Sikkim to finally meet and form Teesta as we know it.   Our journey begins at the other end of Teesta--at the point the river prepares to flow into Brahmaputra as a tributary. Or at least, that is where dawn breaks when I open my eyes during our overnight bus journey. The signboards speeding by say that we are at Patgram, in Lalmonirhat. Here, Teesta is nowhere to be seen, but one knows that the river exists on the other side of the rolling green fields, just beyond eyesight. Stone crushers--big rusting machines surrounded by smooth white and grey stones--parked for the night flanks either side of the road. Trucks full of river stones, quarried on the other side of the border, come in from India and are dumped here. These are then broken into the pebble-sized pieces needed by our ever-hungry construction industry. Tall piles of rough-cuts, some as high as trees, dot the fields, making artificial hillocks.    This particular landscape follows the Teesta through Burimari in Bangladesh, across a man-made political border and into the district of Changrabandha in India. Once we fight through the nightmarish land ports on either side (the Bangladeshi one is way worse) and cross the no-man's-land, the only thing that really changes immediately are the shops. On the Bangladesh side of the border, the shops are regular affairs--you have a guy frying piyaju, one or two dingy hotels for a quick meal, and your mama selling tea in rickety stalls.  Compared to this, Changrabandha, on the other side, is a festival. The make-shift shops have proud window-displays of fat bags of Lay's and big bars of Cadbury's. Everything is draped in flower garlands, be it of fluorescent fabric or fresh hibiscus and marigolds. The trucks change from the yellow, snout-nosed Bangladeshi variety to big white Tata monsters wearing flower wreaths and carrying stones.  A welcome party of money-changers and taxi-drivers greet us with plastic cups of milk tea. While wrestling with the money-changers as they grab at our passports, we haggle with the taxi drivers for a car to Siliguri. A little overwhelmed by the tightening circle of people, I scan the faces, choose one I like and holler at him to bring out his car. He hops over to the parking lot and brings a bright blue Tata Nano.   And that is how we end up being taxied by a cow smuggler.  Where the Teesta belongs to both sides\n \"I've been a taxi driver only since Modi came into power. I used to ferry cows across the river to Bangladesh, but I stopped because there are mobs out to kill people like me,\" explains our driver Uttam*.\n We are driving through the district of Jalpaiguri. Green rice paddies line the roads--the bounty of Teesta's waters irrigates the land here. The reformed cow-smuggler continues to give us insider knowledge about international cow smuggling. They bring in cows and calves to India during monsoon when it floods in Bangladesh, he says. These are reared in India, and then smuggled back to Bangladesh just before Eid-ul-Adha.\n \"However, winter is the best time for doing any business because there is poor visibility and border guards cannot see us. We put the cow on a boat and cross the river. The river is very narrow and shallow during this time,\" says Uttam.\n While we don't go into details, flash-floods, winter droughts, and cow-smuggling are all intrinsically linked to Bangladesh's age-old tussle with India over Teesta's waters. The dam that most affects Teesta's water-flow in Bangladesh is Gazoldoba barrage, located east of Siliguri. During monsoon, the barrage lets loose--similar to what Farakka dam is doing at the very moment--flooding northern Bangladesh. During periods of drought like in winter, the dam's gates stay tightly sealed. Three decades in, the two countries have not yet figured out how to share water equitably. Even as recent as on September 10, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told the parliament that she will be seeking a Teesta water-sharing agreement during her upcoming visit to India this month.  \nMeanwhile, the people continue to suffer. Last April, Star Weekend interviewed fishermen and farmers and found that they routinely lose homes and livelihoods to flash-floods, and starve during droughts. \"Over the last 15 years, I had to change homes 11 times. During every monsoon, Teesta swallows my residence and most of my belongings,\" a fisherman had told our reporter. Cow-smuggling into India happens during these seasons, when the farmers and fishermen have no homes to keep their livestock in, or no fodder to feed them. \n Uttam swears that he is now a reformed cow smuggler, but it's clear that he sorely misses the thrill of crossing the river illegally. Every second thing he sees and hears reminds him of his old days. Two female BSF soldiers crossing the road make him launch into a story of how there used to be no female officers before, and that when the BSF came to raid villages, smuggler families used to send their women to face the male officers, allowing the men to escape. \"That is not possible now because the female BSF can arrest our women,\" he rambles. He is like a recovering addict spiraling at every whiff of his drug. For Uttam, Teesta holds no borders--it is his to ply across as he wishes. \nIn some places, Teesta is a furious mountain river. \nTeesta between the mountains\nThe Teesta disappears from sight after Jalpaiguri and does not appear until later in the afternoon, as we take the road leading to the North. At Jalpaiguri, the Teesta flows sluggishly, snaking its way through large tracts of char.  When we meet it again at Sevoke, Darjeeling, all heads in the car turn towards it. It is gushing and emerald green, flowing between towering mountain cliffs. All around is lush tropical vegetation--on one side of the river is the Gola forest, and on the other, the Mangpong forest. Before long, the Coronation Bridge looms into view. The colonial-era bridge's white massive arch stands with legs on either side of Teesta. Researcher Gauri Noolkar-Oak writes in her essay \"A Tryst with the Teesta\" that the bridge had to be built in one tall arch because the torrential flow of the river made construction of pillars in the middle of the river impossible.\n But that was before the dams, of course. At least three large hydroelectric projects and numerous smaller ones dot the Teesta, beginning from the Teesta barrage in Bangladesh, till its roots in Sikkim. We first see one of these projects with our own eyes at Kalijhora--the Teesta Low Dam-IV, which, completed in 2016, can churn out a total of 160 MW for the West Bengal grid. Compared to other upstream dams, this is considerably small, but is still a sight to behold. A shelf of water hangs ominously over the concrete wall of the dam, and the river we were marveling at up until now, is merely a thin rivulet compared to what lies on the other side. The occupants of our jeep request a toilet break at a roadside dhaba and we take the chance to take photos of the swelling green Teesta.\n But soon enough, there is another dam-- our jeep is now approaching Kalimpong when the Teesta Low Dam Hydro Electric Project Stage III comes into our line of vision. By this time, we have crossed enough dams since our journey started--four to be exact--and nobody lifts up their heads to peer out the window. This too is a rather small dam, they say, only generating 132 MW for the grid. If a small dam can impress and intimidate, I am curious what a big dam would look like.\nDams and hydel projects will feature frequently in our journey. During his 25-year-tenure, former Chief Minister Pawan Chamling approved over two dozen such projects, the media reports. The total projected capacity of these dams would be 5,494 MW--and the electricity is almost entirely slated for export outside of the state. Literature states that Sikkim's own demand for 2015-2016 was only 130 MW.**\nThe construction of so many upstream dams spells doom for downstream areas like Bangladesh where the Teesta already exists as a dry canal, multiple researches have observed. The more water is held back upstream, the less will be received in downstream areas. For example, in 2014 a researcher from Vidyasagar University analysed two decades of data and found out that Gazoldoba barrage is right now being able to release half the water that it used to. How much less water shall Bangladesh receive if more dams are built?\n We get a glimpse of this future at Chungthang two days later. After a tummy full of steaming momos and a good night's rest at Gangtok, the dreamy mountain capital of Sikkim, we are en route to Dzongu Lepcha Reserve, when we come across the 1200 MW Chungthang Teesta State III Hydropower Project. Pulitzer Center called this project the former Chief Minister Pawan Chamling's \"prize jewel\". \"It will generate 15 times the 80 MW electrical demand of Sikkim. The power generated is designed for export to appease the growing electricity demands of greater India and provide revenue for the Sikkim government,\" the article published in 2014 states. The project has also been criticised for not having a fish ladder, and impeding the movement of migratory fish like snowtrout, which is already a vulnerable species. \nOur Jeep driver deliberately stops at a point where we can get an elevated view of the vastness of the reservoir. There is even a tiny stall selling tea and steaming bowls of soupy Maggi noodles garnished with tomatoes and coriander. The intent is quite clear--this is a rest-stop where one can slurp on noodles while taking in the breathtaking beauty of the man-made reservoir. Everyone takes out their phones and starts snapping away. Questions about the environmental concerns of dams, concerns about how large dams upstream are affecting Bangladesh's own Teesta waters, disappear in the apparent tranquility of the experience.\nThe 1200 MW Chungthang Hydropower plant.\nWhere the Teesta is worshipped \nIt is ironic that we stop to appreciate the Chungthang reservoir on our way to \"experience\" Lepcha culture. The Lepcha indigenous community has been central to the movement protesting Teesta dams in their homeland of Dzongu, which also includes the UNESCO World Heritage Site Khangchendzonga National Park. The community organised to form the Affected Citizens of Teesta, whose leaders Dawa Lepcha and Tenzing Lepcha went on a hunger strike for 63 days in 2008 to get the hydro-electric power projects scrapped.\nThe indigenous activists point out that most of the land being taken for hydel projects belonged to Lepchas. Although the activists succeeded in stopping several projects, they could not stop the Chungthang dam from being built. Another project--the 520 MW Teesta Stave IV--is still hanging in the air. A Lepcha home in Dzongu.\nThrough the course of the next day, we learn that for the Lepchas, environmental activism is not just a civil rights issue, it's also religious. The community practices animism, which is the worshipping of nature itself. Every creature is revered, and nothing is too insignificant--even the smallest cockroach is respected. Lepchas believe cockroaches helped invent chee, the local millet wine. The community's heavenly realm lies beyond Kangchenjunga where the earth's spirit mother Itbumu resides. Their motherland Dzongu is the Earth's primordial soup where genesis takes place. Similarly, the Teesta river was created as a result of the romantic union of two heavenly rivulets.\nIt is during our journey to Dzongu that we are truly made to realise why Teesta is considered divine by the Lepchas. Gravelly uphill mountain roads run neck-to-neck with the Teesta at its most furious mighty self. Up until now, the mountainous Teesta had always remained far below, removed from us by several kilometers of cliff-face. But here, we are face-to-face with a mountain river. The terrain is built of large, loose rocks, none of which are too big for the frothing, gushing rapids which seem strong enough to sweep away homes, and definitely, puny humans like us. Our Jeep totters in the narrow space between the riverbank and a cliff, but it can only get us so far.\nThe Boleros stop in front of a long bamboo and cable bridge. We head towards the village of Tingvong, where we park for the night at a Lepcha homestay.\nAt Dzongu, one is forced to interact with the Teesta, when crossing this bamboo bridge. \n\"The car stops here. You have to cross the Teesta to get to your destination,\" we are told. Some of us feel a rush of thrill at the prospect of having to do a tightrope walk on a bamboo bridge; others get cold feet. Ahead of us lay the cloud-shrouded peak of Mount Pandim, and below our feet, foaming water. It has begun to drizzle, bringing with it gentle winds that rock the bridge carrying unstable novice humans, almost as if to send a message--damn it however much you want, but here in the mountains, the Teesta is god.\nOnce we cross the bridge though, we enter into a land straight out of mythical folk tales. A small jeep waits to take us to our village. Everything is bigger, greener, and we are at our smallest. Ferns grow to the size of palm trees, the roads are lined with fat clusters of periwinkle blue hydrangeas and the largest orchids I have ever seen. Our jeep has to pass through several waterfalls and mountain springs--at some points, we cling onto our lives and gear over them, and at others, we drive under them, getting showered with fast-falling water in the process. Next to a stream is a modest temple with a prayer wheel; each time the waters hit the wheel a prayer is sent to the gods. This is the land hidden on the other side of Teesta.\nOur night ends with warm chee drunk through a bamboo straw, accompanied by a meal of rice bamboo shoots and fern stir-fry, shared with the Lepcha family hosting us. \nAt higher altitudes, a tributary of Teesta flows through red, rocky landscapes and alpine fir forests. \nWhere the Teesta began\nThe journey ahead to the source of the Teesta takes another two days. We drive away from the forests of Dzongu towards Lachung, a small tourist outpost where we stop for the night. There is no electricity in the entire village--this, in a state that boasts the production of more electricity than it needs. Our gentle Sikkimese hosts try their best to accommodate us in the light of the single lightbulb being powered by the IPS. The town is pitch black, and the only noise comes from the Lachung river angrily gushing by. Here, the Teesta exists as its glacial upstream predecessor.  \nA Lepcha home in Dzongu. The animist community has been instrumental in the movement against dams\nAn hour before dawn, we get dressed in complete darkness, fumbling with our clothes and bumping against furniture, before hitting the road. The first rays of the sun strike the snowy peaks of Mount Katao turning the whole sky brilliant white--our eyes, having been in darkness for hours, take a moment to adjust. As our jeep climbs the mountainous road towards the foot of Mount Pahunri, the landscape changes fast. At one moment we are crossing jewel-green temperate forests, and then suddenly, the ground gives way to craggy red rocks, alpine fir trees and rhododendron bushes. A thick blanket of fog envelopes everything--the car, the road, us. I see a red panda crossing the road but my husband scoffs it off as a common Himalayan weasel. \nJust as suddenly, the trees disappear. We are surrounded on all sides by snow-covered peaks and the only vegetation are small shrubs growing between lichen-covered rocks. With the absence of forest cover, the sun beams on unhindered. At this point, the road stops, and cars can go no further--it is locally known as Zero Point. To our right lies Mount Panhuri, and before us lies the Teesta in its purest, most nascent stage, flowing as a happy gurgling stream coming from the mountain crevices. This is where the story of this politically wrought river begins. At this point, the river has no idea that it will face multiple dams, be the subject of more than three decades of diplomatic wars, lose its ecology and its people, that it will be let down by states and governments. Here it is barely ankle-deep, barely rising enough to cover its stony riverbed. What it does not know is that by the time it reaches Bangladesh, it will be ankle-deep again in places, because it will not be allowed to flow. Watching the bubbly little stream set against snowy mountains, one truly fathoms the extent of human destruction.\n \n*The name has been changed to preserve his privacy.\n**As stated in the essay \"Sikkim's Hydel Journey\" published in The Birds Have Lost Their Way (2018) by Lokta Books in Sikkim.\n  \"I've been a taxi driver only since Modi came into power. I used to ferry cows across the river to Bangladesh, but I stopped because there are mobs out to kill people like me,\" explains our driver Uttam*.  We are driving through the district of Jalpaiguri.

Our Jeep totters in the narrow space between the riverbank and a cliff, but it can only get us so far.\nThe Boleros stop in front of a long bamboo and cable bridge. We head towards the village of Tingvong, where we park for the night at a Lepcha homestay.\nAt Dzongu, one is forced to interact with the Teesta, when crossing this bamboo bridge. \n\"The car stops here. You have to cross the Teesta to get to your destination,\" we are told. Some of us feel a rush of thrill at the prospect of having to do a tightrope walk on a bamboo bridge; others get cold feet. Ahead of us lay the cloud-shrouded peak of Mount Pandim, and below our feet, foaming water. It has begun to drizzle, bringing with it gentle winds that rock the bridge carrying unstable novice humans, almost as if to send a message--damn it however much you want, but here in the mountains, the Teesta is god.\nOnce we cross the bridge though, we enter into a land straight out of mythical folk tales. A small jeep waits to take us to our village. Everything is bigger, greener, and we are at our smallest. Ferns grow to the size of palm trees, the roads are lined with fat clusters of periwinkle blue hydrangeas and the largest orchids I have ever seen. Our jeep has to pass through several waterfalls and mountain springs--at some points, we cling onto our lives and gear over them, and at others, we drive under them, getting showered with fast-falling water in the process. Next to a stream is a modest temple with a prayer wheel; each time the waters hit the wheel a prayer is sent to the gods. This is the land hidden on the other side of Teesta.\nOur night ends with warm chee drunk through a bamboo straw, accompanied by a meal of rice bamboo shoots and fern stir-fry, shared with the Lepcha family hosting us. \nAt higher altitudes, a tributary of Teesta flows through red, rocky landscapes and alpine fir forests. \nWhere the Teesta began\nThe journey ahead to the source of the Teesta takes another two days. We drive away from the forests of Dzongu towards Lachung, a small tourist outpost where we stop for the night. There is no electricity in the entire village--this, in a state that boasts the production of more electricity than it needs. Our gentle Sikkimese hosts try their best to accommodate us in the light of the single lightbulb being powered by the IPS. The town is pitch black, and the only noise comes from the Lachung river angrily gushing by. Here, the Teesta exists as its glacial upstream predecessor.  \nA Lepcha home in Dzongu. The animist community has been instrumental in the movement against dams\nAn hour before dawn, we get dressed in complete darkness, fumbling with our clothes and bumping against furniture, before hitting the road. The first rays of the sun strike the snowy peaks of Mount Katao turning the whole sky brilliant white--our eyes, having been in darkness for hours, take a moment to adjust. As our jeep climbs the mountainous road towards the foot of Mount Pahunri, the landscape changes fast. At one moment we are crossing jewel-green temperate forests, and then suddenly, the ground gives way to craggy red rocks, alpine fir trees and rhododendron bushes. A thick blanket of fog envelopes everything--the car, the road, us. I see a red panda crossing the road but my husband scoffs it off as a common Himalayan weasel. \nJust as suddenly, the trees disappear. We are surrounded on all sides by snow-covered peaks and the only vegetation are small shrubs growing between lichen-covered rocks. With the absence of forest cover, the sun beams on unhindered. At this point, the road stops, and cars can go no further--it is locally known as Zero Point. To our right lies Mount Panhuri, and before us lies the Teesta in its purest, most nascent stage, flowing as a happy gurgling stream coming from the mountain crevices. This is where the story of this politically wrought river begins. At this point, the river has no idea that it will face multiple dams, be the subject of more than three decades of diplomatic wars, lose its ecology and its people, that it will be let down by states and governments. Here it is barely ankle-deep, barely rising enough to cover its stony riverbed. What it does not know is that by the time it reaches Bangladesh, it will be ankle-deep again in places, because it will not be allowed to flow. Watching the bubbly little stream set against snowy mountains, one truly fathoms the extent of human destruction.\n \n*The name has been changed to preserve his privacy.\n**As stated in the essay \"Sikkim's Hydel Journey\" published in The Birds Have Lost Their Way (2018) by Lokta Books in Sikkim.\n The Teesta disappears from sight after Jalpaiguri and does not appear until later in the afternoon, as we take the road leading to the North. At Jalpaiguri, the Teesta flows sluggishly, snaking its way through large tracts of char.  When we meet it again at Sevoke, Darjeeling, all heads in the car turn towards it. It is gushing and emerald green, flowing between towering mountain cliffs. All around is lush tropical vegetation--on one side of the river is the Gola forest, and on the other, the Mangpong forest. Before long, the Coronation Bridge looms into view. The colonial-era bridge's white massive arch stands with legs on either side of Teesta. Researcher Gauri Noolkar-Oak writes in her essay \"A Tryst with the Teesta\" that the bridge had to be built in one tall arch because the torrential flow of the river made construction of pillars in the middle of the river impossible.  But that was before the dams, of course. At least three large hydroelectric projects and numerous smaller ones dot the Teesta, beginning from the Teesta barrage in Bangladesh, till its roots in Sikkim. We first see one of these projects with our own eyes at Kalijhora--the Teesta Low Dam-IV, which, completed in 2016, can churn out a total of 160 MW for the West Bengal grid. Compared to other upstream dams, this is considerably small, but is still a sight to behold. A shelf of water hangs ominously over the concrete wall of the dam, and the river we were marveling at up until now, is merely a thin rivulet compared to what lies on the other side. The occupants of our jeep request a toilet break at a roadside dhaba and we take the chance to take photos of the swelling green Teesta.  But soon enough, there is another dam-- our jeep is now approaching Kalimpong when the Teesta Low Dam Hydro Electric Project Stage III comes into our line of vision. By this time, we have crossed enough dams since our journey started--four to be exact--and nobody lifts up their heads to peer out the window. This too is a rather small dam, they say, only generating 132 MW for the grid. If a small dam can impress and intimidate, I am curious what a big dam would look like. Dams and hydel projects will feature frequently in our journey. During his 25-year-tenure, former Chief Minister Pawan Chamling approved over two dozen such projects, the media reports. The total projected capacity of these dams would be 5,494 MW--and the electricity is almost entirely slated for export outside of the state. Literature states that Sikkim's own demand for 2015-2016 was only 130 MW.** The construction of so many upstream dams spells doom for downstream areas like Bangladesh where the Teesta already exists as a dry canal, multiple researches have observed. The more water is held back upstream, the less will be received in downstream areas. For example, in 2014 a researcher from Vidyasagar University analysed two decades of data and found out that Gazoldoba barrage is right now being able to release half the water that it used to. How much less water shall Bangladesh receive if more dams are built?  We get a glimpse of this future at Chungthang two days later. After a tummy full of steaming momos and a good night's rest at Gangtok, the dreamy mountain capital of Sikkim, we are en route to Dzongu Lepcha Reserve, when we come across the 1200 MW Chungthang Teesta State III Hydropower Project. Pulitzer Center called this project the former Chief Minister Pawan Chamling's \"prize jewel\". \"It will generate 15 times the 80 MW electrical demand of Sikkim. The power generated is designed for export to appease the growing electricity demands of greater India and provide revenue for the Sikkim government,\" the article published in 2014 states. The project has also been criticised for not having a fish ladder, and impeding the movement of migratory fish like snowtrout, which is already a vulnerable species.  Our Jeep driver deliberately stops at a point where we can get an elevated view of the vastness of the reservoir. There is even a tiny stall selling tea and steaming bowls of soupy Maggi noodles garnished with tomatoes and coriander. The intent is quite clear--this is a rest-stop where one can slurp on noodles while taking in the breathtaking beauty of the man-made reservoir. Everyone takes out their phones and starts snapping away. Questions about the environmental concerns of dams, concerns about how large dams upstream are affecting Bangladesh's own Teesta waters, disappear in the apparent tranquility of the experience. The 1200 MW Chungthang Hydropower plant.\nWhere the Teesta is worshipped \nIt is ironic that we stop to appreciate the Chungthang reservoir on our way to \"experience\" Lepcha culture. The Lepcha indigenous community has been central to the movement protesting Teesta dams in their homeland of Dzongu, which also includes the UNESCO World Heritage Site Khangchendzonga National Park. The community organised to form the Affected Citizens of Teesta, whose leaders Dawa Lepcha and Tenzing Lepcha went on a hunger strike for 63 days in 2008 to get the hydro-electric power projects scrapped.\nThe indigenous activists point out that most of the land being taken for hydel projects belonged to Lepchas. Although the activists succeeded in stopping several projects, they could not stop the Chungthang dam from being built. Another project--the 520 MW Teesta Stave IV--is still hanging in the air. A Lepcha home in Dzongu.\nThrough the course of the next day, we learn that for the Lepchas, environmental activism is not just a civil rights issue, it's also religious. The community practices animism, which is the worshipping of nature itself. Every creature is revered, and nothing is too insignificant--even the smallest cockroach is respected. Lepchas believe cockroaches helped invent chee, the local millet wine. The community's heavenly realm lies beyond Kangchenjunga where the earth's spirit mother Itbumu resides. Their motherland Dzongu is the Earth's primordial soup where genesis takes place. Similarly, the Teesta river was created as a result of the romantic union of two heavenly rivulets.\nIt is during our journey to Dzongu that we are truly made to realise why Teesta is considered divine by the Lepchas. Gravelly uphill mountain roads run neck-to-neck with the Teesta at its most furious mighty self.

We drive away from the forests of Dzongu towards Lachung, a small tourist outpost where we stop for the night. There is no electricity in the entire village--this, in a state that boasts the production of more electricity than it needs. Our gentle Sikkimese hosts try their best to accommodate us in the light of the single lightbulb being powered by the IPS. The town is pitch black, and the only noise comes from the Lachung river angrily gushing by. Here, the Teesta exists as its glacial upstream predecessor.   An hour before dawn, we get dressed in complete darkness, fumbling with our clothes and bumping against furniture, before hitting the road. The first rays of the sun strike the snowy peaks of Mount Katao turning the whole sky brilliant white--our eyes, having been in darkness for hours, take a moment to adjust. As our jeep climbs the mountainous road towards the foot of Mount Pahunri, the landscape changes fast. At one moment we are crossing jewel-green temperate forests, and then suddenly, the ground gives way to craggy red rocks, alpine fir trees and rhododendron bushes. A thick blanket of fog envelopes everything--the car, the road, us. I see a red panda crossing the road but my husband scoffs it off as a common Himalayan weasel.  Just as suddenly, the trees disappear. We are surrounded on all sides by snow-covered peaks and the only vegetation are small shrubs growing between lichen-covered rocks. With the absence of forest cover, the sun beams on unhindered. At this point, the road stops, and cars can go no further--it is locally known as Zero Point.

      "text": "Thousands of people in Moulvibazar's five upazilas are facing a shortage of relief supplies following the flashflood. Although, the overall flood situation in Moulvibazar and Sylhet districts has improved with dropping water levels in Manu and Dhalai rivers, thousands of people, especially those currently living on the embankments, are surviving only on puffed rice and unsafe drinking water for the past seven days.   Their government rations are fast running out, despite assurances from government high-ups. At a special disaster management committee meeting at Moulvibazar Circuit House on Monday, Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya claimed that there was no shortage of relief and the distribution would continue until the flood ends. Currently, about 100 families from Itarghat, Kalairchar and Chariarghat villages of Sharifpur, are living on the dam of the Manu river with their fowls, cattle and goats, awaiting help from the government. In Itarghat, Arun Mia, a ward member said that for around 350 people, they were given food packets worth Tk 150 for 75 people and packets worth Tk 200 for 198 people. The amount was not enough. Similarly, Manik Mia, 65, a resident of Mushibazar area in Kamalganj upazila area, said he received some aid from the government, but it was inadequate. \"We received rations for five people. But, it hardly covers two meals,\" he said. Harun Mia, local member of Itarghat, Kulaura upazila, also said the amount of relief materials was inadequate. Deputy Commissioner of Moulvibazar Tofael Islam, said, \"A total of 2, 50,430 people were affected by this sudden flood. We allocated 1,143 metric tonnes of rice for them.\" Md Faizur Rahman, additional secretary of the disaster management and relief ministry, was present during the aid distribution. He said that due to poor road conditions, distribution was yet to gain momentum but he gave assurances that they would reach the remotest areas soon. Flood relief was sent for nearly 2,300 people of the Sharifpur Union area, said Chowdhury Mohmmad Gollam Rabbi, Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) of Kulaura. Upazila Parishad Chairman of Sharifupur Janab Ali said there were a total of 4,500 flood-affected people in the area. 23 tonnes of rice was distributed among 2,300 people while 29 tonnes of rice was awaiting distribution.  Executive engineer of the Water Development Board in Moulvibazar, Ronendra Shankar Chakrabarty, said the flood situation would not improve unless the rains lessened. At least 231 primary schools and high schools in two districts of Sylhet division have suspended their academic activities as they remain deluged for around a week. Of them, 27 are being used as flood centres in Sylhet division. Md Bayezid Khan and Md Obaidullah, the two district primary education officers of Moulvibazar and Sylhet respetively, told this correspondent that classes of 96 primary schools in Moulvibazar and 111 primary schools in Sylhet were suspended. Md Abdul Kadir, president of Modongouri government primary school managing committee, said the schools were scheduled to re-open on June 19 following a month-long Eid holiday. But right before Eid, the school buildings were flooded. Education officers said considering the risks, a policy decision had been taken to stop the academic activities of the school until the water had receded. However, if the teachers wish, they will be able to take classes on the dry areas of the school. ASM Abdul Wadud, officer of secondary and higher secondary education department in Moulvibazar, said around 25 thousands students were enrolled at 24 flood-affected schools. Tahmina Khatun, deputy director of primary education department in Sylhet division, told this correspondent the decision to hold classes in the flood schools depended on teachers and management committee of the schools."

Also, fresh areas of the north have gone down under.Also read: Immense sufferings, scanty response   The latest flood situation collected from our district correspondents are as follows: Two people died in electrocution - Shahjada, 35, and Abdus Salam, 30, - in Islampur upazila around 1:30pm, Char Putimari Union Chairman Suruzzaman said. A class VIII student Jubair Islam Joy, 14, drowned in Motherganj upazila around 1:00pm, said Upazila Nirbahi Officer Md Kamruzzaman. A child Ayesha, 13, drowned in Melanda upazila and her cousin Tapasi, 12, went missing along with her around 3:45pm, said Melanda Police Station Officer-in-Charge Mazharul Islam. Body of a woman - Joynur Bibi, 45 - who went missing yesterday was recovered this morning, said Bagmara Police Station Officer-in-Charge (Investigation) Asaduzzaman. Ten unions were freshly inundated in Bagmara and Mohanpur upazilas as the Water Development Board (WDB) embankments over the Fokinni and Atrai rivers were breached early today.  Flood worsened as nine out of 11 upazilas in the district, our Dinajpur correspondent reports quoting local WDB Executive Engineer Anwar Hossain. Water levels of the Brahmaputra and Dharla rivers are receding while Dudh Kumar and Teesta are already flowing below the danger mark, said Kurigram Relief Officer Enamul Haque. A total of 25,033 families have been taken to 194 flood shelters while 274 shelters have been submerged, he added. Over 700 educational institutions remain closed due to the onrush of floods, said Swapan Kumar Sarkar, Kurigram district education officer. There has been an improvement in the flood situation in the last 48 hours as the water levels of Punorbhaba and Atrai Rivers were receding, according to WDB charts. The overall flood situation is improving as the water levels of the Jamuna have receded 14cm in the last 24 hours which is now flowing 137cm above the danger mark, said Syed Hasan Imam, executive engineer WDB of Sirajganj. Water levels have receded in most of the submerged areas in the district amid scanty relief for nearly 1.27 lakh families, reports our local correspondent."

      "authors": "\nStar Online Report\n",
      "text": "Even though the water levels in some of the major rivers in the northern and central districts -- Teesta, Dharla and Jamuna -- continue to recede, the sufferings of the flood victims show no signs of easing. However, floodwater submerged new areas in Natore while ongoing mid-term examinations of primary schools in all upazilas in Manikganj except for Singair have been postponed due to flood. In Lalmonirhat, water levels of both the major rivers --Teesta and Dharla -- have been flowing well below the danger level for the past few days. However, many have been unable to go back to their homes as most of their houses were washed away in the floods, our Lalmonirhat correspondent reports quoting sources at the Deputy Commissioner's office. Even the government allocated relief has been sparse. Of the 1,02, 750 families affected by the floods, only 24,200 received relief so far, Lalmonirhat Deputy Commissioner Shafiul Arif said. In Tangail, as well, the flood situation was improving owing to the receding water levels of the Jamuna River. The water level of the Jamuna river at Tangail point fell 17cm in the last 24 hours. At Bahadurabad point of Jamalpur district, the water of the river reduced by 26cm and at Sirajganj point the water level decreased by 19cm, our Tangail correspondent reports quoting Executive Engineer Shajahan Siraj of Water Development Board. In the wake of the flood, the main concern of authorities is to get adequate relief among the flood-affected people. Although relief distribution is going on in the district, there is not enough, the correspondent reports quoting chairmen of the affected union parishads. In Natore, the overall flood situation in Singra upazila deteriorated today as the water of Atrai river was flowing 70cm above the danger mark, according to UNB. Many flood affected people left their houses for safe shelter. At least seven hectares of Aman paddy have already been damaged by the floodwater. Paddy in 800 bighas of land in Temuk Nowdapara beel went under water last evening as gushing water was entering through a damaged dam in Sidhakhali river. State Minister for Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Junaid Ahmed Palak visited the flood-affected areas in the upazila and distributed relief materials among the victims yesterday. In Manikganj, mid-term examination of primary schools in all upazilas except for Singair were postponed by the district primary education office from August 19 until next order, our Manikganj correspondent reports quoting Aleya Ferdousi Shikha, district primary education officer. More than 200 schools in the affected six upazilas have been declared closed due to floods, she said. The water of the Padma and Jamuna is flowing 72 cm above the danger zone by decreasing 4 cm at Aricha point in Manikganj in last 24 hours, said Executive engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) Hasan Mahmud. On the other side, the water of all internal rivers of the district including Kaliganga, Dhaleshwari, Ichhamoti, Gazikhali, Kantaboti is increasing. The water of Kaliganga is flowing 82 cm above the danger zone by increasing 33 cm at Tora point in the last 24 hours, Hasan Mahmud said.  In Dinajpur, although water levels in most of the rivers have been receding in the district, road and rail communications are yet to be restored. As per the government estimate, around 114km roads under Roads and Highways Department (RHD) and around 1,100km roads under of Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) have been damaged due to the ravaging flood, said Masum Sarwar, executive engineer of RHD. Dhaka's rail link with Dinajpur remains suspended over the last seven days as 15km of rail tracks, damaged by the onrush of water, are yet to be repaired, the official said. Meanwhile, the agriculture has also been hit hard as around 1.26 lakh hectares of Aman land have been inundated in floodwaters with fishes of 12,000 ponds washed away, our local correspondent reports quoting district administrations sources. In Kurigram, all rivers except the Brahmaputra are flowing below the danger mark while the Brahmaputra is now flowing 14cm above the danger mark. District administration has so far distributed 1671.38 metric tonnes of rice and Tk 62.55 lakh among the flood victims, our Kurigram correspondent reports quoting Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Enamul Haque. However, a number of flood victims alleged of sparse relief. Nur Islam, 55, of Holokhana union under Sadar upazila, who has taken shelter in a primary school said, \"My family has been left starving as we haven't received any relief materials yet.\" \"My children have nothing to eat. We were given only a kg of flattened rice,\" said Rahena Begum, 35, in RDRS Bazar area of Holokhana union. In Jamalpur, water levels have receded to great extent in the last two days in the district but still the Jamuna is overflowing at 72cm in Jamalpur's Bahadurabad Ghat point. The suffering of over 1.75 lakh flood-hit families of 583 villages in 60 unions of all seven upazilas of the district was still going on for scarcity of food. Meanwhile, Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya and State Minister for Textile and Jute Mirza Azam, MP distributed a packet of 10kg rice among 1700 affected families each in Melandah and Islampur upazilas this afternoon. During the relief distribution, a good number of flood-hit people coming from different areas of the upazila, were seen leaving the place with broken hearts, our local correspondent reports. When approached, 30-40 women encircled the correspondent seeking to get their names enlisted so that they could avail the opportunity of having the rice while the relief distribution was going on around 3:00pm."

      "text": "Disaster and climate induced displacement has become an important issue in the global disaster risk reduction (DRR) conversation. The Co-Chairs' summary of 2019 UN Global Platform on DRR highlighted that forced to abandon their homes and livelihood, the displaced people are one of the most vulnerable population of the world, and the international community should do more to reduce disaster induced displacement. Bangladesh is globally acclaimed for its success in reducing loss of lives during disasters as well as managing relief after disasters. The country is on course to set yet another example by framing a national strategy for disaster and climate induced displacement. Bangladesh has been identified as the seventh most affected country in the world due to \"extreme weather event\". Each year climate events and disasters such as floods, cyclones, storm surges and slow onset processes like droughts are displacing tens of thousands of households. A global study conducted in 2015 by Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) estimates that one out of every seven Bangladeshis will experience displacement by 2050. However, none of the disaster and climate change related national documents of Bangladesh addresses the concerns of the displaced. The National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA 2005) visualises internal migration in the aftermath of climate hazards as a problem for the urban dwellers. The Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP 2009) mentions migration but does not talk about the displaced. Again, it only mentions the need for monitoring different flows of migration. The Disaster Management Act 2012 made passing reference to emergency shelter and resettlement. It also does not provide any guidance on how to deal with various phases of displacement. The government's Standing Orders on Disaster (SODs) provide more detailed instructions to different actors at national and sub-national levels on managing displacement. However, the focus is overwhelmingly on initial emergency shelter. It is against this backdrop that a comprehensive and rights-based Strategy on Disaster and Climate Induced Displacement has been prepared by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR). The document is based on UN Sendai Framework, UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement as well as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. It also incorporates the goal of a \"safe, climate resilient and prosperous delta\" envisaged in Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. The strategy focuses solely on internal displacement caused by disaster and climate change related events. The draft strategy recognises that displacement has grave implications for the rights and entitlements of individuals and communities. Affected persons may face multiple human rights challenges in the aftermath of disasters. Their safety and security are compromised and they may experience gender-based violence, unequal access to assistance, basic goods and services, and discrimination in aid provision. A section of children may also experience abuse, neglect and exploitation. Children, older persons and persons with disabilities who rely on family support for their survival, may experience separation. Loss and destruction of personal document, unequal access to employment and livelihood opportunities, and forced relocation, unsafe or voluntary return are part and parcel of the experience of the displaced. The document chalks out a comprehensive strategy covering all phases of displacement of men, women and children--pre-displacement, during displacement and post displacement. Pre-displacement phase highlights actions required to prevent displacement; humanitarian emergency relief and evacuation are the key features of protection during displacement; and post displacement actions refer to durable solutions. Prevention aims at stopping displacement by reducing vulnerability and enhancing resilience of the concerned communities through disaster management infrastructure development (embankment and dams) and adoption of climate change adaptation programmes. The various steps suggested in the strategy are: generate knowledge to understand risks; ensure adequate resource allocation in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation; strengthen disaster risk governance; creation of decent employment through promoting and encouraging decentralisation of urban growth centres; and disaster-climate risk responsive land use planning along with identification of highly vulnerable zones and restriction on human settlement in unprotected high vulnerable areas. Prevention also includes disaster preparedness of vulnerable people for likely displacement. It relates to measures taken to ensure effective rights based evacuation including awareness raising, training of responsible actors, pre-identification of evacuation centres and development of standard operating procedure by key service providers such as the health sector, police and transportation. Protection phase highlights strengthening emergency humanitarian and disaster relief assistance. When displacement takes place it is important to intervene quickly and decisively to manage it and address urgent humanitarian needs. Effective management of evacuation centres and temporary centres addressing right to food, shelter, health, education and safety of all groups, including children, women, elderly and the disabled is essential. Planned measures are suggested for preventing and responding to protection risks faced by vulnerable groups such as children, girls, women, the elderly and persons with disabilities. Durable solution refers to post-displacement phase. Strategic responses described in this phase attempts to avoid protracted displacement situation. According to UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, durable solutions can be achieved through three types of measures. These are: return to place of origin, integration in the new location and resettlement/relocation to another safe place. Among these three types, return to the place of origin is the most preferred option. Return as a solution targets more specifically those who fall under \"temporarily displaced\" category. However, such return requires being sustainable in the long run from the perspective of safety, security, livelihood, ecosystem service, housing etc. The second option, which is local level integration is suggested when the displaced population cannot return to their areas of origin because of adverse environmental situations. Successful local level integration requires involvement of the host community. In case return and local integration are not found to be suitable options, the displaced deserve to be resettled in a safe place. The document also discusses institutional arrangement and funding.  In September 2015 the Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit (RMMRU) completed the draft strategy for the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) under its Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme II (CDMPII). The document was formulated through a series of consultation with affected people at a number of disaster and climate change hotspots, and workshop with relevant government functionaries, experts, civil society members and development partners. The strategy was presented at the official session of the 2019 UN Global Platform on Disaster Risk Reduction held in Geneva. Following the event, the state minister of MoDMR took the initiative to update and revise the document. RMMRU on advice of MoDMR, in collaboration with Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS), International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Research (C3ER), completed the task and handed over the document to the state minister for MoDMR. The strategy is now ready to go through the inter-ministerial consultation process before final adoption. The importance of this rights-based document lies in the fact that it has been initiated by the government and prepared by a group of Bangladeshi professionals for the betterment of a marginalised group. If it is adopted in the near future, Bangladesh is going to be the second country in the world to have a strategy on the displaced. Civil society organisations working on displacement strongly urge the government to adopt the strategy before the upcoming UN Climate Change Conference--Cop25.   Tasneem Siddiqui is the founding Chair of RMMRU and Professor of Political Science, University of Dhaka. She is the lead author of the strategy."

Farm loan disbursement by private and foreign banks fell 28.30 percent to Tk 561 crore. Agriculture activities in 24 districts almost came to a halt last month as sudden floods hit the areas, a Bangladesh Bank official said. This prompted the central bank to instruct banks to stop their farm loan recovery programme for the time being and adopt a relaxed rescheduling facility for the affected farmers. Banks have been also asked to disburse fresh loans to restore momentum in agricultural production. \"We hope that farm loan disbursement will get tempo within the shortest possible time because of the collective efforts taken by both the central bank and banks,\" the central banker said. The BB has set a farm loan disbursement target of Tk 24,124 crore for the fiscal year. Ten private banks out of 46 did not disburse any farm loans last month. Private lenders usually give out farm loans through non-governmental organisations (NGOs). But NGOs themselves faced difficulties in continuing the disbursement in the flood-affected zones, the BB official said."

      "text": "A lone structure is taking shape on a featureless, grey horizon. Two figures work under the beating sun, on an otherwise deserted landscape. One digs, the other carries loads of earth on her head.    The sky is deep blue. All around there is sand... the dark grey patches where the river has left fertile alluvial deposits, and any stray seed will flourish; and the stark white, devoid of nutrition yet perfect for growing, say, ground nuts. Hints of green are beginning to appear in patches: unmistakable signs of promise. When we encountered this scene, we were passing by, returning from a meeting in an adjacent island. Taking a break from their backbreaking work, Bashir and Amina (not their real names) told us their story. Years ago, this was a thriving village. Bashir and Amina lived in it with their seven children, and while it wasn't a glorious life, they got by. In 2011, they lost their home and the only land they owned to river erosion. For those living on islands in the middle of the river, the loss of homes is almost normal. Every year, the river breaks away large swathes of land from one place, and deposits it in another. Millions in Bangladesh live on these fluid landscapes, and like the land, they are perpetual nomads. They have never had roads, electricity, or much access to government services. But Ganeshyampur, near the confluence of the Teesta and Brahmaputra rivers in northern Bangladesh, was part of the mainland. Only after 2010 did the area begin to erode. When Bashir lost his land, he was so dependent on it that afterwards he couldn't pay the minimal rent for a house. The family spent eight years squatting beside a highway. Deprived of their own land to farm, the two have been relying on sporadic work as daily wage labourers. Their dreams of stability have been anchored to the land they lost. \"Every year I come back to see what the prospects are,\" says Bashir. The relationships that people have with the river are complex. In a sense, it is nothing less than a parent. It provides land, water and fertility. But the river is also a monster, because in a moment it takes away everything it gives. In July last year, floods destroyed acres of farmland, broke homes, killed livestock and even swept away children. Yet, when the water subsides, it often leaves behind the promise of rebirth. Last year's flood left more sediments on Bashir's land, and the water receded to a distance of three kilometres away, convincing him that it was time to start building. After five days of toiling under the beating sun, Bashir and Amina had raised a structure. Now, a few months on, several others have also settled in the vicinity. This is a community of mavericks. Being one of the first to settle the land means that they must build everything from scratch. There is no sanitation or access to clean water until somebody sinks a tube well or builds a latrine. Bashir has improvised a latrine, but for water he must walk to a neighbour's house almost two kilometres away. They have added two more huts to the first: a kitchen and a room to accommodate the family (three sons and a daughter, Nolok). Nolok is 30 but her parents cannot marry her off because of the stigma of her mental illness. Her mind is apparently a child's. The exile has exacted the worst toll on Nolok. Having lived for years in poverty without any government support and without access to social services or healthcare, Nolok hasn't had the protections that she might have under different circumstances. She has one daughter who is a toddler, and is currently pregnant with another child. Rather than joy, Bashir's eyebrows furrow with burden at the thought of these fatherless grandchildren. Last year, river erosion affected several districts in Bangladesh that have never had this problem before. In Shariatpur, erosion has rendered some 4,000 families homeless, and caused a 2-storey health complex to crumble. In Manikganj, hundreds of homes and at least one school were swallowed by the Padma. Even smaller rivers like the Nabaganga have uprooted hundreds of families. Landscapes that are prone to erosion, especially the areas not attached to the mainland, are in a sense detached from state mechanisms. The Jamuna is the widest river in Bangladesh, 12km at its maximum. Getting from the mainland to some of the remotest islands takes upwards of four hours, assuming a boat is ready and waiting. The Bangladesh government has significant funds allocated to rehabilitate river erosion victims every year, and to check river erosion. Then there are NGOs bringing in adaptive solutions--like Friendship's hospital ships. Perhaps Nolok's children will not see the kind of vulnerability that she has experienced. But with some 68,000 displaced each year by river erosion, there needs to be a national strategy to respond to the question: how do we extend care, protection and opportunity to families who are vulnerable and rendered landless by these results of climate change? At least for the next few years, Nolok and her family have the security of a home. Her children will not be spending this chilly winter on the edges of a highway. The ground nuts that Bashir's family has planted on about six decimals of land nearby are now a few weeks from harvest. They might harvest up to two maunds (75 KG), depending on their luck and skill, which would fetch about Tk 15,000 in the market--a significant boost. But the sandbanks they grow on serve as a reminder that the river, though out of sight, is never far.   Naushad Ali Husein is a senior executive at Friendship, an NGO."

      "text": "Winter morn-ings in Bangladesh are usually associated with charming sights and sounds--dew drops on fallen brown leaves, shimmering colours formed by sun rays on spider webs, marigolds, dahlias and mustard flowers, and the singing of thousands of migratory birds in the haors, beels and lakes. Unfortunately, our charming, sunny winters have turned grey and gloomy nowadays, and much of the blame falls on climate change. The climate of Bangladesh is subtropical in the centre-north and tropical in the south, and we are supposed to have pleasantly warm winters from November to February, a short hot spring between March and May, and a long rainy season from June to October due to the summer monsoon. The actual winter usually begins in December and is characterised by warm and sunny days, followed by cool nights. Frequent cold waves, as we have been experiencing in recent times, are out of the usual pattern that our winters follow.  There are quite a few things to be noted in recent years about these cold waves. Of them, two are obvious. For one thing, it has been relentless in its pattern, and therefore, cumulative and gripping in its chilling effect. The other more weighty, record-breaking feature is the lowest temperature registered in seven decades. The mercury dropped to 4.5 degrees Celsius in December 2019, and it was 2.6 degrees Celsius at Tetulia and some other places in January 2018. The cold wave swept through the whole of this small country, causing immense suffering for the people not accustomed to such low temperatures. Not only is Bangladesh trembling in the grip of the cold, the western world and Europe, which is used to snow, is also going through extreme weather episodes. At least 62 people died due to cold related illnesses and fire incidents in Bangladesh this winter; the latter occurring because of people trying to keep warm by setting fire to twigs and garbage, in the absence of warm, winter clothing. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief in Bangladesh, humanitarian organisations, NGOs, the private sector and well-off individuals normally distribute warm clothes, blankets, and food among poor people in different parts of the country to reduce their suffering. However, the cold waves tend to appear unpredictably and require comprehensive preparedness and response plans similar to the plans prepared during floods and cyclones. Bangladesh is now recognised for being quite efficient and advanced in disaster preparedness, particularly for these two disasters. The government, based on recent experiences, could strengthen the preparedness and response framework for cold waves, along with NGOs, the private sector and affected communities. The precautions that need to be taken for health, crops, livelihoods and stocks, as well as the availability of warm clothes and blankets, can be planned far ahead of the cold wave. Region wise mapping through assessment, responsibility and distribution plans, engaging departments and volunteers, and mobilising resources to be used and distributed via one, uniform channel could be a lifesaving effort in Bangladesh. The Ministry of Housing and Public Works could also explore better household design and materials, since heating systems do not exist and are rarely required in our houses. In addition, the Ministry of Disaster Management could aim for shelter arrangements if the situation deteriorates. These shelters should be made available to impoverished populations who live in makeshift homes. In addition, special assistance through local government for livestock and crops are needed. A cold wave is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by the cooling of air. It is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period, requiring substantially increased protection for agriculture, industry, commerce and social activities. People of Bangladesh are used to facing normal winter seasons where the average high   temperature is 25.4 degrees Celsius and the average low temperature is 12.7 degrees Celsius, and where January is the coldest month in Dhaka. Bangladesh.But when the temperature falls down to a single digit, the cold wave turns into a disaster like situation. It can paralyse normal life, and is especially difficult for children and the elderly, who can be affected with various cold-related diseases. Crops, especially potato, wheat, Boro seedlings and vegetables, are vulnerable, particularly to long lasting cold waves. Farmers and day labourers cannot work in the field due to the cold. Thick fog, together with the harsh cold, disrupts movement of all modes of transport across the country, causing accidents.    Winter cold waves that are not considered cold in some areas, but cause  temperatures significantly below average for another area, are also destructive. Areas with subtropical climates may recognise unusually cold, but perhaps barely freezing temperatures, as a cold wave. In such places, plant  and animal life is less tolerant of such cold. Likewise, unusual cold waves that penetrate into tropical countries in which people do not normally insulate houses or have reliable heating may cause hypothermia. Occurrences of extreme low temperatures, in association with the incursion of dry cold winds from the north into the Indian subcontinent, are known as cold waves. Bangladesh has currently been experiencing severe cold waves in winter for the last few years. These cold waves, which have the potential of turning into disasters, need to be addressed under a special preparedness programme of concerned authorities and organisations. Cold waves might come again and again in the coming days, particularly in the winter season, due to the negative effects of climate change. It is high time to undertake country wide mapping to identify extremely vulnerable communities, asses the suffering caused in recent times and formulate the responses required for such situations. It is necessary for the government, NGOs and the private sector to come up with long term plans that take into account the chronic vulnerability of people, particularly in the most poverty-stricken area of the country, due to cold waves. These programmes should not just aim to construct shelters and provide immediate relief; long term programmes are required to reduce vulnerabilities through improving livelihoods, increasing income and providing soft loans to buy winter clothes and medicines. Inclusion of cold-affected communities in the development programmes of the Government and other agencies with a proper vulnerability and capacity analysis could be a significant step towards improving their resilience. A comprehensive approach, instead of the sporadic \"blanket distributions\", is urgently needed to increase the capacity of the most vulnerable sections of society, in both urban and rural areas.

      "text": "Academic activities in nearly 580 education institutions are being seriously hampered in the northern and northeastern regions due to the ongoing spell of floods. The education institutions, mostly government primary schools, are either submerged or have been turned into shelters for flood victims for over a week. Half-yearly examinations at many secondary schools in Sylhet and Moulvibazar have been postponed. However, the education and primary and mass education ministries are yet to prepare a list of the affected institutions. Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid said they would prepare a list of the affected schools centrally as soon as the water starts receding. The field level officials were collecting information about the flood-hit institutions, he added. \"We will repair the damaged school buildings and give textbooks to students who have lost those due to the flood,\" said the minister. The Daily Star correspondents in the flood-hit districts talked to some education officials and compiled a list of the affected institutions. Meanwhile, the overall flood situation in the northern districts remained grave yesterday as nine rivers, including the Teesta, Jamuna and Brahmaputra, were flowing above the danger level at several points due to the onrush of water from upstream and downpours. Academic activities at 313 primary schools and 80 high schools in Sylhet and Moulvibazar have been suspended for the last two weeks. Of them, 27 institutions are being used as flood shelter centres. The two districts have been experiencing floods since the last week of June. Monir Uddin, whose son studies at Monsurganj Government Primary School, said classes were supposed to resume on July 1 after the Eid vacation, but the school has been hit by flood. \"My son stays home, but doesn't want to study. His second term exams are likely to begin next month, but I don't know what would be the [flood] situation then.\" Classes at 161 and 152 primary schools in Sylhet and Moulvibazar remained suspended, according to the respective district primary education officers. Tahmina Khatun, deputy director of the primary education department in Sylhet division, said the flood-affected schools have around 65,000 students. She added they were assessing the losses of infrastructure and furniture of the schools. Jahangir Kabir Ahmed, deputy director of secondary and higher education department in Sylhet division, said some 48 high schools in Moulvibazar and 32 in Sylhet have so far suspended half-yearly exams. Around 45,000 students are studying in these schools. In Lalmonirhat, students of 48 primary and five high schools at Teesta river basin villages and char areas in four upazilas have not been turning up for last two days due to floods. However, the teachers are keeping the institutions open. Sirajul Islam, a teacher at Nodi O Jibon Junior High School at Teesta River Char Sholmari in Kaliganj upazila, said none of their 188 students attended classes in last two days as floodwater surrounded the school. \"Only four out of nine teachers could come to the school,\" he said. Nur Amin, a teacher at Dawabari Government Primary School at Char Dawabari under Hatibandha upazila, said, \"All the classrooms are under at least one foot water. The school premises are under two to three feet water at some places. We stopped giving classes since Monday.\" Soleman Miah, a guardian of two primary students at Teesta Char Gaddimari village, said they had taken shelter at a safer place as floodwater inundated their house. \"How will I send my children to their school? \" he asked. Echoing the same view, another guardian Majidul Islam said, \"Sending our children to school in the flood is very risky.\" Nabez Uddin Sarker, district primary education officer, said teachers were instructed to keep the schools open, but academic activities could not continue without students. In Bogra, at least 80 education institutions in Shariakandi, Dhunat and Sonatola upazilas have been facing difficulties to continue with the classes for last one week. The floodwater has entered these schools' premises and even reached several classrooms. Neither the students were going to schools nor the teachers could hold classes in the water, he added. Only 12 affected schools could take alternative measures to hold classes but did not get any students, according to district administration. Moyna Khatun, a third grader of Shimulbari Government Primary School, said her classes remained suspended for a week as none went to the school. However, a few students were seen wading through the water to attend classes at Fakirpara Government Primary School of Chandanbaisha village under Kamalpur union. Jibonnahar Begum, acting headteacher of Shimulbari Government Primary School in Dhunat, said it was extremely difficult to take classes. In Kurigram, 67 government primary schools in the char areas were forced to stop academic activities as flood situation worsened in last three days. DPEO Swapan Kumar Roy Chowdhury said only eight of those schools were trying to conduct classes through alternative arrangement. Ruling Awami League lawmaker M Ishrafil Alam yesterday blasted the water resources minister and his deputy for \"sitting idle\" at a time when different parts of the country were hit by flood causing sufferings to people. The lawmaker was speaking at parliament on a call attention notice submitted by him on taking emergency measures to repair damaged flood control and protection embankments in his constituency.  Israfil said Water Resources Minister Anisul Islam Mahmud and State Minister Muhammad Nazrul Islam didn't visit any flood affected area where crops and houses were damaged and the victims were living in misery. \"Flood hit my constituency almost every year in the last eight years.  But I've never seen the respective minister or the state minister visiting my area,\" he added."

But this year Joygan and many like her have reason for a little optimism. Several easy-to-implement strategies recently introduced by a non-government organisation hold the promise of making household vegetable gardens flood-proof.  \"At times of flooding we most often take shelter on a bamboo platform in our house,\" says Joygan, \"If we have to, we move to an embankment and live on the roadside. Mostly we can only eat rice with salt. Vegetables are almost impossible to manage.\" \"This year I have planted the vegetables in plastic bags and pots. We have constructed several bamboo platforms around my house,\" she continues. \"When the next flood comes we will hang the vegetables from the platforms to save them from destruction.\" Joygan is proud of her well-decorated bamboo cabinet where dozens of potted herbs and vegetables grow. She has more than 50 plants of around 12 varieties, all pre-prepared to shift to higher ground. Pumpkin and cucumber vines meanwhile are grown on raised trellises. \"This flood season our family will eat rice with vegetables,\" she beams. These simple strategies have been introduced by non-government organisation Manob Mukti Sangstha. \"Farmers have been given training on how to continue to benefit from their vegetable and herb crops in times of flood,\" explains Md Obaidul Islam, manager of the organisation's \"Climate Smart Village\" project. \"We supply the equipment needed for them to establish their first mobile gardens.\" For larger trees which can also suffer from being submerged, there are other strategies. \"I have planted the big trees at the raised floor-level of our home this year,\" says another training recipient, Kadbanu Begum, also from Betil Char. \"The trees are bottle-fed water to account for being planted on higher ground.\" Vegetables are also grown in movable cases on a scaffold. Many in Sirajganj are now practising these farming techniques to protect their crops from flood.  Photo: Ahmed Humayun Kabir Topu\n \"I also have over a hundred vegetables plants in bags and pots,\" she adds. \"Every corner of my home is now used for crop cultivation.\" The produce grown isn't only for household use. As well as ensuring an uninterrupted vegetable supply at home, vegetables can be sold for much-needed cash. Seedlings too can be sown even while a flood is in progress, ready for replanting when water recedes. \"In flood-prone areas people don't always get the full nutrition that they need,\" notes the non-government organisation's director, Md Rafikul Islam. \"Damaged and destroyed crops represent a loss even after a flood has passed. We have been able to train around 5,000 farmers thus far, but many more are learning the same skills from them.\""

      "text": "A large part of Sylhet region has been flooded as rivers have swollen over the safe level. Hundreds of villages were inundated in Kanaighat, Zakiganj, Gowainghat and Jaintiapur upazilas of Sylhet yesterday. As the water level rose in parts of Moulvibazar, Pradip Maliha, 30, a tea estate worker went missing on Wednesday night in Kulaura upazila. Villagers said he was probably swept away when the Manu river burst its banks and water rushed into neighbourhoods. Officials said about 2,800 families have been marooned in their homes as the water levels rose in Moulvibazar, inundating roads and snapping communications in many areas. In Kamalganj upazila of the district, over 700 hectares of farmland were flooded and the crops damaged, said Upazila Nirbahi Officer Mahmudul Huq. About 5,500 families were affected by the flash flooding on Wednesday and the situation continued to worsen yesterday, he added. The upazila administration received 45 tonnes of rice and Tk 50,000 to help the victims. In Sylhet, continued rainfalls have exacerbated flash flooding, Debojit Singha, additional deputy commissioner, said. Yesterday's bulletin of Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board states that the Surma, Kushiyara and Sarigowain rivers in Sylhet, Manu river in Moulvibazar and Khowai river in Habiganj are overflowing. The Surma river at Kanaighat was swollen 206cm above the safe level yesterday morning. It swelled 23cm over the safe level near Sylhet city. In Moulvibazar, the Kushiyara river was flowing 161cm above the safe level at Amalshid and the Manu river of was flowing 125cm above safe level at Manu Railway Bridge.  In Habiganj, the Khowai River was flowing 92cm above safe level at Ballah. Flood water continued to rise in the town throughout yesterday. Most of the flood-affected people in in three upazilas of Moulvibazar district have been passing their days in misery due to acute crisis of food and drinking water. Now 2,800 new families are marooned. According to the WDB officials, the flood will worsen if the rain continues. Upazila administrations in Kulaura and Kamalganj distributed rice and cash to affected families. But those who received the relief said the amounts were too small. Residents also said the relief efforts should reach affected areas faster. \"Four bighas of land, on which I cultivated vegetable, have gone under water. If the flood water doesn't recede immediately, everything will be lost,\" Afsar Ali, a farmer in Baliara village of Kulaura, told our Moulvibazar correspondent. Sahjahan Chowdhury, deputy director of agricultural extension department in Moulvibazar, said paddy fields in the districts were likely to have been damaged by the flood. Farmers are also facing acute crisis of fodder."

Green chili prices have more than doubled with each kg being sold for between Tk 180 and Tk 200, up from Tk 70 to 90 at different kitchen markets in the capital.  Prices of onion and garlic have also increased by Tk 10 to Tk 30 per kg. Retailers and wholesalers say the floods were pushing the prices upwards. \"We know the floods have damaged crops. The vegetables prices could rise as a result, but not to this extent,\" said Sayem Rahman, who was shopping at Hatirpool kitchen market yesterday. \n \"Look at the price of green chilli. How is it justifiable?\" he asked. At Sheorapara kitchen market, Rotna Begum, wife of an auto-rickshaw driver, said, \"I wanted to buy two vegetable items. But the prices are so high I could only afford a kg of pointed gourd for Tk 50.\" The pictures were similar at kitchen markets in Karwan Bazar, Hatirpool, Moghbazar, Sheorapara and Kazipara areas. The prices of bitter gourd, pointed gourd, ladies' finger, snake gourd, asparagus bean, papaya and all verities of spinach also increased significantly. However, potato, imported tomato and carrot prices remain nearly unchanged. Ramiz Uddin, a wholesaler of vegetables in Karwan Bazar, said the supplies have reduced significantly due to the flooding. \"I used to bring about six tonnes of vegetables from Manikganj every day. But now I bring only about 1.5 tonnes. The prices are high there too,\" he said. He added that the prices may rise further if farmlands continue to remain inundated next week. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, the floods have affected a large portion of farmlands in 26 districts until last Friday. About 39,000 hectares of Aush fields, 11,000 hectares of Aman seedbeds, and 10,000 hectares of vegetable farms have been submerged, it said. Prices of vegetables and meat soared excessively at both wholesale and retail markets in the port city as well. In the wholesale markets, the average price of all kinds of vegetables rose by Tk 10 last week while a dozen egg now sells for Tk 125, which was Tk 110 a week ago. Traders said stored vegetables were damaged during the incessant downpour last week, leading to the price hike. Amir Hasan Shahriar from Chattogram contributed to this report"

      "text": "With water level in all major rivers falling below the danger mark upstream, flood situation in northern districts shows signs of improvement. But the miseries of tens of thousands of people in the flood-hit areas are far from over. Inadequate government relief and crises of food and drinking water have compounded their woes. Prices of rice, lentil and vegetable have gone up in the affected areas as crops on vast swathes of land got damaged. A number of flood victims complained that relief provided by the authorities was insufficient to meet their daily needs. Abdul Latif, a flood victim in Rehai Gabsara village in Tangail's Bhuapur, said they are facing a shortage of drinking water as most of the tube-wells in the area have gone under water. Though floods hit the district three days ago, relief distribution was yet to start there. However, Mohammad Ashraf Hossain, upazila nirbahi officer of Bhuapur, said relief programme would begin today and would continue. Flood situation remains unchanged in Jamalpur and Sirajganj while it has worsened in Manikganj, Munshiganj and Shariatpur. Talking to The Daily Star, Sazzad Hossain, executive engineer of Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, said, \"The water level in the major rivers has already dropped below the danger mark upstream. The flood situation will improve if it doesn't rain upstream.\" In Dhaka, five rivers around the capital are now flowing below the danger level, he added. Sayed Hasan Imam, executive engineer of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) in Sirajganj, said all embankments in the district still face threat of erosion. Contacted, Abdur Rahim, district relief and rehabilitation officer, said a total of 491 villages were flooded in the district over the last five days and more than three lakh people remain marooned. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to visit the flood-affected areas in Dinajpur and Kurigram on Sunday. Many of the flood-hit people are unable to return home from temporary shelters as their houses were badly damaged. In Lalmonirhat, 68-year-old Madina Bewa of Shiberkuti village cannot return home though floodwater receded from her house. \"A large portion of my house got badly damaged in the flood. I don't have the money to repair it,\" said Madina, who has taken shelter near the main road in Mughalhaat area, around one kilometre from her home. Like her, 48-year-old Abbas Mia has no option but to stay at a temporary shelter. \"I'll have to arrange money to rebuild my house that got destroyed in flood... I along with my four family members must stay on the BWDB dam till then,\" said Abbas of Char Kulaghat village in the district. Many others face similar crisis in Kurigram, Thakurgaon, Gaibandha, Panchagarh, Nilphamari, Bogra, Jamalpur and Naogaon. Flood is also taking a heavy toll on cattle farmers in eight districts -- Sirajganj, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Tangail, Gaibandha, Dinajpur, Nilphamari and Jamalpur. They are struggling to find a safe place for their domestic animals. Most of them brought those to higher places near the main roads to save those from floodwater. \"I have three cows. My home got submerged a couple of days ago. I had to take the animals to a place near Belkuchi-Enayetpur road on Tuesday,\" said Fazlur Rahman of Ambaria village in Sirajganj. Not only Fazlur, hundreds of cattle farmers in the district had to bring their animals to higher places near the main roads. They are also facing a shortage of fodder for the animals. \"The grasslands in my village are flooded. Now I have no choice but to buy fodder for my cattle,\" said Akbar Hossain, a cattle farmer from Shahzadpur upazila. In Jamalpur, the bodies of two missing persons, including a student, were found floating in a waterbody at Bhaluka village yesterday morning. The two were washed away by strong current on Wednesday, said Mazharul Karim, officer-in-charge of Melandah Police Station. In Rajshahi, a woman has been missing since 1:00pm yesterday as she fell in a beel (a waterbody) in Govindapara Union of Bagmara Upazila. Govindapara Union Council Chairman Bijon Sarker said divers of the fire service launched a search for Jaynur Bibi, 45, wife of Abu Sayeed. At least six lakh children have already been affected by floods, according to an estimate of Save the Children in Bangladesh. Hundreds of schools remain closed, disrupting studies of thousands of children in 20 districts, reports UNB citing a press release of Save the Children. It also mentioned that floods have affected half a million families. According to the disaster management and relief ministry, 2.2 million people have become homeless due to flood in the country's northern region.

      "text": "After wreaking havoc across the capital, the dengue disease has spread to 60 other districts, according to the Directorate General of Health Services. Meanwhile, four people who were diagnosed with dengue died last night. The districts without any dengue patients are Netrokona, Joypurhat and Meherpur. The rapid spread of the disease has been termed alarming by experts. According to a Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) report, a record 1,845 patients outside of Dhaka were diagnosed with the viral disease yesterday alone. In 24 hours since 8:00am on Sunday, 1,335 new dengue cases were reported -- the highest in a single day -- the DGHS said. The data also shows 15,359 people have been infected with the mosquito-borne disease until yesterday -- the highest ever in the country. Last year, the number was 10,148. Many, however, said the number could be higher as many cases are unreported. Of the four people who died yesterday from dengue, two were in Dhaka and two in Barishal. With them, 41 people have died after contracting the disease, according to hospital sources. The DGHS data, however, still shows the number of deaths to be 8. Farzana Hossain, 42, from Siddhirganj of Narayanganj, breathed her last at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Dhaka Medical College Hospital around 1:45am, said Nasiruddin, assistant director of the DMCH. In Barishal, two people -- Aslam Khan, 24, and Sohel, 18 -- died at the Sher-E-Bangla Medical College Hospital. Both of them had contracted dengue, said doctors. Aslam, hailing from Shyampur Bakerganj of Barishal, was rushed to the hospital in an unconscious state on Monday night and died around 3:15am, our district correspondent reported, quoting the hospital's director Dr Bakir Hossain. Sohel, 18, was also taken to the hospital from his hometown in Kaukhali area of Pirojpur around 1:20am. He breathed his last around 3:40am, the official said. In Chattogram, there was a sharp rise in dengue cases, with 59 patients hospitalised at government and private hospitals over the last two days. Dr Nurul Haidar Shamim, medical officer (disease control) of Chattogram Civil Surgeon Office, said, \"Till July 30, there were 120 patients affected by dengue who are undergoing treatment at two government hospitals and nine private hospitals.\" Azizur Rahman Siddiqui, civil surgeon of Chattogram, said, \"People who visited Dhaka came back with the dengue virus. We will try our best so that not a single life succumbs to the disease.\" Meanwhile, AJM Nasir Uddin, mayor of Chattogram City Corporation (CCC), declared that dengue tests would be done for free at all CCC-owned hospitals from Sunday. Hasan Shahriar Kabir, director of the directorate of Chattogram divisional health office, said every government hospital would conduct free dengue tests. Action will be taken against those who do not do so. Around 66 suspected dengue patients were undergoing treatment at Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH). MMCH authorities have started free antigen tests to diagnose dengue at two pathology departments of the hospital's outdoor and emergency units from yesterday. In Kishoreganj, some 59 dengue patients were taking treatment at different hospitals, including at Kishoreganj General Hospital, said Dr Md Habibur Rahman, the district's civil surgeon. Around 139 people were infected with dengue in the district over the last two weeks, said the civil surgeon. Regarding the patients, the doctors said they were likely infected with the disease in Dhaka and other areas outside the district. They were admitted after they returned to Kishoreganj. Meanwhile, hospitals in the capital are still struggling to deal with the excessive number of dengue patients and also those who are coming to take the dengue tests even if they are not runing a fever.  \"Our pathology departments are struggling to provide free dengue tests due to the large number of patients,\" said Uttam Kumar Barua, director of Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital. Some 268 patients were being treated in the hospital and the number of patients is increasing every day, he said. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday said, \"The government is working to tackle dengue ... the leaders and activists of the party should work alongside it.\" Hasina, now in London, made the remarks at a special extended meeting of the Awami League at the party headquarters, which she joined via teleconference. Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader briefed the media in this regard. \"People should be aware of dengue. We've to regularly clean our households,\" she said, urging everyone to combat the situation with patience, according to Quader. The majority of dengue patients are from Dhaka. Earlier this month, the WHO said the dengue situation was alarming in Bangladesh but it was not out of control. Meanwhile, the railway ministry has directed all railway offices and establishments to take extra cleanliness measures to prevent the breeding of Aedes mosquitoes. The ministry gave several directives during a meeting held its office on Monday to create awareness on dengue fever and how to control its spread. Rail Secretary Mofazzel Hossain presided over the meeting. Talking to The Daily Star yesterday, the secretary said Bangladesh Railway had around 500 stations, a number of offices, residents, trains and establishments. The railway stations, especially, are vulnerable as they can be breeding grounds for mosquitoes.  This is why the directives have been given to carry out cleanliness drives at the stations and other establishments, taking help from city corporations or municipalities, he said. Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) Mayor Sayeed Khokon yesterday sought help from the people to tackle the Aedes mosquitoes. Speaking after a mobile court drive at Shantinagar, the mayor said DSCC was working hard to tackle the disease but it needed the help of the people to destroy mosquito larvae. He said they have identified under construction buildings at the DSCC areas where the number of Aedes mosquito larvae is higher than in other places. Khokon said the problem could be tackled with a united effort. The leaves of all officials and employees of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has been cancelled due to dengue and the floods. \"According to the decision of a meeting that took place on Monday afternoon, the leave of all officials of the Health and Family Welfare Ministry has been cancelled due to the flood and dengue,\" said a press release signed by Maidul Islam Prodhan, the ministry's information officer. Besides, a monitoring cell has been formed at the office of Health Minister Zahid Maleque. It will monitor the dengue outbreak situation and ministry activities regarding it round the clock. The monitoring cell will also take action if any hospital does not comply with the government directives regarding the price of dengue test, said the release."

      "text": "Saidur Rahman is a village doctor by profession. But he was struggling to make ends meet with the money he earned by serving the people of Ramnatherbhita village in Gaibandha Sadar upazila. Years back, to find a way out, he started growing rice on the one bigha land that he owns. After several years of incurring losses due to floods and falling prices, he tried out his luck in growing vegetables following organic methods. Saidur hit a turning point in 2004 when he finally made some profit from the sale of Tk 16 thousand worth of vegetables. From then on, he did not have to look back.  Encouraged by the profit, he leased one more bigha of land for vegetable farming in 2006. That year he earned Tk 30 thousand from sales. Now he grows various types of organic vegetables -- such as cauliflower, cabbage, brinjal, potato, bitter gourd, pumpkin, bean and leafy vegetables -- on seven bighas of land in total. Recollecting his past struggles, Saidur said, \"It was quite difficult to support the family with the meagre income from the village doctor profession. But now, by the grace of the Almighty, I've been living a much better life by growing vegetables.\" He made Tk 1.15 lakh from sales last season and with vegetable prices showing a rising trend in markets, he said he expects to sell Tk 2 lakh worth of vegetables this season. \"Chemical fertilisers and pesticides are harmful to human health. So, I use organic fertilisers and natural pesticides in my vegetable fields. There's a good demand for vegetables grown in my garden and I'm getting a good price too.\" Thanking the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) for their training, Saidur said he also tries as much as possible to help out other interested vegetable farmers with tips and suggestions on how to grow vegetables organically. Inspired by Saidur's success, many others in his and neighbouring villages have started growing vegetables under organic methods. Ramnatherbhita resident Abul Kalam said his earnings doubled after he switched from growing traditional crops to organic farming of vegetables on his one and a half bighas land.        Masudur Rahman, deputy director of DAE in Gaibandha, said the department strives to improve farming techniques through organising training programmes for farmers all throughout the year."

      "text": "The 25th Conference of Parties (COP25) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) ended just days ago. Already, many reviews, mostly negative, have come out globally including in this newspaper. I called the COPs often a process of \"active inaction\" in my first book on climate politics published by Routledge in 2014. The zenith of its failure was COP15, held in Copenhagen, which the media later sarcastically called \"Hopenhagen/Brokenhagen\". How can COP be, then, an effective platform for branding Bangladesh?    Actually, not all COPs can be called a failure. Since the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992, there have been a few milestones, such as COP3 which adopted the Kyoto Protocol and COP7 which adopted the Marrakech Accords, establishing three funds to support developing countries. COP13 was a success too, adopting the Bali Action Plan. It put \"adaptation\" on a par with \"mitigation\", long demanded by the developing countries. The Paris Agreement was adopted at COP21 as a universal, bottom-up process which mandated all countries to undertake emissions reduction progressively under their periodically submitted nationally determined contributions. Yet I put the title of this piece in a very positive spirit. Based on my long years of negotiating experience, I regard UNFCCC meetings as the most public form of global diplomacy today. Why? Despite all its lacklustre performance, it has great value in branding a country like Bangladesh to global stakeholders who matter in development discourse. Let me explain. First, climate negotiation, now the number one global agenda, is virtually development diplomacy. Since the publications of the 3rd and 4th Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 and 2007, climate issues have begun to be treated very much as development issues. Climate change as the most diabolically complex and wicked policy problem touches the very foundational aspects of modern life and development. Without mainstreaming climate change into the development strategy, no country can achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Bangladesh is already ahead in putting a policy-institutional framework along this trajectory. Despite all the climate adversities that keep pounding us each year, we are achieving a growth rate of about 8 percent. This sounds like a miracle to many foreigners.    Second, a huge number of participants attend these negotiations at least twice--in May/June and November/December--each year. No other global negotiations happen so openly, under one roof, with the participation of so many delegates from 197 governments, observers representing a variety of stakeholders, such as NGOs of many hues, bilateral and multilateral agencies, think tanks and journalists. According to one estimate, an average of 25,000 participants attend each meeting. All these stakeholders keep their eyes and ears open to know what's happening around. Third, since 2014, the UNFCCC has been working on a Gender Action Program and the COP25 initiated a roadmap for implementation of the Action Plan. Bangladesh already has adopted a Gender and Climate Action Plan years back. In gender parameters, Bangladesh stands out among South Asian and many other developing countries including in girls' education, which is one key to solving the climate crisis. This deserves to be shared at COPs. Fourth, the Chilean presidency was active in promoting this COP as a Blue COP. Before and during the COP, several events took place highlighting the role of oceans in tackling climate change. Just a few months ago, the IPCC published a special report on oceans and cryosphere which highlighted the impacts of climate change and how the oceans can contribute to addressing the problem. The next COP is likely to adopt \"oceans and climate change\" as a formal agenda. With the successful delimitation of our maritime boundaries with neighbours, Bangladesh is now developing a Blue Strategy, which is of utmost importance for such a small landmass. So Bangladesh does have concerns to raise at COPs. Fifth, climate change and human and national security issues are getting intertwined and being recognised as such globally. The UN General Assembly and Security Council got involved with this a decade ago and it will gain further momentum. With its potential to trigger largescale climate-induced displacement thanks to global sea level rise, climate change is very much an existential threat for us, like for many small island states. Here, COP is the forum where we can raise our concerns on this. Sixth, Bangladesh as a graduating country from the LDCs has a high moral/ethical ground in climate diplomacy. We are innocent victims of actions taken beyond our borders. The major emitters, particularly from developed countries, resort to double standards and moral corruption. While they impose carbon tax or other market instruments in limiting emissions within their borders, they enjoy freeriding in exporting emissions into a borderless atmosphere. They continue to see national interests through the centuries-old, national-territory-based Westphalian sovereignty, held still so dearly by many powers, old and new. But climate change violates the basic human and development rights of vulnerable counties like ours. The no-harm rule is a sacrosanct principle in Western legal system. Obviously, we need a new lens of \"pooled sovereignty\" with enlightened interests to solve global commons issues like atmospheric instability. With its increasingly declining aid dependency, Bangladesh must lead the way to make the collective voice louder. Now let me explicate the benefits that the Pavilion of Bangladesh obtained at COP25. Organising this for the first time is just a beginning of showcasing our country. Attended by foreign and Bangladeshi delegates, we were able to project many different faces of Bangladesh. From having the image of one of the most vulnerable, we had been able to change the narrative to a model of adaptation. This is now recognised globally. Ban Ki-moon calls Bangladesh a \"teacher\" in adaptation to learn from. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, an active leader in climate diplomacy, calls Bangladesh the world's \"adaptation capital\". So, such a pavilion can reinforce this narrative in COP meetings, which can rightly be regarded as a microcosm of the globe. In the end, let me reiterate a few issues that Bangladesh should do as preparations for the next COP. Our garment sector, which drives our export economy, is impacted by climate change in different direct and indirect ways. Based on solid research, we can project the negative impacts on the sector and how the global community can support us to achieve a low-carbon manufacturing process. Already, Bangladesh stands out in having the highest number of environment-friendly garment factories. This year at COP25, IDCOL had an effective presence, and we should encourage more such private-sector participation to showcase their processes and products. Next, we should initiate some research in earnest on blue economy, to look for its potential and pitfalls from the perspective of climate change. This should be presented at a side event in Bangladesh Pavilion. Finally, the Bangladesh delegation, I must say, fares well in the negotiations. We have the potential of doing a lot better, given that more rigorous homework is done. This warrants analytical exercises well before each meeting to generate novel ideas for consensus-building. For the purpose, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance, Economic Relations Division, Planning Commission, along with NGOs and the private sector must work together to put greater efforts in building the capacity of negotiators, focusing on the young generation, to hold our flag aloft in the most visible, most widely-publicised global diplomatic forum.    Mizan R Khan is Deputy Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), and Program Director, LDC Universities Consortium on Climate Change (LUCCC)."

      "text": "The first time I visited Satkhira, the tide country, was as a student of Environmental Science. And I remember returning with pages upon pages of focus group discussions with villagers who were living in homes that had been cut off from nearly everything because of water-logging. They talked of a life constantly battling a disaster. Almost all these villages were under siege from water-logging, thanks to the 1960s and 70s flood control and drainage provision projects. This was in 2012 and I was visiting the villages in the area as part of a \"Disaster Management\" course. Despite their complaints, the locals back then were also hopeful of a new project taken up by the government which promised to completely eradicate water-logging in the area, bring back to life the dying Kabodakh river and elevate and even reclaim land in the lower-lying lands of the river basin (thus effectively creating a means to adapt to climate change). Bangladesh is considered one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, and Satkhira, it is believed, will be one of the most affected. Fast-forward to 2018 and the project which was meant to be implemented in 2011-2012 has finally been in operation for around three years now, and is beginning to show results. Breathing life back into a dying river The sight was dystopian to say the least--watching huge CAT dredgers with the pristine backdrop of the Kabodakh river in Tala upazila of Satkhira. But the locals were clearly unfazed by this bizarre sight. The Kabodakh river was running dry and dredging, at that time, seemed like the only way out of this crisis. But drawing from other examples of rivers in Bangladesh, we know that once a river dies from siltation, sporadic dredging is not the answer. You dredge once, the river jumps back to its original state temporarily but the siltation process is continuous and the river gets filled up again. In the south-west districts of Bangladesh, this problem is more pronounced. That is because these rivers are subject to tidal action. Everyday, twice a day, water from the bay rushes in: this is high tide. With the incoming tide, also comes sediment in high speed. The high tide is followed by ebb tide, this is when the water recedes. This ebb tide, however, happens at a lower velocity, and as the water speed slows down, it leaves back sediment in the riverbed, eventually raising the riverbed and in the process, ending up killing the river completely. This is essentially what happened to Kabodakh river. Now you might wonder: why, then, did the locals blame flood embankment projects from the 60s for all of this? For this we need to look back a few decades. Following severe floods in 1954, the East Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (EPWAPDA) and present-day Bangladesh Water Development Board worked towards establishing embankments in the area to protect the area from flooding. Under the Coastal Embankment Project (CEP), which started in the late 50s and continued until the early 80s, polders were constructed in the south-west delta to decrease saline intrusion in the flood plains and to increase agricultural production. In the beginning, the project looked promising. People could now have three harvests compared to their one harvest before. However, in the late 1980s, the delta started to experience severe problems related to drainage congestion and water logging. This meant agricultural production also went down and some areas became permanently waterlogged, according to a 2007 report by the Asian Development Bank. This rapid sedimentation is blamed on a lack of upstream flow which helps in flushing out sediment from these rivers. The construction of embankments decreased the volume of water entering the river during high and low tide which then reduced the flow velocity (speed) of the water in these tidal rivers. Consequently, sediment started settling down in rivers that were essential for draining the polders made under the CEP. Before the CEP, sedimentation occurred mainly on the low-lying floodplains--that is, the river water would sometimes flood the nearby plains of the river bank and the sediment would settle there. As the water retreated through the river channel during ebb tide--causing relatively high flow velocity--sediment settled on the floodplains instead of the riverbed during dead tide. Because of the presence of the floodplains holding large quantities of water, rivers would drain a large quantity of water, which resulted in a reduced pace of overall sedimentation and maintain the navigability of the river. But the embankments effectively limited the water flowing into the river from draining into lower lying floodplains. Locals for a few short years were relieved from flooding but the river dynamics were severely affected by this man-made intervention. The silt and sediment brought in by the incoming tide now just settled on the river-bed thus slowly filling it up completely.  The river-bed continued to get raised compared to the other land areas nearby and as a result, rainwater and floodwater would not drain into the river. Thus began years of water-logging around so many of the upazilas in Satkhira, just around 15 years after the implementation of the CEP. \"I can show you maps of the Satkhira upazila over the 70s, 80s and 90s and you can see it getting bluer and bluer by each decade. You know what that is? That is water-logging. Villages upon villages, schools, agricultural land just under stagnant water that refuses to drain because a project implemented years back thought that by doing so, they would relieve the people of this area from flooding,\" says Jahin Shams, programme manager of Uttaran, one of the NGOs responsible for facilitating locals in the tidal river management basin getting compensation. The Tidal River Management (TRM) project was basically born out of these trying times. Implemented in 2015, the TRM basically aimed at bringing back the Kabodakh river to life. At the lower end of the Kabodakh river, where incoming tide is at its highest speed, the Bangladesh government first had to acquire land to broaden a channel that would take the river water towards a basin. By the time the water rich in sediment and silt reaches the basin, the speed at which the river water is flowing reduces significantly and the sediment is dropped at the basin and the rest of the water just drains back. If you are finding it hard to visualise the entire process then you are among the majority. It took me a whopping six years--through my university years and then some more time while I tried to write this story--to somewhat grasp how the TRM process actually works. But work it does. That is what essentially matters. Since the TRM project started operation in full swing, the Kabodakh river was dredged as well to remove all the silt that had gathered on the riverbed. The project essentially resulted in silt being collected in a basin, which was a low-lying area where influential people used to do shrimp-farming. The dropping off of silt in the basin raised the land area there. That is one merit of the TRM project--land reclamation. This raising of land area also acts as a defense against climate change. Because these areas are basically at sea-level, a single foot raise in the sea-level would mean these lands are left inundated completely. The project has also ensured that the Kabodakh river is back to life finally. The water has returned to the river and as a result it can now drain rain water and any rise in water levels does not mean eventual water-logging of nearby villages. Because the river can now hold water, both rain and flood water can drain back into the river. This is the second and most important merit of this project--no more water-logging in the villages in and around the Kabodakh river basin. Since the project was implemented in 2015-16, incidents of waterlogging have been almost completely eradicated. \"Even in 2017, when the entire country experienced flooding on a massive scale, the villages in Tala upazila and other upazilas of the Kabodakh basin were not affected,\" says Jahin Shams. He also believes that the project has ensured that the silt and sediment has someplace where it can be dropped off by virtue of tidal action in the river. And this is a more or less permanent solution to the crisis. The TRM also means that there is no more need for regular dredging of the river. But no project can be hundred percent free of demerits. \"I did not get any compensation, neither was any measure taken to rehabilitate us. My son had to go away to another area to manage a job. We did not own any land in this area but worked off of the land, working on shrimp farms here, but that is now gone and because we do not have any legal claim to the land, we are not eligible for compensation,\" says Hajera Begum, a 60-year old resident who lives at the mouth of the TRM basin area. This should not come as a surprise because, according to Uttaran, no budget was allocated by the Bangladesh Water Development Board to rehabilitate those who are not legal land owners in the area but who were affected by the connecting channel to Pakhimara Beel in Kabodakh basin. The demerit of TRM is not in the science behind the process, but in the implementation of it. People whose land had to be acquired for broadening the channel of the TRM project are the ones who have been negatively impacted by the project. These people did not get their due compensation. Some 2,079 families who live around the lower end of the Kabodakh river are among those affected. But this can be duly addressed as well just by simplifying the process of getting compensation. These are ultra-poor people and many of them do not have the right legal documents to be eligible for compensation,\" says Shams. However, Uttaran, the organisation responsible for ensuring the compensation reaches the right people are working to address this, by acquiring documents and making runs to the Satkhira land office, he opines.  Hajera is not entirely against the TRM though. \"The newly reclaimed land where the silt was deposited has seen a bumper harvest of rice this year. People did not even need to use fertiliser,\" says Hajera. The Kabodakh river is beautiful under the setting sun. We sit and watch as river dolphins come to play with the changing of tide. The dolphins have come back to the river after nearly a few decades and it is easy to see why there are so many people who are demanding for the TRM to be implemented on their dying rivers as well."

      "text": "Educational activities of lakhs of students in the northern and central regions of the country are in a shambles as over a thousand schools remain submerged or were washed away by flood waters in the past few weeks. Aside from being inundated or damaged by the flood, many schools in 18 districts of these two regions had to be shut down due to dwindling attendance of students who along with their family members had to take refuge in flood shelters away from the schools, report our correspondents.      Moreover, in many cases, books and other stationery belonging to a large number of these students had been lost or damaged. The government will provide new books to the students whose books had been lost or damaged due to the flood, assured education officers of the affected districts, one of them being Mohammad Hossain, primary education officer of Bogra. When asked how teachers in these schools would compensate for the lost hours in lesson time, Hossain said makeup classes will be arranged in schools in the affected areas.  The makeup classes will start if the flood waters recede in the next two to three days and if necessary, the classes will continue during the weekly or public holidays, he added. The worst affected district is Kurigram where around 43,000 students of 248 primary schools have been badly affected as their dwellings and schools have been inundated by the flood waters, according to district primary education office (DPEO) sources, The schools have been closed for around two weeks, said Dabir Uddin, DPEO of Kurigram. However, he said the water has been subsiding day by day. Our district administration sources in Bogra said in Sariakandi upazila alone, at least 83 primary schools, 10 high schools and one madrasa have been affected by the floods this year and a number of institutions in char (shoal) areas have been washed away completely. According to Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) operated by Bangladesh Water Development Board, the water levels of the rivers Brahmaputra, Surma, Kushiyara, and Teesta have been falling while that of the Ganges and the Padma have been unchanged. And therefore, the flood situation in the northern and north-eastern districts will improve soon. In the meantime, water levels in the Balu, Turag, Lakhya and Buriganga will continue to rise over the next 24 hours, worsening the situation around the capital, said FFWC. Students hit the hardest by the floods this year are the ones living on the chars of the Jamuna and the Teesta where levels of water have been above the danger mark for nearly two weeks.   The situation in Tangail, Munshiganj, Manikganj, Rajbari and Faridpur districts are still worsening, with no sign of respite to the students of the area in sight.  In Tangail, as of yesterday, 420 schools in the district have been inundated. Among them 290 are primary schools and 130 high schools, said Mohammad Mokhlesur Rahman, additional deputy commissioner (education) in Tangail. Our correspondent from Faridpur reports, nearly 60 educational institutions in the district have been affected by the flood.  Our Jamalpur correspondent, quoting district education officer, said the floods have damaged over 400 educational institutions in the district.  Our correspondents from Tangail, Kurigram, Bogra and Jamalpur contributed to this report."

      "text": "Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said the world must take all measures to force Myanmar to create conditions enabling safe, dignified and voluntary return of Rohingyas to their ancestral home. She was addressing an interactive dialogue titled \"A conversation with Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\" at Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in New York on Wednesday. \"Through planned atrocities, the government of Myanmar cleansed its Northern Rakhine State of the Rohingya minority. They fled violence and atrocities and we opened our border to shelter them on humanitarian ground,\" the PM said. Hasina said Bangladesh is providing humanitarian support to the Rohingyas to the best of its ability. \"We want a peaceful and immediate resolution of the crisis. Myanmar has created the crisis and the solution lies in Myanmar.\" The PM said the international community, particularly the EU, China and the USA, have been extremely helpful to Bangladesh in dealing with the crisis. She urged all to visit the Rohingya camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. \"We believe, while in those camps you will be shaken by their horrifying stories of atrocities at the hands of the Myanmar security forces and local vigilantes. After seeing their plight, I believe, you will want to see an end to their painful predicament the soonest.\" The PM mentioned that Bangladesh faces climate change as one of the challenges in its development journey. She said the frequency and intensity of cyclones, floods and droughts have increased over the years. The government, therefore, adopted the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan in 2009. Under this plan, Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund was set up with the country's own resources. Since then, nearly $450 million have been spent on several hundred projects, mostly on adaptation and a few on mitigation, Hasina added. The other significant challenge to Bangladesh's economic progress is terrorism and violent extremism. The government has taken \"zero tolerance\" policy against these social menaces, she mentioned. She recommended four measures to fight against terrorism and violent extremism. They are: Must stop the source of supply of arms to the terrorists, must stop the flow of financing to terrorists and their outfits, must remove the divisions within societies and must pursue the principle of peaceful settlement of international disputes through dialogue for a win-win situation. Hasina said the government has equipped the law enforcement agencies and taken steps to socially isolate the extremists and terrorists. \"We have also taken digital measures to stem the spread of lies and hate narratives. In countering terrorism, we have excellent cooperation with both regional and global partners. As a result, since the Holey Artisan attack on July 1, 2016, there has been no major incident. Our people remain increasingly vigilant as we are committed to ensuring the safety of our people and supporting security situation beyond our borders,\" she said. Later, the PM replied to questions on various issues, including Rohingya, the unity of Muslim Ummah, the situation in the RMG sector, food security, social safety net programmes and women empowerment. Responding to a question on Rohingya repatriation, she said Bangladesh had talks with Myanmar and the discussions were underway and the international community also supported it. \"The problem is that these people [Rohingyas] don't want to go back as they feel insecure.\" Hasina said Myanmar changed its constitution in 1982 without mentioning the Rohingyas as their citizens and called them outsiders. \"At one stage of our dialogue, Myanmar agreed to take back their nationals from Bangladesh. But in the Rohingya camps, some people instigated them not to go back home.\" She said Myanmar should create an atmosphere so that the Rohingyas can go back and live on their own land. The PM, however, said the international pressure is very important for the repatriation of the Rohingyas. \"But somehow it seems to me that the organisations working in Cox's Bazar Rohingya camps don't want these people to go back and they [organisations] are trying to prevent them.\" About the Muslim Ummah, Hasina said when she joined the OIC Summit in Makkah, she raised the issue that if there is any problem between the Muslim countries, it should be resolved through a dialogue or discussion. \"But somehow it is not happening and you know wherein the problem lies.\" The PM said there are many resourceful countries which cannot use their resources on their own and those who are helping them have some games to play and they have been pursuing the \"divide and rule\" policy in this regard. \"This is very unfortunate and Muslims should realise it.\" \"Every time in OIC, I raised the issue that the OIC should take some steps. But it is not happening anyway,\" she added. PM's ICT Adviser Sajeeb Wazed Joy, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen, Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi, Health Minister Zahid Maleque, Environment, Forest and Climate Change Minister Md Shahab Uddin, State Minister for Foreign Affairs Md Shahriar Alam, Bangladesh Ambassador to USA M Ziauddin, CFR President Richard N Haas and distinguished members of CFR were present at the event."

      "text": "Bangladesh needs to build self-capacity to combat climate change as countries failed to reach any consensus on ways to implement the Paris Agreement in the latest COP25 conference, civil society members said today. The alternatives can be reached through future development strategies and gaining competency to combat climate change, they said at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU) in the capital. Coast Trust, in association with several other organisations, organised the press meet titled 'COP25 Climate Conference and the Observation of Civil Society'. In the COP21 in Paris in 2015, nearly 200 nations signed the climate deal in which each country provides its own goals to curb emissions of heat-trapping gases that lead to climate change. On December 2-13 last year, the longest 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP25, was held aiming to finalise the \"rulebook\" of the Paris Agreement - the operating manual needed when it takes effect in 2020 - by settling on rules for carbon markets and other forms of international cooperation. Due to discontent between the developed economies and the least developed countries, however, the talks were unable to reach consensus in many areas, pushing decisions into COP26 scheduled to be held next year in Glasgow, UK. In this context, speakers at the conference stressed for planning alternative strategies to continue and strengthening ongoing climate action plan for Bangladesh, and placed some recommendations in this regard.   \"Disputed issues of COP are too complex to bring out an acceptable global outcome in time, even from the future COP conferences,\" the speakers claimed. Hence, Bangladesh has to come up with alternative ways of its own to combat climate change, they added.   Syed Aminul Haque, deputy director of Coast Trust, presented the keynote paper in the event while Atiq Rahman, executive director of Bangladesh Centre for Advance Studies, and Md Shamsuddoha, chief executive of Centre for Participatory Research and Development (CPRD), also addressed the programme among others. Rezaul Karim Chowdhury, executive director of COAST Trust, moderated the programme."

Bangladesh will purchase 200,000 tonnes of white rice and 50,000 parboiled rice this year, Cambodia's Commerce Minister Pan Sorasak told reporters, after signing a Memorandum of Understanding with Bangladeshi Food Minister Qamrul Islam in Phnom Penh. \"We will be able to export to Bangladesh by around October after signing this deal,\" he added. Bangladesh, the world's fourth-biggest rice producer, has now become a major importer of the grain this year after flash floods in April hit their domestic output. As a result, the country is facing dwindling stockpiles and high local rates. \"Due to the floods we have a problem this year. We came here to implement an MoU with Cambodia,\" said Kamrul Islam. Cambodia said this is their biggest rice export deal, and also plans to renew an MoU with Indonesia as well. \"We want to push for a 1-million-tonne deal with Indonesia,\" said Commerce Ministry spokeswoman Soeng Sophary. Cambodia exported 288,562 tonnes of rice in the first six months this year, an increase of 7.6 percent compared with the same period last year. Though the country was drought-hit, it managed to export 542,144 tonnes of rice last year."

      "text": "On April 22, people in countries across the world took part in a global day of political and civic action for World Earth Day, an annual event dedicated to environmental protection, first celebrated in 1970. While much of the news around World Earth Day had a Western bias, with a focus on demonstrations and marches in the likes of London, Paris and New York, this day of environmental awareness-raising activities is of huge relevance to countries such as Bangladesh. In fact, it is arguably of more relevance to Bangladesh, and other parts of Asia, than the rest of the world as environmental challenges and the impact of climate change are more pressing issues here. With the messages of this day still fresh in our mind and as we brace for the aftereffects of cyclone Fani, which hit Bangladesh yesterday, perhaps it is an appropriate time to consider environmental and climate challenges for Bangladesh--particularly the interaction between industry and the environment--and also to consider why we all need to begin thinking much more carefully about how we use the earth's precious resources. The first thing to note in this context is that Bangladesh, like many other Asian countries, is particularly vulnerable to climate change. Extreme weather events have already caused chaos in the country and led to shifts in migration and poverty patterns. For instance, in 2017, 6.8 million people in north-western Bangladesh found their land and crops drowned under flood water. The totally submerged land constituted over 16,000 hectares, while another 560,000 hectares of crops were partially damaged. Meanwhile, in April the same year, floods damaged around 220,000 hectares of ready-to-be harvested crops, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Official estimates suggest that in 2017 alone, the floods severely affected the livelihoods of at least eight million people in Bangladesh. There is a human cost and a business cost here--and clearly, the two are intertwined. For three years in a row, the World Economic Forum's Global Risk Report has identified climate change as the gravest threat for global business and industry. The report notes that \"failure in climate change mitigation and adaptation--water crises--natural disasters\" will impact business and industry worldwide. Ready-made garment (RMG) production, which constitutes the largest industry in Bangladesh in terms of contribution to gross domestic product, is a resource-hungry and pollution-intensive sector. And it is an industry that will have to keep an increasingly close eye on its environmental impact moving forward. It is well-known that washing, dyeing, and finishing of textiles require large amounts of clean freshwater, and can range from under 100 to more than 300 cubic metres per tonne of textiles, according to World Bank data. Assuming an annual textile production of five million tonnes, it is estimated that an average factory in Bangladesh consumes 300 litres of water per day. Replicate this water usage across the many thousands of RMG factories in Bangladesh, and the scale of water use becomes clear. Consider, also, that most of this water is sourced from groundwater wells. The total water usage by the textile industry in Bangladesh is estimated to be 1,500 million cubic metres, which is principally made of groundwater. Around 70 percent of this water consumption is estimated to take place in wet processing of textiles, which involves the washing, dyeing, and finishing of textiles. Though the growth of green garments in Bangladesh in recent times has been commendable--82 garment factories in the country have been LEED-certified by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) and 320 more factories have registered for LEED certification, which is the highest in the world--the textile industry still faces the challenge of dealing with the problem of effluent discharge and the use of coagulants and chemicals for its treatment. This poses a huge problem for the industry, particularly for small- and medium-sized units which do not always have the cash to invest in the latest effluent treatment technology. The government and the industry need to respond accordingly. On the one hand, they need to make water conservation a priority, and on the other, they need to ensure that the industry is treating and disposing of this water in the correct manner. These twin challenges will be critical for the RMG industry, and the environment, moving forward. It is agreed within the industry that water conservation and rainwater harvesting can be better promoted across the industry, and many RMG operators are already going in this direction. They are investing in modern technology, which includes processing equipment that makes more efficient use of water and also better treatment technology, including high-tech wastewater treatment equipment. The industry is certainly going in the right direction, but more support is needed from the government and also the international buyers, which are heavily dependent on our industry. It is also worth considering that saving water and other input resources actually makes economic sense in the long run. It is well-documented that simple changes to production techniques aimed at improving efficiencies can yield financial returns in the form of reduced water, electricity and chemical use. The return on these investments can be quick--often just one or two years. Regardless, these are investments all businesses in our industry need to be addressing as a matter of urgency, for the sake of their long-term well-being, and for the sake of our country and the planet.

They said the rains and floods affected more than 25 lakh people in 22 states of India. The highest number of 382 people's deaths in Maharashtra followed by 227 in West Bengal in rains, floods and landslides that hit as many as 357 districts in the country. A total of 1,874 people died, our New Delhi correspondent reports quoting the officials. Though monsoon continues to be active in a few parts of India now, the season officially ended on September 30. During the four-month period, India recorded the highest rainfall since 1994, according to the India Meteorological Department. In Maharashtra, where 22 districts were hit by floods, 382 people died, 369 were injured and 7.19 lakh people were forced to seek shelter in 305 relief camps. The monsoon rains and floods hit 22 districts in West Bengal, where 227 people lost their lives, 37 received injuries, four were reported missing. In Bihar, currently reeling under floods, 161 people have lost their lives and a total of 182 people were killed, 38 were injured and seven have gone missing in Madhya Pradesh. In Kerala, heavy rains and floods claimed 181 lives and injured 72. Twenty-two districts in Gujarat were hit by monsoon resulting in the loss of life of at least 169 people and in Karnataka, 106 people perished in rains and floods in 13 districts. The rains and floods claimed 97 lives in Assam where 32 districts were hit by the deluge."

      "text": "With a population of about 152 million, Bangladesh has been identified as the highest ranking disaster prone countries and the fifth ranking in the risk index (2012) in the world. An estimate indicates that fourteen percent of the country's GDP is exposed to disasters per year. Although over the last four years the GDP growth (6.12 percent) and per capita income (USD 1312) have shown an upward mobility, high level of poverty (24.7 percent in 2015) remains a major concern. The underlying causes of persistent poverty in Bangladesh are of many folds, resulting from geo-physical settings within South Asia combines with social, economic and political factors. People living in the fragile geophysical location have to face frequent disasters. These people hardly have alternative options to come out of the vicious cycle of poverty and are forced to live in precarious conditions either in their original locations or moving elsewhere. Floods are the most frequent disasters in Bangladesh, causing immense suffering to a large number of people, damaging infrastructure and other resources. Roughly one-third of the country become severely affected by floods while the catastrophic floods of 1988, 1998, 2004, and 2007 caused inundation of more than 60 percent of the country's land. The four types of flooding in Bangladesh include flash floods caused by overflowing of hilly rivers of eastern and northern Bangladesh; rain floods caused by drainage congestion and heavy rain falls; river floods during monsoon season; and coastal floods caused by storm surges. Flood has been characterised as both natural and human induced disaster as it is related to many natural as well as humane structural and non-structural causes. Severe floods in Bangladesh have inundated areas, increased river erosion, breached embankments, and damaged standing crops and infrastructures. Cyclone in this land is as old as its history, which has been mentioned by the eminent historian Abul Fazal in his Ain-E-Akbari in the 16th century. For ages, cyclones have remained as the deadliest and most hazardous disaster for human populations, other species and resources. Cyclones increase vulnerabilities of affected communities as recurring events, lingering in post disaster phases and associated with complex recovery. The deadliest cyclones in Bangladesh occurred in 1991. Two more severe cyclones Sidr (2007) and Aila (2009) affected the coastal belt of the country. Slow onset disasters such as drought (already affected about 8.3 million hectare of land) and salinity intrusion (in 2007 intrusion spreading from 1.5 to 2.5 Mha) and climate change-related hazards, earthquakes, arsenic contamination in groundwater, fire incidence, infrastructure collapse and lately lightening have been putting people at multidimensional risks. Projected displacement would be 6-8 m by 2050. Bangladesh ranking, based on the number of people to be exposed to disaster risk, has been calculated as: first out of 162 countries due to flood; third out of 73 countries due to tsunami; and sixth out of 89 countries due to cyclones.  Data indicates that disasters pose serious impacts on human populations, societies and surrounding environments. It is a well recognised fact that climate change increases frequency and severity of disasters with adverse impacts on humans, other species and ecosystem. Human health is at risk from growing incidences of diseases due to disasters, rising temperatures and rainfall variability. Deforestation, over fishing, over grazing, salt build up, waterborne diseases from irrigation, endangered wild life from loss of habitat, loss of genetic diversity, water pollution, air pollution and disasters related to each other and having impacts on people and ecosystem. Although disaster affects an entire community, all segments of population do not suffer from the adverse impacts equally. There are multifaceted dimensions of vulnerability to disaster: children, elderly, people with disability, special occupational groups and women in poorer categories are among the most vulnerable. The causes of disasters are multidimensional and shaped by complex interactions among natural/ecological/environmental, social and cultural processes. Disaster risks of a country are also related to the process of global and regional mitigation measures combined with national mitigation, preparedness and management capacities. Effective response with mitigation and adaptation measures to disasters and dissemination of information can reduce the adverse impacts of disastrous events on human health and resources.    Disaster risk reduction efforts in Bangladesh\n In independent Bangladesh disaster management initiatives had commenced following the consequences of the devastating cyclone of 1970. Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman launched the \"Cyclone Preparedness Programme\" in 1973 and provided high preference on disaster management activities. However, attentions on disaster management issues had not been given priority by the successive governments, which is apparent from the country's inability to manage the two consecutive floods of 1987 and 1988 and the devastating cyclone of 1991. These disasters attracted international attentions while Bangladesh urged for international cooperation and expert support.  Since then challenges of managing disasters and to recuperate disaster loss Bangladesh has gradually stepped towards disaster response mechanism through shifting paradigm from reactive emergency response to proactive risk reduction. In 1997 a well-designed document was drafted: Standing Orders on Disasters (SoD) (revised in 2010), which explains specific roles of relevant stakeholders (local and national levels) during different phases of disasters. A Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP I and II) has been launched to facilitate disaster management approach. Academic institutes have been established at higher education levels to provide technical knowledge to disaster managers.  A good number of institutional structures to achieve technical monitoring, capacity building, preparedness and response in reducing disaster risks have been established by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR). The Disaster Management Act (2012), National Plan for Disaster Management and Disaster Management Policy have been prepared. With the contributions from academia and civil society the disaster management models adopted inclusive approach towards mainstreaming disaster risk reduction (DRR) including gender mainstreaming in DRR. The revised version of National Plan for Disaster Management has been developed in line with the international driver Sendai Framework of Disaster Reduction (SFDRR) for the next ten years. Other ministries have also endorsed some of the DRR inclusive documents in their plans and  policies: the Sixth Five Year Plan (2010-2015) and Seventh Five Year Plan (2016-2021), Ministry of Planning; Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP, 2009) and Gender Action Plan (GAP, 2013 based on four pillars of BCCSAP/Ministry of Environment and Forests/MoEF); National Women's Advancement Policy (2011, Ministry of Women and Children Affairs/MoWCA); National Child Policy (2011) and Children Act (2013, MoWCA); National Education Policy (2010, Ministry of Education); National Agriculture Policy; Post 2015 development Agenda (2012, Ministry of Planning) among others. Effective applications of the policies and initiatives are vital for disaster risk reduction and adaptation to changing environments. Bangladesh is also a pioneer in promoting gender and DRR agenda in disaster within South Asia and has received global recognition for gender mainstreaming efforts in Disaster Risk Reduction (the author received the prestigious Mary Fran Myers Award, 2016 of Gender and Disaster Network from the Colorado University (Boulder), USA). Since mid-nineties researchers have been pointing out that although gender, and recently social inclusion were recognised as a crosscutting issue, it was not integrated into disaster risk management policies, plans and decision-making processes, including risk assessment, early warning, information management and education and training. It must be mentioned here that Bangladesh has been proactively responding to the international policies on disaster risk reduction since the development of the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA, 2005-2015) to build a disaster resilient community. However, implementation process of HFA lack an inclusive focus, especially gender dimension has been overlooked. Following wide level national and international consultations in the post 2015 agenda gender and social inclusion issues have been incorporated in the Sendai Framework of Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR, 2015-2030). Implementation of listed activities with appropriate budgetary allocation proved to be crucial in making them more than just a \"paper-plan syndrome\". Another important agenda in the contemporary disaster risk reduction effort is involvement of the private sector in disaster risk reduction. In Bangladesh, the government is expected to play the major role when disaster strikes and must provide services almost without any direct commercial return. Private sectors have hardly been involved explicitly in disaster mitigation or risk reduction activities as part of their corporate activities. Traditionally the sectors' involvement in DRR was of welfare-oriented philanthropy or one-off charity. It was never thought of as an investment. Role of private sectors in context of common disasters such as flood, cyclones and others systematic knowledge has only been collected in rare occasions and therefore, data in this regard is not available. Out of four pillars of SFDRR, two (\"Investing in DRR\" and \"Build Back Better\") are directly indicating for investment and sufficient resources for disaster preparedness and recovery. It is relevant to mention that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been announced as one of the winners of the environmental accolade \"Champion of the Earth\" in Policy Leadership category of the United Nations (2015), in recognition of Bangladesh's initiatives to address climate change. One of the main reasons for achieving the award, as narrated by UNEP in a release is, \"Sheikh Hasina has proven that investing in climate change is conducive to achieving social and economic development.\" Disaster risk reduction efforts are also to be connected with such successful initiatives. Prior to the Sendai framework the government introduced several policies instruments to facilitate the private sector engagement to establish a well-encompassing disaster management framework. The National Disaster Management Plan provides strong emphasis on equitable and sustainable participation of all stakeholders including the private sector. As the capacity to deal with earthquake and human-made urban disasters is yet to reach a satisfactory level, the implementation of disaster management policies and plans in line with SFDRR, SDGs and Seventh Five Year Plan requires huge financial and technological resources and systematic efforts. The Government of Bangladesh has increased the budget allocation for the education sector over the last few years. However, dedicated budget for children affected by climate change or living in disaster prone areas has not been prioritised. Research reveals that children in disaster affected districts are facing educational disparity in terms of location. For example, a Char called Majher char is 4 km away from the district headquarters but is separated from the town by the Meghna River.  A recent study by the author indicates that local level disaster management capacities have been improved compared to last few decades for two reasons: knowledge imparted to the members of District, Upazila and Union level Disaster Management Committees and their long experiences in working within disaster affected communities. Currently the local level disaster mangers have access to systematic knowledge on disaster management and risk reduction issues such as preparedness, mitigation, taking part or observing rescue operation, conduct relief programs and others. However, although trainings they have received are effective and satisfactory, regular follow-up trainings and effective monitoring are still required. Lack or limited communication equipments to reach and communicate with people in remote devastated areas and villages remain a challenge. Moreover, strengthening existing resilient mechanisms of local people, preservation and dissemination of indigenous knowledge and practices need to be dealt with special emphasis. Bangladesh needs to be equipped to address the human induced disasters like the Rana Plaza disaster of April 24, 2013. The death of 1129 garment workers, mostly women, generated a lot of questions to rethink managing and preventing such industrial and urban disasters. Attempts should be taken to grasp the harsh realities and thereby lend policies in context of both natural and human induced disasters. DRR efforts of Bangladesh will be most effective if they are supported by stronger policy and budgetary allocations, implementation guidance and coordinated efforts of national, regional and global perspectives for both natural and human induced disasters. The SDGs have also given specific focus on disasters and reducing the risks. Disaster risk reduction efforts would become successful when effective communication is established among multidimensional actors including inter-governmental agencies, researchers, academics, development partners, national and local level disaster managers, humanitarian agencies, private sectors and communities who are at risk. Attention must be given to the multifaceted and multilayered governance, global accountability, and South Asian regional risk reduction issues, often shaped by political crises, to reduce the challenges of disaster risk reduction efforts.

Many char areas have been flooded in the last 24 hours, bringing untold sufferings to residents of those areas. The Teesta was flowing only one centimetre below the danger level of 52.4cm at Teesta Barrage point of Doyani in Hatibandha upazila as of yesterday afternoon. Mostafizur Rahman, executive engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) at Dalia, said all 44 gates of Teesta Barrage have been kept open since Wednesday night due to pressure of upstream water. \"The Indian Gajoldoba Barrage authorities have informed me that they kept open all the gates of the barrage due to pressure of water flowing from upstream Sikkim,\" he added. He said they have been monitoring the water level of the river. \"We will alert the char and shoal people if the river crosses the danger level,\" he said, warning that the water level might cross the danger level anytime. Mobarak Hossain, 35, of Char Gaddimari village in Hatibandha said their shoal was flooded yesterday morning and they were using bamboo-made rafts to maintain connection with the mainland. Mofazzal Hossain, chairman of Rajpur Union Parishad in Lalmonirhat Sadar, said char and shoal people always live in flood situations during the rainy season as the river overflows following normal downpour upstream. The riverbed has lost its depth because of silt and mud settling there for years, said WDB Executive Engineer of Lalmonirhat Abu Bakkar. He added it is necessary to dredge the river so that it can capture additional water during rains. A large area in Jalpaiguri district in West Bengal and northern Bangladesh has been flooded as excessive water has been released through the two barrages in Sikkim and West Bengal states, reports our Kolkata correspondent Subrata Acharya. The release of water has created danger of large-scale flood in Bangladesh's northern districts. Insiders said excessive water has been released from the Gajoldoba barrage in West Bengal due to flash flood caused by untimely rainfall. The government sources say 1,200 cusec of water has been released, but locals claim the amount would be several times higher. It has been apprehended that low-lying areas fed by the Teesta in Bangladesh will be affected by the flash flood. Contacted over cellphone, West Bengal Irrigation Minister Rajib Banerjee yesterday told this correspondent that the Barrage sources informed him that 1,200 cusec water was released on Tuesday. Asked if they had considered that the water released from the barrage might affect Bangladesh, the minister said, \"The water has been released by Sikkim. As Sikkim is on the upstream when water is released, it will flow downwards. However, Sikkim should have given us a note before releasing the water.\" However, Rajib Banerjee expressed sorrow over the creation of flood situations in Bangladesh. He said, \"We don't want any neighbouring country to be affected due to us.\" West Bengal state government has meanwhile issued a \"Yellow Alert\" from Domohani at Teesta to bordering Mekhliganj since Tuesday morning. The western districts in West Bengal have been experiencing heavy rainfall for the last one week due to a depression. The rainfall caused pressure of excessive water on Gajoldoba barrage due to flash flood. Local people have complained that the authorities concerned released water at Gajoldoba without any prior announcement."

      "text": "Imports of the staple stood at 22.59 lakh tonnes in July-December of fiscal 2017-18, the highest since 1998-99 when a record 30.67 lakh tonnes of rice were bought from external sources in the full fiscal year, according to food ministry data. The government imported 5.08 lakh tonnes of rice in July-December. Analysts said imports soared in the face of speculation of a decline in yield of current aman and low stocks of previous boro rice at private mills. A slash in import duty to 2 percent from 10 percent in August gave a boost to imports. Analysts said higher imports will increase supply, thus helping to stabilise the market and benefit consumers. But the government should be watchful so that higher imports do not hurt farmers by creating a glut in the market, they added. \"Imports will continue as prices are higher in Bangladesh compared to India,\" said Citta Majumder, managing director of Majumder Group of Industries. Food ministry data showed letters of credits to import 32 lakh tonnes of rice were opened until December 23 last year. The buoyancy in imports continues at a time when farmers have harvested most of the aman crop, which accounts for 38 percent of the country's annual rice production. The soaring imports and the harvest of aman crop have increased the availability of rice. However, prices of the staple still remain high. In Dhaka, retail prices of the coarse and medium quality rice, consumed by the majority of the population, were Tk 44 to Tk 56 a kg yesterday, according to data from the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB). Yesterday's prices of coarse and medium quality grain were 6 percent and 4 percent higher from a month ago, show TCB data. Majumder said there is high speculation that aman output declined in 2017 from a year ago. The government decision to buy rice at Tk 39 per kg and millers' rush to buy aman paddy contributed to the higher prices, he said.     Majumder said the number of buyers is high this year. Many millers don't have any stock of previous boro paddy and entered the market to buy aman paddy to keep their mills running. A US Department of Agriculture report in November forecasted a drop in aman production to 1.3 crore tonnes in the fiscal year. The agency also said overall output will decline.   In December, the Food and Agriculture Organization said total paddy production would fall in 2017 by 3 percent to 5.08 crore tonnes, a five-year low. It estimated paddy output at 5.21 crore tonnes in 2016. \"In Bangladesh, three episodes of severe floods during 2017 affected large areas of the country, particularly northern districts, causing losses to the two main boro and aman crops, which together account for more than 90 percent of total annual output,\" said the FAO. Rezaul Karim Talukder, poverty and social protection policy adviser of the FAO Bangladesh, said the floods and a disease infestation in aman crop might have caused a loss of 15-20 lakh tonnes of rice. He said imports are rising as there is demand from the private and public sectors. Talukder expected the prices of rice to become stable for increased imports and the harvest of aman. Quazi Shahabuddin, a former director general of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies, said the private sector is importing because of the price gaps between domestic and international markets. He stressed ensuring a bumper boro harvest in the coming season to bring down prices of rice."

A few weeks ago, a Dhaka-bound launch from Barguna named 'MV Shahrukh-2' ran aground in a shoal of the Meghna river near Kaliganj area in Barishal's Mehendiganj upazila. A passenger of the launch Mirza Khalid recalled how they were rescued by another vessel after being marooned for almost nine hours. \"Now the 8-hour journey from Barguna to Dhaka almost became 24 hours long,\" he said.  Rahim Mia, driver of a passenger launch that plies the Dhaka-Barishal route on the Meghna river, said his launch got stuck a number of times in the last two months in a shoal near Bhasanchar under Mehendiganj. Crew member of another vessel that plies the Barishal-Bhola route said, water level at Laharhaat and Shaheberhaat point under Barishal Sadar upazila has become very low, causing river transports to run aground sand bars beneath the surface of Arial Kha river. Officials of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) admitted that shortage of water flow has created navigability crisis in at least 30 points of different river routes in the Barishal region. Mizanur Rahman Bhuiyan, superintending engineer of dredging department of BIWTA, said, according to the data collected in recent years, the main rivers carried an average of 1.2 billion tonnes of mud and sand from upstream and 40 percent of the sediments were deposited at different points of the rivers in Barishal region. This year flash floods in the northern districts caused the rivers to carry more mud and sand downstream and deposit those at the southern parts of the country, he added. Rezaur Rashid Khandaker, assistant director of the dredging department of BIWTA, told The Daily Star that for the last two weeks 10 dredging machines have been working at 10 points of six rivers--Meghna, Kalabodor, Tentulia, Khakdon, Karkhana and Kirtonkhola. BIWTA dredging officials informed that, like other years, about 30-lakh cubic metres of mud and sand would be dredged from the thirty points of Barishal regional rivers. Of those, one lakh cubic metres would be collected from Barishal river port area.  Ajmal Huda Mithu, deputy director (DD) of BIWTA's marine safety and river traffic department, said, river vessels need at least 12-feet deep waterway, but hardly 10-feet depth can be found during low tide in Barishal port. He said, Dhaka-Barishal passenger launch MV Manami got stuck at the district's river port area in the last week of October due to poor navigability. \"Therefore, we are trying to ensure 14-feet depth in the surrounding areas of the river port,\" he asserted. He noted that they also have to relocate some launch terminals because of poor navigability. Patarhaat Launch Terminal under Mehendiganj would be relocated one kilometre away to Mas Kazir Char, said the deputy director. He admitted that in absence of alternative dumping ground, dredged mud and sand are often dumped in other parts of the rivers, considering its depth and strength of currents. However, this can sometimes create navigation problem in those points, he added."

Between 2008 and 2017, some 37 million people in Bangladesh were affected by natural disasters, the report says. IFRC and Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS) launched the global report, titled \"World Disasters Report-2018: Leaving No One Behind\", at a programme in Dhaka yesterday. BDRCS Chairman Hafiz Ahmed Mazumdar along with other dignitaries formally unveiled it. However, it did not specify the type and number of natural disasters the country encountered in the last decade. The report analysed calamities  like storms, extreme temperatures, floods, landslides, droughts, wildfires and earthquakes in the chapter \"Disaster Trends and IFRC Insights\". Globally, 3,751 natural disasters occurred in the last 10 years, affecting an estimated 2 billion people and damaging property worth $1,658 billion, according to the report which used \"Emergency Events Database\" of Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels. The largest proportion (40.6 percent) of the total disasters took place in Asia, which also has by far the largest share of affected people (79.8 percent) and the largest share of estimated damages (45.4 percent), it adds. While the data shows fewer disasters and people affected over the last decade than the previous one (9 percent less incidents and 29 percent less people affected), estimated damages more than doubled in the region -- from $326.6 billion to 752.2 billion. The report says China, USA, Philippines, India and Indonesia were the five countries most frequently hit by natural disasters in last ten years. China and India alone accounted for 62.4 percent (1.2 billion) of the 2 billion affected people since 2008. Seven of the worst-affected countries, in terms of number of people affected, are in Asia. The report identified five reasons for which affected people may not receive required assistance. \"The humanitarian sector cannot help people if it fails to see them,\" says the report. \"Some communities are hard to reach for geographical or political reasons, because of conflict and insecurity, or bureaucratic and legal bottlenecks created by affected states and donors alike. These can all pose serious challenges to humanitarian access,\" it mentions. The IFRC's 2019 operational plan for Bangladesh sets a budget of $5.5 million to reach 3.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, through Bangladesh Red Crescent Society, said the organisers. Azmat Ulla, head of IFRC Bangladesh Country Office, said if the vulnerable and under-supported groups discussed in the report are to be identified, reached, understood and supported, the international humanitarian sector must invest in local and national actors like BDRCS."

      "text": "Bangladesh experienced over 200 natural disasters since 1980, leaving a total death toll of approximately 200,000 people and causing economic loss worth nearly $17 billion. Every year, we incurred 1.8 percent of GDP loss due to natural disaster. It is estimated that 14 percent of our GDP is exposed to disasters. After the devastating cyclone of 1991, the concept of response (acting after the occurrence) has been changed by the new concept of total disaster management (which includes response, recovery, rehabilitation and prevention, mitigation and preparedness). This is the genesis of observing National Disaster Preparedness Day. After the 1998 floods, the momentum increased significantly towards risk reduction. Such change or shifts are well ahead of many global initiatives.  In order to make disaster management system operative in an effective and efficient manner we have taken a lot of initiatives and we achieved significant success. The progress achieved can be of two categories mainly - the institutional framework and the legal and policy framework. Among the public sector institutions, the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, established in 1972, is the apex body, which currently focuses on the complete disaster management concept, and has taken shape as a separate ministry. The new concept is reflected in the allocation of business prioritising risk reduction as the centre of all activities.  The government has restructured and established the Disaster Management Department as the main organ or instrument in the field for implementing and coordinating various forms of disaster management activities. Merging two organisations - the Disaster Management Bureau (established after the 1991 cyclone) and the Directorate of Relief and Rehabilitation established earlier. For the dissemination of early warning signals of cyclones to the communities in the coastal zone, the Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP), a globally renowned volunteer organization of Bangladesh, which combines volunteerism and communication technology, was established in 1972, after the devastating Bhola cyclone. The organisation has been restructured and rejuvenated through training, technology upgrades (e.g. wireless network) and extension of the areas per the changing cyclone route.  Besides these reformed organisations, there are frontier organisations like the Bangladesh Metrological Department, Flood Forecasting and Warning Center, Water Development Board, Fire Service and Civil Defense. In the last couple of years, these organisations have also been strengthened significantly.  Research organizations like IWM WARPO, CEGIS, BUET, BCAS and others have also proven their increased capability.  The most demanded legal instrument was enacted in 2012 viz. the Disaster Management (DM) Act - incorporating existing orders, reforming institutions, envisaging new institutions, putting necessary mechanisms in place and making the disaster management system accountable with mandatory legal provisions. Before this Act, we worked under the Standing Order on Disaster (SOD) issued in 1997. It has two important features - provision of duties and responsibilities for the ministries and departments and secondly, the establishment of committees at all levels, considering the inter-relatedness of disaster management activities. This SOD is regarded as the \"Bible of Disaster Management\". Now these orders are part of the DM Act.  Currently we have other instruments like the Disaster Management Policy, approved by the cabinet, the Disaster Management Plan, guidelines also prepared for addressing specific disasters and purposes.  Understanding disaster and development related challenges, the General Economic Division incorporated a disaster and climate change action in the five year plan document (which started from the Sixth Five Year Plan). It's a tremendous achievement and is expected to guide the whole development process and quantify the results achieved with specific indicators. The Environment Ministry also prepared the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan and National plan of Action.  Mortality reduction is the single most important result we achieved, as it reduced from 300,000 in 1970 to 3,000 in 2007. Food production increased three times in 1970. Poverty reduced from 40 percent in 2005 to 24.7 percent in 2014. Economic growth is averaging at 6 percent and is expected to increase. Five out of the eight goals were achieved under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Literacy rate, sanitation coverage and women's participation are also mentionable achievements. Against the backdrop of reforms done and the success achieved, we can claim justifiably that we are not afraid. But we must be aware about the present and future challenges. The changing patterns of disaster pose major challenges. We are better in managing rapid onset disasters like floods and cyclones. We have to agree that the intensity and frequency of natural disasters will increase with further climate change. On the other hand, we have no better understanding in managing slow- onset disasters, which include salinity, agricultural droughts and earthquakes. These disasters in the future may create insurmountable pressure on lives and livelihoods.    Unplanned urbanisation has been emerging as a major threat for us. Due to this process, many new disasters have already manifested. Urban congestion, fires, building collapses, pollution, urban flooding, etc. will be more frequent in the future.  Bangladesh, being a low deltaic country, is extremely vulnerable.  Climate change has its impacts on every sector of the country's development. This will create complex and compound disasters. It is required to understand the change and its trend, and the dynamic and sustainable adaptation strategies. Longer term investments and strategies need to be developed.  Mainstreaming disaster and climate change issues in different sectors and in the development process are challenging tasks. Disaster and climate change is not an external issue - rather, it must be internalised by all sectors; otherwise, we shall not be able to overcome the odds successfully through just one ministry or department.  Human induced and technological disasters are getting more dominance in the landscape of disaster management. The role and engagement of the private sector is unquestionable. In our country, the matter to be considered is beyond the 'charity' mindset. Reduction of harmful consumption, production, distribution and deviant activities, attitudes and habits must be reduced. On the other hand, innovative ways need to be utilized to improve the disaster and climate change situation by producing and promoting new products and services. The other issue is short term versus long term investments, benefits, preparedness, planning and strategy. People here tend to prioritise short term benefits, but practitioners and academicians are always in favour of long term planning. In the area of disaster management, Bangladesh is well ahead of many countries. This is why the country is considered a role model in managing natural disasters. The strength and attributes we have among others include community resilience, volunteerism, the Early Warning System, community based decision making process, government commitment, a vibrant NGO sector and an appreciable legal and institutional framework. These need to be strengthened further. Implementation of various provisions of legal and policy directives needs to be evaluated and further commitment is needed in this regard. Many provisions of the DM Act, especially the Disaster Management Fund, Volunteer Platform, Research and Training Institute, are to be put in place as priority activities. Educational and research organisations should be supported continuously. This year is the beginning of three international interrelated processes - the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, and the COP21 Paris Agreement for climate change action. Bangladesh, as an active participating country, will once again prove to be the champion of disaster risk reduction through better preparedness at all levels and across all sectors, battling every type of disaster. The writer is National Project Director, Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP II). "

      "text": "Recently Department of Disaster Management in collaboration with Shifting the Power and Dhaka Earthquake and Emergency Preparedness Programme (DEEP) of Christian Aid Bangladesh organized a roundtable titled \"Let the world know, Bangladesh is prepared for facing disasters\". Here we publish a summary of the discussion.   \n Md. Reaz Ahmed, Director General, Department of Disaster Management\n In today's roundtable we will discuss what we have done so far, what we are doing now and what our future are regarding the management of disasters in the country. As part of earthquake preparedness, we are working on debris management in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet. We have already developed an earthquake contingency plan for these areas. We have bought about 100,000 tents to provide shelter to earthquake-affected people. The government has bought advanced rescue machineries worth Tk 250 crore. As part of medical preparedness, we have trained 6,000 doctors and paramedics. To increase capacity of hospitals we have developed an in-built guideline and database of doctors and blood donors. Under the Dhaka Urban Resilience Project, we are preparing a database on the bearing capacity of soil in Dhaka and its adjacent areas such as Narayanganj, Savar and Gazipur. This database will help identify what type of piling will be needed to construct a building in these areas. However, we need to do a lot more to take our disaster preparedness to a higher level. As the nature of disasters is changing, we need to find innovative solutions to effectively tackle catastrophes. It is not always possible to predict a disaster but if we take adequate preparation we can certainly minimize loss and damage caused by a disaster. We also need to pay attention to those disasters which may not have taken a large number of human lives but seriously affect people's everyday lives, e.g. unusual increase or decrease in temperature.  I would like to request all the distinguished participants of today's roundtable to share their valuable insights about how we can move forward in our disaster management efforts. Shakeb Nabi, Country Director, Christian Aid\n The slogan \"Let the world know, Bangladesh is prepared for facing disasters\" is very optimistic. It talks about Bangladesh as a global example and the world should learn about disaster preparedness from Bangladesh. We all know that Bangladesh is a country which tackles huge disasters successfully every year. We need to talk about how Bangladesh has been responding to various disasters. Bangladesh has a strong culture of safety. There are some basic safety measures that you do not need to teach people; it comes naturally to them. In today's roundtable, we will discuss why Bangladesh is a good example, and also some of the examples taken from Bangladesh which we would like to share with the global community and how we can do that. Gawher Nayeem Wahra, Adjunct Faculty of IDMVS, University of Dhaka and Founder Member Secretary, Disaster Forum\n Bangladesh has attained laudable success in disaster management. On the one hand, we are unfortunate that our climatic conditions are such that natural disasters are unavoidable. But on the other hand, we are fortunate enough to make predictions and therefore take preventive measures when it comes to tackling disasters. It is not always possible to predict all disasters, such as earthquakes, but we can certainly prepare ourselves to tackle and reduce damage caused by such disasters. I would like to focus on cyclone shelters. We have successfully transformed these shelters into multipurpose buildings. Now if we could bring these shelters under housing facilities it would benefit a lot of people. Another laudable initiative by the government was to involve local people in building dams and creating shelter facilities there for the disaster-affected people. One of these projects is located in Char Fashion area of Bhola. Local people themselves are taking care of these dams. These facilities have been providing shelter to common people for the last 13-14 years. Last year we saw that floods caused havoc due to the failure of dams. The major reason behind such failures is poor maintenance of these dams. If we can replicate the model of Char Fashion we can easily prevent such disasters. There is another gap in the maintenance of sluice gates. In both the cases of Sidr and Aila, the water couldn't be released on time and it caused havoc for crops and property. It all happened due to poor management of sluice gates. Finally, we need to invest more in creating awareness among general people about disaster preparedness. We should effectively utilize local knowledge about disaster management and disseminate it to a wider audience.   Mahbuba Nasreen, Director and Professor, Institute of Disaster Management and Vulnerability Studies, University of Dhaka\n The paradigm of disaster management has shifted and our knowledge about it has also changed over time. Now we know that we can't control disasters; we have to manage it and reduce risks of disasters. Earlier we only focused on natural disasters. But now we are actively considering manmade disasters. Previously, the government, particularly the Department for Disaster Management, used to work separately. Now we are seeing active collaboration between government and non-government actors in disaster management efforts. Today's roundtable is a good example in this regard. Another major development is the recognition of the role of women in disaster management. Earlier they were seen only as victims. This change has also been reflected in our policy documents. There is still a lot to improve. I want to highlight that all the documents related to disaster management such as Standing Orders on Disaster and Sendai Frameworks need to be simplified and disseminated widely so that ordinary people can learn about tackling a disaster. Sanjib Biswas Sanjay, Programme Manager, Christian Aid Bangladesh\n There are four pillars of good governance: political will, people's will, strong institution, and punishment or award mechanism. In the case of Bangladesh's disaster management sector, the honourable prime minister herself is playing a leadership role which reflects strong political will. With this support the whole disaster management effort is evolving with greater efficiency and inclusiveness. We have successfully introduced digital technologies in the disaster management system. We have been able to build a strong collaboration between government and non-government actors which also reflects a strong institution for disaster management. We are a disaster-resilient nation as we have survived many disasters since the birth of the country. However, there is no scope for us to be complacent with our achievements. We need to be ever more vigilant and constantly develop our disaster management capacity to cope with the changing nature of disasters. Ashfaqur Rahman, Senior Project Officer, SEEDS Asia\n I would like to emphasise on community engagement in disaster management. After the Kobe earthquake in 1995, an assessment was conducted by the Japanese government on how the affected people were rescued. It was found that 98 percent people were rescued by their friends, neighbours and relatives while only 2 percent people were rescued by professional earthquake rescue team. A community-based model of disaster management was developed from this finding.. We are trying to create a platform for these community organizations so that they can share their experiences and problems among themselves and take joint initiatives to solve local problems. Rahima Sultana Kazal, Executive Director, AVAS\n Local women play a key role in disaster management and their contribution is recognised by the society. We have been able to build a disaster-resilient community in the area with national and international support. To take this achievement forward we need to invest more in local efforts as local organisations are the first responders in any disaster situation. We also need to invest more in creating awareness among general people about disaster preparedness. Our signalling system and emergency communication system need to be simplified so that ordinary people can easily understand them and take precautionary measures. Finally, when we assess a disaster we generally focus on mortality rate. We should equally emphasise on loss of property and livelihoods of the affected people because in Aila and other disasters we found that the death rate is very low compared to the damage rate. MA Halim, Director, Bangladesh Red Crescent Society\n I would like to suggest inclusion of disaster preparedness drills and education in the curriculum of primary education. There should be more departments and research centres on disaster management at the university level.    Also Forecast-based Financing can be promoted as advance financial assistance to families who might be badly affected during a disaster. It helps them to recover from the immediate shock of a disaster. This model is working effectively in our project areas. Finally, we have not been able to engage the private sector in disaster management. They can be key providers of resources for carrying out disaster management efforts. Manik Kumar Saha, Project Manager, Plan International Bangladesh\n The curriculum of class five to 12 includes necessary information on disaster management which I believe is a global example. Last year CEGIS did a forecast of river erosion which was 90-95 percent accurate. If we can include such digital technologies in the disaster management system, then that would be another global example. The rural sector is a champion when it comes to disaster management. What worries me is this: How resilient will Dhaka be if a disaster strikes? There is a lot to do regarding disaster risk reduction in urban areas. We are training urban volunteers, but we must develop effective mechanisms to retain these human resources. In our urban risk assessment and community risk assessment frameworks children and persons with disabilities should be given more attention. The government is currently preparing master plans for developing municipalities and secondary towns. Disaster risk reduction should be an integral part of these plans.      Ranjon Francis Rozario, Assistant Executive Director, Caritas Bangladesh\n We have achieved some expertise in tacking disasters in rural areas. Now we should improve our capacity of disaster management in urban areas. We have no prior experience of combating an earthquake and we are also not adequately prepared to face such a calamity. Therefore, we should focus on earthquake preparedness.   Shafiul Alam, Programmer Co-ordinator, Start Fund Bangladesh\n Bangladesh has improved a lot in coordinating disaster management efforts. The government is leading from the front in this regard. Whenever a disaster occurs they are the first to respond. This is an example worth sharing. Another important thing is to increase investment in earthquake preparedness.   Anjum Nahed Chowdhury, Director, Gono Unnayan Kendro\n The people in rural areas are ever more prepared to combat disasters. Even if we can't provide relief immediately after a disaster, a family can survive on its own at least for a week. Our field experience shows that women are leading disaster management efforts at the family level. They are the first responder in a crisis. If we can increase their capacity and engage them in the planning process we can significantly improve our disaster preparedness. Although our capacity to combat flood and cyclone has improved a lot, we are still lagging behind in tackling river erosion which has a crippling effect on property and livelihoods of the affected people. MB Akhter, Programme Director, Oxfam Bangladesh\n We have developed a flood hazard model. Based on this model we are providing flood insurance products in Sirajganj district. This insurance facility aims to provide cash relief in the event of a catastrophic flood. We have provided this support to 1,700 families for two years. This has proved to be an effective intervention. It can be replicated on a wider scale. There should be a national database of volunteers so that we can keep track of them and quickly mobilize them in a disaster situation. Suman Ahsanul Islam, Country Director, Humanitarian Leadership Academy SME sector contributes 25 percent of our total GDP. During any disaster these enterprises suffer serious damage. Unfortunately, there is very little support for them in our disaster management system. In the SOD the business continuity plan has been mentioned briefly. It has also not received proper attention in the policy draft of disaster management. We should look into this issue seriously and develop a strong business continuity plan for SMEs so that they can successfully tackle a disaster.     Dr Antony Gnanamuthu, Delegate/Coordinator, Disaster Risk Reduction, German Red Cross Bangladesh Delegation\n Bangladesh is well placed in disaster preparedness in terms of early warning system, early communication, last-mile connectivity, fast response system and multipurpose cyclone shelters. Bangladesh can share these examples globally. There are also some good practices that can be replicated in Bangladesh such as crop insurance system in Sri Lanka, forecast-based financing in Philippines and Vietnam, and community and school drill in Japan.   Kazi Shahidur Rahman, Humanitarian Affairs Specialist, UNRCO\n Through the SOD we have successfully connected the community with the local government. Nowhere in the world have I seen such strong institutional engagement of community in disaster management. Now, the main challenge before us lies in making our urban areas disaster-resilient and engaging the urban community in this effort. Community-based use of ICT can be of great help in this regard.     Abdul Latif Khan, Disaster Expert and Practitioner\n Disaster management should be an integral part of our development policy. Disaster management ministry has conducted various research studies whose findings need to be applied in preparing our development policies.       Dr Mohammad Atiqur Rahman, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief\n Both the government and non-government organisations have been carrying out various types of disaster management activities. We need to document the experience and output of these interventions.     Md Faizur Rahman, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief\n As part of disaster preparedness, we are making huge investments in building disaster-resilient infrastructure such as cyclone and flood shelters, Mujib killa, herring roads and so on. We have a plan to build 13,000 bridges by 2021. So far we have built 10,000 bridges. We have a goal that by 2021 there will be no bamboo-made bridge. These infrastructures will strengthen our resilience system.    Khaled Mahmud, Director, Department of Disaster Management\n We have introduced a toll-free number \"1090\" where you can get immediate weather alerts and warning messages about natural disasters on your phone. We need to popularise this number so that people can plan their daily activities by being informed about the weather situation and always stay alert about natural disasters.  We are putting special emphasis on community engagement in disaster management. For example, in Sariakandi of Bogra we are building flood-resilient houses. There we are providing funds and the local community is building houses. It has proved to be an effective intervention. Abu Syed Mohammad Hashim, Director, Department of Disaster Management\n We only talk about landslides in Chittagong Hill Tracts. But it also happens regularly in Sylhet as it is also a hilly area. We tend to think that flash floods happen in plain lands. But there are four valleys in Chittagong Hill Tracts--Chengi, Matamuhuri, Kasalong and Maini--where every year flash floods occur and cause havoc to property and livelihoods of local people. When we talk about flash floods and landslides, we must also include these areas. During the Kobe earthquake, the media, particularly NSD TV, played a key role in tackling the disaster. I think our media can learn a lot from that experience and come forward to highlight the issues of disaster preparedness and management.   Satya Brata Saha, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief\n The government is investing a lot in building disaster resilience in urban areas. To engage local government bodies in the management of disasters in urban areas, we are holding workshops and discussions with city corporations regularly. In all these interventions we have put special emphasis on earthquake preparedness.   Md Shah Kamal, Secretary, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief\n Bangladesh has improved a lot in terms of adaptation to floods. Bangladeshi people are no more afraid of floods. Because they know how to tackle it.  We are also successfully utilizing our indigenous knowledge to combat cyclones. The resources for disaster management must be decentralized and we working for this. Now every district has 200 tons of rice and Tk 2 lakh as  reserve to tackle an emergency situation. In AMCDRR 2016 in New Delhi where there were 5,000 participants from all around the world,. Narendra Modi in his speech of inauguration mentioned the name of Bangladesh five times as the best example to learn from in terms of tackling natural disasters. In the SOD there was no mention of earthquake. We have already revised this document. In the revised version earthquake has been considered as a major hazard. We still do not consider chemical hazard as a major hazard. Also, we do not have the capacity to tackle any chemical hazard. But we must address this very seriously. We have already started working on this issue. As part of the earthquake contingency plan we have divided the whole Dhaka city into nine zones. Eight areas have been delegated to the Armed Forces Division and one area is under Border Guard Bangladesh. Fire Service and Civil Defense has been made the second force and volunteers are the third force. We have also linked community volunteers in this effort. In the event of a disaster in urban areas, urban volunteers will be affected. Community volunteers will then help. We are providing training on earthquake preparedness to 56,000 community volunteers. Again, if a cyclone strikes, urban volunteers will lend their support to rural areas. We are providing training on cyclone management to 32,000 urban volunteers. We have also formed partnerships with India, Singapore, Malaysia and the US so that they can help us in rescue operations if our  internal resources fall short to tackle a disaster. We are also holding drills and simulation trainings regularly to strengthen our earthquake preparedness. We have also sent our manpower and resources to earthquake-affected countries to get firsthand experience. Rather than doing relief work we want to focus on disaster risk reduction. This is an important shift in our thought process on disaster management. To engage local government institutions in disaster management we are providing training on disaster preparedness to local government representatives. This is an ongoing process and last year, we covered five districts. We have already brought 10 medical colleges under retrofitting and made arrangements to set up mobile hospitals during emergency situations. Having been inspired by Saima Wazed, we are now providing psychosocial mental health training to 72 persons with the assistance of JAICA. They have already worked in the Rohingya camps. I believe Bangladesh will attain great achievements in providing psychosocial mental health support to disaster-affected people. We are going to organise an international conference on disability in disaster management. To improve our disaster communication system, we are going to invest Tk 400 crore. The government has also approved a national resilience project under which Tk 400 crore would be earmarked for the disaster management department. Finally, disaster management is a holistic process. We need full support from all the stakeholders. If we work together, we can tackle any disaster.  Dhaka Earthquake and Emergency Preparedness (DEEP) is a European Commission Directorate-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Civil Protection -ECHO funded consortium initiative by Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS), German Red Cross, Christian Aid Bangladesh, Action Against Hunger (ACF), International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC), American Red Cross. As part of the Humanitarian Implementation Plan (HIP) 2017, this project is aiming to enhance earthquake and emergency preparedness and reinforce de-centralized response capacities of 15 Urban Wards of Dhaka's South City Corporation where 1.6 million vulnerable people are  living with the risk of urban disaster.  Shifting the Power is a START Network project supported by the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (DFID) through the visionary Disasters Emergency Preparedness Programme (DEPP) implemented in 5 countries, Christian Aid led the project aims to support local actors to take their place alongside international actors to create a balanced humanitarian system based on \"localization\" approach in Bangladesh. Christian Aid along with 5 International organizations supports 11 local organizations to strengthen their organizational capacity for effective, efficient, timely humanitarian response."

Floods washed away around 88 tonnes of fish worth Tk 1.85 crore from the ponds in three upazilas of Rangpur, reports our Dinajpur correspondent. Besides, structures worth Tk 23.11 lakh surrounding the ponds were washed away by the floodwater, said fisheries officials of the district.  The affected upazilas are Gangachhara, Kaunia and Pirgachha. Gangachara was the worst affected area. In Gangachhara, fish worth Tk 1.36 crore of 495 ponds were washed away by floods. Besides, floodwater washed away structures worth Tk 22.55 lakh surrounding the ponds. In Kaunia, 4.27 tonnes of fish of 50 ponds were flooded. The market price of the fish was around Tk 7.15 lakh. In Pirgachha, 6.66 tonnes of fish of 37 ponds in the upazila were washed away by floodwater. The market price of the fish was Tk 7.62 lakh. Structures of Tk 1.31 lakh were damaged. Shamiul Islam, a fish farmer of Mohna village in Gangachhara upazila, said floodwater washed away a variety of fish like pabda and rui worth Tk 15 lakhfrom his pond on 50 decimals of land. Latifur Rahman, deputy director of Rangpur Fisheries Department, said fish production may decline this year as a large number of ponds have been washed away by floodwaters. According to our Lalmonirhat correspondent, 235 out of 250 homesteads in Sindurna char in the Teesta river bed of Hatibandha upazila. The rest houses were not inundated. Those were built 4-5 feet height above water level so that flood victims in the area can use the homesteads as safe shelters. Two months ago, these 15 houses were built under Integrated Communication Development Project (ICDP)-II of Eco-Social Development Organisation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), funded by PLAN International Bangladesh. Different trees were planted surrounding the homesteads. Like Sindurna char, there are 1500 families in 12 chars in the river bed of the district, said NGO officials. A large number of houses in the areas went under floodwater every year. Floodwaters started to recede in many areas from Sunday, said locals.  Farmer Shamsul Islam of the char area said their houses went under floodwaters for 10 days since July 9, but they did not go to the flood centre like previous years this time as they took shelter at the homesteads. Rangpur Divisional Manager of PLAN International Bangladesh Asis Kumar Baksi said they could build only 15 houses for ultra-poor people due to insufficient funds. They will inform the government high officials about the matter, he said. Meanwhile, over 100 houses and a two-storied government primary school building got flooded as gushing water entered through the breach of flood control dyke at Ketkirhat in Gaibandha's Fulchhari upazila on Saturday, reports our correspondent. Locals said as floodwater entered through the breach, a large porting of the dyke collapsed, inundating the houses and Ketkirhat Government Primary School. Nazimuddin, a farmer of the area, said around 400 students of the institution are facing uncertainty over their education as the school went under floodwater."

      "text": "   Dhaka city experiences a deluge every time it rains heavily Every time major floods occur in the country and every time it rains, the city of Dhaka faces acute drainage problem. Parts of the city go under water. In the densely populated city, woes of people know no bounds.\nIn 1954, 1956, 1988, 1998 devastating floods occurred submerging 70 percent or more of the country. Along with the country most of the Dhaka city except pockets of high spots went under various depths of water. There was flood water in old city, eastern and western parts.\nHowever in earlier years, as the eastern and western parts of the city were mostly agricultural lowlands with a few or no human habitation, flood damage remained confined to the city proper only. There was no huge and cry and suffering of people as it is today in the eastern part.\nIn spite of huge investment over the years, particularly after 1988 floods when almost whole city of Dhaka went under water, the 1998 floods appeared most devastating. About Dhaka city, drainage situation aggravated due to silted-up, blocked drainage channels. WASA's limited storm water drainage is too inadequate for a city of 850 sqkm (Greater Dhaka).Causes and problems Causes of floods and drainage problem vary in different zones (areas) of the city depending on topography (elevation, high, low), proximity to rivers, peculiar areas like housing estates etc. Two main causes of floods in the city are river floods and runoff from rainfall.River floods: Rivers surrounding the city like the Sitalakhya, Buriganga, Turag, Tongi and Balu cause floods in the city. This year low lying areas in the eastern part of the greater Dhaka city was heavily flooded. One point is that for some reasons the proposed flood protection eastern embankment/bypass was yet to be constructed.\nThe western flood protection embankment protected Uttara, Airport, Nikunja and other areas from floods of Turag and Buriganga.Rainfall: Due to bad drainage system in the city where most of the channels were encroached upon by the land grabbers or were choked up or filled up with illegal dumping of solid and construction wastes water logging occurs all around the city. Most of former flowing/living channels are now non-existent. Even the large ones like the Begunbari channel were either encroached upon or the outfall closed with consequence that runoff cannot flow as it used to in 50's, 60's and even 70's Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara and Uttara lakes are blocked at the outfall. Many other channels in the eastern Dhaka, South Badda, Khilgaon, Bashaboo, Shahjahanpur, Jatrabari etc. were partly or full occupied by unauthorised illegal structures. If channels are improved, heavy runoff will quickly flow outside the city.Housing estates: Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara and Uttara and perhaps other satellite towns like Bashundhara, Asian City, Amin Group etc. are relatively on higher lands and runoff thus flows into the lakes which incidentally work as buffer flood control reservoirs. Except some pockets of transient water-logging in the above areas waters are quickly drained off.Eastern part: The eastern area of the city is heavily affected by river floods and also by runoff. Flood water ... standing as river levels remain high. It strongly suggests pumping of flood/runoff waters when the eastern embankment would be constructed. Similar pumping is necessary in western embankment area.Old city: The old city is affected by runoff form rainfall. Numerous low pockets remain water-logged. If drainage channels are built or water flows through improved channels this flood situation will improve. WASA may also be of help with storm water drains. It is necessary as open drains may be difficult to run because of congestion in the area and its unique situation/location.Water-logging in DND Project: One of the earliest irrigation projects, the DND (Dhaka-Demra-Narayanganj) project was built by the then EPWAPDA (now BWDB). The project was meant for producing rice crops by irrigation. In recent years agricultural low lands were purchased or illegally acquired for residential use. Canals were encroached upon, both irrigation and drainage channels were encroached upon by influential people. Due to heavy downpour on June 15, 2007 the whole Dhaka city and adjoining areas were flooded. With drainage channels closed here and there, DND project area was fully water-logged.\nAnother reason is that due to low level of the outfall of the drainage channels, natural drainage is not possible due to higher level of water of the river Sitalakhya. As a result the water of the DND needed to be pumped out. But sometimes some of the pumps remain out of order. BWDB should keep the pumps in good working condition at all times.Some unconventional causes: Though the unconventional causes like the slow subsidence of ground surface in general can occur over a long period of time, they deserve serious consideration. For gradual subsidence over many years might turn out to be serious in magnitude and dimension. This may happen for both natural and man-made causes.Natural process soil erosion: Anytime heavy rainfall occurs, it erodes some soil in the city area. Ceaselessly the rainfall has caused erosion and sediment was transported away by runoff to the adjoining rivers bounding the city, through rills, small channels. Only a proper contour survey available for 50's or 60's or later years may be compared to see the magnitude of erosion, consequently lowering the ground surface level (subsidence)Man-made causes: There are two such causes of land susbidence --Subsidence due to pumping: Due to continuous pumping by hundreds of deep tubewells, ground water level below Dhaka city is falling. It may be mentioned that for continuous pumping in Tamil Nadu and Gujrat States in India, ground water dried up in millions of tubewells. There is no irrigation now, only low-yielding rain-fed agriculture is in practice. Drinking water is brought to the large affected area with hundreds/thousands of trucks daily! One may ascertain difference between ground level now and that some 30 or 40 years ago and estimate the evidence and extent of subsidence.\nGroundwater aquifer (aquifer is water holding stratum/layer of soils) consists of trillions of water-filled voids. As pumping continues over the years, voids are depleted of water and as a result due to overhead soil pressure empty voids may get contracted which may accentuate subsidence. Though a very long term process, it may happen. It is worth investigation and studies.High rise buildings: For the last 25 years or so thousands of high rise buildings were constructed all over Dhaka. Though developers generally take good care in foundation design considering bearing capacity versus subsidence, there are thousands of multi-storied buildings which were privately constructed. I have doubt whether they took care of foundation design adequately. In the years to come there may be a global effect of millions of tons of imposed weight on the surface which may cause subsidence in the soft alluvial sedimentary soils underlying the city. A six-storey residential building on 5 katha (3600 sft) may weigh 5000-7000 tons. Our learned geologists and foundation engineers might have answer to this. If the answer is an emphatic yes, it may be of concern to all of us.\nAll the above three causes particularly the man-made ones might look speculative at the moment. But after serious investigations, comprehensive relevant surveys and intensive studies, we might obtain a suitable answer.June 15, 2007 rainfall: Let us analyse the rainfall of June 15, 2007 that occurred for a duration 6 hours (6 pm to 12 midnight) with a total rainfall of abut 100mm.\nGreater Dhaka has on area of 850 km2. Preliminary estimate shows that a flow (discharge) of 3,000 m3/s was generated in the greater Dhaka and 2,000m3/s in the metropolitan area. Both the figures are designed discharge. Canals of 200m bottom width x 1.5 deep x side slope 1.5:1 x bed slope 1/1000 and other canals of 150m, 100m, 50m and 30m bottom width can be designed for the drainage of the greater Dhaka city. About 35 trapezoidal channels of various capacities are required to achieve drainage of the city.\nBegunbari channel takes off from Dhanmondi lake but Mirpur road blocked it near Panthapath crossing. It is again perhaps blocked by roads notable Nazrul Islam Avenue before Sonargaon Hotel. It resurfaced behind the hotel. On its way a lot of illegal structures, some multi-storey buildings were constructed between Sonargaon Hotel and its crossing at Shahid Tajuddin Road (Tejgaon Road). The channel then veers north-eastward meeting the combined drainage channels from Gulshan-Banani lake and Mohakhali drainage channel at a point 5 km south of Gulshan Lake (E). Then it moves east-southeastwards meeting a north-south channel in low areas south of Badda and moves eastward to the proposed Eastern Bypass.\nBegunbari channel is the main drainage channel of the city, both larger in dimension and longer in stretch, and moves west to east draining the crowded parts of the city: Tejgaon, Mohakhali, Kawran Bazar, Panthapath, Banani-Gulshan and open areas in the east and Green Road, Farmgate area. With 200m width and proper designed dimensions, it can carry a discharge of 400-500m3/s i.e. 1/7th to 1/6th (15%) of the total runoff generated by June 15 rainfall. Begunbari appears to have large catchments. It also drains entire Badda, Rampura and Khilgaon areas, open areas in the east on both sides of Begunbari. The feeder channels, Mohakhali-Banani-Gulshan lake, north-south canal meeting Bagunbari should be excavated and improved. Begunbari channel acts like a drainage divide between the north and south of the metropolitan area. Another divide existed in old city, now filled up Dholai Khal channel which ran west to east dividing the old city drainage to the canal from the north and south.\nFrom contour plan of the Begunbari and catchment and characteristics of channel catchment plan, synthetic unit hydrograph may be drawn by using maximum daily rainfall data for 20 to 30 years. From unit hydrograph peak flood of 25 years, 50 years or 100 years frequency versus depths can be determined for the design of channels. Similar methods can be used for other channels in other zones/areas.Some recommendations Master Plan: Master plan of Dhaka City Drainage should be prepared by an experienced consulting engineering firm. A national committee composed of experts from relevant organisations may guide and oversee the activities of the firm. The whole city may be divided into drainage zones according to topography and location.Eastern Bypass: An embankment by the east of the city (Eastern Bypass) may be constructed as quickly as possible. If the Eastern Bypass is delayed for the Master Plan, the city will continue to suffer. Western embankment was not delayed for the Master Plan.Cleaning of canals: All silted up and choked up channels large, medium or small, should be excavated and made efficient for drainage of rain water. These moribund channels should be cleared and designed to carry runoff in 25 or 35 channels as outlined earlier.Open area drainage: Drainage channels in the open areas between the city and the existing west and the proposed eastern Bypass will be designed to carry flow and evacuate in the embankment sluices. In some points pumping may be required. We are to design pumps, pump houses etc.Embankment: Embankment along the Buriganga in the southern side should be strengthened in order to prevent river floods. Drains should carry runoff from rainfall.\nProtection from future grabbing: Excavated/cleared existing closed or blocked channels should be protected from future grabbing by enacting strict laws, if necessary.\nDND drainage: Drainage channels in DND project area should be cleared and made efficient to carry runoff. Pump house should be made efficient and repaired when necessary. Water-logging in DND area is man-made artificial creation.Multi-disciplinary national committee: A multi-disciplinary national committee composed of experts from relevant organisations may be formed to find causes and effects of floods and drainage problems in the city (Greater Dhaka and Metropolitan area), and outline preventive and regulation measures. The committee will assist in the selection of an experienced consulting company. The Committee will prepare its own TOR and draft TOR for the consultants. The committee will continue to guide and oversee the activities of the consultants during its tenure.

      "text": "Prolonged low prices of paddy and floods have dampened the demand for agricultural machinery among farmers who are losing interest in making new investments, according to marketers.  \"It seems that low prices of paddy have created a gloom among farmers,\" said Subrata Ranjan Das, executive director of ACI Motors Ltd, one of the major marketers of farm machinery.  Overall sales of farm machinery have dropped by 12-13 percent year-on-year in the January-September period, according to Das. The flood in July and sporadic rainfall have also affected the demand, he added.   Industry insiders said the farm machinery market expanded steadily over the last couple of years thanks to the subsidy provided by the government to enable growers to buy the equipment.  The government hoped that the machinery for mechanised cultivation, particularly land preparation, transplantation and harvesting and threshing, would ensure that cultivation went ahead on time, crop yields increased and costs reduced.  In 2010, the government took up a Tk 150 crore project to provide 25 percent subsidy on prices of farm machinery. The allocation and ratio of subsidy have since been gradually raised.  Another six-year project involving Tk 339 crore ended in June this year, in which the subsidy was increased to 50 percent so that farmers could buy combine harvester, reaper, rice transplanter, power thresher and seeder by paying half the price.   Industry operators said though the project's expiry might have had an impact on the machinery sales, falling paddy prices was the chief reason.  \"Farmers are frustrated by very low prices of paddy,\" said Alimul Ahsan Chowdhury, managing director of Alim Industries, which makes farm machinery.   Prices of the grain, a staple grown on 70 percent of the total cropped area of 1.54 crore hectares, started declining in the middle of aman harvest in 2018 because of good yields, including the principal rice crop boro.  And the downturn continued after this year's boro harvest in April-May.  Prices of coarse boro paddy fell by 11 percent to Tk 1,394 per quintal (meaning 1 kilogramme cost Tk 13.94) in the first week of September from Tk 1,563 in April, according to the Department of Agricultural Marketing (DAM).  September's market price of paddy was almost half the government production cost estimate of around Tk 24 per kilogramme and procurement rate of Tk 26 a kilogramme, according to the DAM.  As a result, tractor sales dropped 13 percent year-on year to around 2,900 units in the January-September period, according to a leading company's estimates.  Sales of power tillers, diesel engines and combine harvester have also dropped, according to the estimate.  Prof Md Monjurul Alam of the Department of Farm Power and Machinery of Bangladesh Agricultural University said farmers suffer from a dearth of cash and incurred losses by selling paddy.  M Asaduzzaman, former research director of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), said uncertainty over getting fair prices was another factor affecting farmers' interest to purchase agri-machinery.  Sadid Jamil, managing director of The Metal (Pvt) Ltd, expected the market to recover during the coming aman harvests as the government plans to launch a Tk 400 crore scheme to provide subsidy to farmers.  Prof Alam too said demand for the machinery would eventually increase. \"The sluggishness is temporary. Demand for machines for harvesting, transplanting, drying and storing will grow,\" he said.  Currently, farmers use machines to prepare 90 percent of their land. Significant progress has also been made in irrigation, pesticide spraying and threshing. Yet, less than 1 percent of rice crop is transplanted and harvested by machines, according to a paper by Alam.  Sheikh Md Nazim Uddin, former director of a farm mechanisation project under the agriculture ministry, said the government plans to allocate Tk 415 crore this fiscal year to provide subsidy to farmers to buy farm machinery.

During the recent floods, 234 of the 250 houses at Char Sindurna in a Teesta riverbed area of Sindurna union, went under floodwater while the 16 others remained safe as those were made after raising the lands by around five feet. These homesteads were used as shelter centres for flood-affected people from nearby areas. Two months before the monsoon, these 16 homesteads were built after raising the level of lands owned by ultra-poor families in the char (land emerging from riverbed) island, some five kilometres from the mainland. The project was implemented under Integrated Communication Development Project (ICDP-II) of non-governmental organisation (NGO) Eco-Social Development Organisation with fund from PLAN International Bangladesh. Tk 40 thousand was spent for each house, which included putting earth to raise the level of land, building the structure and planting different trees around. \"Our house went under floodwaters last year but we remained safe this season as our house was built on a land that was raised by five feet. Affected people from the nearby area took shelter in our house during recent floods,\" said Rafiqul Islam, 48, a farm labourer at Sindurna. Shamsul Islam, 62, a farmer of the area, said their house remained under floodwaters for two weeks in last month. \"But we didn't go elsewhere. Instead, we took shelter in a neighbour's house that was made on a raised land before the rains. We also want such houses but we don't have the ability,\" he said. Sindurna Union Parishad Chairman Nural Amin said he visited the Teesta char area during floods and saw how houses on raised lands provided safety for people. \"NGOs can help people in char areas to build this type of homes as they face floods every year,\" he said. Rangpur Divisional Manager of PLAN International Bangladesh, Asis Kumar Baksi said, \"With our limited fund, houses for 16 ultra-poor families were built on raised land and these benefited the char people during floods. We will share the success story with high officials of the government so that steps can be taken for such initiative in other char areas.\""

      "text": "As a signatory to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted on September 25, 2015, Bangladesh has been engaged in implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the last four years and playing an active role in the global discourse on the SDGs. The government of Bangladesh has involved various stakeholders in the process of implementing the SDGs with a whole-of-society approach to this end. Non-state actors have also been playing important roles in carrying out activities towards the implementation of the goals.  The SDGs gave the world an ambitious aspiration that leads towards a transformational growth, with the commitment of \"leaving no one behind\". Out of the 169 targets of the SDGs, the majority are not quantifiable within the national context. Unfortunately, data for forecasting those indicators, particularly reliable long-term data, are not available for Bangladesh. In this circumstance, the localisation of SDGs is very important for us. Localisation relates to two aspects: a) how local and regional governments can support the accomplishment of the SDGs at national level by means of action carried out from the bottom-up; and b) how the SDGs can provide a framework for local development policy. Many Asian countries like the Philippines, Indonesia, China and India have developed their SDGs-related localised plan and implementation mechanism. In the meantime, in Bangladesh, the \"Natore SDG Localisation Framework\" was already developed with technical support from a donor agency. This subdistrict-level model plan addresses the identification of local problems, potentials, adoption, resources mobilisation, database preparation, responsibility-sharing among government departments, civil society organisations, and the private sector. It is also about empowering the local people to participate in the accomplishment of the SDGs in their daily lives. Bangladesh has six \"hotspots\" that simply define a broad grouping of districts and areas facing similar natural hazards and climate change risks. These are: 1) Coastal Zone (27,738 sq. km); 2) Barind and Drought Prone Areas (22,848 sq. km); 3) Haor and Flash Flood Areas (16,574 sq. km); 4) Chattogram Hill Tracts (13,295 sq. km); 5) River System and Estuaries (35,204 sq. km); and 6) Urban Areas (19,823 sq. km). The socio-economic, political and cultural problems and prospects of the six \"hotspots\" are completely different. For example, river erosion, electricity problem, lack of industries, energy crisis, communication hazard, lack of infrastructure as well as capacities in coping with disasters, inadequate budget allocation, inadequate number of teachers, inadequate number of doctors, lack of local employment opportunities, inadequate fish production (due to lack of entrepreneurs), over-fishing, sea piracy, shortage of manpower in government offices, salinity and inadequate access to safe drinking water, sanitation for disadvantaged people, insecurity facing women, child marriage and child labour are the major socio-economic problems of the coastal belt. Some problems are common throughout Bangladesh. But in the Barind and Drought Prone Areas, irrigation, cross-boundary water issues including river basin developments, losses due to floods and drainage congestion, water supply and sanitation and round-the-year unemployment are major and consistent problems. Floods, scarcity of fresh water, and degradation of the ecosystems are major issues in the Haor region. Moreover, social unrest, land settlement, remoteness, schooling of children, scarcity of safe drinking water, and deprivation of ethnic minorities are major problems in Chattogram Hill Tracts. Also, urban poverty is an emerging issue in the present development discourse and Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). The issues and concerns of the six \"hotspots\" must be addressed in the national planning of SDGs from the bottom-up. Remarkably, the government has undertaken some important initiatives for implementing the SDGs, such as integration of SDGs into the 7th Five Year Plan, Ministry mapping for implementation of SDGs, SDGs Financing Strategy, Data Gap Analysis, Monitoring and Evaluation Framework of SDGs, forwarding outlooks, and joint collaboration with citizen's platforms for SDGs. But it is important that every sub-district of the six \"hotspots\" has a localised plan for SDGs. It should be based on local problems and solutions. The localisation process may take into account the local resource mapping, sub-district development plan, and an implementation committee coordinated by the Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO). The \"Natore SDG Localisation Framework\" can be a good example in this case. The 8th Five Year Plan of Bangladesh should have a particular chapter for mainstreaming the development of SDG-related targets. It is important to speed up the pace of implementing the SDG-related programmes and projects at the local level, given that there is not much time left in the run-up to the 2030 deadline. Without a strong, decentralised local governance system, a successful localisation of the SDGs in Bangladesh will be difficult.

      "text": "Bangladesh needs to put in place a supply chain that is resilient to natural calamities and the impacts of climate change in order to cut economic losses stemming from disasters, said experts and entrepreneurs yesterday. They said economic costs of natural disasters are high due to a lack of resilience to climate change and natural calamities, so the time is right to assess the disaster risks in industries and promote business continuity plan in order to minimise the risks. The floods of 1987, 1988, 1998, 2004, and 2007 inflicted a loss of $8.4 billion on the economy, while cyclones Sidr, Aila and Bulbul caused a loss of around $6.5 billion, according to an inception of the study on the supply chain resilience of the RMG sector in Bangladesh. It was presented at a workshop at the Bangabandhu International Conference Center in Dhaka. The programming division of the planning commission is carrying out the study under the National Resilience Programme (NRP) of Programming Division of the Planning Commission. The study will cover the present status of disasters and climate risks in the garment sector supply chain, impact of disaster risks in supply chain, and how the risks can be minimised. A supply chain includes facilities, function and activities that are involved in producing and delivering a product. Speaking at the event, Planning Minister MA Mannan said not only garments but pharmaceuticals and agricultural sectors also need a strong supply chain to post higher growth. \"However, we have resource constraints and other challenges. We need adequate infrastructure to maintain a good supply chain.\" He said the government has built many infrastructures and is thinking of building an expressway as alternative to single-road Dhaka-Chattogram highway. Reza Md Shehab Uddin Sharawardi, vice-president of the Bangladesh Supply Chain Management Society, said there is only one road that connects Dhaka with the Chattogram port and the reliance on a single road is risky. \"We need more ports to meet higher export and import within a short time. These play a vital role in reducing lead time of exports,\" he said, adding Bangladesh needs to emphasise on building human capital. Bangladesh's export lead time is 90 to 120 days, opposed to 19-45 days in Sri Lanka, 40-50 days in China, and 50-70 days in India, according to the inception of the study. Rubana Huq, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), said supply chain management and resilience needs in all sectors, not only in the garment sector. Moreover, the garment sector has taken many steps in the last few years. However, small and medium companies are at risk. \"So, they should be taken into account,\" she added. Md Mohsin, additional secretary of the disaster management and relief ministry, said Bangladesh has been successful to reduce life-loss in natural disasters. However, economic loss is still a subject of thinking, he said. Md Nurul Amin, secretary of the Planning Division, said the country is developing its own resilience system to tackle natural disasters. \"In supply chain management, we are trying to ensure more infrastructures,\" he said, adding the government has built Payra port, which is very developed. The government is expanding the capacity of the Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. A new airport will also be built. Md Khalilur Rahman Khan, chief of the planning division, said investment, modern technology, institutional capacity, human capital and coordination among all government divisions are necessary to have a sustainable resilience. The study should recommend a guideline and a monitoring system, he said. Mohammad Khorshed A Khastagir, director general of the foreign affairs ministry, Md Khurshid Alam, assistant representative of the UNDP Bangladesh, and Asif Ibrahim, a director of the BGMEA, took part in the discussion. Nurun Nahar, deputy chief of the programming division and project director of the NRP, also spoke."

      "text": "The labour shortage created by the current shutdown is worrying farmers ahead of the Boro paddy harvest, despite different measures taken by the government to ensure maximum crop yield. Although the agricultural ministry is making special arrangements for transportation of labourers from different districts to the country's granaries, labour leaders are unwilling to leave home fearing coronavirus infection. Even the ministry's sanctioning of Tk 110 crore to help farmers buy harvester machines at a subsidy might do little to ease the crisis as small and marginalised rice producers, especially in the haor region, cannot afford such investments. Harvest of Boro paddy, the principal crop of the country, starts in the haor region in a week, in the Chalanbeel area of the north in two weeks and in other parts of the country in May, agriculturists and farmers say. Every year, farm labourers from different regions, particularly from Rangpur, Rajshahi, Dhaka, and Barishal divisions, go to the haors to harvest boro before flash floods inundate the area by the end of April. The labourers then rush to the Chalan Beel area, other plain lands and Barind region for the same work. But this year, farmer Akbar Hossain from the haor area of Sunamganj district's Jamalganj upazila could not find any labourer with just a week left before the harvest of his boro paddy, cultivated on 50 acres of land. \"No labour leader could assure me of anything. If I can't find labourers, the flood will wash away my paddy,\" he feared. Ali Hossain, a farmer of Chalan Beel are in Natore's Shingra, cultivated boro paddy on 31 acres of land. He needs 25 labourers for seven days for harvesting his paddy at the end of this month. \"I am very worried. I have become tired of calling the labourers. None assured me of coming to work,\" he said. Labourer Abdus Samad from Pabna's Chatmohor wants to go to Shingra for the harvest but could not find any vehicle. Labour leader Bhabani Kanta Sen of Patgram in Lalmonirhat district is also facing the same problem. He has been travelling to haor areas of Sylhet division during every boro harvest for the last one decade and leads a group of 20 farm hands for the last couple of years. \"I never witnessed a situation like this. Most of us are afraid of visiting the haors of Sylhet as we think that area is risky [for virus infection],\" he said. \"We can't go out of our village [under law enforcers' watch]. No vehicles are plying on the roads,\" Bhabani said, adding that they also do not have the money to travel. Each labourer of Bhabani's group used to earn around Tk 30,000 working for 25 days during the harvest. But this year, Bhanbani is willing to let go of the income. \"Lives are more valuable than money. We can earn money if we survive,\" he said. MEASURES BY MINISTRY Officials of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), however, said they are providing safe transportation to agricultural workers. Director General Md Abdul Muyeed of DAE informed The Daily Star that in the second week of April they have already transported around 200 labourers from Rangpur and Pabna to the haor areas of Sylhet following health safety measures by keeping them at distance in buses and providing them with masks. But Md Safar Uddin, DAE deputy director of Sunamganj district, said the initiative for transporting labourers from outside the Sylhet region was discouraged in a meeting on April 6 to stem coronavirus spread. The district administration officials noted in the meeting that maintaining social distancing would be difficult if the DAE ventures to bring labourers from other districts, he said. However, it was endorsed that the currently unemployed labourers of stone and sand quarries as well as coal labourers can be engaged in agricultural work, he added. Secretary Md Nasiruzzaman of the agriculture minstry also feels that local non-agricultural workers, who have become unemployed due to the shutdown, will fill the labour shortage gap. Talking to The Daily Star, he said, labourers, who work at the cities and returned home following the Covid-19 outbreak, are basically from agriculture sector. They will work in crop fields in their locality as the cities have no jobs for them, he said. Regarding labour transportation from other districts, Nasiruzzaman said local administrations were asked to allow movements of vehicles carrying agricultural labourers when harvest begins in different regions. \"We are identifying the labour leaders and asking them to hire labourers,\" he said, adding that for the uninterrupted movement of labour during the shutdown labour leaders shall be provided with a certificate detailing their travel destinations and number of workers under them. The ministry of agriculture issued a circular in this regard on April 9. The ministry also allocated Tk 110 crore to help farmers buy 800-plus combine harvesters, and 400 reapers and transplanters with subsidy this year. Of those, 180 new harvesters and 137 new reapers would be given to farmers in haor areas, that already have 362 harvesters and 1056 reapers. A combined harvester can harvest paddy from 1.2 acres of land in an hour while a reaper is capable of harvesting 0.4 acres of land per hour. Farmers would buy the machines while the government would provide 50 percent of the cost with the sanctioned money, the agriculture secretary said. \"Farmers of haor region are usually not interested in buying harvesters as they need it only once a year. So we will bring the machines from other districts to support them,\" he said, adding that similar steps will be taken in other regions. CASH CRUNCH Despite such assurance from the agriculture ministry, farmers in haors, Chalan Beel and the Barind regions cannot relax. Jyotimohon Das of Sunamganj haor area cultivated boro on 6.8 acres of land and is worried about paying labourers' wages. \"Every year I borrow to pay off labourers with cash as they don't accept paddy in payment for difficulties in transportation. This time the lenders are not willing to provide loans. They say they don't have money,\" Jyotimohon said. Jahangir Alam Shah, a farmer who opened a farming library in Naogaon's Manda, said small and marginalised farmers often sell paddy directly from the field to pay off the labourers and lenders. However, he is anticipating a fall in paddy prices as he could not find buyers for his future produce yet. Citing the coronavirus situation, the buyers are not getting into any contract and some are offering to buy paddy on credit, he said. Nirod Boron Saha, president of Naogaon Paddy and Rice Businessmen's Association, said they are facing some financial constraints, but it would not impact their paddy purchase if the crop is available. \"Our main concern is who will harvest the paddy if labourers are not available,\" he said. Even well-off farmers like Saidur Rahman of Sunamganj's Dharmapasha upazila are worried about higher production costs. He fears local peasants, who work as farm labourers, would demand higher wages this year. At present, he added, the daily wage for agriculture labour is around Tk 400 to Tk 500, but it will double during the harvest time. According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) data, the country has a total 165.63 lakh farmers. Of them, 78.62 percent are small and 6.83 percent are marginal farmers. The number of farm labourer families is 90.96 lakh, accounting for 25.6 percent of the 3.55 crore total households in Bangladesh. THE PRINCIPAL CROP Paddy is cultivated on 71 percent of the total 1.54 crore hectares of cropland in the country, according to official data. Boro accounts for more than half of the total 3.64 crore tonnes of rice produced in the country in the 2018-2019 fiscal year, BBS data shows. Rajshahi division provides 18 percent of total rice production, while Rangpur and Dhaka divisions each provide 17 percent, Mymensingh 14 percent, Khulna and Chattogram each 13 percent, Sylhet five percent and Barishal division three percent. Mymensingh tops among the rice producing districts followed by Naogaon, Bogura, Dinajpur, Tangail, Jessore, Cumilla, Sirajganj, Rangpur, Netrokona, Jamalpur, Kishoreganj, Gaibandha and Chandpur. For the last two years, farmers have not been getting expected prices for their boro crop. As a result, this year the crop was planted on only 47.54 lakh hectares of land instead of 48.66 hectares of land as expected by the DAE. Yet, DAE and Bangladesh Rice Research Institute officials are expecting a production of at least two crore tons of boro rice this year.

      "text": "Photos: Amran Hossain During the drier seasons from November to March, anybody visiting the northern districts of Bangladesh will come across a sight that cannot be compared with any other part of the country-- vast sandy plains stretching hundreds of miles resemble more with the desert wilderness of Arabia or the Sahara. And, in the northern districts like Kurigram, Gaibandha or Lalmonirhat, the sand is invading more and more lands. Due to high velocity winds, the sand is taking over the adjacent fertile plains turning huge amounts of land into barren desert every year. However, just from April and onwards, this huge sandy plain turns into a raging inland sea. The furious current washes away everything in its path; monstrous waves destroy each side of the river bank leaving hundreds and thousands of people homeless and destitute. Hundreds of populous, rich villages get wiped out from the map of Bangladesh every year due to this completely contrasting nature of the once mighty Teesta River. This year, Bangladesh has suffered from the most devastating flood in the last ten years. More than three million people have been affected in at least sixteen districts of the country by the surging waters of Jamuna and Teesta rivers-- the two main distributors of Brahmaputra River that flows in India and Bangladesh. More than 15,000 homes have been washed away by devastating river erosions. According to Engineer Jahangir Kabir, Director General of Bangladesh Water Development Board, \"There are three river systems in Bangladesh which are Ganges river system, Jamuna river system, and Meghna river system. 93 percent of the catchment area of these three river systems is situated outside Bangladesh.\" \"Heavy rainfall during monsoon in the upstream catchment area of these river systems situated beyond the Bangladeshi border is actually the main reason behind this year's flooding,\" he adds. So, to look at what causes such devastating deluge we have to go outside the borders of Bangladesh. Before, 1987, Teesta was a river of prosperity. The River used to nourish the fertile plains of Bangladesh's northern districts with mineral rich alluvial silts. Chillmari river port of Kurigram district on Teesta was a booming centre of riverine trade and commerce. Then in 1987 when India diverted the upstream waters of Teesta River with Gojoldoba barrage to irrigate its agricultural lands during dry season, the situation started to deteriorate in Bangladesh. Due to this barrage situated only 70 kilometres from Dalia point in Nilphamary, now the river bed of the once mighty Teesta River turns into an arid desert plain during every dry season. And, during monsoon, when the Gojoldoba barrage has been opened to drain away the excess waters of Teesta, the rushing water overflows the dried up, sand covered riverbed resulting in distressing floods and erosion of  huge land mass. Besides this, the Indian government has also built several dams across Teesta River to produce hydroelectricity. On the other hand, according to a 2016 report published by Assam Science Technology and Environment Council, destruction of forests, and growing human settlements in the hills have degraded the catchment area of Brahmapautra River, which is the 10th largest river in the world in terms of discharge of water. As a result, during monsoon when the catchment areas of Brahmaputra are showered with around 12,000 millimetres of rainfall, the river, which has already lost its depth due to sedimentation resulting from soil erosion, expands many folds in width, failing to hold the rush of water like the Teesta river and swallows villages and towns which again contribute to sedimentation of the river. The main brunt of such flooding affects the lower basin of these mighty river streams which are mostly located in Bangladesh. Thus, abnormally overwhelming monsoon floods in Bangladesh is the glaring example of how unplanned modification of natural resource can bring about deadly catastrophes for mankind. However, experts in Bangladesh have claimed that this year's flood is not as devastating as the one we had experienced in 1998 and 1988, in spite of the fact that in Jamalpur, on July 28, waters of Jamuna River flowed 121 centimetres above the danger mark level, whereas during the flood of 1988 it flowed 112 centimetres above the mark. \"If flood water remains clogged for a long period of time then we can call it a devastating flood. The flood water is now receding. Some places of the country have been inundated but compared to 1998 and 1988, this inundation is not that significant,\" says Jahangir. However, the receding flood water is making way for new catastrophes which is no less dangerous than the inundation. Besides loss of property, waterborne and other skin diseases have turned into epidemics in the flood affected areas. Akkas Ali with his 3 children and wife are still living in their dinghy as his household has washed away by the flood and the plot of his shanty is still soft and muddy. \"My wife and my youngest daughter have been suffering from diarrhoea for last three days. All my skin is covered with rashes and sores. I cannot even walk due to acute pain from my sores,\" says Akkas Ali, a small farmer living in Hatathpara village in Udakhali union under Fulchhari upazila of Gaibandha district. \"We cannot go to the doctor as all the roads and bridges have been washed away. I do not have any money to rebuild my house\", adds a hopeless Akkas. The aftermath of the flood has worsened due to scarce relief and rescue operations. A huge number of people in most of the affected districts have not been contacted by any government representative with relief. \"Nobody has given us any relief. We have no food, no medicine and no home,\" says Golejan Bibi a villager of Hatathpara village. \"You think members and the chairman of our union council will send relief for us? They will never come to us. They will steal all the relief goods for their own use,\" adds Akkas. However, according to data shown by The Directorate of Disaster Management Tk 55 million and 6,000 tonnes of rice were distributed so far among 3.1 million affected-people. But reflection of such appreciable activity can hardly be seen in the flood affected areas.  \"We do not want relief. We want a safe place to build our home. We want strong dykes around our village which will not be washed away every year,\" says Golejan Bibi. Millions of people like Akkas and Golejan Bibi are now homeless, ailing and starving in Bangladesh. As the floods have washed away their homes, food crops and fishing ponds, they will suffer more crises due to food shortage and loss of property. If immediate relief response cannot reach these destitute people, the consequence might result in famine or further breaking out of diseases.  However, to reach a sustainable solution to this regular catastrophe, there is no alternative to reach a bilateral consensus between Bangladesh and India to make an acceptable division of the waters of the two country's common rivers that has remained a pending issue for more than thirty years. Without solving this issue, there is no doubt that tragedies like this will descend upon the impoverished people of Bangladesh with greater extent of humanitarian disaster in the near future."

The Dhaka Sanitation Improvement Project will help improve the city's livability with safely managed sanitation services in Dhaka, particularly in its southern part, the Washington-based development lender said in a press release on Friday.  The project will treat sewage and septage, which will help reduce inland flooding and water pollution. It will also provide 50,000 new household sewer connections. Furthermore, to improve the quality of living in slum and low-income housing areas, the project will upgrade toilets and install communal septic tanks. \"About 3.5 million people living in Dhaka's low-income communities, especially women suffer most from poor sanitation and high levels of pollution,\" said Mercy Tembon, country director of the WB for Bangladesh and Bhutan, in the press release.  \"This project will help ensure safe sanitation, which is essential for reducing public health risks as well as extreme poverty.\" The project will help construct a new sewage treatment plant at Pagla area with a capacity of treating about 150 million litres of domestic waste water per day. \"By reducing the volume of untreated wastewater and fecal sludge into drainage canals and water bodies, the project will decrease the risk of inland floods and thus lessen the risks of water contamination,\" said Arif Ahamed, WB's team leader for the project. Dhaka's 881km sewer system is old and inadequate to serve the large population. Often, untreated domestic sewage and industrial effluent are illegally discharged into rivers and canals, causing pollution and flooding. Due to damaged and clogged sewer collection and transmission network, the existing sewer treatment plant can only treat about one-fourth of its capacity. The project will support Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority to improve efficiency in sanitation service delivery. It will receive a scale-up facility credit from the World Bank's International Development Association, with a 34-year term, including a four-year grace period. The project also includes $170 million financing from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and $143 million financing from the government of Bangladesh, the WB said."

      "text": "At least 165 people have died and thousands have fled their homes as monsoon floods swept across Nepal, India and Bangladesh, officials said Monday, warning the toll could rise as the extent of the damage becomes clear. Three days of relentless downpours sparked flash floods and landslides that have killed at least 70 people in Nepal, 73 across northern and eastern India and 22 in Bangladesh. Around 200,000 people are living in emergency camps in Assam in northeast India, which suffers frequent flooding during the annual monsoon rains. Another 15,000 have had to leave their homes in the eastern state of Bihar, which borders Nepal and where one official said seven rivers were at danger levels. Huge swathes of the state were submerged in 2008 when a river burst its banks across the border in Nepal, with the two countries trading blame for the disaster. In Nepal, police said over 48,000 homes have been totally submerged by the floods. As emergency workers struggled to reach far-flung areas, the country's home ministry said another 47 people were missing, presumed dead. The Nepal Red Cross warned that shortages of drinking water and food could create a humanitarian crisis in the impoverished Himalayan country. \"In many parts of the country there is a scarcity of safe drinking water creating a high risk of health hazards,\" spokesman Dibya Raj Poudel told AFP. \"Several villages and settlements are unreachable. Telecommunications, mobile phones are still not working so it is difficult to give a full assessment.\" In India, emergency workers were scouring the area hit by a massive landslide that swept two passenger buses into a deep gorge on Sunday, killing at least 46 people in the mountainous northern state of Himachal Pradesh. In the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand -- which also borders Nepal -- three people were killed in a landslide late Sunday triggered by heavy rains, local police official Ajay Joshi told AFP. Bangladesh deploys troops Bangladesh deployed troops to shore up embankments in the north of the country, where flooding has killed 22 people. Local government administrator Kazi Hasan Ahmed told AFP up to 700,000 people had been marooned by flood waters after rivers burst their banks following days of heavy rain. \"We've not seen such severe floods in Dinajpur since 1988,\" he said, referring to the worst-hit district. \"The town protection embankment was washed away by flood water, submerging most of the main town.\" The government's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre warned that water levels in some major rivers would continue to rise over the next 72 hours, raising fears the flooding could spread. In Nepal, the worst of the flooding was in the southern lowlands known as the Terai, the country's most fertile region and home to much of its agriculture. \"We are getting reports that about 70 percent of agriculture area in the Tarai is inundated,\" said Shankar Sapkota, senior agricultural economist with the government. \"Paddy fields, vegetable plantation and fish farms have been affected but right now we cannot confirm the extent of damage.\" Nearly 150 people have been killed in Nepal since the beginning of the rainy season in late June. The rains are now expected to shift westwards and authorities in Nepal have begun evacuating 74,000 people from the area expected to be hit. Hundreds have died in torrential rain, floods and landslides in neighbouring India during the monsoon, which hits the country's southern tip in early June and sweeps across the nation, lasting into September."

Khowai, Manu and Dhalai rivers have swelled up, flooding a number of villages in Moulvibazar and Habiganj districts in Sylhet division, our local correspondent reports. Last reported, Manu was flowing 175 centimetres above the danger level at Manu Railway Bridge point in Kulaura upazila of Moulvibazar. Also, the Dhalai was flowing 52 centrimetres over the danger level at Dhalai Bridge point in Kamalganj. The water levels may rise in the next 24 hours, says Shankar Chakraborty, executive engineer of Water Development Board's (WDB) local office.  He said, the onrush of water from Indian state of Tripura is adding to the swelling of rivers in addition to the incessant monsoon rains since yesterday. A number of villages in Kamalganj and Kulaura upazilas have been inundated due to the swelling of the rivers, he said. Meanwhile, water level of Khowai River in Habiganj was flowing 180 centimetres above the danger mark in Habiganj town point causing flood, said Tauhidul Islam, executive engineer of WDB's Habiganj office. The Habiganj town protection dyke has been facing threat of collapse in different points due to the increase of water level in Khowai River, he said. The low-lying areas along the dyke were inundated by the river water, he added. The upazila administration of Kamalganj has distributed rice among 125 flood-affected families in Karimpur and Munshibazar areas today, said Mohammad Mahmudul Huq, Kamalganj upazila nirbahi officer (UNO). Three upazilas in Chittagong were inundated due to incessant rainfall for last three days till this morning causing several thousand people marooned, reports UNB. Severe flooding has been reported in Hathazari, Raozan and Fatikchhari upazilas of the district that caused untold sufferings to the people. In Hathazari, regional roads, fish enclosures, houses and business establishments were submerged by the rain water. Besides, embankments of Halda River in different points collapsed, increasing the woes of the people. The Hathazari-Rangamati, Hathazari-Khagrachhari and Hathazari-Oxygen highways were inundated causing immense sufferings to the commuters, UNB reports. The local administration has taken all out preparation to tackle any kind of natural disaster, UNB said quoting Akterunnesa Sheuli, Hathazari upazila nirbahi officer (UNO). The inhabitants of low-lying areas have been asked to take shelter in local educational institutions, she said. In Raozan, heavy rains flooded many low-lying areas in the upazila, causing untold sufferings to the people. Nearly one lakh people in six unions -- Haldia, Dabua, Chikdair, Ghahira, Noajishpur, Purba Gujra and Raozan -- have been trapped following the rain water. People were seen wading through the knee-deep water on Chittagong-Rangamati road on Tuesday. Besides, traffic remained suspended on the road due to the flood. Shamim Hossain, UNO of Raozan upazila, said onrush of hill water and persistent rains for the last three days have inundated at least six unions of the upazila. A total of 24 shelter centres have been opened as well as a control room will be in operation for 24 hours, he added. Besides, leave of all the employees and staffs of the local administration were cancelled and all of them were asked to remain in their work place round the clock, the UNO added. In Fatikchhari upazila, persistent rains for the last three days led to severe flooding in 12 unions of the upazila. The Aman seedbeds were damaged while fish of different ponds were washed way. Meanwhile, Taiab, 28, a resident of Purba Farhadabad reportedly went missing in the flood water around 4:30 pm on Tuesday. Khurshid Alam, Gauge Station officer of Water Development Board in Narayanhat, said the water of Halda River has been flowing 5.90 centimeter above the water level till 6 pm on Tuesday. Some fifty villages in the upazila including Dharmapur, Committee Bazar, Bakhatpur, Shamitir Haat, Nischintapur, Azadi Bazar, West Dharmapur, Lelang, Gopal Ghata, Kanchan Nagar, Manikpur, Telparoi, Manik gola, Paschim Bakhatpur, Okhara, Rosanggiri, Paschim Nanupur, Maizbhandar, Azimnagar, Suabil, Sundarpur, Purba Harualchhari, Paidong, Bherajali, Shetkua, Doulatpur, Kumbar Par, Dhurong, Rangamatia were inundated by the flood water, rendering three lakh people marooned."

      "text": "As one of the countries that are most vulnerable to the climate change, Bangladesh has been working relentlessly to combat the effects of extreme weather events induced by climate change. According to the German Watch Global Climate Index Report, Bangladesh is among the 10 most vulnerable nations affected by climate change. The impacts of climate change have become more real for us since natural disasters such as cyclones, floods, river erosion, and drought have increased both in number and ferocity in the country, displacing hundreds and thousands of people annually. Reportedly, even a one-metre rise in the sea level will have disastrous impacts on our coastal regions. Bangladesh will lose 17.5 percent of its land by 2050, which would displace an estimated 20 to 30 million people. Now the question is, where would all these climate refugees go? Is it only the responsibility of Bangladesh and other vulnerable countries to accommodate this huge number of displaced people? What role can the global community play in protecting the rights of the climate refugees? Under the circumstances, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's call to the global community was very timely. She has rightly said that climate change has become an existential threat for countries like ours. At the opening session of COP25, known as the UN Climate Change Conference, the prime minister has urged the global community to take responsibility for climate migrants by accommodating them and providing them with livelihoods as they would be displaced for no fault of their own. Bangladesh has already made a compact national adaptation plan which is now under implementation. It has taken mitigation measures to reduce and eventually reach zero emission in the future. Bangladesh is the first LDC to establish a Climate Change Trust Fund and has so far spent more than USD 415 million from its own resources for mitigation and adaptation purposes. However, without the necessary support from the world community, it would be difficult to deal with the issue of climate refugees. An appropriate framework is needed to address the needs of the people displaced by climate change. At the same time, the world's major emitters should be held accountable for their inaction to mitigate the impacts of climate change. "

      "text": "Refrigerator sales has failed to see a usual pre-Eid surge this year, which retailers and manufacturers reason for the dengue outbreak across the country and floods in the north and hilly regions.  The need to preserve meat of animals sacrificed during Eid-ul-Azha drives the market of the cooling apparatus, accounting for nearly half the year's sales.  The sector's major players say sales grow by some 35 to 40 percent during this period, propelled by offers, including discounts, cashbacks and prizes.   Though there are a couple of days to go before the festival, the growth this year has averaged at only 15 to 20 percent.  The makers believe dengue treatment costs and flood-induced losses are being met with money kept aside for the home appliance.   Some 14 lakh refrigerators were sold in 2014 while the figure rose to 20 lakh in 2017 and 22 lakh in 2018, meaning an average annual growth of 11.42 percent in the past five years, says industry insiders.   \"Sales are slightly dull compared to that of last year...it might be the same as of last year,\" said Manzurul Karim, general manager of Esquire Electronics, the sole authorised distributor of Japanese brands General and Sharp.  According to him, the industry's Eid targets will remain unattained and the year's tally would be at best 22 lakh units. However, he was optimistic of Esquire Electronics' chest freezers this year.    \"Sales growth is only 10 percent this year...with chest freezers the most sought after,\" said Rashedul Islam, product manager of Transcom Digital which retails Whirlpool, Hitachi, Transtec and Samsung brands.   \"We have a maximum Tk 500,000 in cash back offer for fridges otherwise tours abroad,\" he said. Transcom is also offering exchanges with discounts of up to Tk 16,000.   Walton, a leading local manufacturer of refrigerators, has set a target of selling 10 lakh units ahead of Eid.  The local electronics giant increased production at Walton Hi-Tech Industries and booted stocks at outlets across the country, releasing around 50 new models.   The company is offering a chance to win Tk 10 lakh with purchases made at authorised outlets. Moreover, there are cash backs of Tk 1 lakh, cash vouchers and various appliances including refrigerators.   Sayefus Shahedin, deputy general manager (sales) at LG, said 33 percent of their Eid sales target had been met till August 5 despite the company offering cash backs ranging from Tk 1,000 to 100 percent of the price tag. \"I think the target ahead of Eid might remain unattained because of the impact of dengue fever in urban areas and flood in rural area,\" he said.   Last year, they sold 12,000 LG units and 27,000 of Eco Plus while this year's target is 23,000 and 21,000 respectively.  Vision Electronics, a sister concern of Pran-RFL Group which offers 75 models, said their sales grew only 20 percent ahead of Eid whereas it was 50 percent last year.  Kamruzzman Kamal, director for marketing at Pran-RFL Group, said they produce 1,000 units every day at their Ghorashal factory in Narsingdi.  Vision Electronics retails products through showrooms of Best Buy and Vision emporiums alongside over 2,000 listed dealers, he said. Their 121 to 556-litre-capacity refrigerators are in the price range of Tk 11,000 to Tk 91,000 while 150 to 350-litre-capacity chest freezers around Tk 22,400 to Tk 37,300.   Kamal said Vision refrigerators having glass doors were in high demand.  Products of different brands such as Panasonic, Haier, Kelvinator, Mitsubishi, Toshiba, Jamuna, Marcel and Electra are also available in the market."

      "text": "The recent floods have affected different people in different ways. The one thing that they all have in common though is an unending suffering that shows no signs of receding, much like the floodwater. In these trying times though, some stories of heart-breaking compassion are bound to arise. It is these stories that give everyone a little hope but at the same time they do little to distract from the real issues. Altaf Hossain, a resident of Gunergati village in Sirajganj Sadar upazila, has been living on the flood protection embankment at 3-no dyke point area for the past four days only to protect his cows. His four family members are staying in their house in the village, around half a kilometre away, which is also deluged. \"This cow gives around 10 litres of milk every day. I had to leave my family members in my house for her,\" he said, his eyes fixed in a vacant stare. \"I have left my family behind in the water because I do not know how to let go of this cow. She is like a member of my family and more importantly, an earning member,\" he added.  With the floodwater entering on Saturday, his house is now under waist-deep water, as the Jamuna swelled up rapidly. \"My family is suffering a lot in the flood. If the water keeps on rising, I have to bring them here on the embankment,\" he said. Like Altaf, at least 20 people of the same village have been staying on the embankment with their domestic animals. Milon Hossain was one of them, living there with his four cattle, for the last three days. \"My family members are virtually living on the bed to avoid the water. But these cattle cannot survive there. I need to save my cattle at any cost.\" he said. Without their cattle, the people here believe that they have nothing else to look forward to. Years of taking care and doting after these creatures has built an unbreakable bond that cannot be fully explained. Some people said they sold their domestic animal due to lack of accommodation. Parting was better than causing more suffering. \"I sold 10 hens and a goat at a low cost as the water submerged my house. There is no scope here to save them,\" said Somar Ali. Flood-hit people of Gunergati village are passing days amid hardships as almost all the houses have been flooded in the last four days. Apart from living on the embankment, many took shelter at the madrasa playground. \"The madrasa playground is crammed with the affected people. It's like we're living in a slum,\" said Abdul Mannan. Many people send their family members to their relative's house outside. The Jamuna river has swelled 67 cm above the danger level since yesterday, said Fazlul Haque, sub divisional engineer of Sirajganj Water Development Board. \"Due to the onrush of water from upstream, Jamuna has surged. But the floodwater entered into the low lying areas outside the flood protection embankment.\" Fazlul said. Over one lakh people in 29 unions of five upazilas in Sirajganj have been affected by the flood, according to the district administration office. The realities of the flood though can be seen when the homes of those affected are visited. This is where the real struggle can be understood, up close. Setting up her earthen oven on a floating banana-tree raft, Rikta Khatun was cooking rice for her five-member family yesterday noon. Her father-in-law prevented the make-shift kitchen from tipping over by using a piece of bamboo as an oar in one end of the raft as there was floodwater everywhere inside her house. \"I've been cooking food only once a day on it [the raft] as my home has remained under water for the last five days. There is no dry place left around my house,\" said the 37-year-old mother of three. \"The food I could prepare is inadequate for my family. My children want more,\" Rikta added, her voice heavy with helplessness. The floodwater started seeping into her homestead in Dholirkandi village of Sariakandi upazila in Bogra on Friday and has been increasing every day. Her husband, Solaiman Ali, has a tiny grocery shop in the village, but that too remains inundated. Relief was yet to arrive and her husband was trying to earn money by transporting people in his small boat. Her children - all students of a government primary school -- stayed at house amid miserable conditions. With water on the ground, they raised their bed by placing bricks underneath. \"We are passing days in misery, either half-fed or under-fed. We cannot move to higher grounds in fear of losing our valuables and belongings,\" Rikta said. Elsewhere, the condition of Morium Begum looked better. With her husband Azgar Ali and eight other family members, the 56-year-old woman of Rahadaha area on Kamalpur union in the same upazila took shelter at the flood control embankment for the last one week after her house was flooded. A few days ago, she received 20 kg rice and some dry food once from the authorities. Her husband incurred a huge loss as their crops were damaged in the flood. \"We don't know how my family would run when the water recedes from the area,\" she said. About 11,220 families of 57 villages of nine unions of Sariakandi were affected by the flood as the floodwater was flowing 57cm above the danger mark in Sariakandi point yesterday noon. The rise of water is devouring more and more places of Sariakandi upazila. Twenty-one villages in three unions of Sonatola upazila and 14 villages in two unions of Dhunat upazila of Bogra were inundated, affecting at least 70,000 people, according to the District Relief Office."

Read More: Heavy rains raise fresh flood alarm The embankment of the Dharla near Mondolpara area of Kathalbari union of the upazila was damaged around 11:00am resulting in floodwaters rushing into the villages, our Kurigram correspondent reports from the spot. The local bazaar in the area went under knee-deep water in minutes following the damage, the correspondent reports. Meanwhile, another embankment near Mondolpara area gave away around 3:00am today.  Many people of the villages have been reported missing as well, the correspondent reports quoting locals. Over loudspeakers, residents of Kathalbari union are being urged to move to the Government High School in the area as soon as they can. The water of the Dharla River is flowing 108cm over the danger mark, the correspondent quoted Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) sources as saying. Kurigram Deputy Commissioner Abu Saleh Mohammad Ferdous Khan visited the affected areas today. Meanwhile, UNB reports, more than two lakh people of 30 unions in Lalmonirhat district's five upazilas -- Patgram, Kaliganj, Hatibandha, Aditmari and Sadar -- have been marooned by floodwaters as both the Teesta and Dharla rivers were flowing above the danger level. The flood bypass road on the Teesta Barrage broke down due to opening of 54 gates of Gajoldoba Barrage in India and onrush of water coupled with heavy rain in the last five days, said BWDB Executive Engineer (Dalia Division) Mustafizer Rahman. Meanwhile, at least 34 villages were flooded following the broke down of flood bypass road. Local BWDB office on Sunday morning has issued red alert in Teesta Barrage area, asking the people living in 63 chars of Teesta and Dharla to keep updated with the latest flood situation, said Mustafizer Rahman. The floodwaters also prompted disruption of bus and rail communications of Lalmonirhat with other parts of the country. Local officials of BWDB said Teesta River was flowing 65 centimetres above the danger mark early Sunday. Meanwhile, 18 villages went under water as Itpota dam, Shiberkhuti and Khatamari dams in Moghalhat area in Sadar upazila have broken down due to heavy current of the river. Patgram town saving embankment also collapsed. The worst affected areas are Dahgram of Patgram upazila, Dauabari, Patikapara, Sindurna, Saniajan of Hatibandha upazila, Bhotmari, Tushbhander of Kaliganj upazila, Mohishkhocha, Durgapur of Aditmari upazila, Rajpur, Gokunda Khuniagach, Borobari, Kulaghat and Mogolhat under Sadar upazila. Houses, roads and educational institutions have been eroded by the heavy current of Teesta and Dharla rivers. Regarding measures taken to prevent erosion, WDB Lalmonirhat deputy-Assistant Engineer Kamrul Islam said, \"We have started dumping GO bags (sandbags) to prevent erosion at the vulnerable points of the barrage.\" District Education Officer Nobez Uddin said a total of 168 educational institutions in the district were declared closed for floodwaters. Several thousands of farmers have to face heavy losses as more than 300 ponds were washed away by flashfloods, said Rezaul Karim, district fisheries officer. Lalmonirhat deputy commissioner Shafiul Arif told UNB that overall flood situation in the district has turned serious, leaving more than two lakh people marooned. Bus and train connection have declared suspended due to the floods. On last Sunday, some 1,600 packets of dry foods have been distributed among the flood-affected people, he added."

However, an initiative from a team of Brac University's Centre for Climate Change and Environmental Research (C3ER) could bring a change in the lives of those most affected by floods. Under a project funded by the Global Resilience Partnership (GRP), the team has made flood-resistant floating houses, using bamboo, wood and plastic barrels. Members of the team, led by Dr Ainun Nishat, professor emeritus of Brac University, said each house was built at a cost of Tk 10 lakh, but could now be made for around Tk 5 lakh. As part of the project, tilted \"A Dream House\", three houses, each covering around three kathas, were constructed in Dular Char area of Shariatpur's Bhedarganj between January and July of 2017. Earlier in 2016, the team had won a $250,000 fund after getting selected in a flood management competition organised by the GRP. Apart from withstanding floods, the houses can also survive strong storms and earthquakes of magnitude 8, Nishat claimed. Keeping the theme of sustainable development in mind, the process of generating earnings for inhabitants has also been created within the houses through an effective integration of modern technology, he said. Agriculture, fisheries and poultry production can be ensured inside the house through special arrangements. Through hydroponics and aquaculture and the utilisation of vertical farming method, around 4,500 vegetable plants and 1,000 fish can be produced inside the house. There are also facilities to rear 216 chickens, said members of the team. The house is environment friendly, said Nandan Mukherjee, the main designer and head of the project, and a Bangladeshi researcher of UK's University of Dundee. All the bio-waste from the chickens and those living in the house would be turned into gas through bio-digesters and can be used for cooking, he added.  The energy demands of the house have been cost-effectively and sustainably met through the implementation and integration of solar panel, solar concentrator, wind mill and mechanical energy. The most modern technology has been used to store and supply rain water. Even if it doesn't rain for 167 days, there is a reserve tank beneath the house that can store 17,000 litres of water. \"Simply speaking, there are round-the-clock facilities of pure water, energy and gas supplies in an environment-friendly floating house. The house is self sustainable, hence the inhabitants will not face any kind of crisis during the time of a natural calamity,\" said Dr Nishat. He added that anyone would be able to build such houses as the procedure and design would be published on the GRP website."

The call to action for the World Environment Day 2018 is \"Beat Plastic Pollution\". Plastic pollution is a pressing environmental concern that requires our collective action. Plastics have become a part of our everyday life. To organise a meeting or a workshop, we often use plastic water bottles, plastic plates, plastic forks and spoons, plastic cups for tea or coffee with plastic stir sticks, all carried to the meeting using plastic bags. In Dhaka city, about 14 million pieces of polybags are thrown out every day, often ending up in rivers and oceans and causing hazards to marine life. Bangladesh experienced floods in urban areas in 1998 and 2008 where polythene and plastic materials were one of the major causes for the blockage of the drainage systems. A recent report published by Earth Day Network (2018) ranked Bangladesh 10th out of the top 20 plastic polluting countries in the world. Plastic contributes eight percent of the country's waste which is equivalent to 800,000 tonnes, of which around 200,000 tonnes go into the ocean and rivers. Globally, one million plastic bottles are purchased every minute. A report produced by the World Economic Forum (2018) found that by 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the world's oceans due to 13 million tonnes of plastic ending up in the ocean each year. Most used plastic materials are non-biodegradable and decompose at different rates. Managing plastic waste is increasingly becoming a global environmental and economic challenge. Plastic waste is a risk to public health as it enters our food chain, creates congestion problems in drains, causing flooding, ends up in river beds and oceans, depleting ecosystems and marine biodiversity, and makes solid waste management more expensive as landfills and open incineration do not provide an acceptable solution for disposal. Moreover, the production process for plastic produces greenhouse gas, thus contributing to climate change. It is time for Bangladesh, and the world, to introduce alternatives to plastic. Bangladesh, which became the first country in the world to ban polythene bags in 2002, made a voluntary commitment last year at the Ocean Conference in New York to significantly prevent and reduce marine pollution by 2025. To beat plastic pollution, we need to entirely redesign or rethink our behaviours relating to the consumption and production of plastic. World Environment Day could be a turning point to inspire innovators, producers, consumers, activists, the media and political leaders countrywide to do more than just clean up and recycle existing plastics. It is time for research and investment to lead to suitable, environmentally-friendly and affordable alternatives to plastic. We all have a role to play. As individuals, we can reduce our plastic pollution and be more environmentally conscious by avoiding single-use plastics (e.g. straws, cups, cutlery, etc.) and packaging materials (e.g. polybags). Instead we can use jute bags, glass bottles or jars, steel or ceramic cutleries and utensils, and paper-made tetra packs. The private sector needs to invest more in producing alternatives and biodegradable plastics and in phasing out the production of plastic. More research and technology investment and development is required to make alternatives to plastic that are economically viable and affordable. The government should play a leading role by enacting strong policies and regulations that will encourage a more sustainable model for the design and production of plastics. Technical and financial incentives from the government are instrumental for the transformation of the existing production system to a more sustainable one. The introduction of Deposit Return Schemes through which a deposit is paid upon purchase and refunded upon return, could make a difference. Finally, we need to change our existing corporate culture and behaviours relating to the use of plastics. In our offices and workplaces, we should ban the use of single-use plastic and packaging materials. We can serve tea or coffee in ceramic cups, and water in pitchers and glasses instead of plastic water bottles. We can make our offices green and minimise our plastic pollution footprint. If plastic pollution continues at the current pace, Bangladeshis will be living on islands of plastic, not chars. The time for action is now. Let's beat plastic pollution.

      "text": "Namapara village is like any of the 84,000 villages of Bangladesh. Located in Rowmari upazila of Kurigram, the poorest district in Bangladesh, this village is inhabited by some 200-250 families, most of whom are impoverished farmers. The Jinjirum, a meandering river originating in the hills just across the border, shapes the fate of the villagers--sometimes by providing them with a bounty of fish and alluvial silt and sometimes by inundating the village and destroying their harvests. However, inhabitants of this ordinary, impoverished village have devised a way to reduce its vulnerability to natural hazards such as flash floods and river erosion, which has created quite a stir among the neighbouring localities. Actually, they have reintroduced a native technology of river training which had been forgotten due to long periods of disuse. This technology is known as 'bundaling' among the people who live along the Brahmaputra river system. A 'bundal' is a complex, multilayered bamboo palisade that can protect the riverbank from flash floods, in the process increasing navigability of the river. Depending on the width and strength of the river, several bamboo posts, each 25 feet long, are installed vertically into the riverbed where its bank is vulnerable to erosion. Each post is installed 13 feet deep into the riverbed. The vertical bamboo posts are supported by horizontal ones of the same length. The gaps between the vertical and horizontal bamboo posts are stuffed with wooden planks, sacks of jute, and straw to reinforce the structure. Each set of bamboo palisade is installed at an angle of 45 degrees towards the direction of the river current. Depending on the strength of the river, several layers of bamboo palisades are installed at vulnerable points of the riverbank. Ahad Ali, a farmer and an inhabitant of Namapara village, is an expert in constructing this kind of bamboo structure. He says, \"My original home is in Chilmary, on the bank of the Brahmaputra. My home and croplands have been washed away by that river. My ancestors used to construct large bundals to tame the currents of the Brahmaputra. I heard about this technique from my father and grandfather. But, due to government embankments all along the river, they could not construct large bundals that could prevent Brahmaputra's current from scouring. However, the government embankment could not save us. We lost all our belongings. Then I settled here and with the help of local villagers and the local administration, along with my neighbours, I started to construct these palisades to save our croplands.\" This method is not unknown to Bangladesh's river researchers and engineers. According to Kazi Rezaul Karim, chief scientific officer at the Bangladesh River Research Institute (BRRI), \"The network of bamboo palisades acts as a natural dredging machine. The bamboo palisades, installed at an angle of 45-50 degrees towards the direction of the river current, obstruct the river current and trap alluvial silt. In this way, the palisades naturally rebuild the banks and increase the amount of fertile croplands. On the other hand, the palisades divert the current to the centre of the river. As a result, the river naturally scours the riverbed instead of the banks which increases its navigability.\" To assess its effectiveness, BRRI has set up a series of bamboo palisades along different channels of the Jamuna and Padma rivers. \"We have already got satisfactory results to some extent. We set up palisades along the course of the Gorai river. We have experienced effectiveness of the palisades this monsoon. Most parts of the banks are still intact and we are expecting that the river's navigability will also increase in the next dry season. Since it's a natural process, we shall have to wait a couple of years more to fully understand its efficacy.\" Eminent river researcher and bundaling expert Sheikh Rokon, secretary general of Riverine People, thinks that efficacy of this technology has already been established in our history. He says, \"In the past, agriculture, transportation and trade of this part of Bengal depended mostly on the rivers. We had to ensure that these rivers supply us with enough silt to make our croplands fertile and, at the same time, remain navigable throughout the year. And, to do so, our ancestors constructed bundals of different sizes all along the rivers.\" \"Most of our rivers change their course so frequently that it is sometimes impossible to tame these rivers artificially by building concrete structures. However, our engineers are still reluctant to use bundals because many of them are unaware of the resilience of this structure and the modern dredging and embankment techniques require large amounts of funds which allow for corruption,\" he adds. Due to a lack of awareness about this method, these bamboo palisades are being constructed defectively. In Rowmari upazila, several palisades were seen constructed parallel to the bank that is at a 90 degree angle to the current of the river, instead of at 45 degrees. As a result, local people cannot access the riverbank and during the current monsoon, several of these palisades have already been washed away. Again, villagers have to install only a single layer of palisade due to lack of funds and material and for the same reason, they cannot maintain these structures, which reduce their efficiency. \"Bundals have to be repaired frequently. Jute boards and wooden planks need to be changed regularly. Regular siltation buries the bamboo posts. In such cases, the structure needs to be shifted towards the vulnerable bank. Also, we must ensure that bamboo posts are driven at least half of their length into the riverbed. For this purpose, we need heavy hammers to insert the bamboo post. Otherwise, the structure will be washed away by the river current. To ensure sustainability of the structure, we need funds and intense labour which we don't get in our village,\" explains Ahad as to why they cannot construct sturdy palisades. Despite these limitations, usefulness of these structures has propagated to the neighbouring villages of Namapara. Villagers of Bakbandha and Bikiribeel villages have already constructed bundals with the help of some development organisations and the local administration.        However, according to BRRI, bundaling still requires 10 times less the funds than modern dredging methods require as well as increasing navigability and helping to increase fertility of the agricultural lands. By using bundling, depth of a riverbed can be increased up to eight to 10 feet homogenously and sustainably whereas the modern dredging method sometimes damages the riverbed, by hampering the natural flow of the river and thus accelerating river erosion. Every year, Bangladesh's economy gets badly affected due to river erosion. According to the Bangladesh Water Development Board, more than two and half crore people of 43 districts have lost their homes due to river erosion in the last 10 years. In the last four decades, Bangladesh has lost more than 100,000 hectares of land due to river erosion, an area larger than many of the districts of Bangladesh. The government also spends a large amount of resources to protect the riverbanks. For instance, the government took up 76 development projects in the water development sector for the fiscal year of 2018-2019. 30 of these development projects are to protect the riverbanks and to dredge the riverbeds. These projects have consumed no less than Tk 21,000 crore. However, mounting loss of land and resources prove that these conventional, fuel intensive methods are failing and it is high time for the government to think about alternative methods to reduce river erosion. And bundaling, a natural and 'green' way to protect the riverbank and dredge rivers, deserves serious consideration.      The writer can be contacted at shahnawaz.khan@thedailystar.net\n"

      "text": "Plagues, pandemics, floods and blights, we were once taught, are vehicles of retribution, weeding out those who have not prepared for divine wrath--the greedy, reckless, and arrogant. Yet heavenly justice can be merciless and undiscerning, destroying innocent lives for the hubris of their leaders. As the global division of labour has expanded and deepened, decades of \"structural adjustment\", privatisation, deregulation, austerity measures and the deliberate destruction of public institutions and social welfare infrastructure have left a fundamentally weak and vulnerable world. Now the West lies crippled, much of the Third World unable to even measure their predicament, and only a handful of governments managing any kind of effective response at all. Here, in this crowded land, the first phase of an unofficial lockdown began after March 17, becoming official as of March 25. The government had at least two months to prepare since the first wave of both people and news arrived from China; yet it appears that, for some, other activities took precedence over the health of their fellow citizens. Now that we are finally taking it seriously, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina insists that we must \"take measures in such a way that we can protect every person of the country [from the deadly disease],\" while Health and Family Welfare Minister Zahid Maleque has declared that \"our country is now safe and doing well\" (The Daily Star, March 30, 2020). Indeed, with very few new cases of infections being reported, it seems that Bangladesh is succeeding where so many of the mighty have failed. A formidable achievement indeed! We have, however, sincere doubts about what is being said and the integrity of our institutions. Amidst continued claims that there are no shortages (bdnews24, March 29, 2020), only one of the four facilities originally assigned to be used for coronavirus patients is reported to be equipped for the task. There are severe shortages of protective gear for hospital staff, and too many reports of rejected patients, doctors and nurses refusing to approach them, forcing family members to attend to them instead. Even now, in the fourth week of the pandemic's career in Bangladesh, we are coming across news of a critical patient spending 12 hours in an ambulance, trying to get admitted into six hospitals one after another, only to die in the end with zero medical attention (Prothom Alo, March 29, 2020). Meanwhile, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) continues to stick to its own narratives with numerous reports coming in everyday of people unable to reach anyone on their \"hotline\". While we preach \"social distancing\", practice surgical sanitisation, bemoan the flood of returning migrants and the en masse evacuation of Dhaka, we forget that our \"remittance soldiers\" do not have the support system to stay in a foreign land without daily wages, and that the working classes do not have the luxury of \"social distancing\" or sanitisation while going hungry for days under the lockdown (The Daily Star, March 23, 2020). We have put the onus on able-bodied individuals to ensure their personal safety, while disguising the structural inequality that determines who gets infected and who can save themselves. Social distancing is social inequality: the elite retreat into safety while marginalised communities (the working classes, the impoverished elderly, sex workers, the hijra-transgender community, etc.) are left exposed. The nation has been abandoned to figure out how to survive on its own, either by hoarding monthly supplies, self-medicating, or reaching out to people in need. Such is the state of this aspiring \"middle-income\" country. Covid-19 has stripped naked the modern nation-state everywhere. The helplessness of the world's great statesmen to contain this pandemic has unmasked the deadly flaws in the structure of global capitalism that we have been enduring for ages, under the illusion that such a system is the path to human freedom and progress. This is what happens when we allow private gain to become the organising principle of social life: a world where we can produce enough \"fast fashion\", but not enough protective masks--a Bangladesh where we have the space to throw extravagant weddings, but not enough to provide safe housing during a crisis. Nishant Shah, a friend of one of the writers, has put it well: \"[T]he reason why we shall not accept this as normal is because the call for normalcy--and its accomplished rhetoric of productivity, work, business-as-usual--is in the service of the very system that has led to this crisis.\" Encouragingly, collective efforts have emerged to raise funds and provide PPE and other necessities to the \"socially distanced\". Such efforts are commendable; yet why do these working-class bodies have to live on our handouts, instead of what they are entitled to as citizens of the state? While affluent voices have cried over the fate of \"khete-khawa manush\", they have looked on at the state agencies beating and humiliating citizens, the \"undisciplined\" bodies, denying them the right to live with dignity. Where are these \"small punishments\" for the hoarders, or for the factory owners who forced workers to continue to expose themselves to hundreds and thousands of others in crowded factories every day? Even as late as March 21, the state minister for labour declared that RMG factories would continue to operate unless the prime minister directed them to stop, ignoring warnings about the disproportionate risk garment workers were facing (New Age, March 22, 2020). Despite many impassioned speeches, there is still no official injunction requiring all factories to shut down, for all due wages to be paid, and no guarantee that workers will not be sacked. Meanwhile, beyond the RMG industry, the body-count has begun: when workers at a jute mill in Biral, Dinajpur came out to demand all unpaid wages (fearing a shutdown), the police responded with bullets and beatings, killing a paan-seller, a bystander, in the process (Jagonews24, March 26, 2020). Just like in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza massacre, millions of taka are flowing in from everywhere without any transparent plan about how this money will be managed (such as the BGB's 125 million donation, Dhaka Tribune, March 30, 2020). We demand a full disclosure of the state's strategy to deal with this pandemic, and accountability regarding the distribution of funds. Charity will not save us. Both the state and the industrial-corporate class have deployed a narrative of common humanity to implore the affluent to help \"the needy\", the same narrative that makes us believe that we can help the many without inconveniencing the few. This is an illusion; the wealth and power of the latter rest on the perpetuation of social arrangements that generate the misery and dispossession of the former. If anything, this pandemic has taught us a brutal lesson on just how much our lives are intertwined. Lockdowns and closed doors can only delay the inevitable. When the time comes, the state will have to answer for everyone who may die. Let us not make a man-made disaster look like natural selection. We are all in this together, after all.

The part of the bridge adjacent to Sharifpur union of Kulaura upazila went under water due to erosion of earthly base of the bridge, a government official told this correspondent. Following the collapse, all import-export activities at Chatlapur land port have been halted and many people remain stranded on each side of the Monu river. No repair work has been started yet to restore the important road link. \"We are planning to construct a Bailey bridge on the route,\" Mintu Ranjan Debnath, executive engineer of Roads and Highways in Moulvibazar, told this correspondent. Md Junab Ali, chairman of Sharifpur union said, the bridge is around 20 years old but \"such incident never occured\" before. Jamal Hosen, immigration officer of the area said, \"Many passengers from Bangladesh and India are stuck on both sides of the collapsed bridge.\" Thousands of people have been marooned as incessant rainfall this week coupled with onrush of hilly water triggered flooding in three districts of Sylhet division and some upazilas of Rangamati, Khagrachhari, Feni, Chittagong and Cox's Bazar. Thousands of residents of 90 villages have been waterlogged in two upazilas of Moulvibazar and one upazila of Habiganj in Sylhet Division as the Khowai, Manu and Dhalai rivers swelled up. Floods also hit the Indian state of Assam, which usually has a ripple effect in this division. The Manu was flowing 175 centimetres above the danger level at Manu Railway Bridge point in Kulaura upazila of Moulvibazar till Thursday."

      "text": "Bangladesh is viewed globally as the \"epic centre\" for climate disasters. The country, due to its unique location, is battered regularly by extreme weather events such as high floods and tropical cyclone disasters displacing hundreds and thousands of people annually. On top of this, the looming catastrophe of global climate impacts associated with even one-metre rise in sea level in the low-lying coastal districts of Bangladesh will make the country much more vulnerable leading it to the brink of massive disasters. According to some projections, close to 17 percent of the country in the southern delta will be permanently flooded displacing an estimated 20 to 30 million people by 2050 or so, which is not too far away. Indeed, already a large number of people in Bangladesh have become victims of climate change and have become \"climate refugees\" in their own country. There is perhaps no way that Bangladesh can handle such a huge number of climate-displaced people in the time in which it is likely to take place. Despite evidence of increasing numbers of climate-displaced refugees in many parts of the world, very little attention was paid to this growing human crisis even at the much-celebrated United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP21) held in Paris in 2015 (also known as the Paris Agreement), which focused largely on carbon emission reduction targets and environmental issues. This was equally true for the COP22/Marrakesh (Morocco 2016) and COP23 (Bonn, Germany 2017). However, the 2018 COP24 held in Katowice, Poland, made a significant and a decisive move for the recognition of the rights and needs of \"climate-displaced peoples\" and offered help to climate refugees. Delegates from many countries, including Bangladesh, India, United States (Alaska, Louisiana, Washington State), Vanuatu, Kiribati, Tuvalu and other Pacific island nations claimed that their lands, cultures, and livelihoods were threatened by the rising temperatures, higher sea levels and weather disasters, and called for recognition of rights and needs of the climate-displaced people. The COP24 in Poland approved a framework report by a task force set up to tackle the problem. The report encouraged countries to formulate laws and policies to prevent people from leaving their homes and hearth because of climate change impacts, and to help them move, resettle and minimise negative impacts if they are forced to leave. In view of the lack of any international convention for protecting the climate refugees, the COP24 framework will be helpful in that the vulnerable communities can now seek both legal and political protection to ensure safer migration and resettlement. Furthermore, the two new UN Global Compacts signed by 160 nations in September 2018 recognised climate-driven migration for the first time--one on safe, orderly and regular migration, and one on refugees--offer critical opportunities to help and ensure safety, dignity and lasting solutions for those who are displaced or at risks due to climate impacts. For Bangladesh, in addition to sea level rise and its consequences, there are other impacts as well. For instance, the loss of land due to permanent flooding means that less land would be available for people to grow food--a calamity of much higher proportion for this already overcrowded country of 160 million people. At the same time, the northwestern region will likely be affected by drought creating untold misery--including food security and agricultural production; both fishery and forestry will likewise be immensely affected. Furthermore, a wide-ranging adverse impact on human health and well-being may lead to increased illness and death while many infectious diseases, including malaria and dengue may be on the rise. In sum, the risks and impacts are multi-dimensional. Climate impacts will also force people now living in the coastal areas and the floodplains, including those displaced by riverbank erosions, to become climate refugees. Displacement caused by sea level rise is already happening, but it may not be as apocalyptic as thought some 20 years ago. In recent years, the numbers of people displaced by floods and riverbank erosions have reportedly been very high--an estimated 10 million over the last decades. Although flood and erosions are nothing unusual in Bangladesh, climate impacts have further threatened and made floodplain communities more vulnerable and \"victims\" of climate change. The loss of ancestral homes, lands and livelihoods epitomises the human costs and the grave injustice of climate change, for those least responsible are bearing the brunt of the impacts with little or no resources or help to cope with the new realities. Where do the climate-displaced people go or end up? In Bangladesh, the most popular narrative is that the climate-displaced people migrate to cities like Dhaka and join the ever-growing slums. A second view is that some definitely do migrate to cities, perhaps around 10 percent of the displaced people, including those who migrate for better livelihood opportunities or economic migrants. Therefore, rural-urban migration is not necessarily driven by climate impacts. Third, a vast majority of those displaced remain within their own localities, as reported in some recent research, and adapt to the changing situations with support from extended families and kin groups. Finally, cross-border migration between neighbouring countries has also been reported in some studies. Thus, at this point, there is apparently lack of enough data at the community level for better understanding of the displacement risks people face and options available to them so that more effective solutions can be crafted. The UN Global Compact may help people uprooted by climate impacts; these policies are, however, in their infancy and implementation may be too slow to resolve the scale and magnitude of the problems people and communities are facing on the ground in Bangladesh today. Therefore, as noted earlier, actions and commitments at the global level must be matched and supported by national and local level responses in reducing displacement and migration in the context of climate change. In Bangladesh, a solid national adaptation plan is under implementation, which involve strategies of adaptation as central element to climate change. Since displacements linked to climatic forces are already happening in Bangladesh, mobility, migration and resettlement should also constitute key responses to climate disasters, particularly planned preventive resettlement of populations at risks of disasters. Otherwise, the issue of climate change refugees will remain hidden between the lines of the current national adaptation policy.

      "text": "Around six million people have been displaced from their homes due to the effects of climate change in Bangladesh, International Organization for Migration (IOM) said today. Increased temperature and variations in rainfall are the most prevalent elements of climate change affecting the lives and livelihoods of Bangladeshi people in recent years, according to a study of IOM. The study, conducted in Bangladesh, Maldives and Nepal by Displacement Solutions, an international organisation dedicated to resolving cases of forced displacement across the world, was presented at a Regional Dissemination Meeting on 'Assessing the Climate Change, Environmental Degradation and Migration Nexus in South Asia' at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in Dhaka. The costal districts of the country are very vulnerable to cyclones, storm surges, tidal floods, salinity intrusion and sea level rise, while the regions in north and north-east of Bangladesh are susceptible to drought, flashfloods and riverine floods, making people's lives difficult, it said. The study, carried out among 320 households in four separate upazilas of Khulna, Patuakhali, Rajshahi and Sunamganj on Bangladesh, also underscored that climate change and environmental degradation will further contribute to the movement of people living in the region. MD Golam Rabbani, a lead consultant at Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, led the team for conducting the study in Bangladesh. According to the research findings, 92 percent respondents felt that the impacts of internal migration have made the women more vulnerable as the male members of their families go for working outside of their own districts, he said. According to another report by Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), around 9.6 million people in the country will migrate due to climatic factors between 2011 and 2050, excluding temporary and seasonal migrations. Referring the IDMC report, Rabbani said that over 19 million people across the world were displaced internally in 2015 due to sudden-onset disasters, of which 7.9 million or 41 percent were from South Asian countries.  Bangladesh and Nepal are countries of origin of many less skilled international migrants while Maldives is identified as the destination of many migrants from both Bangladesh and Nepal, he said. However, all three countries are also destination for skilled migrants originating from within the region, Rabbani added. Prof Ainun Nishat, an eminent expert on climate change issue and former vice chancellor of BRAC University, however, said ensuring alternative livelihoods for the affected people instead of encouraging them for the migration may be the solution of the problem. Secretary of the Environment and Forests Ministry Istiaque Ahmad and Chief of Mission, IOM Bangladesh Sarat Dash, among others, spoke at the launching ceremony of the meeting."

      "text": "The flooding in Sylhet might take an alarming turn and trigger landslides in the hilly areas as heavy rain is expected to continue in the district till Friday. More than one lakh people have been marooned in several upazilas as downpours and onrush of water from the upstream inundated vast swathes of land. In Moulvibazar, the overall flood situation remained unchanged yesterday as houses, schools and roads went under water. According to Water Development Board (WDB) and the meteorological department in Sylhet, heavy rain in the Barak basin across the border was responsible for the flood. Rain water from upstream was causing the Surma and the Kushiara rivers spill over their banks at some points, damaging dykes. In Sylhet's Amalshid, where the Barak bifurcates to form the Surma and the Kushiara, water was flowing to 85 cm above the danger level on Sunday night. The Kushiara was flowing 73 cm above the danger level at Shewla point and 24 cm at Sherpur point. The Surma was flowing 56 cm above the danger level at Kanaighat point. The two rising rivers inundated several hundred villages in Zakiganj, Kanaighat, Fenchuganj, Beanibazar, Golapganj and Osmaninagar upazilas in the last seven days. Besides, Goainghat and Companiganj upazilas were hit by flash floods due to the onrush of water from the hills of Meghalaya. Some areas in Sylhet Sadar upazila also went under water, but the situation was not as grave as in some other upazilas. Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of WDB in Sylhet, said flood water might continue to rise for some more days due to heavy rain in the Barak basin. Syed Ahmed Chowdhury, a Met official of Sylhet meteorological department, said the district might experience heavy rain till Friday and the flooding might take an alarming turn and cause landslides in hilly areas. Earlier this year, Sylhet suffered a huge loss as the Boro crop was damaged due to flash floods in haor areas. The district is now faced with another loss as the Aush paddy on around 3,000 hectares of land has been inundated, said district administration officials. At least 161 primary and 13 higher secondary schools were shut. Around 100 flood-hit families took shelter at nine shelter centres opened by the district administration. Rahat Anwar, deputy commissioner of Sylhet, said the administration was considering the situation as a natural disaster. A total of 128 tonnes of rice was distributed in six upazilas and Tk 2.77 was given to flood-hit families as part of the government's relief initiative, he said, adding medical teams were formed in each upazila to monitor the health condition of the victims, especially the children. The flood submerged 29 unions in the district's three upazilas. \"We've been confined to our house since the Eid day [June 26] when water entered the home,\" said Husna Begum, 36-year-old housewife from Bhuksimul area of Kulaura. Misbah Uddin, 45, of the same area said locals couldn't cook food in their houses for the last couple of days as those went under water. Like in Sylhet, Moulvibazar also saw a similar calamity in March when the Sonai, Kontinala, Juri and Kushiara rivers swelled, causing flash floods in the district. Farmers incurred a huge loss due to the damage of Boro crops. The latest flood has come as another blow to the growers as their seedbeds of Aus and Aman crops have already been inundated. The government disbursed relief materials to the affected people through various disaster management programmes, but the allocation was still inadequate, said Borolekha UNO SM Abdullah Al Mamun. AFM Kamrul Islam, chairman of Kulaura Upazila Parishad, called upon the government to declare the region as a disaster area and take immediate steps to alleviate the sufferings of the flood victims. Abdul Alim, primary education officer in Moulvibazar, said 152 primary schools were closed in the district. Forty-eight secondary schools were shut and eight of them were being used as flood shelters, said ASM Abdul Wadud, district education officer of Moulvibazar."

      "text": "A parliamentary watchdog yesterday raised questions over the commerce ministry's delay in importing onions to face the ongoing crisis, while another minister separately admitted the government's \"failure\" in this regard. The Standing Committee on Ministry of Commerce also blamed some businessmen for hoarding imported onions and thus contributing to the price hike.  The issue came up as the onion price skyrocketed in recent time and went out of the purchasing capacity of middle and lower income people. Indian and local onions are selling at Tk 140-150 per kg in the kitchen markets of Dhaka, while both varieties sold for around Tk 50 in September. Traders said the Indian onion price started shooting up in the third week of September due to a supply shortfall, and it left an impact on the price of local varieties.  In the last week of September, India banned onion export with immediate effect after extended monsoon downpours delayed harvest and supplies shrivelled. The resulting price hike in Bangladesh raised concern among consumers. Later, state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB) began selling onions at Tk 45 a kg with a limit of 2kg per person through 35 mobile vans in Dhaka. \"India banned export one month ago. The ministry concerned should have taken a prompt decision on onion import and the opening of LC at that time. Why was there delay?\" asked Tofail Ahmed, chairman of the standing committee.  \"The ministry should have done an analysis on production and demand of onions. How much will we need to import? So we asked the ministry to remain alert in the future and take advance measures to avert such crisis,\" he told The Daily Star. Meeting at the parliament building, the committee also urged proper functioning of TCB and the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection in dealing with the crisis. A member of the committee, Mahmud Us Samad Chowdhury, said the committee blamed a section of businessmen for the price hike as they stocked the daily kitchen essential after import. \"The committee asked the ministry concerned to take action against these businessmen with the help of law enforcers.\"  Around 7-8 lakh tonnes of onions are imported every year to meet the country's demand of 24 lakh tonnes. Bangladesh can produce 23 lakh tonnes of onions annually but a portion of it get damaged. On the same day, Agriculture Minister Muhammad Abdur Razzaque admitted that there was a failure on the part of the government in facing the crisis. \"We could have taken steps regarding onion crisis much earlier. However, we have not done that. This is our mistake,\" he told a press briefing at the ministry. Onion production was enough but floods ravaged the crop, resulting in the present crisis, while India's ban on export aggravated it, the minister said. \"In the future, we will take necessary measures to import onions in due time.\" Razzaque said the government would provide free seeds and fertilisers worth Tk 80 crore to small and marginal farmers to ensure nutrition for all through crop diversification. As part of the initiative, an onion producer will get 1kg of seeds, 20kg of DAP [diammonium phosphate] fertiliser, and 10kg of MOP [muriate of potash] fertiliser for cultivating onions at one bigha land, he said. Under the programme, 686,700 marginal farmers would get free seeds and fertiliser for cultivation of nine crops -- wheat, maize, mustard, sunflower, peanut, winter season mung, summer season mung, onion, and summer season sesame. This will help earn more than Tk 840.29 crore, the minister said. The incentive would be given to 7,700 farmers for onion cultivation; 75,000 for wheat; 250,000 for maize; 240,000 for mustard; 4,000 for sunflower; 10,000 for peanut; 25,000 for summer season sesame; 30,000 for summer season mung, and 45,000 for winter season mung."

      "text": "Incessant rain for the last nine days coupled with the onrush of water from the hills in bordering areas have triggered flash floods in the greater Sylhet region and adjacent districts, inundating vast areas of farmland and causing sufferings to Boro farmers. The rainfall in Sylhet from March 28 till yesterday was four times more than it had rained in those days last year, Abdul Mannan, a meteorologist from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, told The Daily Star. Heavy rainfall was also recorded in the bordering Indian states of Meghalaya and Assam, causing the flash floods, said Sazzad Hossain, an executive engineer of Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre. Such flash floods usually strike the hilly areas of greater Sylhet in the second half of April, but they have come early this year, Mannan said, adding, \"As far as my knowledge goes, such early flash floods had last hit the regions six to seven years back.\" The early strike has left the local farmers with no chance to harvest their crops, mainly Boro.  \"We were hoping to have a good yield this year. But the flash flood has shattered all our hopes,\" said Lokman Ahmed, a Boro farmer of Dharmapasha in Sunamganj. Thousands of farmers in Sylhet, Moulvibazar and Habiganj suffered the same fate. They were about to cut the harvest within a couple of weeks. This year, the government had fixed a target to produce 35 lakh tonnes of Boro in 456,714 hectares of land in the four districts of Sylhet division, according to Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) data. However, almost 129,172 hectares have already been inundated till Tuesday evening, said Mamun-Ur-Rashid, deputy director of DAE in Sylhet. The worst-affected areas are Dharmapasha, Tahirpur, Bishwambarpur, Jagannathpur and Chhatak upazilas of Sunamganj; Companiganj and Gowainghat upazilas of Sylhet and Hakaluki Haor basin of Moulvibazar. Sylhet Divisional Commissioner Nazmanara Khanom said early flash flood in haor areas caused a huge loss to Boro farmers. According to the statistics of Haor Advocacy Platform, farmers of the low-lying Haor areas could not harvest crops seven times between 2001 and 2016. Kasmir Reza, president of Paribesh and Haor Unnayan Sangstha, said, \"Without dredging rivers, crops of the Haor cannot be protected.\" In Moulvibazar, flash floods hit the vast areas of Barlekha, Kulaura and Juri upazilas, reports our correspondent. Many places in Barlekha Sadar, Kathaltoli, Dakhinbag, Tetli village and Hakaluki Haor went under water amid continued rain till yesterday. Meanwhile, Bilash Chandra Pal, deputy director of in DAE, Netrakona, said, 16,880 hectares out of 184,320 targeted for Boro cultivation in eight upazilas of the district went under water. Mohammed Tofael Ahmed, upazila nirbahi officer of the district's Khaliajury upazila, said 23 small and large dams had been damaged till yesterday, reports our correspondent there. The situation took a turn for the worse after the \"Kirtankhola Dam\" was washed away at a point on Monday. Abu Taher, executive engineer of Water Development Board in Netrakona, said heavy pressure of water from the Dhanu and Surma rivers destroyed a part of the 51-kilometre dam. In Kishoreganj, 19,730 hectares out of 165,515 targeted for Boro cultivation were flooded in last two days, said Shafiqul Islam, deputy director of DAE in the district. RAIL LINK DISRUPTED Sylhet's rail communications with Dhaka and Chittagong remained suspended since 2:30pm yesterday after a bridge connecting Srimangal and Sathgaon railway stations was damaged. Rain washed away some mud around the pillar of the bridge, said railway sources. The authorities were working to fix it, said Station Master Jahangir Alam of Srimangal Railway Station."

Be it in Africa, Middle East, Latin America or Asia, child marriage nips the dreams of young girls in the bud.  One in five girls in the world are married off before they reach 18, as per data by a global partnership organisation called Girls Not Brides, which works to end child marriage. More than 650 million women alive today had been married off when they were children. And more than 150 million girls will be forced into child marriage by 2030. The situation in Bangladesh is no different. According to Unicef, Bangladesh has the fourth highest rate of child marriage. The first three positions have been secured by impoverished African countries: Niger, the Central African Republic, and Chad. Unicef further states that between 2005 and 2013 in Bangladesh, 29 percent of girls got married before the age of 15 and 65 percent married before they reached the marriageable age of 18.  These numbers are staggering and expose the dark underbelly of a major social problem that we are facing today, both at a global and local level. And while we know that this is a problem, and enact laws to prevent it, what we don't ask ourselves is why this is happening. Or do we? Our basic instinct is to the blame the patriarchal, feudal mind-set that tends to see females as inferior beings--economic and social burdens, who should be married off soon. And true it is. But there are other factors that lead to child marriage which do not surface in popular discourses on this subject. Poverty is a major reason that encourages child marriage. If one looks at the trend, they would notice that child marriage is more prevalent in underdeveloped or developing countries. Financial constraints and shortage of food often lead parents to marry off their girls at an early age. Moreover, younger girls, who are considered more attractive and have a higher reproductive lifespan, require comparatively less dowry. Therefore, poor parents are more prone to marrying off their girls at an earlier age. According to Girls Not Brides, the \"median age of marriage for girls living in the poorest households of Bangladesh is 15, compared to 18 for those living in the richest households.\"    Climate change is another factor that triggers child marriage. Often, fear of river erosion and floods sweeping off one's abode and lands, economic problems due to water, land and resources shortages which lead to poor harvesting, force families to marry off their girls, while still financially capable. Lack of education among the parents is also a reason. With no knowledge of what child marriage does to a girl--physically, psychologically and emotionally--parents fail to realise the dark pit that they are pushing their girls into in the name of marriage. And with child marriage come the repercussions. For one, it severely damages the reproductive health of girls, putting their lives at risk during childbirth. According to a 2015 Human Rights Watch report, \"research shows that globally girls aged 10-14 are five times more likely to die during delivery than mothers aged 20-24; girls aged 15-19 are still twice as likely to die during delivery than women aged 20-24.\" This is just one aspect of the multifaceted problems posed by child marriage. The physical pain and psychological trauma of marital rape on the girls leave them emotionally scarred for the rest of their lives. And of course, child brides are most often subjected to battery and domestic abuse at the hands of their much older husbands and in-laws. Having no means to support themselves and no financial freedom, these girls are left to suffer silently without emotional counselling or access to healthcare. Child marriage poses another threat for these young, vulnerable child brides--a threat that is more sinister and menacing: trafficking and prostitution. Often these child brides are sold off by their husbands to dalals or traffickers, who in turn sell these girls to brothels. The Telegraph and Foreign Policy have printed in-depth stories that shed light on the complexity of this problem. The girls who try to run away from their husband's house, in desperate attempts to escape domestic violence, are also preyed upon by the traffickers who lure them into prostitution. And in the many legalised brothels of Bangladesh, these girls are raped--day in and day out, 10 to 12 times a day sometimes--by their customers. These girls perish in their windowless rooms, hoping to save enough money to buy their freedom someday.   According to the Foreign Policy report, in Bangladesh, a \"country with the highest rate of marriage involving girls under the age of 15 in the world, and where 150,000 to 200,000 children and young women have been trafficked into prostitution, the two forms of abuse [child marriage and forced prostitution] are tightly intertwined.\" And in order to address the latter, the former needs to be stopped first. The government has taken many commendable steps to address the problem of child marriage--the country, in line with target 5.3 of the Sustainable Development Goals, has committed to eliminate child, early and forced marriage by 2030. It ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 which sets the minimum age of marriage at 18; enacted the Dowry Prohibition Act; and inked many policies that discourage and criminalise child marriage. However, its incorporation of a special provision allowing child marriage in \"special cases\" in the 2017 Child Marriage Restraint Act has overshadowed all the positive steps it had taken earlier to prevent and stop child marriage. Especially because, the act does not define what constitutes a \"special case\". This regressive policy has put the future of all our girls at stake, made them more vulnerable to the curse of child marriage, because now anyone can concoct a \"special case\" and justify child marriage. This one step has regrettably taken us back centuries, and no matter how much we beat the women empowerment drum, it will not be possible for us to end violence against women or truly empower them, unless we can rescue our girls from the spiralling trap of child marriage. It is high time the policymakers revisited the policy and made the necessary amendments in order to truly make it pro-girls and pro-girl-child-empowerment, rather than making it an essential loophole for the criminals who rob our girls of their childhood, their dreams and aspirations.

      "authors": "\nThomson Reuters Foundation, Barcelona\n",
      "text": "Disaster-prone developing nations, including Bangladesh and Indonesia, are exposed to crippling losses when storms, floods or earthquakes strike because they suffer from a dangerous lack of insurance, industry experts said yesterday. Globally, assets worth about $163 billion are not insured against catastrophes, posing a \"significant threat\" to livelihoods and prosperity, London-based insurance market Lloyd's said in a report. The value of \"underinsured\" assets has shrunk by only 3 percent since 2012, it noted. Many countries with the lowest levels of insurance are also among those most exposed to risks, including from climate change impacts, and are least able to fund disaster recovery efforts, it added. \"If insurance is not available, catastrophes can have a much greater impact on economies and lives,\" Lloyd's Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown said in a statement. Emerging and low-income economies account for almost all of the global \"insurance gap\", the report said. Insurance penetration rates - total insurance premiums as a percentage of gross domestic product - are on average twice as high in rich nations as those in developing countries, it noted. Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Egypt and Nigeria all have an insurance penetration rate of less than 1 percent, it said. After a disaster, uninsured losses usually have to be paid from government funds - a problem for poorer countries that cannot afford to rebuild. \"Catastrophes coupled with underinsurance can be seen as one of the significant factors that holds back economic development and perpetuates global inequality,\" the report said. Some risks in richer nations also are not well-covered by insurance, it noted, including earthquakes in Italy and floods in the United States. Slow progress on expanding the use of insurance to protect against risks is \"concerning\", the report said - and remains the case despite many economies bouncing back from recession in the six years since the \"insurance gap\" was last measured. It is particularly worrying given the upsurge in \"more severe, frequent and costly natural disasters, driven in large part by climate change\", the report added. Last year was one of the costliest for natural catastrophes in the past decade - and expected economic losses from such disasters now total $165 billion annually, Lloyd's said. One of the main barriers to taking out disaster insurance in developing countries is that it is too expensive for many. Limited understanding of its value and lack of trust in insurance companies also stand in the way of policies being sold, the report said. But insurance, combined with investment in improving resilience to disasters, can cut losses, the report said. Studies suggest each dollar invested in reducing disaster risk saves about $4 in recovery costs. Another report also released yesterday by Lloyd's and the UK-funded Centre for Global Disaster Protection outlined four innovative financial instruments that could generate cash to invest in resilient infrastructure and boost insurance coverage. They include loans that incorporate insurance to keep interest payments low, and bonds whose payments are linked to the success of resilience measures. Another idea is \"resilience service companies\" that would retrofit buildings to better withstand natural hazards, for example, reducing risks and lowering insurance premiums. Daniel Stander, global managing director of Risk Management Solutions, which worked on the report, said the instruments aimed to ease the initial costs of building to withstand disasters, and to finance the risks that remain. \"In this way the benefits of insurance can be enjoyed by those who need it most,\" he said in a statement. But some climate change experts argue that insurance is not the best method to help the poor cope with the growing damage caused by wilder weather and rising seas as the planet warms. In a September report, the Heinrich Boll Stiftung North America, an environmental foundation, said regional insurance schemes, from which African, Caribbean or Pacific states can buy coverage, had paid out too little, too late in recent years. It proposed other options to support developing countries, such as international funding to build up social safety nets, relocate vulnerable communities and develop new ways of making a living for those at risk. Carnegie-Brown of Lloyd's said that, for poorer nations such as Bangladesh, buying insurance was a \"low-order issue\" compared to other economic problems. He urged donor governments to work with financial markets to find ways to use aid money to boost protection, adding that current efforts are fragmented and not expanding fast enough. \"The developed world is not really assisting the countries least able to afford the resilience investment that we think they need,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation."

The fisheries department imposed the restriction from October 9 to 30 to ensure safe spawning and protection of mother hilsa, said Bimal Chandra Das, Barisal district fisheries officer (hilsa). Azizul Haque, deputy director of Barisal divisional fisheries department, claimed that the ban on netting, sale and transport of hilsa was observed successfully across the division. Visiting the wholesale market at Port Road yesterday, this correspondent saw huge quantities of hilsa, weighing 600 grams to around one kg, there. Depending on sizes, the fish is selling for Tk 500 to Tk 800 each while the prices ranged between Tk 800 and Tk 1100 one month ago, sellers said. Around 5,000 maunds (a maund = 40 kg) of hilsa on a hundred trawlers has already landed near Port Road wholesale market and fishermen and wholesalers have started sending the fish with trucks and covered vans, said Nirob Hossain Tutul, secretary of Barishal Matsya Arotdar Samity (fish wholesalers association). Ajit Kumar Das Manu, president of the association, said most of the hilsa netted from the coastal rivers are big sized ones. \"We came to Port Road hilsa wholesale market with five hundred maunds of big sized hilsa on a trawler,\" said Kabir Majhi, a fisherman from Bhola. \"We faced hardship during the ban but now we are happy to get good catches of hilsa last night,\" said Sumon Gazi, a fisherman from Mehendiganj. Availability of large sized hilsa shows that the ban has yielded good result, said Abu Sayed, district fisheries officer, Barishal. \"During October 9 to 30, fisheries department in Barishal division conducted 2,538 drives by mobile courts, awarded short term jail to 1,447 people and imposed a total of Tk 44.56 lakh fine for violating the ban. Officials seized 19.03 tonnes of hilsa and 89.69 lakh metres of nets during the time,\" he said."

      "text": "Recently, I came across a friend's Facebook status that read: \"The rain is supposed to bring forth life from land, and comfort our stressful minds. Not flood our cities and villages, nor wash away homes and livelihood. What have we done? How poorly have we designed our world?\" Nadine Shaanta Murshid, in her article published by The Daily Star on August 23, 2017, has rightly pointed out that \"when we ascribe floods as 'natural disaster' we must ask ourselves how 'natural' the causes really are.\" And regardless of how \"natural\" or artificial the disasters are, there are some who suffer the consequences of a disaster more than others.  Here are some facts that have not been part of the mainstream discussion on disaster management: As reported on the Star Weekend, April 21, 2017, the Rana Plaza accident killed over 1,100 people while many of the survivors suffered from psychosocial disabilities. Four years on, many of the 2,500 and more survivors still showcase symptoms of being unwell, according to counsellors working with Rana Plaza survivors and families of victims. The rehabilitation initiative taken up by some NGOs was perhaps the first of its kind to address disabilities in disaster management.  As we face another disaster in the form of a flood in northern Bangladesh, following onrush of water from the upstream and incessant rains, we must ask ourselves, how are those with psychosocial disabilities coping with this disaster? Bangladesh has the highest natural disaster mortality rate in the world, with over half a million people lost to disaster since the 1970s. Most of these people have died during floods or cyclones, both of which are likely to become more frequent due to the impacts of global climate change. Recent floods are the worst to have hit the region in decades. Till date, the government's disaster response strategy has focused, increasingly and perhaps effectively, on the physical needs of the survivors through the provision of shelter, food and physical medical care.  However, there has been no policy provision, compensation or support for those with disabilities, who are among the most vulnerable during a calamitous event. People with physical disabilities struggle with evacuation, getting relief and are more susceptible to accidents caused by natural disasters. But the mental health consequences of the disasters receive even less attention.  According to a 2006 study by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 96.9 percent of the individuals with psychosocial disabilities are from the lower-middle socioeconomic class. This makes them the most vulnerable population, requiring support especially during disasters such as floods. Our disaster management policy falls short of addressing mental health issues because, among other reasons, when we refer to \"mental illnesses,\" we do not take into account the pervasive stereotypes, attitudes and other barriers that result in inequalities affecting the people with mental illnesses.  Mental illness denotes a number of changes that can affect our thinking, our mood, our sense of pleasure and our behaviour. Typically though, people view mental illness as a malfunctioning of one's brain and do not consider the social factors that result in mental health conditions. A mental health condition, unless inherited, usually results from an adverse social or environmental situation. In this case, if we consider flood as an environmental factor, we need to address the mental health condition of the victims in our disaster management programmes. Not providing support to those who are already vulnerable further demoralises and disenables them from recovering. Since the responsibility to support people with disabilities lies with the Ministry of Social Welfare, district administrations are supposed to have lists of such individuals and they can provide adequate support to them during disasters such as floods, but to what extent that is actually practiced is a big question. That there is no systemic study and evaluation of the plight of people with physical or psychosocial disabilities in such situations is a testament to the negligence meted out towards disability in general.  One may brush aside the plight of the most marginalised as one not of immediate concern. One may also wonder if it is possible to do anything about this issue. In case one is wondering, a case study of a nation with similar resource limitations may help. Like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka had a limited number of psychiatric professionals. In 2007, they had only 25 psychiatrists for a population of 20 million people. After the Indian Ocean Tsunami in 2004 that took 30,000 lives and displaced over one million people, the Sri Lankan government adopted a comprehensive mental health plan to address the widespread mental health conditions that ensued.  It developed a category of community mental health workers known as Community Support Officers. These volunteers, receiving small monetary incentives, were tasked with providing social support and psychological first aid and identifying people in need of additional mental health services, under the supervision of mental health professionals. They have contributed to the detection and referral of affected individuals, and provided support in their own communities. Findings of a study in three districts in the southern province of Sri Lanka showed that community support officers had referred more than half of all inpatients, and this proportion rose to 75 percent in areas where no psychiatric services had previously existed.  Not only does this show the need but also the benefits of having community-based services in low-resource settings such as Bangladesh. Bangladesh can replicate or change this model as necessary to involve community-based volunteers who can effectively address the social exclusion people with disabilities face, and increase their access to relief and rehabilitation as the ongoing flood reaches its pinnacle.

      "text": "Planting trees around rivers could reduce the height of flooding in towns by up to 20 percent new research suggests. A study for the Environment Agency concludes that trees round a feeder stream can slow the rush of rainwater and save properties from flooding. But it warns that natural flood prevention methods do not always work. And it urges a strategic approach because foresting a whole catchment would be counter-productive. The report - from the universities of Birmingham and Southampton - says that with increased building on flood plains and climate change increasing the risk of heavy rain, many places can't be completely protected by walls of concrete. There has been a rush of interest in natural methods - planting trees and creating leaky dams which attempt to delay the flow of water by creating mini-floods upstream. But the report's authors suggest that most successful natural methods are likely to be on a much larger scale than currently in operation. They advise a strategic approach - taking a tributary stream to a main river then foresting the area round it, allowing the stream to make its own meanders, and letting dead wood from the forest to block the stream where it will. A drop of up to 20 percent in flood maximum can be achieved by doing this over 25-40 percent of the main catchment, they say. That is because the forested area will release its water to the main stream later than water running off pastureland. RE-WILDING Proponents of \"re-wilding\" suggest turning a whole catchment to forests. But the authors say this would not work because all the water would be released at the same time. They say the strategic approach will be challenging because of the numbers of landowners involved in tackling the catchment of a whole tributary stream. New incentives may need to be found for farmers, who currently get EU grants for keeping land as pasture and clearing scrub and trees. Simon Dixon from Birmingham University Institute for Forest Research told BBC News: \"Where its possible to do more extensive planting than we're doing we really need to do it. It's a bit of a no-brainer.\" He said that foresting even 10-15 percent of a catchment could prevent some flooding. Ben Lukey, a flood risk manager for the Environment Agency, said there were insufficient funds to attempt the scale of works proposed in this report, although recent changes in grants might help. \"What's identified is opportunity for bigger impact with more strategic catchment but we have to be mindful of the possibility that if it's not done well it could make matters worse. \"To make the scale of changes to help a big city like Leeds for Manchester - that's a scale of ambition that would take sometime to come to pass.\" The environment select committee will produce a report on flood management soon. Floods minister Rory Stewart said the government was spending more than ever to protect communities and tree planting had a role to play along with improved defences and dredging."

      "text": "The topic of loss and damage from human-induced climate change has been a highly politically sensitive issue in international negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for many years with vulnerable developing countries, including Bangladesh, arguing in its favour and the rich countries arguing against it. In recent years, there have been two breakthroughs in the negotiations in our favour. The first was the adoption of the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) on Loss and Damage adopted at the 19th Conference of Parties (COP19) in Warsaw, Poland in 2013 where a five-year work programme was agreed upon. In COP25 to be held at the end of 2019 in Santiago, Chile the review and future mandate for the WIM will be a discussion and decision point which is likely to be quite heated. The second breakthrough was the adoption of Article 8 of the Paris Agreement at COP21 in Paris, France in 2015 where loss and damage was finally acknowledged as an issue separate from adaptation. The Article also highlighted the related issue of future climate migration due to loss of livelihoods of millions of people around the world who will be forcibly displaced as a result of human-induced climate change. At COP24 held in Katowice in 2018, the taskforce report on forced displacement due to climate change was adopted to give this issue greater prominence. However, despite these positive developments on loss and damage, there has been a distinct lack of progress on the issue of funding loss and damage (beyond insurance) which the developing countries will be pushing for at COP25 later this year. One of the major impediments for developing countries has been the inadequacy of scientific knowledge and research on this important issue. Fortunately, a recent scientific publication in the renowned international publishing company Springer titled \"Loss and Damage from Climate Change: Concepts, Methods and Policy Options,\" with over 20 chapters on different aspects of the issue written by over 30 experts from around the world (including myself), can help fill this gap in understanding and knowledge. The publication has addressed a number of key issues. The first point is defining what we mean by \"loss and damage\" which has not been agreed upon until now. Many negotiators of developed countries think that it is simply a euphemism for liability and compensation. However, in scientific terms, it refers to what happens when we reach the limits of adaptation (or fail to adapt adequately). A good example would be the wetlands of the haor basin in north-eastern Bangladesh which are prone to flash floods whenever there are heavy rains in neighbouring India. Over the decades, Bangladesh has adapted to these conditions by building submersible embankments which allow the rice crops to remain dry when the initial floods arrive so that the crops can be harvested before any major water flows begin (which overflow the embankments and flood the entire haor basin). The people there live on little hillocks above the water level and they all have boats and nets for fishing which they can indulge in when there's substantial water for a number of months during the monsoon season. However, in the last few years, this form of \"adaptation\" has not worked as the major flash floods arrived much earlier and devastated the rice crops before they could be harvested. This caused enormous loss and damage in that area. So we need to think about whether we should build even higher embankments or just let the areas revert to being a wetland. A second scientific issue that has plagued the discussion has been the inability to accurately account for how much of the loss and damage is due to human-induced climate change and how much is natural. As climate change adds to the intensity of hazards but does not cause them, we need to know how much we can attribute the hazards to human-induced climate change. There has indeed been very significant scientific progress on this front which now enables estimates to be made in real time on the additional intensity due to the one degree Celsius warming already attributable to human-induced climate change. Thus when the wildfires devastated California and Hurricane Florence hit North Carolina in the US last year, both events were said to be higher in intensity due to climate change. This is a major scientific breakthrough and, from now on, we can estimate how much of the loss and damage is attributable to human-induced climate change. The third and final issue that has been addressed in the publication mentioned earlier is looking into ways to provide funding for loss and damage incurred and using a form of insurance called Index Based Insurance (IBI) to link payments to levels of climatic events such as hurricanes, floods or droughts. There have been a number of pilot programmes such as with hurricanes in the Caribbean, droughts in Africa and floods in Asia, including in Bangladesh. The scientific lessons coming out of these pilot insurance schemes show some, but only limited, success. The main problem with insurance as a tool is that it is good for people who own considerable assets and can afford to pay the insurance premiums but not so good for the poor who cannot pay. Even if the premiums for the poor are subsidised, it is not effective. Hence we need to go well beyond insurance as a means of funding loss and damage moving forward. As we begin debating and discussing this issue prior to COP25 later this year, it is important that all the negotiators, both from developed and developing countries, read the latest scientific findings on this topic in order to reach a sensible decision to be made at the COP on funding loss and damage, going beyond insurance.

Thoroughfares, lanes and bylanes were partially or fully submerged in those areas. At places, human waste and dirt came out of sewers. The Met office said the rain, caused by active monsoon, started Thursday noon and continued with intervals. It is likely to rain in the city in the 48 hours. The office recorded 114mm rain between 6:00am Thursday and 6:00pm yesterday in Dhaka, said meteorologist Abdur Rahman. City planners say it is the inadequate storm-water drainage system, not the rain, that caused the waterlogging. Yesterday was a weekend and those who went out of their homes for various works found themselves in deep trouble. Some of them were seen waiting for public transport in rain while others were wading through ankle-deep or knee-deep filthy waters. The Daily Star correspondents found roads in Rajarbagh, Paltan, Nayapaltan, Motijheel, Karwan Bazar, Mirpur Road, Tejturibazar, Manipuri Para, Kazipara, Senpara, Indira Rood areas and many alleys in old Dhaka inundated. In some of places, the water receded in the afternoon when rain stopped. At places, buses, cars and three-wheelers haphazardly inched forward throughout the day. Many of the vehicles broke down being stuck in water. Traffic policemen, who were manning some important intersections, seemed helpless. The sufferings of the people worsened due to road renovation and construction works of different projects, including Metro Rail, in different parts of the city. On the other hand, rickshaw-puller charged high even for a very short distance, cashing in on the situation. Talking to The Daily Star, Rahman Mia, a service holder, said failing to get any bus, he hired a CNG-run auto-rickshaw from Mirpur-10 to attend a wedding in Dhanmondi. However, the auto-rickshaw broke down in Kazipara area after the vehicle remained stranded in water for some time.  \"I got down in the murky water and hired a rickshaw which took me to Agargaon. From there, I hired another auto-rickshaw and reached the wedding venue in that. I had to spent Tk 500 in total,\" he said, adding that the usual fare would be Tk 200-250. Many city dwellers, using Rokeya Sarani in Kazipara, Senpara where the space of the street has shrunk due to the construction of Metro Rail Project, and Manik Miah Avenue near Dhanmondi-27, had similar experiences. \"This is how we live in the capital. Only a few hours of rain and there is water everywhere,\" said a frustrated Yousuf Hossain, who got drenched after coming out of his home in Dhanmondi to buy some medicines. \"This says all about the drainage system of Dhaka,\" added the man while wading through a flooded road. Habibur Rahman, who lives in Farmgate area, said he had to pay Tk 800 to hire a car to go to Kalyanpur for an emergency work. \"The water stinks. The roads are flooded whenever it rains for a while,\" he said. Many shop-keepers said their businesses were hit hard by the waterlogging. \"Customers don't come unless it's an absolute emergency,\" said Akib Javed, who owns a grocery shop in Indira Road area. Amzad Hossain, a resident of Nazimuddin Road, said, \"We've been facing the problem [waterlogging] during monsoon every year. The authorities had promised us of solving it, but it has not happened yet.\" \"We want a solution. We can't bear it anymore,\" he added."

The event, organised by UNESCO Dhaka, in partnership with Prito Reza Productions, was supported by the Government of the Republic of Korea. It was inaugurated in the presence of Kim Cheol-Sang, Deputy Chief of Mission, Korean Embassy, Sun Lei, Education Specialist, UNESCO Dhaka, Kizzy Tahnin, Programme Officer for Culture, UNESCO Dhaka, and Prito Reza, photographer and curator.  The goal of the event was to promote the photography industry as a creative and cultural sector in Bangladesh, in light of the UNESCO 2005 Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, and as a driver for sustainable development. The focus of the exhibition was to highlight the beauty of Bangladesh, in the landscapes, daily lives of the people, and ethnic and religious diversity. \"An online search for Bangladesh usually brings up pictures of floods or the Rohingya refugees, all bearing negativity,\" said Prito Reza, who was a judge in the competition and the curator of the event. \"We wanted to exhibit the positive aspects of our country - the cultural facet that we're forgetting and the beauty in the simplicity of our people that we often overlook.\"  Other judges of the competition were Munira Morshed Munni, Shafiqul Alam Kiron and Wawi Navarozza. A total of 1,700 entries were submitted for the event, out of which 120 photographs were on exhibit. The photographs at the exhibition were also displayed through digital projector and on canvases. Some pictures were screened through bioscope. They also arranged discussions every day on various issues related to photography. Another attraction of the exhibition was a wall full of envelopes. On one side, the wall was labelled, 'Give what you can' for visitors to write positive messages for other people. The other side read, 'Take what you need', for visitors to pick up pleasant and optimistic messeges from others."

In Cox's Bazar, heavy shower, flash floods and excessive onrush of water in the Matamuhuri, Bakkhali, and Redu rivers were continuing to inundate low-lying areas, submerging houses and disrupting road communications. People of 10 upazilas in Sylhet and Moulvibazar have been hit hard with the flood wreaking havoc on agriculture and fisheries, according to the district administrations. Himangshu Roy, civil surgeon of Sylhet, said 78 medical teams were working in the affected areas to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases. \"I've never been so hungry in my life,\" said Dewntee Malakar, an 80-year-old woman of Tilokpur village in Kulaura of Moulvibazar. Kuddus Mia, 69, of Kaleshar village in the same upazila, said his sons had been without work for the last three weeks. \"We have no job and no food. We have not received any relief yet,\" he said. In some villages, people were struggling due to lack safe water. \"I fear that my two kids may become sick if the water continues to rise and inundates all the tube wells,\" Sohel Ahmed of Bardal said, adding that the tube wells near his house have gone under water. Moin Uddin, of Chandpur village in Sylhet's Fenchuganj, said there was knee-high water in his home which forced his family to sleep on a bed placed on a raised platform of bricks. According to Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre, the water levels of the Surma and the Kushiyara rivers in Sylhet region were dropping. But the flood water would not recede until the rain stops, said Water Development Board officials. \"There had been excessive rain in the Borak valley of Assam in India recently, causing the Kushiara to swell,\" said Sirajul Islam, an executive engineer of the Water Development Board in Sylhet, adding that the river was flowing 98cm above the danger level in Sewla point. Mamunur Rashid, deputy director of Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in Sylhet division, said crops on 5,400 hectares of land was damaged. Rahat Anwar, deputy commissioner of Sylhet said the administration has been distributing relief to the affected people. Tofail Islam, deputy commissioner of Moulvibazar said 294 tonnes of rice and 49,200 VGF cards have already been distributed among the affected. Around 1,000 houses in different villages of Chakaria including Shaharbil, Koiarbil, Kakara, Boroitoli, Demushia were submerged. Chairman Jafar Alam of Chakaria upazila told our Cox's Bazar correspondent that there were not enough relief materials. The authorities closed Ramu-Naikkhangchhari, Ramu-Marichha, Eidgaon-Jalalabad roads on Wednesday. Around 700 houses in Cox's Bazar sadar have been surrounded by water while some 500 houses in five unions of Ukhia went under water. \"The heavy rains are causing serious damage,\" said Main Uddin, upazila nirbahi officer of Ukhia.

The dead were identified as Atal Barua, 52, from Chattogram's Raozan Upazila, and Suihlau Marma, 42, from Karigor Para area in Kaptai. The injured was Aungchahla Marma, 45, from Bandarban. The incident took place when a 60-foot hilltop collapsed on the Rang-amati-Rajastoli-Bandarban link road around 11:30am, police said quoting locals. Atal and the caretaker of his fruit orchard Suihlau were waiting for transport in the area. As they signalled a CNG-run auto-rickshaw to stop, the landslide occurred and the two were buried deep into the mud. The CNG driver, however, jumped out of the way in time to survive. Locals and police searched for the two under the mud to try and rescue them. They were found dead after a 30-minute search, police said.  Injured Aungchahla Marma said he and three others were in a CNG-run auto-rickshaw, when Atal and Suihlau signalled the CNG to stop. \"Just when the driver stopped the vehicle, the huge chunk of Earth collapsed. We all ran quickly, but I injured myself.\" He later took treatment at a dispensary in the area, he said. Visiting the spot, this correspondent saw about a 100-feet of debris and mud from the landslide on the road. Some vehicles there were buried under mud. The Rangamati-Rajastoli-Bandarban road was shut off after the incident, said Asharaf Ahmed Rassel, upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) of Kaptai. Many commuters were seen getting off their vehicles and walking on foot. Speaking to The Daily Star, Ujjal Das said his was at a tea-stall with some others when they heard someone screaming. When they ran to the spot, they saw that the landslide had just occurred. He then tried to rescue the victims along with other locals and police. Members of the BGB, with the help of locals, conducted a rescue oper-ation at the spot, said Muhammad Ashraf Uddin, officer-in-charge (OC) of Chandroghona Police Station. \"The two dead bodies were handed over to the families,\" he said. Earlier on July 8, two died in landslide in the upazila's KPM area.  Meanwhile in Chattogram city, at least four people, including a child, were injured in two separate landslides triggered by heavy rainfall in the port city yesterday. The incidents occurred at the city's Khulshi and Baizid areas. In Khulshi, the injured were Rehena Begum, 35, and her daughter Nusrat Jahan, 3, from Kushumbag Abashik area. In Baizid, Musammat Shanu, 40, and Morjina Begum, 18, from Arefin Nagar, were injured in the landslide. Musammat told The Daily Star that she lives in her shanty at Jhor-nar Mar Khamar of Arefin Nagar on a hill-slope adjacent to Chattogram Cantonment. \"I was cooking lunch when I suddenly heard a loud bang and I fell under mud,\" she said, adding that her home was completely flattened in the landslide Later, a team from the Bangladesh Army from the cantonment, along with fire service, rescued them from the mud, she added. Jashim Uddin, deputy director of Chattogram Divisional Fire Service and Civil Defence, said they rescued all four victims of the two landslides. They were sent to CMCH with moderate injuries, he added. (Our Chattogram correspondent contributed to this report.)"

      "text": "The overall flood situation in Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Sirajganj and Jamalpur districts has worsened further following the gushing water from the upstream and incessant rains. The floodwaters have inundated fresh areas of the four districts, halting academic activities at hundreds of educational institutions. According to reports reaching the UNB desk, the water levels of all the rivers, including Brahmaputra, Teesta, Dharla, Jamuna and Dudhkumar in the three districts continued to rise due to the onrush of water and heavy downpour. The flood hit more than one lakh people in four upazilas of Lalmonirhat, over 1.7 lakh people of 250 villages under five upazilas of Kurigram, more than one lakh people in Sirajganj district and one lakh inhabitants in Jamalpur. In Lalmonirhat, over one lakh people of the Teesta basin were trapped in floodwaters. At least 36 villages of 16 unions under Hatibandha, Kaliganj, Aditmari and Sadar upazilas remained under water for the past four days. The water of the Teesta River was flowing 30 cm above the danger level at Kulaghat point while five cm lower from the red mark at Doani point on Wednesday morning. Thousands of families were marooned under floodwaters as embankments in Kutirpar area in Aditmari upazila broke down. Water development board Dalia division Executive Engineer Mostafizur Rahman said the flow of water has decreased slightly as India closed 10 gates of its Gojaldoba Barrage. To control the water, the Teesta Barrage Authorities have opened all gates of the barrage at Dalia point, according to sources at the local office of Bangladesh Water Development Board. The flood-affected people were suffering much for lack of pure drinking water, sanitation, food and shelters. State Minister for Social Welfare Ministry Nuruzzaman Ahmed has distributed relief goods among 400 flood victims of Char Bairati area this morning. But most of the sufferers in 63 chars got no government relief, many of them claimed. In Kurigram, fresh areas went under water due to the increase in water levels of all the rivers, including the Brahmaputra, Teesta, Dharla and Dudhkumar. The Brahmaputra was flowing 32 cm above the danger level at Chilmari point while the Dharala 25 cm above the danger mark at the Bridge point. More than 1.7 lakh people of over 250 villages, including chars of 35 unions, under Ulipur, Chilmari, Roumari, Rajibpur, Nageshwari and Sadar upazilas were hit hard by the flood. The scarcity of food and pure drinking water has turned acute in the flood-affected areas. Waterborne diseases were spreading fast in the flood-hit areas while no relief or medicine reached the victims yet. More than 150 educational institutions were shut down following the flood, locals said, adding that 771 hectares of cropland were inundated. Deputy Commissioner of Kurigram Abu Saleh Mohammad Ferdous Khan said some 2250 tonnes of rice and Tk 5 lakh in cash were allocated for the flood-affected people. \"All preparations have been taken to face the flood situation.\" he said. In Sirajganj, the flood situation in five upazilas -- Kazipur, Shahzadpur, Belkuchi, Chouhali and Sadar - has taken a serious turn following the rise in water level of the Jamuna River, worsening the woes of the flood-affected people. Fresh areas went under water as the Jamuna water was flowing 63 cm above the red mark at 9:00 am Wednesday. Several hundred acres of cropland were inundated by the floodwater. In Jamalpur, six unions of Islampur, Dewanganj, Madarganj and Sarishabari upazilas newly went under water as the Jamuna River was flowing 78 cm above the danger level at Bahadurabad Ghat point. Besides, 77 hectares of seedbeds, 133 hectares of Aus paddy and 449 hectares of vegetable fields were inundated by the floodwaters in Islampur, Dewanganj and Sarishabari upazilas, said Abu Hanif, training officer at the local Department of Agricultural Extension office. The local administration has, meanwhile, allocated 130 tonnes of rice, Tk 2.2 lakh in cash and 2,000 dry foods for the flood-hit people in four upazilas of the district. Seventy seven medical teams have been formed so far, said Civil Surgeon Dr Md Mushair-ul-Islam (Ratan) adding that a team is working in each union. District Education Officer (Secondary) of Jamalpur Mokhlesur Rahman said second terminal examinations have been postponed at 29 high schools and madrasas in six upazilas of the district. Moreover, some 119 government primary schools were declared shut down in the six upazila for flood waters, said district primary education officer Md Shahidul Islam.  "

      "text": "A friend enquired whether the four horsemen of death, famine, war and conquest are anywhere to be seen given the current pestilence followed by the recent fires, floods and exodus of millions. Set aside the religious connotation, it is generally agreed that we are globally experiencing an existential threat. The present lockdown offers us the opportunity to reflect on our immediate future.  Here are some thoughts. On April 10, the world recorded nearly 1.6 million corona infections, 95,000 deaths and 3,55,000 recoveries. The US leads, followed by Spain, Italy, France, Germany, China and others. The trend is somewhat exponential and there is no WHO-approved remedy in sight, except that people are advised to practice physical distancing. Based on Chinese and Korean experience, the epidemiologists believe that such a practice reduces the degree of spread of the virus allowing the health service providers to cope with the crisis. \"Save Lives\" has become a de-facto global goal for all. Corona has become the ultimate leveler--education, wealth, social standing, colour, religion, ethnicity, gender, and nationality hardly matter.   Compared to China, Europe and America the South Asian countries seem fortunate but these are early days, and there is no room for complacency. Some South East Asian countries (e.g., South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore) may have deflected COVID-19 reasonably well. South Asia and others should learn from the South East Asian experience. Figures from John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center give us a global real-time snapshot, and Bangladesh's situation looks favourable compared to many other countries, if the figures are reliable--61 infections, 6 deaths and 26 recovered (April, 4). The Government of Bangladesh have demonstrated its commitment to face this pandemic with courage and the prime minister has announced policies for the poor, businesses and general population to withstand the expected fallout of COVID-19. The citizens wholeheartedly support the government's guidance. The armed forces have stepped in to support the civil administration, which has been welcomed generally. Notwithstanding the figures on Bangladesh, there are some serious concerns and they need to be reviewed.   Assumptions It appears that Bangladesh's situation is subject to a series of assumptions.  They are: First, all COVID-19-like symptoms-affected people have been tested. This pre-supposes that people with such symptoms sought medical care and they were subsequently sent to appropriate medical facilities. Second, all deaths (not registered as Corona-induced) with symptoms like cough, fever, difficulty breathing, pneumonia in both lungs (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coro...) have been tested. This pre-supposes that all people who have died recently and had corona-like symptoms sought medical help and their samples were sent for effective testing. Third, people, who have been socially together with the \"positive\" tested persons (alive or dead) have also been tested. This pre-supposes that the health officials kept an eye on these people.  Fourth, those who were tested \"positive\", effectively practiced physical distancing at home and outside. This pre-supposes that these people and their family members have practiced physical distancing. Fifth, the testing kits used were reliable. Given that certain brands of the kits were proved ineffective in Spain and Italy, this pre-supposes that we undertook quality control before using such kits. Sixth, the personnel using the kits are skilled enough to understand the instructions. This also pre-supposes that the users fully understood the instructions. Recently, the Chinese suppliers have cautioned users about it. The question is whether these assumptions hold in the case of Bangladesh. If any one of the assumptions don't, the aforementioned data given for Bangladesh are unlikely to reflect the true picture. It will be true of other countries, let alone Bangladesh. Therefore, it is realistic to assume that there are untested corona cases in Bangladesh, which are and will remain potential sources of COVID-19 spread. The return of numerous hardworking migrant workers to their villages using overpacked transport could be one of many such sources of dissemination of COVID-19. In addition, prayer congregations in mosques, temples and churches could be another potential source. In order to pursue \"Save Lives\" goal we need to understand our situation in the context of four-stage framework. Stage-1 (imported cases of COVID-19, which are relatively easily traceable); stage-2 (imported cases and transmission within family and friends, which can still be traceable); stage-3 (community is affected, which becomes untraceable); and stage-4 (mass scale infection, which becomes a serious public health threat). Where are we now? Most likely we are still in stage-2.   In stage-2, Bangladesh's livelihood environment will start to become insecure.  As in other countries, unemployment will increase, food availability will become problematic, health infrastructure will face severe stress, and due to prolonged lockdown people will look for \"escape routes\" putting law enforcing agencies under huge challenge and scrutiny, businesses will face liquidity crisis and supply chains will be threatened. If the period of lockdown is increased, which is quite likely, the transition to stage-3 will take the stage-2 factors to an even more acute level. The \"Save Lives\" goal requires an inter-related system of four strategies, they are:   Strategies First strategy: Ensure a smooth food supply chain for all. Assuming that Bangladesh doesn't have a strategic food reserve of more than a season, we must ensure access to suitable (macro and micronutrient) and sufficient food for all. This pre-supposes that the food is available. Under current reality, importation of food might be difficult, as there will be a \"me-first\" policy adopted across the world. Therefore, domestic production must get absolute priority. The farming population should be protected by any means to safeguard agricultural production. In addition, the agricultural land presently not used for other purposes, e.g., housing, should be used for cultivation. In France, the urban educated class is responding to calls of the farmers to work in the field.  Special care should be given to children, expectant and nursing mothers and adolescents under the motto \"save our future\". The food supply and distribution should be handled in the most cost-effective, cost-efficient and equitable manner. Community-Based Programmes with the participation of local government, army, civil society and police should ensure that the food delivery is made to all families. The government could contemplate reducing gasoline price given the fall of petroleum price in the international market.  A general Food-for-Work Programme may be initiated for those who will assist the farmers. The farmers should have easy access to all agricultural input-support and expertise. The government should consider importation of food grains to establish a strategic food reserve as part of mid to long-term plan to avoid crisis in the future.  Second strategy: Ensure corona-specific health services. Regarding Health Services, Bangladesh can just pursue \"Follow the Leader\" approach. Other than experts, such as, WHO, Bangladesh can seek information and advisory support from countries, which are experiencing and managing the corona carnage and have already gathered together valuable lessons. Second, the Bangladeshi diaspora, who are actively involved in the health care system in many countries, are sharing their advice on social media. They should be approached for guidance. Third, the transformation of hospitals into \"Corona Care Units\" should happen without disbanding other emergency services. In addition to support for physical health, provisions should be made for mental health.  Whatever time we have should be utilised most effectively before the window shuts. It is a race against time. Third strategy: Ensure a congenial social, legal and institutional ecosystem.  The \"Save Lives\" goal can only be achieved if the activities occur under a favourable governance environment. If the Corona crisis prevails for another month or more, the business sector will be in crisis. Job and income losses, and fall of remittance are likely immediate impacts, challenging the livelihood of others. These factors will force people to break out of self-isolation in an attempt to find other options to survive. This could create a serious law and order crisis, and thus undermine country's peace and security. Therefore, a concerted government effort is required, which will bring together all the main societal stakeholders. In order to save lives our approach should be to unite and work together irrespective of party affiliation, religion, ethnicity, professional strata and economic standing. Failing to do so will result in social injustice and greater fragility within our society. Fourth strategy: Devise a gradual exit strategy from the present lockdown situation. While the country prepares for a possible stage-3 situation and a possible extension of the present lockdown, we also need to plan an exit strategy. The government may engage various working groups led by experts, practitioners, academics and scientists, who will craft strategies to explore opportunities in the post-corona environment. Revival of export market, rebuilding of the business sector, export-friendly currency and monetary policy, introduction of the post-corona safety net for the affected population, restructuring of the public health service delivery, and pro-people governance. We are experiencing a unique event--a global pandemic--and this calls for a new but immediate partnership among the private, public and non-profit sectors.  Uncoordinated approach to this once-in-a-lifetime challenge will cause irreparable damage. This has to be avoided at all costs as the pandemic can easily become a spiralling cycle of destruction given our existing fragilities. On the other hand, the corona crisis can be an opportunity to transform and create a \"new Bangladesh\", which will empower all its citizens to re-embrace the freedom of independence on our 50th anniversary in 2021.

Parkash held discussions with Bangladesh Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal in Dhaka on the government's preparedness for mitigating any potential outbreak -- and its economic impact --according to a press statement by the ADB. \"The government of Bangladesh has requested ADB to provide assistance to help tackle the challenges of a COVID-19 outbreak in the country,\" said Parkash. \"As a long-standing development partner, ADB is committed to assist Bangladesh in this difficult time.\" \"We have initiated the process of quickly exploring the financing modality and other details in close coordination with the government and other stakeholders,\" he added. The global public health emergency, which has been characterised by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic, calls for urgent measures to respond to the disease as well as tackling its economic fallout. ADB has recently announced a $6.5 billion initial package to address the immediate needs of its developing member countries as they respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. ADB's previous responses to COVID-19 include $200 million made available through ADB's Supply Chain Finance Programme for companies manufacturing and distributing medicines and other items needed to combat the pandemic. ADB's response to date also includes $2 million announced on February 7 to enhance detection, prevention, and response in China and the Greater Mekong Subregion; another $2 million announced on February 26 to support response in all its developing members; and an $18.6 million private-sector loan, signed on February 25, to the Wuhan, PRC-based pharmaceutical distributor Jointown Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd. to support the continued supply of essential medicines and personal protective equipment. Another grant of $600,000 was provided to Sri Lanka on March 13. ADB has a strong track record of responding rapidly to provide targeted support to Bangladesh in times of emergencies, including natural disasters like floods and cyclones and other situations like the influx of Rohingyas in Cox's Bazar camps from across the Myanmar border."

      "text": "Haradhan Dey along with his elderly mother, wife and two children has been surviving on biscuits and dry foods for the past five days. \"No one has come to help us...we have not yet received any relief,\" said the local of Dulal Member Bari area in Chattogram's Raozan. Haradhan's family is one of 30 families marooned for five days in the waterlogged area. Many of them have not got any aid so far. Their predicament is similar to those of many others affected by the floods ravaging through the country. Stranded in waterlogged areas, many victims remain unemployed, with little access to food and drinking water, a situation compounded by insufficient relief.    According to data from the ministry, there has been an allocation of Tk 3.37 crores, 22,350 of tonnes rice, 91,000 packets dry food, 7,500 sets of tents and 1,000 bundles of tin for flood-hit people across the country. The number of such people is around 21 lakh. Md Shah Kamal, senior secretary of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, said the government arranged sufficient relief materials for those \"who really needed it\".  \"There are many flood-hit families, who are financially affluent. They don't want to take relief. But those affected people, who are poor, are entitled to the relief,\" he told The Daily Star last night.  While the allocation is there on paper, our correspondents from different districts, however, found an insufficiency of relief materials. \"We did not get any relief. Rather, we have seen that many affluent families have got it,\" said Hazrat Ali,58, a flood victim in Gobordhan village near the Teesta River basin in Aditmari upazila of Lalmonirhat. \"Around 1,200 families in our union have been hit by flood. But only 235 families have got relief materials,\" said Matiar Rahman Mati, a member of Mahish Khocha union parishad in the upazila. \"We got only 10kg rice since the floods came a week ago. How can we survive on this,\" said Abdul Jobbar, a day labourer of Sunoi village under Kalmakanda upazila of Netrokona, another area where few have got relief. In Mymensingh, Md Rafiqul Islam, chairman of Pogla union, said he had so far distributed only five tonnes of rice and 60 packets of dry foods among 500 families. The number of affected families, however, is 4,000. In yet another instance of insufficient relief, only five families out of the 50 sheltering at Kaliralga village under sadar upazila of Kurigram got 10kgs of rice while the rest got packets of dry food, and some flattened rice and sugar, Abdul Mannan, a flood victim said. In Nilphamari, Moinul Islam, chairman of Tepa Kharibari union in Dimla upazila, said the actual number of flood-hit families in the union was around 1,680. But the upazila administration had enlisted only 880 for relief. Allegations against the authorities tasked with relief distribution is rife in many other areas.  \"They [authorities] announced to give 20kg rice to each affected families. But they are now giving us 10kg,\" said Tong Pray Mro, a resident of Sualok union under sadar upazila of Bandarban. \"My name was not enlisted. That is why, I did not get any relief after visiting the relief distributing centre in the past three days,\" said Mya Nu Prue Marma, 57, a resident of Bakichhara village of Bandarban. Contacted, the Bandarban relief and rehabilitation officer said 450 metric tonnes of rice and Tk7.50 lakhs had been allotted for 9,242 flood-affected families of Bandarban. Of this, 210 metric tonnes of rice and 5.75 lakh taka had already been distributed. TWO KIDS DROWN IN FLOODWATER \n In Tangail, two children drowned in the flood at Kalihati upazila yesterday. The deceased are Tanjila, 8, and her younger sister Lima, 5. Anwar Hossain Pramanik, chairman of Durgapur union parishad, said Tanjila, a grade-three student and Lima, a grade-one student of a local primary school, were swept by a sudden current of water near their house and went missing in the morning. Later, their bodies were found floating nearby at around 2:00pm, he said. TRAIN COMMUNICATION SNAPPED Train communications in some routes, including Jamalpur-Dwarnganj and Santahar-Lalmonirhat, remain halted due to flood, said a press release of the Bangladesh Railway."

      "text": "Floodwater has washed away fish worth Tk 9 crore from 2436 ponds in Sylhet division while rainwater has submerged the hanging bridge over Kaptai Lake in Rangamati. Persistent heavy rain and onrush of water from upstream have swelled local haors and rivers in Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Habiganj and Sylhet districts, reports our Moulvibazar correspondent. Flash floods triggered by heavy rain have washed away fish worth Tk 9 crore from the ponds on 356 hectares of land in the four districts, said Sultan Ahmed, deputy director of the Department of Fisheries in Sylhet division. Of the districts, Sunamganj was severely hit by the floods this year. Fish of 1169 ponds have been washed away by the floodwater, causing a huge loss to hundreds of farmers in 10 upazilas of Sunamganj. The affected fish farmers claimed that the loss would be over Tk 5 crore, said Sunamganj District Fisheries Officer Aminul Haque. Fish of at least 336 ponds in Biswambharpur, 286 in Sadar, 41 in Derai, 77 in Chhatak, 23 in Dharampasa, 20 in Tahirpur, 71 in Jagannathpur, 134 in Dakkhin Sunamganj, 68 in Jamalganj and 113 in Dowarabazar upazila were washed away by floodwater. Farmer Helal Mia of Salukabad union in Bishwambharpur said his pond was the breeding ground of carp fish. The fish worth Tk 30,000 were washed away by floods, he said. Jahangir Kabir of Sreepur area in Tahirpur upazila said fish of his pond on 10 acres of land were washed away by floodwater. The market price of the fish was Tk 11 lakh. Bishwambharpur Upazila Fisheries Officer Mehedi Hasan Bhuiya said they sent a list of affected fish farmers to the authorities concerned. Bishwambharpur Upazila Nirbahi Officer Samir Biswas said the government will give financial support to enlisted destitute farmers. In Rangamati, the hanging bridge over Kaptai Lake in the district has been inundated with rise of water level in the lake, compelling the authorities concerned to suspend movement of all the tourists and local people on the bridge from Tuesday, reports our correspondent. Heavy downpour and an onrush of water from upstream led to the rise in water level, Srijon Bikash Barua, manager at Rangamati office of Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation (BPC). The bridge goes under water during the rainy season every year, he said. Considering public safety, BPC and local administration suspended movement over the bridge from Tuesday evening, said the manager. Around 1,200 people of about 175 families living on Dewanpara Island in Kaptai Lake near the bridge are stranded as it is their only link with the mainland. In the absence of water transport, they cannot even go to the market, said locals. \"We have been facing a lot of problems after the bridge was closed. Now we have managed an engine boat for daily movement and the students are facing a lot for the movement of 200-foot-long waterways,\" said Suman Chakma, 35, a resident of Dewanpara village. The bridge will reopen after renovation of the bridge and decrease in water level, said the official."

      "text": "Love, for the soil and the soul, is a muse for renowned artist, Dr Farida Zaman. Having taken tutelage from legendary artist K G Subramanyan, she has travelled around numerous idyllic places of Bangladesh, soulfully depicting them in paintings with diverse themes. The artist's 8th solo art exhibition titled, For the Love of Country will take place tomorrow at Nalini Kanta Bhattasali Gallery of Bangladesh National Museum at 6 pm, complete with a book launch on the artist. The exclusive exhibition, showcasing an array of paintings, installation and text, will remain open till December 11. Mohammad Wahiduzzman and Zeenat Ikramullahare are the curators of the show, which will shed light on Farida's five-decade journey. Eminent artist Mostafa Monowar will inaugurate the exhibition as chief guest. Julia Niblett, Australian High Commissioner in Bangladesh, will grace the occasion as special guest. Professor Shamsuzzaman Khan, Chairman, Bangladesh National Museum; novelist Selina Hossain, litterateur Professor Syed Manzoorul Islam and author Martin Bradley, will attend the event as guest of honours. Photo: Sheikh Mehedi Morshed\n A noticeable feature of the artist's works is the depiction of riverine life in Bangladesh. Her works articulate the lives of fishermen. Farida Zaman's line drawings represent one of her main artistic traits. The dancing lines, dots and various familiar forms are inspired by Bangladeshi folk elements. Art critic Martin Bradley has written the book on Dr Farida Zaman, as it delves into the personal aspects of her life influencing her work. \"That house, those surroundings, the fish-filled ponds, lakes, the towering coconut trees, the frequent floods, and the fishing nets have all become central themes to Farida's recollections, and have evolved as memes, icons and symbols in many of her paintings,\" writes Martin in the book.     Farida Zaman's artistic career demonstrates a remarkable versatility in expression and creative inspiration. The exhibition is a powerful testimony of her integrity and conviction as an artist. Paintings have always been a natural instinct of her artistic soul and an important element that has constructed her creative spirit. Born in Chandpur in 1953, Dr Farida Zaman is also an illustrator, who has designed several thousand book covers. The seasoned artist has received many awards and honours, including a cultural award from Australian government and the Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy Gold Medal. "

      "text": "    What is Jhenaidah known for? Sadly, the answer that comes first is 'suicide'. According to the latest data from the World Health Organisation (WHO), Bangladesh witnesses six incidents of suicide for every 100,000 people (as of 2016). However, according to data from the offices of the civil surgeon and police superintendent, the suicide rate is 22 for every 100,000 people in Jhenaidah district. WHO data also shows that an average of 28 people take their own lives across the country every day, while Jhenaidah alone marks an average of one death every day. What are the reasons behind such an alarming rate of suicide in Jhenaidah? According to statistics from the local authorities, a total of 1,820 people have committed suicide between 2014 to 2018 in Jhenaidah. The number of people attempting suicide in these years is 12,536. Star Weekend spoke to 10 survivors and family members of people who committed suicide in the area in an attempt to understand this disturbing phenomenon. The responses from the survivors were eye-opening.  Take the example of Parvin Akter, a housewife of Dhananjoypur village of Jhenaidah Sadar upazila, who attempted suicide thrice. 27 years back, 11-year-old Parvin was married off to an illiterate and unemployed landless man. Her in-laws all lived at her husband's maternal uncle's house. He would keep busy the whole day with cards and gambling, she says. Parvin's father's financial condition wasn't enough for them to provide a dowry to the groom, which is why Parvin's husband and her in-laws soon started torturing her. There wasn't a day that went by, she says, when her husband or in-laws didn't beat her. But since there was no option of going back to her poor parents, Parvin stayed. \"They didn't allow me to eat properly or buy me a sari, let alone give me any money. I had to do all the household work and work in the fields to please them. The next year, I gave birth to my first son. I can still remember that after finishing the household chores, I would work in people's houses, carrying my son, but that too, didn't save me from their severe beatings and verbal abuse. With no other way, I hung myself from the ceiling, but I was saved--luckily or unluckily, I don't know which to say,\" explains Parvin. After giving birth to her second son, one day while she was in the bathroom, a small fire broke out, in which her youngest son received severe burns, eventually losing his right hand. His treatment at the hospital, understandably, required a great deal of money. \"After that incident, I was called evil and their beatings increased. I had no wish to live in this world. I took it for granted that my life has no meaning. There is nobody to share my sadness; I could not show the scars on my body to anyone. It was then that I tried to commit suicide again, twice. I'm still struggling to find meaning in this life,\" she adds. Parvin represents one of the many women who attempted to, or committed, suicide due to the physical, mental or economic abuse they suffer in their domestic life. According to data from the civil surgeon's office, a total of 1,086 women committed suicide in the six upazilas of Jhenaidah district between 2014 and 2018. Another 9,373 women attempted suicide in this four-year period.   \n \nAccording to the local NGOs, human rights organisations, and the only suicide prevention NGO in Jhenaidah, Society for Voluntary Association (SOVA--the only NGO working for preventing suicide in Jhenaidah district), the main reasons behind these suicides is the violence and torture they endure as a result of polygamy, dowry, child marriage, drug addiction of their husbands, and domestic conflicts. According to BRAC's local office, they receive an average of 50 VAW-related complaints every month at their eight legal aid units in Jhenaidah.\nZahidul Islam, the CEO of SOVA, says that women are treated particularly badly here. \"I hear many people saying that women commit suicide for silly reasons, such as her husband didn't buy her a sari or didn't bring sweetmeats from the market,\" he says. \"They do not look for the deeper reasons. They never talk about the constant torture, deprivation, and disrespect women face for years. Rather, they talk about the triggers, and make a mockery of the whole thing,\" adds Islam.\nOther survivors also echoed a similar experience. Aleya Begum, another woman living in the area, also attempted suicide thrice. Similar to Parvin, she was married to an illiterate, unemployed man at the age of seven. She gave birth to her two daughters by the age of 13, and her physical condition worsened and she became unable to walk. Her husband, who was now farming on another's land, did not take this well. Their poverty and now his wife's inability to 'please' him, in her words, led to violence in the household.\n\"I remember that every day was like hell. I was not in a physical condition to tolerate the severe beatings and abuse anymore. I took poison twice and tried to hang myself once,\" says Aleya.\n30-year-old Shahina Akter has a similar story--an early marriage and poverty leading to domestic violence and eventually, her attempting suicide.\nStar Weekend contacted Sharifa Khatun, director of local human rights NGO Welfare Efforts (WE) that has been working in the area since 1993. \"From my viewpoint and experience, I have seen that only a few women in Jhenaidah town have the ability to choose a career and/or forge their own identity. But if we look at the grassroots villages of Jhenaidah, even today, women there have limited opportunities to go outside the home and earn money. Before getting married, girls are dependent on their parents and after marriage, on their husband or in-laws. The husbands usually don't allow them to leave the home without their permission. These women also lack the minimum ability to make a decision about family affairs. This is why, any kind of violence is inevitable in such family settings,\" she says.\nThe only baseline survey in the area, conducted by SOVA in 2005, titled Surveillance and Reduction of Women's Suicidal Trends in Jhenidah: A Hot Spot with High Suicide Rate in Bangladesh, showed that around 80 percent women who committed and attempted suicide were housewives--44.7 percent of whom had no formal education, 15.8 percent had primary and 39.5 percent had secondary education.\nThe survey also showed that young people between the ages of 11 and 30 were more vulnerable to suicide. According to the Bangladesh national portal, the average life expectancy of the people in Jhenaidah district is 69 years.\nStar Weekend also delved into the reasons for men in the district committing suicide. According to SOVA's volunteers, locals, and family members of the deceased, major reasons for their suicides are the men's failure to meet financial needs of the family, relationship troubles, extramarital relationships, and chronic illnesses. According to the survey, 43 percent of suicide attempts were by farmers. Islam, who conducted the survey, and his volunteers say that they found the main reason behind men's suicide to be family feuds due to financial problems.\nFor instance, Jesmin Akter says her husband Rezaul Islam hung himself when he was going through great losses in his wholesale business of selling paddy and jute. \"My husband was a farmer all his life. But four years back, he saved some money to set up a business and in a short time span, ran up debts of Tk 300,000. Four months ago, he also had an accident which led to head injuries. Since then, he had been tense as people were coming to our house and asking for the money,\" she says.\n\"That morning, I went to drop my son at school, after finishing breakfast together. On coming home, I found him hanging from the ceiling. If he was given proper care and mental strength, I'm sure he wouldn't have done this. My mother-in-law [Jobeda Begum] died by taking poison 20 years ago, to escape a family conflict due to poor financial condition,\" says Jesmin.\nStar Weekend spoke to Dr Anisur Rahman Khan, assistant professor at the department of sociology at East West University, who did his post-doctoral research on masculinity and suicide in Bangladesh. He chose to work in the district of Jhenaidah due to the high rate of suicide and did in-depth interviews with the family members of people who committed or attempted to commit suicide. Dr Rahman focused on the social factors linked with the suicide of men--financial instability was found to be the cause for several cases.\nThe income range of the families of the 20 male suicide subjects he worked on was between Tk 7,000 and Tk 20,000. \"Since the men need to meet the socially prescribed responsibility of the sole breadwinner, this often instigates them to commit suicide when they fail to perfectly carry out the role. They try to escape, considering suicide to be the solution to their problems,\" says Dr Rahman.\nWhy do people in Jhenaidah commit suicide?\nWhile suicide is not unusual in almost every district in Bangladesh, it is to yet to be discovered why Jhenaidah is a hotspot.\nLocal administration, and even the NGOs working there, seem to think that the people of Jhenaidah are very \"emotional\" and \"not hardy\". \"The area is free from any kind of natural disasters--floods, river erosion, cyclones or tornadoes. People in this region have less capability to endure difficult conditions. They get emotional easily,\" says WE director Sharifa Khatun.\nAnalysing incidents of the people who died of, or attempted suicide, shows that a culture of acceptance has developed in the district, normalising the issue. Dr Rahman, who stayed in Jhenaidah for two months, says that if you walk 100 metres in the area, you will find a family where people have attempted or committed suicide. Although epidemiological studies demonstrate a significantly higher risk of suicidal behaviour among family members of suicide victims and attempters, suicide awareness and prevention campaigns have not taken off in the area.\n \n\n\n \n\"It is saddening that law enforcers even make mockery of death due to suicide. I heard once that a police officer was making fun of saying which upazila stood 'first' in suicide. This is so disappointing. It needs massive social change,\" says Islam. \"In fact, hospitals don't have the proper resources to address the patients for treating the suicide attempters. The bodies are washed outside the hospitals in front of everyone.\"\nBesides, in an area where most families are involved in farming and agriculture, the easy availability and unsafe storage of insecticides is a major issue. Last year, a total of 1,794 people committed suicide by taking poison, while 2,284 attempted suicide.\nWhy does Jhenaidah get no attention?\nDespite having the highest suicide rate in the country--22 per 100,000 --Jhenaidah does not have a proper preventive method to address the issue. The deputy commissioner and the district women's affairs officer acknowledge that they don't have adequate measures to address suicide. People don't have any mechanism to report a suicidal friend or family member, say the survivors and the family members of the deceased.\nDespite the fact that there is a 2014 directive from the Prime Minister to establish an institution in Jhenaidah dedicated to studying suicides to find a way to resolve them, the project has yet to see the light of day. Also, the largest 100-bed Jhenaidah Sadar hospital has no post for a psychologist, let alone the upazila health complexes. There are a few private hospitals that have some guest doctors, but those remain inaccessible to those most prone to suicides.\nAccording to the deputy commissioner Saroj Kumar Nath, the government is aware of the high suicide rate. \"In recent times, the rate has reduced due to different campaigns in schools and colleges. The SOVA is working on organising anti-suicidal programmes to aware people.  Besides, the scope of jobs and work has also increased in the district,\" he says.\nBut these are not the responsibilities of NGOs alone. According to locals and several school teachers, the programmes the DC was talking about cannot be counted as significant enough to address such a critical issue. \"Just talking about suicide in a programme cannot prevent suicide. The government is doing nothing to address the root causes,\" says A Rahman, a teacher at a government high school of Kaliganj upazila of Jhenaidah.\nIslam believes that the people who are at risk need one-on-one counseling because they are less likely to open up in a group about why they want to commit suicide. \"A helpline service will also not work there, as a large number of women don't possess mobile phones or internet connections, or are not allowed to use cell phones. There must be something sustainable that doesn't end after a project ends. And this is why the government has to come forward,\" he stresses.\n\"A death a day can never be normal.\" \n \nIllustrations: Nahfia Jahan Monni\nInfographic: Shaer Reaz\n \n \n   According to the local NGOs, human rights organisations, and the only suicide prevention NGO in Jhenaidah, Society for Voluntary Association (SOVA--the only NGO working for preventing suicide in Jhenaidah district), the main reasons behind these suicides is the violence and torture they endure as a result of polygamy, dowry, child marriage, drug addiction of their husbands, and domestic conflicts.

Also, the largest 100-bed Jhenaidah Sadar hospital has no post for a psychologist, let alone the upazila health complexes. There are a few private hospitals that have some guest doctors, but those remain inaccessible to those most prone to suicides.\nAccording to the deputy commissioner Saroj Kumar Nath, the government is aware of the high suicide rate. \"In recent times, the rate has reduced due to different campaigns in schools and colleges. The SOVA is working on organising anti-suicidal programmes to aware people.  Besides, the scope of jobs and work has also increased in the district,\" he says.\nBut these are not the responsibilities of NGOs alone. According to locals and several school teachers, the programmes the DC was talking about cannot be counted as significant enough to address such a critical issue. \"Just talking about suicide in a programme cannot prevent suicide.

There must be something sustainable that doesn't end after a project ends. And this is why the government has to come forward,\" he stresses.\n\"A death a day can never be normal.\" \n \nIllustrations: Nahfia Jahan Monni\nInfographic: Shaer Reaz\n \n \n Star Weekend also delved into the reasons for men in the district committing suicide. According to SOVA's volunteers, locals, and family members of the deceased, major reasons for their suicides are the men's failure to meet financial needs of the family, relationship troubles, extramarital relationships, and chronic illnesses. According to the survey, 43 percent of suicide attempts were by farmers. Islam, who conducted the survey, and his volunteers say that they found the main reason behind men's suicide to be family feuds due to financial problems. For instance, Jesmin Akter says her husband Rezaul Islam hung himself when he was going through great losses in his wholesale business of selling paddy and jute. \"My husband was a farmer all his life. But four years back, he saved some money to set up a business and in a short time span, ran up debts of Tk 300,000. Four months ago, he also had an accident which led to head injuries. Since then, he had been tense as people were coming to our house and asking for the money,\" she says. \"That morning, I went to drop my son at school, after finishing breakfast together. On coming home, I found him hanging from the ceiling. If he was given proper care and mental strength, I'm sure he wouldn't have done this. My mother-in-law [Jobeda Begum] died by taking poison 20 years ago, to escape a family conflict due to poor financial condition,\" says Jesmin. Star Weekend spoke to Dr Anisur Rahman Khan, assistant professor at the department of sociology at East West University, who did his post-doctoral research on masculinity and suicide in Bangladesh. He chose to work in the district of Jhenaidah due to the high rate of suicide and did in-depth interviews with the family members of people who committed or attempted to commit suicide. Dr Rahman focused on the social factors linked with the suicide of men--financial instability was found to be the cause for several cases. The income range of the families of the 20 male suicide subjects he worked on was between Tk 7,000 and Tk 20,000. \"Since the men need to meet the socially prescribed responsibility of the sole breadwinner, this often instigates them to commit suicide when they fail to perfectly carry out the role.

      "text": "Dear readers, Bangladesh has a total stock of 11.18 million (one million equals to 10 lakh) cows, buffaloes, goats and sheep ahead of Eid-ul-Azha, the second largest religious festival of the Muslims, a little up than that of the previous year. We know that preparations have already been taken regarding the stock of the sacrificial animals and supplying those to the selected markets. The government at an inter-ministerial meeting, chaired by State Minister for Fisheries and Livestock Ashraf Ali Khan, has taken necessary steps to implement a contingency plan and ensuring fool proof security.  Bangladesh has attained self-sufficiency in meat production and significantly it is important to reduce cattle imports and illegal entry of sacrificial animals from neighbouring countries. Departments concerned are working with livestock department and city corporations to prevent cow fattening and using steroid and hormone injections. Many farmers expect that they'll get a good price for their cattle. However, farmers from the flood-affected regions don't foresee good profit this year, as they witness signs of malnourishment due to feed crisis amid the ongoing floods across the country.   During the 80s, farmers of the country used to nurture their cows and feed them natural foods. Those cattle were their wealth, ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. However, in time's course, as the demand for meat increased vastly in the country, the concept of beef fattening came along. I featured these changing scenarios on BTV's Mati O Manush. Dr Saad Ullah, the then head of livestock department of Bangladesh Agricultural University brought into the light Urea Molasses Block, a cattle feed especially suitable during disasters like flood. This was a brick-shaped solid food, which the cows used to eat by licking. Afterwards, came Urea Molasses Straw Technology, a mixture of water, urea, molasses and straw.        Farmers, consumers and traders, all are now aware of the harmful effects of fattening cows by growing them with steroid or other harmful chemicals. Many consumers can now identify cows which have been fed steroids. You would see them very calm and quiet. You would also notice saliva dripping from their mouth. Farmers are trying their best to fatten the cows by feeding pure, natural and organic food.  The country's development in the farming sector is quite encouraging and inspiring. There is no doubt that there has been a revolution in the livestock sector in the last few years. Many unemployed youths have become self-reliant by establishing their farms. Women's success in bringing solvency to the family by raising goats is a remarkable story for all of us. Thus, country's livestock sector is expanding day by day. The number of farmers is also increasing and it means, livestock sector has ample potential for employment. Without doubt, future farming scenario means smart farming. IoT (Internet of Things) based on artificial intelligence is adding new dimensions to livestock farming alongside mainstream farming. Some of the cattle farms are using digital technology at their farms and fetching new information. It is quite evident when technology is used more in numbers, then the cost comes down and becomes relatively low. It really does help the farmers hugely when the data of animal movement, health status is always being updated.   Throughout the year, cattle farmers concentrated more on fattening using organic and natural methods. As I have said earlier, the customers are more aware about the effects of antibiotics, artificial growth promoters and harmful chemicals. So, most people are looking to find the 'organic' one. Few years back, I also wrote an article on the beef breed, 'American Brahman'. It's been a few years that Brahman's new home is Bangladesh. In 2008, under the Beef Cattle Development Project, 10,000 samples of semen were brought to be used experimentally in Bangladesh. Then another 60,000 samples of semen were brought in. It is highly positive that Brahman has spread as an organic breed. During the first phase of the project in 2014-15, 130 selected cattle farmers in 80 upazilas of 38 districts applied Brahman semen on 260 cows. Meanwhile, advanced research on the breed is going on at Savar's Artificial Insemination (AI) and Research Centre and farmers are getting benefited hugely through this. This Brahman breed can weigh up to 1000 kg. In 2016, I rode from port city Ghent to reach the municipality of Avelgem, located in the Belgian province of West Flanders, to see something they call the monster beef breed, 'Belgian Blue', which can weigh up to 1200 kilograms. Big cattle farmers of our country have taken up the expensive beef breed 'Belgian Blue' to their farms, as well.    Dear readers, dengue and flood seem to have lessened the delight of Eid. We have always fought hard against any disaster, whether natural or manmade, and we will fight back. Keeping Eid-ul-Azha ahead, beef fattening is a profitable and promising business sector, you already know. A large part of unemployment can be eradicate by expanding this sector. Livestock sector has been playing an important role in the country's economy. The march for 'organic' livestock should flourish even more. This sector will definitely create more employment opportunities for the youth. We must not forget one thing: we have to ensure a clean environment during and after the sacrifice of the animals as responsible citizens, since dengue has been spreading quite hugely across Dhaka and in many parts of the country. Clean and healthy surroundings is what we should give utmost priority to. My heartfelt Eid greetings to all of you."

      "text": "One of the depressing aspects of the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh is that we understand the problem and know the solution, but it is difficult to be sure how we will get there and when. Our response to global climate change may add a different perspective to this dire refugee situation. There are three basic responses to climate change, also called climate crisis or climate emergency. The ultimate solution to climate change, if I am allowed to say so, is the reduction of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as soon as possible, so that the on-going and expected changes in the climate can slow down, and hopefully, revert back in the long run. This is possible by radically changing our fossil-fuel-based systems into a renewable-energy-based one. We call this response \"mitigation\". Unfortunately, even drastic actions to reduce greenhouse gases will take time to produce a positive impact, even if all countries become really serious about it. Its negative effects on an already warm world will thus continue for a long time. This brings in the second response to climate change, or \"adaptation\", where we adjust to the harmful effects of climate change. If floods continue to stay for a longer period of time, we grow flood-resistant rice to minimise our food loss, for example. Our adjustments to climate change impacts, however, may fall well short due to the severity of climate-induced natural disasters. Then comes the third response, which is to tackle the \"loss and damage\" caused by the changing climate. Given the intensity of calamities, we may lose our precious possessions to the insatiable hunger of climate change. Now, let us examine our responses to the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh in light of the above responses to climate change. We all agree that there is no other solution to this refugee crisis except returning all Rohingya refugees to Myanmar. This is the only mitigation option to address this crisis. Period. Since mitigation is taking time, we are currently going through the adaptation phase of this crisis. The government of Bangladesh, the host communities, the UN agencies, and international and national organisations, with generous financial support from many donors, are trying to adjust to the crisis. We are maintaining an environment in the 30-odd refugee camps spread over Ukhiya and Teknaf sheltering nearly a million Rohingyas so that they do not fall victim to any tragedy. We have been facing loss and damage from day one of this two-year-old crisis. We cleared 6,000 acres of forestland, mostly covered with natural greenery. A recent report by the Bangladesh Forest Department estimated a damage of Tk 460 crore from tree loss, while the overall ecological damage comes to another Tk 1,400 crore. After adopting the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, it took the world 23 years to agree upon concrete actions called the Paris Agreement. Over all these years, discussions went on from who to blame for climate change, to who to reduce how much of carbon and by when, to why we should compromise on our pace of economic growth. But the main problem is, unless all countries agree upon doing their bit in reducing carbon emission drastically, there is no other way to cool down the already-heated-up atmosphere. After all, we all breathe the same air. Nevertheless, climate change has always been surrounded with uncertainties. The best way to fight such uncertainties is to use the available information, technologies, and resources to create some form of certainties within the uncertainties, which we call climate predictions. This approach actually worked in climate change discussions and led to the Paris Agreement. The limited, but commendable, progress that we have made at the global level is because countries have realised that climate change is real and happening now, that we need to make a drastic shift towards low-carbon-emitting economy to keep the global temperature rise well below two degree Celsius to save the world from irreversible destructions, and that we need to allocate resources, build capacities, and develop technologies to support that shift as well as to adapt to climate change. The Rohingya refugee crisis is directly affecting Bangladesh in an unprecedented manner. The sheer number of refugees--with 55 percent of children without access to proper education, thousands of men without work to keep them engaged, hundreds of thousands of girls and women vulnerable to exploitation--has indeed become a \"ticking time-bomb\". We do not need a computer modelling to predict that. The cost of not resolving this refugee crisis soon will not only make Bangladesh suffer more, but also the region and beyond, through violence, trafficking, and radicalisation. Like climate change mitigation, countries, forums, and actors at regional and global levels need to recognise that the Rohingya refugee crisis is essentially a global crisis and they should work together towards a single urgent solution--that is, proper repatriation of all refugees to Myanmar as soon as possible. To be realistic, a complete return of all Rohingyas will take time. Based on the anticipated realisation that Rohingya crisis is a global emergency, donors need to continue funding to ensure basic facilities in the refugee camps in Bangladesh. In addition to humanitarian support, they also need to channel resources for the development of the host communities in Cox's Bazar and for the restoration of the camp sites in a post-repatriation era. The UN and the global community have not been successful in taking immediate, proper measures to resolve the Rohingya refugee crisis. There is no other option but to take a diplomatic approach to resolve it. Bangladesh is now leading the way in that direction working with all concerned countries, as we have been seeing, especially in the recent months. These countries now need to continue responding to Bangladesh's call. Last month in Dhaka, former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon praised Bangladesh for being on the forefront of tackling climate change. He called Bangladesh the \"best teacher\" in climate change adaptation. With her diplomatic leadership, Bangladesh indeed is walking towards the same direction in refugee crisis resolution.

      "text": "Housing is one's fundamental right as per our constitution. The scenario of housing in Bangladesh in general is not good. And the state of coastal housing is even worse. The extreme poor in particular are in an especially grave condition. According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the total population in 16 coastal districts amounts to around 34 million (24 percent) over an area of 42,000 square kilometres (29 percent). The population density in coastal areas is around 800 people per square kilometre which is less than the national average. BBS Census 2011 also shows poverty and extreme poverty levels in the coastal areas are 34.65 percent and 20.55 percent against the national average of 31.5 percent and 17.6 percent, respectively. Therefore, the levels of poverty and extreme poverty in 16 coastal districts are respectively 10 percent and 17 percent more than the national average. Bangladesh is a disaster-prone country. Floods, earthquakes and riverbank erosion are some of the most common hazards that have drastic effects all over the country. The coastal region suffers more due to additional hazards like cyclonic winds, tidal surges and salinity, floods and earthquakes. Again, the east coast suffers from the threat of severe earthquakes and landslides. On the other hand, saline intrusion is much deeper inland along the west coast. Salinity affects the durability of building materials and therefore building structures. Tidal surge and wind from cyclone exert loads on structures which are even more severe than the earthquake load. Therefore, structures in the coastal region demand the use of alternative appropriate materials and technologies for withstanding severe loads emanating from cyclones, tidal surges and earthquakes. A relevant policy document titled \"Standard Guidelines for Rural Housing in Disaster-Prone Areas of Bangladesh,\" a publication of the Housing and Building Research Institute, dictates eight design standards and proposes shifting from the paradigm of temporary building structures to a durable one. Moreover, the use of wood, bamboo, straw, etc., causes deforestation and destroys coastal green belts which is most important to break the tidal surge and wind thrust during severe cyclones. The eight design standards for rural housing are: 1) Guaranteed security of tenure for a set period of time of at least 30 years; 2) Access to safe water and sanitation solutions is to be provided; 3) All housing is built with materials and techniques that allow easy maintenance, repair and duplication; 4) All housing and sites are adapted to the local hazard profile to resist recurrent disasters over 30 years; 5) All housing offers a comfortable and healthy internal climate; 6) All housing is adapted to special and specific needs of its inhabitants; 7) All housing is functional, culturally appropriate and adaptable; and 8) All housing should be situated as close as possible to employment and education opportunities, medical and other social services. Considering all these things above, it is obvious that coastal housing needs special care. The following measures are some of the ways in which coastal housing needs can be ensured:   Mohammad Abu Sadeque is former director, Housing and Building Research Institute (HBRI)."

She served as a lecturer at DU right after her graduation, and earned her MSc and PhD in Computer Science from Georgia State University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, USA, respectively. Dr Nova joined the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at North South University (NSU) in 2011. She was the only female faculty member in the department at the time. She is currently an associate professor at NSU. Her research interests include computing for good, healthcare, education, cloud and distributed computing, sensors and systems, feminist human computer interaction, and ICT for privacy and social justice. She is fascinated with solving problems in Bangladesh in low-cost, feasible, and socially acceptable ways, through everything from sensor-based hardware systems to human-centered computing. To that end, she has worked on projects dealing with safe vehicle-driving, flash floods, and sexual harassment, among other things. Dr Nova became a mother while she was pursuing her PhD. Continuously shifting her roles as a parent and a student and juggling her responsibilities effectively were tough for her. But thankfully her partner, who was also a PhD student at the time, and her peers helped her through all of it.  \"I cannot do this because I am a girl\" is a statement Dr Nova, who has over 10 years of research and professional experience in computer science, dislikes to hear. She is passionate about engaging women and children in STEM disciplines. She noted that female students are a minority in her department and some of the brightest girls in her classes do not show the same active participation in laboratory-based learning environments. She has organised the Ada Lovelace Celebration in Dhaka and the Women in Science Without Borders programme in South Africa and Egypt to open up conversations about the challenges that women scientists face. \"Many of my female students don't want proper jobs in computer science upon graduation. Despite having good grades and giving good interviews, they tend to fail in the psychology tests for industry jobs,\" she explains.  There are many societal pressures that limit women and girls from building careers in science. \"Balancing full-time jobs and homemaking is one of the main challenges that women face in our society,\" adds Dr Nova. \"Some girls don't want to work after marriage, because they are not confident enough. Providing psychological counselling and child care support for these women is important, so that they are motivated to continue their pursuits. We need to promote the enjoyable side of science to young women and girls.\" Achia Khaleda Nila completed her BSc in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from United International University and MSc in CSE from Daffodil International University in Bangladesh. She started working as a junior software engineer at a multinational IT company when she was a second year undergraduate student. She was able to manage both her studies and office work effectively throughout her university years. However, Nila came across very few female students of CSE and often times, she was the only girl in the classroom. \"Many of my female peers and juniors were not looking to take up industry jobs after graduation. Others opted out for jobs in completely different fields, despite studying CSE,\" she says. Many deeply embedded societal perceptions lead women in Bangladesh to not opt for studying or working in STEM fields, despite being interested in such subjects. \"Girls are discouraged from pursuing challenging jobs in computer science and programming because they believe that they are not good enough and that such jobs are only meant for boys. These perceptions need to change,\" asserts Nila. The barriers that limit women from building careers in computer science and technology are even more prevalent in the professional space, according to Nila. \"In my first job, I observed that women are preferred in the graphics department. Hardcore programming was a 'no-go' zone for them, which was shocking,\" she says. Nila feels that women are neglected in terms of recognition and promotion, even after doing exceptionally well. \"There are many women in the entry-level CSE jobs, but hardly any in the higher-level positions,\" she explains, adding that women are more likely than men to take a few steps back--or leave the workforce entirely-- once they have children. Committed to empowering women and girls through computing and technology, Nila founded Women in Digital (WID), a social enterprise, in 2013. WID facilitates female creators who want to work in digital platforms to raise their profiles, reach their desired audience, and showcase their work. It aims to improve the design of products and services to better serve a more diverse population, and increase economic and social well-being by providing more women with stable and lucrative careers. Today, the social enterprise operates an agency, tech schools, and an e-commerce initiative. Female engineers of the agency work on IT products for international clients, mainly in Australia and the USA. So far, they have developed more than 6,000 websites and more than 3,000 mobile applications. They recently developed a water billing software for Bangladesh. Young girls in Dhaka, Ramgonj, Kurigram, Mymensingh, and Nepal receive computer training at WID's tech schools. Their e-commerce initiative provides an international market for handicraft products made by rural women of Bangladesh. So far, WID has successfully trained over 5,000 women for jobs in computing and technology. \"The technology industry offers an abundance of opportunities to women in terms of flexibility and work-from-home options, among other things,\" adds Nila, who is one of the 23 Bangladeshi changemakers to be selected for the prestigious Acumen Fellowship 2020, an intensive leadership development programme for emerging leaders who are building solutions to tackle problems around poverty and social justice. After earning her BSc and MSc from the Department of Food and Nutrition at the College of Home Economics (under the University of Dhaka), Samia Tasnim completed her clinical dietetic internship at Square Hospitals Ltd in 2013.  She went on to serve as a nutritionist and diet consultant at Kidz Care Bangladesh and RIAND Bangladesh. \"I provided nutritional therapy and counselling to children with special needs in particular, including those on the autism spectrum as well as those with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome, and other developmental disorders. I also trained health workers, parents, and teachers of the children on nutrition,\" explains Samia, who frequently goes to different educational institutions, NGOs, and television and radio programmes to talk about health and wellness. Besides child nutrition, her areas of expertise include obesity, malnutrition, pregnancy nutrition, and diet management for various diseases. Presently, she consults patients at Prescription Point, Banani, and Lab Aid, Mirpur. Samia came into the nutrition and wellness profession because she likes to interact with people directly to solve their problems. \"Working in nutrition and food science entails that you have to communicate with the masses and frequently visit remote areas, which can be difficult,\" she says. \"However, as nutritionists, we get to work for the welfare of others.\" Samia feels that there is a shift happening in the public perceptions of nutrition today. \"People in our country are more aware of nutrition generally. They are more open to making healthier food choices, but often times, they simply copy what others around them are doing for their health, without getting any expert help, which can have dire consequences,\" she says. \"We must remember that everyone's nutritional requirements are different.\" Furthermore, she explains that people who want to study or work in the nutrition and food science field need to have a strong mindset. \"Once you have figured out your specific interests, the opportunities in this sector are vast,\" she says. Currently, Samia is pursuing her MPhil in Nutrition and Food Science from DU. She also aims to lead different research projects on nutrition. Nazia Tajrian Amin earned her BSc in Avionics from the Department of Aeronautical Engineering at the Military Institute of Science and Technology in 2013.  She joined the private airline company, Novo Air, in 2014, where she currently works as a senior CAMO engineer. Her main job responsibility is keeping aircrafts safe for flights, which involves but is not limited to aircraft maintenance data analysis, maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircrafts and aircraft components, managing aircrafts and aircraft components, and analysing various proposals to make sure that they are technically and financially feasible. \"I have always wanted a job that is unique and challenging over others. The fact that most of our population do not go for aeronautical engineering motivated me to choose this field,\" explains Nazia, who also has an MBA from Bangladesh University of Professionals. \"My team at Novo Air is like a close-knit family. However, aeronautical engineering still remains a male-dominated area. We have only two female engineers, including myself, working in our company today.\" She further spoke about the main reasons why Bangladeshi women shy away from studying or working in the engineering sciences. \"The general stereotype is that women are fragile and cannot flourish in demanding jobs in engineering fields,\" she asserts. \"But I believe that no work environment is too harsh for a woman, as long as she is passionate about her profession.\" Based on her own experience and that of her classmates, Nazia explains that jobs in aeronautical engineering are incredibly challenging, as they require specific academic qualifications and training. She further adds that as a young mother, maintaining a balance between her familial and professional life is one of her biggest struggles. Nevertheless, she believes that more young women need to be enabled and encouraged to prosper as aeronautical engineers.  \"This career path is immensely rewarding and an excellent choice for women because it gives them an edge in the cutthroat competition across the globe. As long as women come into the job with a resilient mindset, commitment, and passion, they will thrive,\" adds Nazia. Born into a family of medical doctors, Ananya Ferdous Hoque had an inherent interest in the biological sciences from a young age. However, she wanted to branch out by basing her career on a subject more compatible with the world of modern research. The applications of microbiology in our daily life, be it in food, medicine, environment, or industry, inspired her immensely. Two-time recipient of The Daily Star O and A Level Award, Ananya earned her MRes in Biological Sciences from the Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health at the University of Manchester after completing her BSc in Microbiology from NSU. As a postgraduate student, she was placed in top-class laboratories and acquired multidisciplinary training. This included studying dialysis in mice, whereby she injected dialysis fluids into mice abdomen and later visualised their tissues histologically under the microscope to detect physical changes. For another project, she isolated bacterial mutants that showed altered response to antibiotic treatment. As an undergraduate student, she worked as a research intern under scientist Dr Mohammed Ziaur Rahman's supervision at the Virology Laboratory of the Programme for HIV and AIDS, under International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). During that time, Ananya became familiar with viral genomic studies and collected data on the genotypes of respiratory syncytial virus circulating in Dhaka. \"Dr Ziaur was quite content with my lab performance and encouraged me for higher studies,\" she says. When she returned to Bangladesh from Manchester, Ananya joined icddr,b, where she currently works as a senior research assistant. She is a member of the molecular team at their Virology Laboratory, where her daily workload includes detecting the presence of viral pathogens in patient samples by extracting, amplifying, quantifying, and analysing certain marker genes. \"The viruses targeted are influenza virus, norovirus, Nipah virus, and other agents of febrile illnesses. At the same time, I guide the research interns in the laboratory with their experiments and thesis writing. I am also involved in scientific manuscript writing with my supervisor,\" Ananya adds. Although she has personally not faced any issues in the workplace so far, Ananya notes that some factory-based scientific jobs are only available to men, as women may find the working conditions and commute difficult and unsafe. \"Women in field work positions may also face social or physical obstacles, depending on the nature of the jobs. Staying after hours may be required for emergency tests, but women are rarely obliged,\" she asserts. \"Other than that, gender or political biases may exist, but that varies between organisations.\" She also spoke about the current opportunities for women in science-focused jobs in Bangladesh. \"Women are thriving in the research and development, quality control, diagnostics, and science education sectors. The need for jobs will increase once more young girls enroll in science-related programmes,\" she says. \"These changes will happen when families are more aware and supportive of such career paths for their girls.\" Ananya herself plans to enroll in a UK-based PhD programme soon. \"I aim to be an example to young girls who are interested in science,\" she concludes. Today, advanced robotics continues to surprise those of us who couldn't have fathomed the existence of AI bots like Sofia, Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant. But thanks to tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and others that continue to set the pace, this sector is something to marvel at. Robotics is gaining momentum in many schools worldwide. While it's important to note that teachers who administer courses in this area should have advanced knowledge in programming and other skills, students are reaping huge benefits, not just for the present, but also for the foreseeable future. The Tech Academy, founded by Shams Jaber in 2013, is an institute in Banani where children can learn how to create robots, software, and even CGI animations. Students of the academy are also given the opportunity to create actual products for different companies, and for competitions as well. Kids from the academy also teach adults all they know about technology at events organised in Jatra Biroti every Friday.  Eleven-year-old Tara Sobhan, a seventh grader at Grace International School, is one of the youngest and most promising students at The Tech Academy. A go-getter by nature, Tara does not let her age get in her way of learning new things. She has been learning robotics and animation at The Tech Academy for over two years. From working on LEDs, RGBs, Sonar, LDR to RC Car, Servo and Dot Matrix, Tara has been involved in a variety of class projects in robotics. In the animation classes, she learns building models, texturing, camera animation, soccer animation, and colouring materials in 3D, among other things. \"I am learning new ways of solving problems using technology. The teachers and staff are really supportive,\" says Tara, who aspires to be a scientist one day. \"The animation and robotics classes encourage me to think creatively.\" Tara's story showcases that when girls realise their ability to code and build robots, they can be empowered to have successful futures and create innovative technology.

      "text": "The Bangladesh Bank yesterday unveiled a loose monetary policy for fiscal 2019-20 as it looks to pump money into the economy to alleviate the banking system's prolonged liquidity crunch. For instance, it has set net domestic asset target of 16 percent for fiscal 2019-20 in contrast to 12.3 percent in June. It has also set a public sector credit growth target of 24.3 percent, up from 21.1 percent last month. \"This is not a tight monetary policy at all. Rather, the central bank has taken a relaxed policy given the existing crisis in the money market,\" said Ahsan H Mansur, executive director of the Policy Research Institute of Bangladesh. The slower-than-expected remittance and exports earnings growth in comparison to GDP has compelled the central bank to take the stance. \"The liquidity crunch in banks will ease for the time being because of this. But there will be a downside risk and it may create a balance of payment crisis,\" Mansur said, adding that the economy will face inflationary pressure. But BB Governor Fazle Kabir had a different opinion. \"The new monetary policy is cautiously accommodative like the previous ones as it will help achieve 8.2 percent GDP growth and contain inflation at 5.5 percent,\" he said while unveiling the monetary policy yesterday. And in a departure from the past, he unveiled a monetary policy for the entire fiscal year instead of the previous practice of unveiling one every six months. In the year-long monetary policy, the private sector credit growth target has been set at 14.8 percent although the growth rate dropped to a six-year low of 11.29 percent last fiscal year. The central bank governor though blamed the low private sector credit growth on banks straightening out their lending practices. \"Some overenthusiastic banks have been forced to scrap their questionable stance in disbursing loans because of our intensive monitoring,\" he said. This has helped bring down the private sector credit growth to a logical level when compared to the emerging economies of South and East Asian countries, he said. \"The public sector credit growth looks higher than the private sector. But in terms of funds, the credit volume of the private sector is at least 7.3 times higher than the public one.\" He went on to express satisfaction about the ongoing situation in the money market as the net foreign assets (NFAs) increased last fiscal year, mitigating the liquidity crunch in banks. The central bank has projected the NFAs will register a 0.3 percent growth this fiscal year, whereas it grew 2.2 percent last fiscal year. Kabir, however, said the implementation of the new VAT Act and crop damage due to recent floods may create inflationary pressure. The central bank also announced it will be switching to short-term interest rate-based monetary policy in keeping with global best practices. It has started preparations for the switch with the South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Centre (SARTTAC), a collaborative venture between the International Monetary Fund and its six member countries of South Asia. But economists expressed doubt about the success of the new policy in the absence of a vibrant bond market. Given only the call money market to rely on it will be tough for the central bank as the developed nations depend on the yield of bond to set and reset the policy rate, said Mansur, also a former economist of the IMF. Zahid Hussain, a former lead economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office, echoed the same. This will require establishment of a stronger link between the policy rates and financial market prices, which in turn will require a more competitively behaved banking system and development of a bond market, he said.  \"The central bank will need to work much harder on these fronts before switching to an interest rate targeting-based monetary policy regime.\""

      "text": "Farmers in the northeastern backswamp are all too familiar with flash floods. Rice paddies grown just once a year in this vast haor remain at the mercy of nature. But thousands of growers in this wetland ecosystem had never experienced flash floods striking this early as in this season, completely destroying paddies in over one lakh hectares of land.  Experts said flash floods usually wreak havoc here in the haors in April but this time crops went under water on March 27. They attributed the phenomenon to climate change. The flash floods submerged the wetland of Sylhet, Sunamganj, Habiganj, Netrokona, Kishoreganj, Brahmanbaria and Moulvibazar.  Losing the only crop of the year, many farmers in Sunamganj, Kishoreganj, Netrakona, Habiganj and in some other northeastern districts are now selling their cattle and other valuables while many others are leaving their homes for nearby towns to find manual work. Rashid Ali from Damodar Api village in Dakshin Sunamganj usually sells around eight tons of rice grown in over 10 acres of land. But this year he could not harvest even a kilogram. \"I had seven cows. But I have already sold four of them to repay loans that I took to cultivate rice. I am not sure how would I run my family now,\" he told The Daily Star. Farmers from other haor regions also started selling their cattle to tide over the crisis. Mohammad Mainuddin, 50, member of Sizadpur union in Habiganj's Baniachong upazila, said he had never seen such early flash floods in that region. \"This is the worst situation we can remember. Many people in our village harvest 20 tons of Boro rice every year. But this time they would not harvest even a handful of rice,\" he said. Mainuddin explains, the farmers mostly cultivate two kinds of Boro crop that they were supposed to harvest in the last week of Chaitra and the first week of Baishakh (second and third week of April). But this year the flash flood hit 15 to 20 days early destroying all the mature paddies in the field. Prof AKM Sailful Islam of the Institute of Water and Flood Management at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) said when the water level of the Surma river at Sunamganj station of Bangladesh Water Development Board (WDB) crosses the 6.5 metre-mark during March-April, they consider it as the beginning of flash flood. He said all the other flash floods since 2000 hit the Haor areas in mid April and by then the farmers were able to harvest a major portion of the Boro crops. \"Last year, the flash flood hit on April 17, but this year the flash flood came on March 27,\" Prof Saiful said. He attributed change in season from climate change to this early flash flood. The intensity and frequency of extreme weather has been changing also due to climate change, he said. \"We were not prepared for the situation as well. There are news reports many of the embankments in the haor area were either not repaired or remained damaged. \"So we were not prepared for it,\" the professor said. Again, the department of meteorology or Flood Forecasting Warning System doesn't have any special warning system for flash flood. Samarendra Karmakar, a meteorologists and an ex-director of Bangladesh met office, also pointed to climate variability for this year's early flash flood. \"This year flash flood took place earlier than usual. But nobody can exactly say why this climate variability happens.\" This year easterly low pressure was active and sub tropical high in the Bay of Bengal was weak that caused rainfall in the Himalayan region in India, he said as a possible explanation. Zahidul Haque, deputy director at the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in Sunamganj, said farmers in the haor area of the district cultivated Boro crops in some 1.6 lakh hectares in the district. Of them, around 1.13 lakh hectares have been submerged while crops in about one lakh hectare have been completely destroyed. \"Our estimation says farmers would face a loss of Tk 1 lakh for per hectare of land,\" he said. The department is yet to estimate the total amount of financial loss in the area, said Manzurul Hannan, director general of DAE. He said farmers cultivated Boro rice in 4.5 lakh hectares of haor this year and an estimated 1.41 lakh hectares went under water. However, data collected by our correspondents from the district agricultural offices shows around 2.5 lakh hectares of land was submerged in the flash floods. Asked, he expressed his hope that the government, despite this havoc, would be able to reach its target of Boro harvest this year due to a good yield in other places of the country. Boro contributes 55 percent to the annual rice output and was cultivated in 48 lakh hectares of land. Last year, total 1 crore and 89 lakh tonnes of Boro rice was produced in the country.

He said they have been monitoring the water level of the river. \"We will alert the char and shoal people if the river crosses the danger level,\" he said, warning that the water level might cross the danger level anytime. Mobarak Hossain, 35, of Char Gaddimari village in Hatibandha said their shoal was flooded yesterday morning and they were using bamboo-made rafts to maintain connection with the mainland. Mofazzal Hossain, chairman of Rajpur Union Parishad in Lalmonirhat Sadar, said char and shoal people always live in flood situations during the rainy season as the river overflows following normal downpour upstream. The riverbed has lost its depth because of silt and mud settling there for years, said WDB Executive Engineer of Lalmonirhat Abu Bakkar. He added it is necessary to dredge the river so that it can capture additional water during rains. A large area in Jalpaiguri district in West Bengal and northern Bangladesh has been flooded as excessive water has been released through the two barrages in Sikkim and West Bengal states, reports our Kolkata correspondent Subrata Acharya. The release of water has created danger of large-scale flood in Bangladesh's northern districts. Insiders said excessive water has been released from the Gajoldoba barrage in West Bengal due to flash flood caused by untimely rainfall. The government sources say 1,200 cusec of water has been released, but locals claim the amount would be several times higher. It has been apprehended that low-lying areas fed by the Teesta in Bangladesh will be affected by the flash flood. Contacted over cellphone, West Bengal Irrigation Minister Rajib Banerjee yesterday told this correspondent that the Barrage sources informed him that 1,200 cusec water was released on Tuesday. Asked if they had considered that the water released from the barrage might affect Bangladesh, the minister said, \"The water has been released by Sikkim. As Sikkim is on the upstream when water is released, it will flow downwards. However, Sikkim should have given us a note before releasing the water.\" However, Rajib Banerjee expressed sorrow over the creation of flood situations in Bangladesh. He said, \"We don't want any neighbouring country to be affected due to us.\" West Bengal state government has meanwhile issued a \"Yellow Alert\" from Domohani at Teesta to bordering Mekhliganj since Tuesday morning. The western districts in West Bengal have been experiencing heavy rainfall for the last one week due to a depression. The rainfall caused pressure of excessive water on Gajoldoba barrage due to flash flood. Local people have complained that the authorities concerned released water at Gajoldoba without any prior announcement."

Parasite, the South Korean film that won four Oscars this year--including the awards for Best Picture and Best Director--is probably one of the most talked about cinematic works from the 2010s. As I watched the film, I realised how universal the theme is, how believable and realistic it would be even if it were set in Bangladesh, the country I was born and brought up in. At the centre of the film are two families: four members of a family barely managing to make their ends meet successfully pretend to be unrelated, efficient people and, thanks to their luck and the tricks they use, get employed in the household of a wealthy family. There are unpredictable twists and turns, culminating in unexpected revelations and shocking outcomes. While the storyline is very intriguing and the themes of social inequality and its catastrophic effects are extremely thought provoking, I spent a lot of time pondering over something else after I finished watching the film: the title. Who are the titular parasites? Some people might choose to not focus on things that do not meet the eye and come to the conclusion that the four working class people faking their identities and blatantly lying to be employed by a well-off family are the parasites; that they are leeching off the rich. But why should the REASONS they choose to lie be ignored? How much equality is being established by the economic development taking place all over the world? Why should there be so much income, wealth and social inequalities in countries being constantly considered the models of economic development? How flawed should social structures be to compel people to lie, fake their identities and risk legal repercussions just to make their ends meet? The thing that compelled the family in question to risk everything is the structural flaw that allows the rich to get richer and live off the sweat of the working class who risk being drowned in floods caused by downpours that the rich enjoy sitting in their mansions and air-conditioned cars. The relationship between the privileged and the underprivileged, contrary to what many people might suggest, is not symbiotic by any means. It is deeply parasitic, with the rich being the parasites, the exploiters, the oppressors--and not the other way around."

      "text": "Politicians and law-enforcers in Bangladesh, from time to time, hype up both panic and complacency by publicizing the following: \"terrorists everywhere\" or \"no terrorists anywhere\", in the country. The ambivalence is counterproductive to counterterrorism (CT) operation. The first and foremost requirement for effective CT is understanding of terrorism per se, that terrorists are not mindless robots programmed to kill innocent people just for the sake of killing. Terrorism is ideology-driven violence, different from violent crime and warfare. Most terrorists, globally, have been well-to-do engineers and technocrats, not poverty-stricken madrassa-educated people. Terrorism is a deviation, something out of the ordinary; there's no ordinariness about it like crime, epidemic, floods, or earthquake. It's a symptom of the disease, not the disease itself. A society or nation creates it, as studies on terrorism have revealed, through various unwise socio-political, and economic decisions. Very similar to cholera or malaria, terrorism spreads through certain germs or bacteria; it just doesn't drop from the heavens. It's noteworthy, terrorist outfits representing minority communities often fizzle out - such as the IRA and LTTE - but those who are well-entrenched among the main stream of the population, remain formidable adversaries for years, if not decades. The primary responsibility for the spread of terrorism in any country lies with the country itself; there is no room for blaming others. I give the example of the ten-year-old American boy, who seconds after the second plane had hit the Twin Towers on 9/11 screamed: \"Why are they killing us? We must have done something wrong to some people somewhere\". What this little boy understood that terrorists don't attack just for the sake of attacking, the American Administration refuses to admit that terrorist attacks are either retaliatory or preemptive by nature. Bangladeshis must also search as to why terrorism is present in their country. Any denial is costly, and counterproductive to effective CT operation. CT experts in Bangladesh must understand the problem of terrorism has deeper roots than alienation of some rich kids. Is there any problem of mass alienation of people from society, politics, and state - which they consider corrupt, cruel, and lacking in legitimacy? The problem may be political, and \"political\" has a very broad definition. It's all about human relations in power perspective; it's about people's aspirations, honour, dignity, livelihood, family, and freedom in local, national, and global perspectives. And what's local is global, and global is local. In the wake of the latest terror attacks at Gulshan and Sholakia, the question is, are Bangladeshi leaders and law-enforcers still going to be in the denial mode? The stance that there is no ISIS in Bangladesh and that terrorists here are all homegrown locals seems to have become irrelevant. In fact, they should rather worry more about the homegrown elements than the foreign ones, who are relatively easier to track down than the locals. They should understand terrorism is also globalised like the McDonald's franchise; you don't need American chefs to prepare their burgers in distant Bangladesh. An effective CT doesn't require more troops or policemen, it requires: a) the admission by politicians and police that terrorists do exist in Bangladesh; b) no bragging about actual or elusive success in CT operation; c) no blame game against each other; and d) good governance and fair distribution of prosperity and opportunities to all. Imperatively, mainstream religions or political parties never nurture terrorism. Cults or secret religious or political clans surreptitiously mobilize support for terrorism by systematic brainwashing of people through manipulation of facts and ideologies. The upshot is a tiny minority of angry, marginalised people start believing what's apparently right is actually wrong, and vice versa. According to the Home Minister, since only a handful of people are terrorists, the Government can overpower them in no time. The Police Chief is even more complacent: \"Militancy has decreased in the country due to law enforcers' efforts .... Some have been killed in 'crossfire' incidents\". Interestingly, only 19 terrorists destroyed the Twin Towers on 9/11, killed around 3,000 people, inflicting a loss of more than a trillion dollars to American economy; and al Qaeda spent less than $500,000 for the attacks. The punch line is 20 terrorists can kill 20,000. Global CT operators have learnt that there are three different types of politically inspired violence: a) terrorism b) insurgency and c) insurgent-terrorism. The fine line between terrorism and insurgency often remains blurred. While al Qaeda is primarily terroristic, the ISIS champions global insurgencies against all governments across the world. Hence it's the most dangerous destabilizing force in the world. As terrorism is often part of  broader insurgencies - the terrorist JMB in Bangladesh is a surrogate to the global insurgency called ISIS - CT operators must apply counterinsurgency (COIN) methods as well. David Galula, the guru of COIN operators in the world (although this French expert came from the losing side of the War in Algeria), believes CT-COIN is \"eighty percent political, and twenty percent military\". CT-COIN operators in Bangladesh must apply the concerted civil, military, paramilitary, political, economic, and psychological forces to counter terrorism. Then again, CT-COIN operators mustn't follow security studies manuals, blindly. One military historian has pointed out, most CT-COIN operations have failed to achieve anything as the losing side has written \"99 percent\" of their manuals. Hence the desirability of innovation or creativity! Again civil-military cooperation is an essential pre-condition for the success of any CT-COIN operation, so goes General David Petraeus's Counterinsurgency Field Manual. The line between terrorists and insurgents is getting blurred, very fast. In countries where terrorists and insurgents come from the main stream of the populations, there's no guarantee about the success of any CT-COIN operations in those places. There's no alternative to addressing the socio-political, and economic issues to resolve the problem of terrorism-insurgency in those countries. We know terrorism isn't a law-and-order problem, and as such there's no quick fix or police and military solutions to the problem. However, this information is a bitter pill to swallow for most government agencies in Bangladesh, and elsewhere. Another stumbling bloc to successful CT-COIN operation is some politicians' and law-enforcers' disrespect for human rights, human dignity, and privacy of suspects having links with terrorists and insurgents in general. They simply don't understand extra-judicial killings of suspects and criminals - through the proverbial \"encounter\" or \"cross-fire\" - further aggravate the problem of terrorism-insurgency. To conclude, Bangladesh should use the globally recognised CT-COIN Manual, for example the one developed by the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS), which is all about intrastate and interstate cooperation to contain and defeat terrorist-insurgencies in various countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including Bangladesh. While the Comprehensive Security Response to Terrorism (CSRT) method stresses the importance of intrastate civil-military and inter-agency cooperation, including intelligence sharing, the Advanced Security Cooperation (ASC) suggests interstate cooperation among civil-military and intelligence agencies at the international level. Again, both the CSRT and ASC methods stress the importance of good governance, democracy, and respect for human rights as antidotes to terrorism and insurgency. CT-COIN operators in Bangladesh should learn, there's no substitute for good governance, which is transparent and accountable, and ensures democracy, the freedom of expression, human rights and dignity. In sum, there's no police or military solution to the problem of terrorism and insurgency.   The writer teaches security studies at Austin Peay State University in the US.

      "text": "Bangladesh has set an ambitious target to eliminate extreme poverty by FY2031. The results of the latest Household Income and Expenditure Survey done in 2016 (HIES 2016) suggest that this is a feasible target but by no means assured.  HIES 2016 shows that moderate poverty (percent of population below the Upper Poverty Line or UPL) has fallen from 31.5 percent in 2010 to 24.3 percent in 2016, while extreme poverty (percent of population below the Lower Poverty Line or LPL) has declined from 17.6 percent to 12.9 percent over the same periods. Research shows that several factors have contributed to continued progress with poverty reduction in Bangladesh including rapid economic growth, public spending on health, education, social protection and infrastructure, rapid inflow of external remittances and expansion of micro-credit programmes. Continued progress on these fronts will be important for further poverty reduction.  These research findings have been internalised in the government's poverty reduction strategy and related policymaking. But there is one major policy gap that has not received adequate attention. Research shows that poverty and the population's vulnerability to natural disasters are positively correlated. Those falling in the extreme poverty group are most susceptible to natural disasters owing to the absence of adequate coping mechanisms. Yet, policy progress with reducing the vulnerability of the poor to natural disasters has been weak. Continued neglect of this aspect of poverty strategy could jeopardise the government's ability to eliminate extreme poverty by FY2031. The importance of this policy challenge is well illustrated by the results of HIES 2016. District level data indicates that the poverty reduction progress has been highly uneven. The chart shows that the top 10 poorest districts of Bangladesh have poverty incidence ranging from 70 percent to 42 percent (based on UPL) as compared with the average poverty incidence of 24.3 percent.  Indeed, the poverty gap between the poorest district (Kurigram with 70 percent poverty rate) and the least poor district (Narayanganj with a poverty rate of only 2.6 percent) is astounding. A 70 percent poverty incidence found in Kurigram even after 45 years of independence is truly worrisome. A deeper analysis of the determinants of these large spatial variations in poverty incidence must be done to inform policymaking. An important factor is the role of geography and exposure to natural disasters. Kurigram is an extreme example of this. Year after year Kurigram suffers from massive flooding from the overflow of the Brahmaputra river. It is little comfort to give the exposed population annual dose of relief supplies, small financial handouts, access to microcredits and better toilet facilities. Unless a permanent solution to the river flooding problem can be found, Kurigram will continue to show high poverty and thwart the government's efforts to eliminate extreme poverty. More generally, the location map of the top 10 poorest districts shows that they are either a part of the Barind Tract area of North-West Bangladesh (Dinajpur and Rangpur) or a part of the river and estuary belt (Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Magura and Kishoreganj).  Because of location, they face a range of vulnerabilities presented by river-flooding and water-logging in the monsoon and water shortages in the fall and winter dry seasons. The remaining two (Bandarban and Khagrachhari) are a part of the Chittagong Hill Tracts with little access to usable water combined with difficult land terrain and episodes of flash flooding and land-slides from water runoffs. The environmental problems are compounded by over-exploitation of ground water and deforestation. All these districts are heavily dependent upon agriculture for livelihood that makes them so much more vulnerable to river flooding, flash floods, water logging, soil erosion and water shortages. Without a sea change in the poverty reduction strategy that is targeted to benefit these districts through specific interventions to reduce the vulnerabilities imposed by geography, natural disasters and climate change, there is a huge risk that these districts will not benefit in a sustained manner from the current poverty reduction strategy and will continue to be left behind as presently. This will likely compromise the government's ability to eliminate extreme poverty by FY2031. What is the way out? The adoption of the government's Delta Plan 2100 (BDP 2100) will be a major step forward. The BDP 2100 identifies the major sources of vulnerability of the population of Bangladesh to geography, natural disasters and climate change and seeks to address these vulnerabilities at source through a well-thought strategy comprising policies, regulations, institutions and investment programmes. If the government is serious about eliminating extreme poverty by FY2031 it must move speedily to adopt the BDP 2100 and initiate its implementation.  Tinkering at the margin in these districts with small scale safety net or micro-credit programmes will likely be a wasteful use of resources when measured against sustained long-term impact. Sources of vulnerabilities must be addressed to achieve sustained progress with poverty reduction and this will involve large scale public investments in flood control, river training, irrigation, water storage, piped water supply and proper operations and maintenance (O&M) practices. Degradation of land and underground water resources from deforestation, soil erosion and over-exploitation of ground water must be checked and reversed through regulations, investments and sustainable cropping practices. Institutions must be established and cost recovery policies instituted to ensure participation of beneficiaries in policymaking, adoption of correct O&M practices and sustainable financing of investments. Production diversification must be ensured to create off-farm jobs in small scale manufacturing, transport, trade and other services. Improving access to international migration will be helpful by increasing the income base of the vulnerable families. Better access to microcredit and social protection programmes will also help reduce poverty on a sustainable basis provided these interventions are a part of the broader strategy that seeks to reduce poverty by addressing vulnerabilities at the source.

The Meghna River has 102,000 sq. km catchments area in total -- 51,000 sq. km lies in India, 1,000 sq. km in Myanmar, and 50,000 sq. km in Bangladesh. Because of this, Bangladesh has many common rivers with its neighbours.  \nThe Joint Rivers Commission (JRC) was established in Dhaka pursuant to the joint declaration of the prime ministers of India and Bangladesh on March 19, 1972. There is a counterpart JRC for India based in New Delhi. The minister of water resources is the ex-officio chairman of the Commission on each side. The JRC started its activities as an independent organisation in 2000, under the Ministry of Water Resources. It monitors flows of 57 trans-boundary rivers (54 with India and 3 with Myanmar) on an annual basis. According to the website of JRC, its activities include:\n* Negotiating with the co-riparian countries on development, management and sharing of water resources of common rivers;\n* Meeting with India at different levels on sharing of waters of common rivers, transmission of flood related data, river bank protection works along common/border rivers etc.;\n* Monitoring and sharing of the Ganga/Ganges waters at Farakka, India, and at Hardinge Bridge, Bangladesh, from January 1 to May 31 as per the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty, 1996;\n* Working jointly with Nepal for harnessing common water resources, mitigating floods and flood damages, and conducting research and technical studies;\n* Co-operating with China in the field of water resources, enhancing the flood forecasting capability through exchange of flood related data and information keeping in mind the principles of equality and fairness, conducting training in the relevant technical field, etc.;\n* Principles of equality and fairness, conducting training in the relevant technical field, etc.;\n* Working jointly with co-riparian countries on hydro-power development and water resources management under sub-regional co-operation.\n*\nAccording to its website, the JRC has held 37 meetings since its establishment in March 1972. Several other meetings at various levels were also held. The issues mainly addressed at those meetings are as follows:\n* Sharing waters of common rivers;\n* Transmission of flood related data from India to Bangladesh;\n* Construction and repair of embankments and bank protection works along common/border rivers;\n* River interlinking project of India;\n* Tipaimukh Dam project of India;\n* Mahananda Barrage constructed by India. No meeting has been held till now after the 37th JRC meeting on March 2010 in Delhi. The 38th JRC meeting was scheduled to be held on September 5, 2011, when a deal on Teesta water sharing was to be signed. It was postponed. Several dates were set afterwards for that meeting, but were postponed on request from the Indian side. The reason for this stalemate is clear: Chief Minister of Paschimbanga Ms. Mamata Banarjee wants to reframe the proposed Teesta agreement, along a line which is not at all agreeable to the Bangladesh side. Bangladesh wants 20% water for the river and the rest distributed between India and Bangladesh on 50-50 basis. Mamata said: \"There is no water in Teesta in lean period, so no water to Bangladesh.\" Historical records say that the minimum average flow of Teesta is no less than 8,000 cusec towards Bangladesh.  \nIn the 37th JRC meeting in Delhi, Bangladesh Water Resources Minister Ramesh Chandra Roy expressed satisfaction for getting 3,500 cusec of water without asking. After a secretary level meeting of JRC in Dhaka, in January 2011, it was in the air that the Teesta water sharing agreement was imminent, with the formula of dividing the flow 50-50, keeping aside 20% of the total flow for the river. But The Daily Star on September 3 carried two contradictory reports: one quoting a JRC official in Dhaka, that keeping aside 20% of the total flow for the river, water shall be divided on 48-52 basis for 15 years; the other, quoting PM's advisor Mashiur Rahman that, \"In fact we do not know how much water is flowing through the Teesta River. We are to measure it for 17 years; then the agreement shall be signed.\" It was stunning and a matter of great shock. On the same day, Anandabazar Patrika of Kolkata reported that by keeping aside 460 cusec of water, it shall be divided 48-52 between Bangladesh and India. This raised a big question. If 460 cusec is 20%, then the total flow (100%) is 2,300 cusec! In that case, would Bangladesh get 1,104 cusec water only?\nAfter the Hasina-Manmohan Summit in Dhaka, Foreign Affairs Secretary of Bangladesh Mijarul Quayes said on September 8, 2011: \"Teesta agreement is finalised; we are not to give any more concessions.\" Since then, it has remained a mystery. What is there in the document? What is the amount of flow to be distributed? Many days have gone by since the controversy developed in September 2011; JRC has still not yet clarified to the public what was or is the real situation. In the meantime, India has closed the Gazaldoba gates towards Bangladesh, and is diverting all the lean period flow of Teesta towards the Mechi River in Bihar through the Mahananda River. Bangladesh is getting only the regenerated flow from the dry bed downstream, added by the Dharla River flow coming at Domohoni Bridge.\nWe often quote Article II of the Helsinki Rules of 1966, which says that 'an international drainage basin is a geographical area extending over two or more states determined by the watershed limits of the system of waters, including surface and underground waters, flowing into a common terminus.' The UN Convention on Non-navigational uses of International Watercourses of 1997 agrees with this definition [Art. 2a]. According to this clause, transfer of water from one watershed basin to other is prohibited. This convention sets out norms on agreements between watercourse states [Art. 3(3)], and those based on negotiating in good faith [Art. 3(5)], and no party can adversely affect uses of another state without the consent of that state [Art 3(4)]. The convention allows the watercourse states to utilise an international watercourse in an equitable and reasonable manner in their respective territories [Art. 5]. This instrument can definitely settle water disputes with our neighbours.\nBangladesh did a commendable job by approaching the International Tribunal to settle its maritime boundary with Myanmar. Bangladesh is a signatory to the UN Convention on Law of the Seas, but why not to the UN Convention on International Watercourses? This convention is yet to come into force with ratification, acceptance, approval or accession by 35 countries. As on April 8, 2014, 34 countries had done it, one remains. Why is Bangladesh not doing that?\nThe JRC in Bangladesh is a small unit fully dependent on other departments for data and logistics. It cannot work on its own for its mandate and research. In India, the Central Water Commission, which acts as the secretariat of JRC, is very strong on its own. The JRC in Bangladesh may need reformation and integration with the Hydrology Department of the Water Ministry.       \nHe writer is Chairman, Institute of Water & Environment.   \nEmail: minamul@gmail.com  "

      "text": "The job of an upazila nirabhi officer at the remotest haors of Kishoreganj is not for the faint of heart. The quality of life of the people of the haor areas is being improved with the dedication and patience of the 13 UNOs of the district, eight of whom are women. Dilruba Ahmed, who joined as the UNO of Bhairab in 2016, said she receives spontaneous support from the public representatives and common people. \"There are a lot of opportunities here to interact with people and have a positive impact on their lives,\" said Dilruba, who joined cadre services in 2008 after completing her honours and masters in geography and environmental science from Dhaka University. One of her first accomplishments was to fill the village police vacancies, which enabled her to form a network. \"I ensured that they got bicycles and mobile phones for better access to the grassroots.\" Shibpur, one of the seven unions in Bhairab, has been declared free of early marriages. \"One of my main duties is to maintain this with the help of local police.\" The mother of two has overseen the preparation of a database of 496 families in the union, and supports them in agriculture, fish farming, livestock or training programmes for the youth according to their needs through the concerned departments. Among her noted achivements was the construction of a dam on Jwanshi Haor. To the joy of farmers, flash floods across Bangladesh earlier this year did not destroy the Boro crops of some 20,000 farmers of three unions -- Sreenagar, Sadhakpur and Aganagar. Monju Mia, a farmer of Jafarnagar village, said the dam helped save their Boro crops from flood waters in April. \"We got encouragement from the UNO of Bhairab. She is the first UNO to visit this area. She visited twice this year.\" Urme Binte Salam is the UNO of Kuliarchar upazila and the recipient of the best UNO of Dhaka and Mymensingh divisions award this year for standard primary education. The quality of education and attendance are the two main elements to achieving this, said Urme, who completed her honours and masters in English from Dhaka University in 2005 and joined the service in 2006. She also got a PhD from Malaysia later. The UNO provided bicycles to 300 meritorious students so that they can commute to school easily. She also organised Science and ICT practical classes for students from fifth to seventh grades. The classes were participated by some 3,200 students of the upazila in January. Taslima Ahmed Poly, the first female UNO in Kishoreganj upazila, is reputed for her services towards people in the remotest of areas. Upon completing her masters from Bangladesh Agricultural University (BAU) in Mymensingh, Taslima joined cadre services in 2010. The people of the haor suffer mostly for poor communication, and surprisingly, it is better during monsoon as they can use boats to go from one union to the next, said the only female employee at the upazila office. When the rains subside, commuting becomes next to impossible in some upazilas, as the roads are muddy. There is a dearth of playing grounds for children though authorities distribute sports equipment to the schools in the upazila. \"The conditions are extreme, but I still visit the unions using row and speed boats for my work,\" she said. Sultana Akter, UNO of Tarail, acquired masters in Public Policy from the United Kingdom and joined the service in 2008. \"Although I grew up in Dhaka and studied abroad, I was mentally prepared to work for rural Bangladesh. The people of these upazilas still view the UNOs as the solver of all problems and they come to me with their personal and social problems. I try to find remedies with the support of departments concerned,\" said Sultana. Both men and women here feel more comfortable speaking to a woman about their issues as they crave empathy and understanding, she added. Annapurna Debnath, UNO of Pakundia, is a change maker. Out of some 150 families at Shailajani village of Chandipasha union, one or two members each from 30 families have been trained in some form of handicraft to make a living. Many more will be brought under the initiative by December, said the UNO. There are some 194 primary schools in the upazila and all the schools will be brought under a mid-day meal programme by December, said Annapurna, who did her honours and masters from BAU. She will be the first to introduce this government programme in the upazila. Mohammad Alauddin, a sharecropper of Khama village in Agarsindhur union, said the UNO arranged Tk 10,000 from the upazila administration for his daughter's admission into Rangamati Medical College. \"She has given my daughter an opportunity to pursue her dreams.\" Annapurna approached Jangalia Union Parishad Chairman Sarder Shamim Ahmed to distribute uniforms for some 120 students of local primary school Pathkoli Shishu Kallanyan Bidhalaya. Shohana Nasrin, Israt Jahan Keya and Mahmuda have joined as UNOs in three upazilas of the district this year. Shohana completed her education from BAU, Keya from Jagannath University and Mahmuda from Eden College in Dhaka.  They enjoy life in the remote haor areas with their families and are rewarded with immense job satisfaction by helping the vulnerable people. Their biggest asset is the support from their families, they added. Zillur Rahman, chairman of Kishoreganj Zila Parishad, said there are no allegations against these UNOs as they work with perseverance."

Several dwellings in the area, under Rongchhati union, have already been devoured by the river and unless immediate steps are taken, the situation can turn for the worse during the ongoing monsoon season, said Mozammel Haque, member of Rongchhati Union Parishad. Aus crops and Aman seedbeds in the area have also been affected by the flash flood, but despite the fact, no steps have yet been taken even after officials of Water Development Board (WDB) visited the area last Friday, he alleged. Flash floods cause damage and erosion every year in the area and there needs to be a well-devised plan to cope with the situation, he also said.   Around 3,000 families were affected after an onrush of water from hills across the border early Wednesday flooded 25 villages in Rongchhati, Kharnoi and Lengura unions in Kalmakanda.   While speaking with this correspondent, Kalmakanda Upazila Nirbahi Officer Zakir Hossain said he visited the affected areas on Saturday and he already asked the WDB to initiate a project for saving the area from erosion. The villages have been flooded as local rivers including the Sumeshwari, Mahadeo, Mohishkhola and Dhaleshwari swelled up by the incoming water from the hills, he said.    Near about 50 ponds and eight kilometres of unpaved roads were also affected in the flash flood, causing sufferings to thousands of villagers, he added.  Rongchhati Union Parishad Chairman Tahera Khatun said the situation is getting better after the floodwater started to recede since Thursday. Local lawmaker Manu Majumder visited the affected areas and distributed relief materials among flood victims on Friday.  "

      "text": "Rail communications between Dhaka and northern and south-western districts have remained suspended since yesterday morning as floodwater washed away soil beneath an approach to a rail bridge on Joydebpur-Bangabandhu Bridge route in Kalihati upazila of Tangail. The snapping of rail link forced Bangladesh Railway to cancel plying of all trains to seven districts yesterday, causing sufferings to thousands of passengers. According to a top railway official, the authorities suspended operations of Maitree Express (between Dhaka and Kolkata) and 10 intercity and one mail trains after the damage. Talking to The Daily Star around 12:45pm yesterday, Amjad Hossain, director general of Bangladesh Railway, said they were hopeful that the train services will resume by tomorrow (today) morning. Visiting the spot, Railway Minister Mazibul Hoque said full workforce along with proper resources have been deployed to restore the rail network. The onrush of floodwaters washed away around 30-foot stretch beneath the southern approach to the rail bridge No 98 on the Pungli, a tributary of the Jamuna, leaving only some rails and wooden sleepers and creating a 20-foot-deep crater. The spot is about 15km east of Bangabandhu Bridge.  The incident occurred some time after Sundarban Express, a Dhaka-bound intercity train from Khulna, crossed the bridge around 5:00am, witnesses said. Some fishermen were the first to notice it and they ran to locals who came to offer Fazr prayers at a local mosque. The locals along with two night guards of a local market stopped Nilsagar Express right at the north end of the bridge around 5:45am by raising a red flag, saving the train from a fatal accident, they added. The train, bound for Dhaka from Nilphamari, was carrying around 2,000 passengers, including a number of hajj pilgrims. They got on buses or hired cars to reach their destination by road. Two other Dhaka-bound trains -- Ekata Express from Dinajpur and Rangpur Express -- stopped at Bangabandhu Bridge West Railway Station and Bangabandhu Bridge East Railway Station. Dhumketu Express, from Dhaka to Rajshahi, got stuck at Joydebpur Railway Station, official sources said. A relief train from Joydebpur rushed to the spot around 10:00am and started the repair, said Ramjan Ali, chief engineer of Bangladesh Railway (West zone). \"Now we are dumping sand bags to check further damage and then we will carry out piling works for closing the channel with fencing,\" he said. Asim Kumar Talukder, railway's divisional general manager (Pakshi zone), said the repair is being hampered due to strong currents. \"We hope we will be able to restore the rail link by tomorrow [today] morning temporarily, but it will take at least three days to complete the repair,\" he said. Deputy Commissioner of Tangail Khan Mohammad Nurul Amin, Superintendent of Police Mahbub Alam and Shajahan Siraj, executive engineer of Water Development Board in Tangail, extended supports for the repair work. Abu Sayeed, a sub-assistant engineer of WDB in Tangail, blamed it mainly on flooding and unplanned sand lifting from the river Pungli. \"The diversion of water flow due to a nearby broken bailey bridge and an under-construction bridge under the Joydebpur-Elenga four-lane highway project near the rail bridge was another reason,\" he added. Some influential people with political clouts have allegedly been lifting sand from the river illegally by using dredgers. Locals complained to the administration on several occasions.  The railway authority filed a case against some people for lifting sand under the rail bridge last year and the key accused was arrested. The illegal activities resumed after he got bail, said Abdur Rashid, an assistant engineer of Bangladesh Railway (Joydebpur zone). The Daily Star ran a story about it on August 16. The DC, however, claimed that the local administration conducted mobile court drives and burnt dredgers on several occasions. Announcements through loud speakers were made to stop sand lifting from the river, he added. Both the rail minister and the DC said they will investigate the matter. The train services to Rajshahi, Khulna, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Lalmonirhat, Sirajganj and Chapainawabganj were cancelled yesterday, thus affecting passengers of more than a dozen districts connected to the network.  Nurun Nahar, along with her elderly grandmother, came to Kamalapur Railway Station at 6:10am to catch Sundarbans Express to go to Khulna. At the station, they came to know about the cancellation. When a correspondent of the newspaper talked to her at 2:20pm, she was waiting for her maternal uncle to take them back. Rumi Khatun, who underwent a surgery at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, came to the station along with her mother around 2:00pm to go to Sirajganj. \"How will we go home now?\" she said, baffled, after knowing the development. Floods already damaged rail tracks at some points in northern region. Meanwhile, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) said all the rivers, except for the Padma, were showing a falling trend. Its flood bulletin said the Jamuna and the Surma will show a falling trend in the next 72 hours, meaning the flood situation in northern and northeastern regions will continue to improve over the next three days. However, the water level of the Ganges will continue to rise for two more days. Low-lying areas of several districts including Manikganj, Munshiganj, Faridpur and Madaripur along the Padma in the central part of the country remained inundated. Our Munshiganj correspondent reports that villages in Lauhajang upazila were submerged by knee to waist-deep water. Furthermore, strong currents in the Padma have been hampering ferry services on the Paturia-Daulatdia route for the last seven days. Hundreds of vehicles have been stuck in Paturia of Manikganj and Daulatdia of Rajbari -- the two ends of the main river route between the capital Dhaka and the south and south-western districts. Of the 16 ferries available, four to five have to be repaired in the floating workshop at Paturia terminal, our correspondent reports, quoting Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC) office sources. Our Rajshahi correspondent reports, some 2,000 families of 15 char areas of Chawkrajapur union in Bagha upazila of Rajshahi have been marooned for the last one week as the Padma continued to swell yesterday worsening the flood situation. Although the upazila administration distributed some relief on Saturday, most of the affected people were still struggling without receiving any help, said Azizul Azam, chairman of Chawkrajapur union.

      "text": "There is no doubt that Sri Lanka's President Sirisena's visit to Dhaka earlier this month and the 14 Agreements and MOUs signed with the Bangladesh government, mark a new and significant advance in bilateral ties. The sectors covered are wide ranging and include information technology, agriculture, education, trade, investment, banking, shipping, tourism, media and collaboration between foreign- service academies and others.  The broad aim is to assist each other in areas of comparative advantage. The relationship of the two countries already has a long history. They are both Commonwealth countries within the South Asia region and share membership of many regional and international organisations such as SAARC, SAFTA, APTA, BIMSTEC, WTO and UN organisations. Both countries have many points of similarity, such as a large diaspora settled abroad and migrant workers supporting respective economies by their remittances. A new era opened in January 2015 when Maithripala Sirisena, heading a 'rainbow' reformist coalition combining Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims, won the presidential election. It is against this positive scenario that President Sirisena came to Bangladesh on a three day state visit, from 13 to 15 July 2017. It was felt on both sides that this was the right time to forge strong bilateral relations.          To cite a few examples, in Bangladesh approximately 77 percent of its workforce and two thirds of its rural areas are agricultural. Although in a vulnerable country susceptible to climate change, floods and saline intrusion this sector has made significant strides in reducing poverty from 48.9 percent in 2000 to 31.5 percent by 2010. Irrigation, high yielding rice crops, judicious marketing, flood tolerant rice varieties, positive government policy, collaboration with aid agencies, training and investment has brought results. It is now focusing on diversification and use of new technology to further raise the quality and the range of agricultural products for export. Sri Lanka has a relatively conservative agricultural sector which can be upgraded by sharing experience, both between agricultural institutes and at grassroots levels.   Bangladesh, meanwhile, has a lot to gain from Sri Lanka in terms of taking the latter's best practices to improve the education sector at all levels. Sri Lanka has a high quality, market oriented and ICT based education system, able to take advantage of remarkable innovations in technology which require skilled human resources. Its higher education is very competitive and selective. Emphasis is placed on English language ability, ICT and mathematics. Examinations test not only students' knowledge but their cognitive skills and analytical abilities.  The aim is to produce a creative and innovative management and work force with good analytical ability. Less than 15 percent of students qualifying from good secondary schools can enrol in higher education. The remainder can find alternative routes through the Open University, vocational colleges or by going abroad. Teachers are well trained, student assessment is stringent and education generally is of an international level. In the area of disaster management Bangladesh is a leader and Sri Lanka can benefit from our experience in this field. The government through 'National Plan for Disaster Management' has taken a holistic approach to implement resourceful methods to help its people during floods, cyclones, droughts  and other adverse impacts of climate change. They include institutionalising a risk reduction framework and imaginative strategies to assist the target population. Early warning, disaster shelters, food supply, medical assistance and proactive rehabilitation procedures are in place and are being further improved. NGOs, CBOs, resource groups all make concerted efforts to mitigate disaster. During his visit President Sirisena commented that he would \"explore the possibility of getting some help from Bangladesh regarding disaster management and recovery.\"  The banking system of Sri Lanka is strong and vibrant, with the prestigious Central Bank known for its proficiency. The Colombo Stock Exchange is one of the most modern in South Asia, with fully automatic trading system, monitoring procedures and, transparent methods. Here Bangladesh can learn from the Sri Lankan model.   Both countries promote tourism. Sri Lanka's tourism has revived as stability returned. Two million tourists visited Sri Lanka in 2016.  Yet despite its many places of historical and natural interest, Bangladesh attracts far fewer tourists. It is felt that with enabling infrastructure and facilities it also could attract large number of foreign tourists. Bangladesh can assess the facilities of Sri Lanka for its own benefit.    Bangladesh is a vibrant growing economy with the second largest RMG sector in the world after China. The mostly female garment workers are skilled and together with ancillary industries form a formidable workforce. Its economy is being further strengthened by diversification into light engineering, pharmaceuticals, leather goods, and construction. In these areas of RMG, together with agriculture and climate management Bangladesh has shown itself to be both creative and strong thereby enhancing its growth and potential. Its GDP growth rate in 2017 is 7.5percent, one of the highest in the region. Sri Lanka's strength lies in sound financial management; a robust banking sector; vibrant commerce;  technological expertise; quality education; skilled human capital;  tourism and a strong shipping sector, due both to good management and geographical location. The country in its post-conflict era has been able to achieve prosperity in an ethnically diverse society. Its GDP growth rate in 2017 is 5.0percent.  Prime Minister Hasina has also highlighted the importance of both states working together in various sectors addressing common issues such as drug trafficking and illegal immigrants. Bangladesh also solicited Sri Lanka's support for its candidature as a non-permanent member of the UNSC. President Sirisena assured his support. Sri Lanka is India's second largest trading partner in the region. The new agreements and MOUs should in time help make Bangladesh and Sri Lanka stronger trading partners to mutual benefit. President Sirisena's visit to Dhaka demonstrates a wider trend of smaller Asian countries becoming increasingly prepared to engage in more bi-lateral trade and investment amongst themselves by- passing any strains in regional politics. Selina Mohsin is a former ambassador."

      "text": "Although every year during this time farm labourer from different regions of the country go to the haor areas to harvest boro paddy, this year farmers are facing a labourer crisis to harvest their crops. The fear of the coronavirus infection and the lockdown enforced by the government are the reasons behind this. Although harvesting boro is a major source of income for many of our labourers across the country, this year some are willing to let go of the income while others are either not finding any transport or do not have the money to go to the boro producing areas for work due to the country-wide shutdown. We are concerned because if the boro harvest cannot be started in a week in the haors, either rains or flash floods will destroy the crops. Since boro is one of the major crops grown in the country, it is crucial to harvest the crops on time to ensure food security. The government should make a proper plan and implement it within a week to ensure that crops are harvested in due time. It has already taken some measures to solve the problems our farmers in the haor areas are facing. The agriculture ministry has allocated Tk 110 crore to help farmers buy harvester machines at a subsidy and is also making special arrangements for transportation of labourers from different districts to the haor areas. Also, the prime minister already announced a stimulus package of Tk 5,000 crore to provide financial assistance to the small and medium farmers, which is commendable. However, for the time being, the government should focus on boro harvest and solving the labourer crisis. Allocating money to help farmers buy harvester machines will do little to help the small and marginalised farmers. We think, agricultural equipment--combine harvesters, reapers, transplanters, etc.--should be provided to the farmers free of cost. Since even the rich farmers do not want to buy the machines because they only have to use it once a year, bringing the machines from other districts to support them seems like a good idea. However, there is no alternative to bringing in more labourers to harvest the crops, ensuring that they take proper precautions and are provided with appropriate safety gear. Since there seems to be some confusion regarding transporting labourers from outside the Sylhet region amid shutdown, the ministry should give a proper directive on this. Also, non-agricultural workers of the respective districts who have lost jobs due to the shutdown can be engaged in agricultural work to solve the crisis to some extent. But before doing that, the government should develop a mechanism to oversee that the workers maintain the physical distance and take necessary safety precautions while working in the field."

      "text": "British newspaper, The Telegraph, recently reported on Bangladesh's quadrennial FIFA World Cup frenzy this way: \"Rival supporters of Argentina's Lionel Messi and Brazil's Neymar fought with machetes in the town of Bandar. One man and his son were critically wounded in the incident, according to police reports.\" Violence among machete-wielding fans has been reported across Bangladesh since the World Cup kicked-off. People got electrocuted while hanging large flags from electric poles. One Argentine supporter committed suicide, unable to bear his favourite team's humiliating defeat by Croatia. The fans who died have been called \"World Cup martyrs!\" We may choose to consider this obsession an innocent national \"fun\" or a forgivable expression of the derogatory term hujuge Bangalee. But, is there something deeper than the mere love of World Cup football? As I saw Brazilian, Argentine, and German flags flying high in Sunamganj (Sylhet) or Anwara (Chittagong), I kept wondering why Bangladeshis become so enamoured with countries that are so far away, with no ethnic or blood ties. Argentine supporters in Feni brought out a raucous procession through the city with a kilometre-long blue-white flag! In Narayanganj, a fan has named his high-rise apartment building \"Brazil Bari,\" literally a three-dimensional Brazilian flag and an improvised museum of Brazil's World Cup paraphernalia! And, Amjad Hossain, a 69-year-old farmer in Magura has made a tricolour German flag, stretching 5.5 kilometres (3.4 miles), and requiring an entire village to unfurl it in a local school ground. Where did he get the money for this \"lengthy\" aspiration? He reportedly sold a portion of his inherited farm land. Some people are also deeply offended by this zealotry and dismiss it as a peculiar cultural infantilism. The fanatic devotion may well have deep roots in the era of electronic media, globalisation, Bangladesh's own socio-political history and the cultural evolution of its people, its vulnerable geography, etc. But let's start with a few basics. The fascination with Brazilian football started with the Pele myth, a pre-TV phenomenon that neatly transitioned into the global era of live telecast in the early 1980s. Argentina's football domination began with the World Cup championship in 1978. The country's football legacy that Mario Kempes created that year reached stratospheric heights with the emergence of the demigod, Diego Maradona, and his otherworldly skills that helped Argentina win the championship again in 1986. I recall how electrified Bangladesh was by Maradona's \"hand of God\" goal against England (Argentina's defeat by the United Kingdom at the Falklands War in 1982 already generated much popular sympathy for the country) and one-man demolition of Germany. In the popular imagination, Argentina and Brazil offered some kind of challenge, albeit through sports, to Western hegemony. The football rivalry of the two South American neighbours found its most unlikely but animated host in Bangladesh during the 1980s, 1990s, and onward. Argentina was champion in 1986 and runners-up in 1990. From Maradona to Lionel Messi, there has been a soaring narrative for many Bangladeshis. Brazil was champion in 1994, 2002, and runners-up in 1998. Germany, too, began to be popular with Bangladeshis as they were runners-up in 1986, champion in 1990, and again runners-up in 2002. Many Bangladeshis seemed eager to adopt these countries as their own football \"nation\". Despite Zidane's immense popularity, France never quite became a star in the firmament of Bangladesh's football love. The admiration for football prowess is hardly enough to explain Bangladesh's extreme emotionalism, and affiliated violence, during the World Cup. Does the country's geography have to do something with the emotional character of its people? Crisscrossed by rivers and canals, and prone to cyclones, storms, and floods, the deltaic land and its people have long developed an existential angst for survival against natural calamities. Bengalis tend to inherit this mental state as a form of \"genetic memory\". To overcome the wrath of nature, people internalise a perpetual and innate need for beneficial myths, heroes, and a host of other sociocultural anchors that serve as a lighthouse, a source of inspiration. Our popular myths are often related to our precarious riverine geography and the heroes who guide us during hard times, during deluge, river erosion, or storm. Our need for heroes is an existential one. They can be from here, there, or anywhere. They can be real or imaginary. We are eager to believe in, and augment, their supernatural powers. When they help us rise above all kind of adversities, we gravitate toward them like moths. From Khudiram, Master Da Surya Sen, Rabindranath Tagore, Begum Rokeya, and Bangabandhu to boxer Muhammad Ali, Mother Teresa, Mandela, Zidane, Messi, and Neymar, we somehow persuade ourselves to see these figures as saviours or some kind of existential anchors with which we figure out the meaning of our lives and social spheres. When we survive our struggles with their guidance, we become overwhelmed with joy, emotion, and a desire to thank them with extreme, sometimes absurd, devotion. How else does one explain the processions across the country to reverse the death sentence of Baker Bhai, a fictional Robin Hood character in Humayun Ahmed's famous TV serial Kothao Keu Nei (1990)? The Magura farmer Amjad Hossain identified his supposedly successful German homeopathic treatment as the reason for his quadrennial obsession to stitch the longest flag as an homage to the German football team. These acts should not be dismissed as frivolous instances of extreme piety or stupidities. Rather, they should be anthropologically analysed as windows into the emotional state of our national character. As writer Ahmed Sofa suggested in his acclaimed essay, \"The Mind of the Bengali Muslims\" (1976), acts of irrational dedication can often take place in moribund spaces of cultural stagnation. He argued that the kind of social enlightenment that defined the Abbasid Caliphate in Baghdad and the Umayyad Caliphates in Damascus and Andalucia never reached the Indian Subcontinent with the arrival of Islam. Richard Eaton, the American scholar of pre-modern South Asia, suggested that Islam came to the Bengal delta as a \"religion of the plough\", meaning that mass conversion to Islam happened about 500 or so years ago when foreign Islamic saints or dervishes employed local tribes to cultivate their agricultural lands. Extending this hypothesis, we can reason that Bengali Muslims as a people have historically remained more interested in the seasonal bounties of the fertile land than developing a collective cultural ability to abstract the world around them. The uneasy question here is how material wellbeing as a motivator of the devotional character could compromise people's ability to analyse, and sometimes take a dispassionate distance, from the subject of their interest? While this may sound like a high-brow reasoning from an urban bourgeois perch, it may be a necessary question we need to ask to expand the definition of development beyond economic advancement. Bangladesh has been frequently described in recent times as a \"success story\" in economic advancement--some social indicators are also better than neighbouring counties. Yet, how capable are we as a people to think about the world in their complexities and contradictions? Economic growth may not necessarily translate into sociocultural developments. While Amjad Hossain has every right to do whatever he pleases with his land or money, his wish to create the longest German flag reveals an uncomfortable cultural pattern. Did Bengalis inherit some kind of enduring cultural paralysis due to a host of historical evolutions, prohibiting them from seeing the seeming irrationality of their extreme emotionalism? I keep wondering. Meanwhile, I am a supporter of the Brazilian football team. I like it a lot when Brazil scores a goal or wins the cup. Growing up with the Maradona generation, I also appreciate Messi's magical dribbling skills. Yet, am I willing to pay for the longest Brazilian or Argentine flag? Should I?

      "text": "Bangladesh faces more frequent extreme climate events in coming decades due to irreversible changes in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) mountain system and region, the largest source of fresh water after the two poles, suggested a major study. The Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment projected an alarmingly high temperature for the HKH region, which will cause major disruptions in the glacial, hydrological, and ecological systems in the area and beyond.  For Bangladesh, the consequences would be severe and wide ranging. Agricultural productivity and biodiversity would be harmed, some regions would have more rainfall while others would have less, sea level rise would increase damaging more arable land, and the poor would become even poorer, experts said.   More than a third of the ice in the HKH mountain range, also known as the third pole, will melt by 2100, even if governments take necessary measures to limit global warming under the 2015 Paris climate agreement to 1.5 degree Celsius, the assessment said. And if governments fail to rein in greenhouse gas emissions, the region could heat up by 4.4 degrees Celsius by this century's end resulting in the meltdown of two-thirds of the ice caps, according to the assessment report of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development released on February 4. Glaciers in the HKH region, which spans over more than 2,000 miles of Asia, are critical water source for the 250 million people who live there, and 1.65 billion people who rely on the great rivers that flow from it into India, Pakistan, China, Bangladesh and other countries. The report, requested by Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan, was put together over five years by 210 authors. The report includes input from more than 350 researchers and policymakers from 22 countries. The regional impact assessment based on the findings of the report is yet to be done. But experts believe Bangladesh, one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, may have to endure more frequent and longer floods in the monsoon and severe drought spells in the dry season. \"In the initial period, let's say in [the next] 30 to 50 years, the glaciers will melt rapidly and consequently floods in the country is expected to increase. After 50 years, due to lack of ice, the glacier melting will decrease considerably, reducing water flow in the country's river systems,\" A Atiq Rahman, member of the Steering Committee of the assessment, told The Daily Star. Atiq said variability of water flow, from the source up in the north of the country, would put the hydrological cycle of Bangladesh into more uncertainty and this would have severe impact on our agricultural productivity, poverty alleviation efforts, and biodiversity as a whole.   Only 7-8 percent of the water that goes into the Bay of Bengal through Bangladesh are received from rainfall within its territory. The rest comes from sources outside its boundary. The study projected major disruption in the water systems of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, the two mighty rivers that originate in the HKH region and flow over Bangladesh into the Bay of Bengal. The rivers depend on the water from the glaciers, especially in the off-monsoon seasons when water is most needed for crop cultivation. At least 22-28 percent of the water of the Ganges are from melted ice and snow while the percentage is between 10 and 13 for the Brahmaputra, experts said. The flow of the Ganges drops to a sixth during the dry season. The report projected a pattern of heavy downpour and drought in the region. Rainfall will decrease in the northwest and southwest region of the country. This means the drier part of the country is going get even more dry. Abu Saleh Khan, deputy executive director of the Institute of Water Modelling, agreed. \"The situation will be grave for Bangladesh especially in the dry season. There is a huge possibility of drought in the Barind region due to reduced water flow,\" he added. Monsoon in Bangladesh, which regulates its climate cycle, is heavily dependent on the Himalayas and its glaciers, said Abu Syed, one of the lead authors of the HKH assessment. The warm and humid wind from the Bay of Bengal gets condensed in contact with the cooler air of the glacier covered region and causes rain and snowfall, which also helps glaciers. A warmer HKH region will disrupt this cycle, he noted. Syed said rising temperature in the HKH region risks altering the arrival and departure of monsoon causing erratic rainfall - which means heavy downpour as well as droughts - affecting agriculture and livelihoods of millions in Bangladesh.     \"Extreme weather events will be more extreme,\" he added. This would pose as a serious challenge for Bangladesh in achieving the goals to become climate change resilient by 2030, he opined. Syed, also a fellow at the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, said the overall rainfall in the country might not decrease but the change in climate might affect the seasonal and regional distribution of rainfall. The Chattogram Hill Tract and Sylhet region will have increased downpours and suffer the most. Moreover, the variability of water flow would complicate sediment flow and hydrodynamics of the rivers, said Syed, noting that more research was needed on this. He urged the authorities to take note of the report and incorporate necessary risk-management measures into Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, which is scheduled for a review later this year. Because of their huge volume, HKH's melting glaciers are going to add to sea-level rise, compounding problems for Bangladesh, experts said. Scientists have already issued warnings over melting Arctic, Antarctica and Greenland. They said the melt caused sea level to rise 1.32cm over the last four decades and could contribute to 25cm more rise by 2070. The Arctic ice loss has tripled since the 80s. \"Bangladesh has already been affected by sea-level rise. If the trend continues, salinity intrusion and ingression will increase and make more land in coastal areas less productive,\" Atiq said. The amount of salinity affected land in Bangladesh was 105.6 million hectares in 2009 and continues to increase, according to the country's Soil Resources Development Institute. In the last 35 years, salinity increased around 26 percent in the country, spreading into non-coastal areas as well. \"Glaciers in the Himalaya will melt and it is inevitable, and downstream people of the region, including Bangladesh, will be affected,\" Saleemul Huq, Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development, told The Daily Star. \"All the eight countries in the region should come forward and make preparations to face the situation collectively,\" the noted environmentalist said. Mentioning Bangladesh's insignificant carbon footprint, Atiq Rahman called on the big greenhouse gas emitters to take the responsibility and extend help to the affected countries."

      "authors": null,
      "text": "    Gender Based Violence (GBV) is not uncommon in humanitarian settings or humanitarian emergencies, i.e. armed conflicts or natural or man-made disasters. GBV is increasingly reported in situations of emergencies. Study conducted by ActionAid Bangladesh shows 71% of women faced more torture during the flood than what they were facing before and among them 52.3% of women respondents complained about physical violence (2007). GBV is an umbrella term that comprises not only rape and attempted rape, but also sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, physical and psychological/emotional violence, domestic violence, intimate partner violence (IPV), early child & forced marriage (ECFM) and trafficking. These acts of violence can lead to serious consequences to physical and psychological health and social well-being. Due to existing inequalities, gender discrimination and unequal power relations, emergencies hit women the hardest and the recovery period is also the longest for women.  Emergencies have more profound adverse impact on women than men. Studies show that women and young children are at most risk during a humanitarian crisis. In times of emergencies, maternal mortality rate, sexual violence and sexual exploitation against women increase drastically. During emergencies, women lose access to health services such as family planning, prenatal care, postpartum care, etc. The heightened risk of female health and safety makes them vulnerable to disease, violence and death. In addition to above restricted mobility and opportunities to earn money make women and girls economically vulnerable. The reasons for the occurrence of GBV in emergency context may vary from one setting to another. In refugee camps, for example, living in crowded shelters, accessing latrines and bathing spaces at night, going to marketplaces and lack of lighting in the camps put women and girls at risk of harassment and/or GBV. In addition, a large number of women suffer from sexual and psychological abuse in the relief shelters and relief queues. Displacement can increase the incidence of GBV, both in initial temporary shelters and when displacement becomes protracted. Disasters cause impoverishment which can induce some people (mostly women) to adopt negative coping mechanisms, including transactional sex. In order to achieve gender equality before and during a humanitarian crisis and to maximise the contributions of humanitarian responses, it is crucial to keep women and girls at the centre of the planning. A gender-integrated approach that empowers women and girls and also engages men and boys, is crucial for achieving long-term positive change, transforming deeply entrenched inequalities and developing resilience. Considering Bangladesh's current humanitarian priorities, ActionAid Bangladesh, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and The Daily star have jointly organised a roundtable discussion on \"GBV in Development and Humanitarian Settings: Accountability of Stakeholders and Policymakers\" on November 29, 2018. Here we publish a summary of the discussion.       Farah Kabir, Country Director, ActionAid Bangladesh        We have come together for this roundtable to have a conversation and raise awareness on gender- based violence against women in humanitarian settings and also to look at the issue of accountability of different stakeholders. This is not the first time that gender-based violence (GBV) is occurring in a humanitarian setting. It's not that we don't know about it but we need to discuss how much we know, how aware we are, and what we can do. Incidents of gender-based violence do not happen in isolation; it's a reflection of the gender discrimination that exists in society. In humanitarian settings or emergencies, it is one of the primary duties of stakeholders and policymakers to address gender-based violence following a comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach so that we can address gender-based violence through interventions for prevention, mitigation and response. We have to do this work simultaneously, because there is an existing scenario and there is also the traditional norms and practices in a community, and women are being further disadvantaged because of the emergency. It is very important to promote women's equal participation at all levels. The humanitarian actors should recognise women's rights as a non-negotiable agenda, develop strategies and design programmes to include the most vulnerable and marginalised women, build on women's existing capacities, address barriers to women's leadership, strengthen women's access to resources, and create safe spaces for women and girls to organise and mobilise. At every level, we need to hear women and children's voice in an effort to make this process more gender sensitive. Grassroots women rights organisations are usually the first responders in emergency settings, and hence it is important to ensure that these organisations or local organisations are not only engaged on the periphery, but are also encouraged and funded to deliver gender-based violence response and prevention programming. All stakeholders, including the government, UN agencies, law enforcement, and development organisations, need to have certain policies, operating procedures and standards, and they need to be very aware of the sexual exploitation and abuse. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be in place for submission and receipt of complaints, reporting, investigation and victim assistance to Protection from Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA). Since 2013, ActionAid Bangladesh has been promoting women-led emergency response across its all humanitarian programme which also includes playing watchdog role in reducing gender-based violence in emergency. Drawing from the concept of building back better, AAB is investing in women, particularly in young women, to take leadership in responding to humanitarian crisis in a way that helps community to rebuild considering future disasters. Since 2014, AAB has been implementing resilience intervention through women leadership setting indicators including women's social economic, instructional, infrastructural and environmental capacity to strengthen localise resilience action.  Gender-based violence (particularly domestic and intimate partner violence) in emergency is largely neglected. These kinds of violence are considered universal and prevail in women and girls' lives prior to, during or after a crisis. Collecting data to demonstrate the prevalence of GBV is challenging. Mainly due to underreporting, there are difficulties in capturing and recording incidents, and discrepancies between different data collection and analysis methodologies appear. Reporting and law enforcement mechanisms, as well as services for survivors of GBV, are often disrupted by the crisis, which also hamper the collection of data on GBV's prevalence. Looking at the comprehensiveness of building resilience including humanitarian response, the process of advocacy and programming requires the actors to bring ideas to reduce the gender-based violence into designing and implementation. ActionAid Bangladesh has been championing the integration through sharing examples of good practices of reducing gender-based violence across all sectors of the society.   Eiko Narita, Deputy Representative, UNFPA\n As we now come across various humanitarian settings, including the recent Rohingya crisis, one thing that has always been consistent is that people most frequently report the shelter, water and food needs. We get so many requests providing evidence of the needs of all these aspects, and yet when it comes to gender-based violence, it somehow gets the least importance. This is because of the shame and stigma attached to GBV. I am so happy that we are having this conversation because I believe that we really need to talk about this issue. We have to look at this issue in terms of the context in Bangladesh, as it is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. While there are annual natural disasters like floods and cyclones, the country is also now laced with a humanitarian crisis. Bangladesh has one of the highest child marriage incidences. According to a report, during Cyclone Roanu, which hit around seven districts, 38 percent of women were exposed to some sort of gender-based violence. It's not that gender-based violence only spurs during humanitarian crises, but the problem exacerbates during such times, and we have got to do something about it. I hope to have an honest and frank discussion amongst the allies present here. Even if it may be difficult to talk about it, we need to talk about it. I also hope that it will charge us to move forward in a much more proactive way, from speaking about it to actually doing something about it. I would like to reemphasise that one of the first things we need to do is raise our voices on this issue, especially because women, girls and even young boys, are often not able to voice their problems in these situations. We need to maintain confidentiality in handling the data of GBV so that people feel safe sharing their experiences. For every woman and girl who share their story, there are many more who remain silent, but each shared story gives the silent majority more hope, courage and confidence. Hence, we should work with the media to take these stories to the world.   Elita Karim, Editor, Culture & Entertainment, and Star Youth, The Daily Star\n There is a high-risk area near Benapole where young girls are illegally trafficked across the border. Their parents themselves sell these children to the traffickers so that they can earn a livelihood. Even after they were rescued, they can't return to their regular life or play like other kids because of the stigma now associated with them.   Little things shape up the way we think; this starts from when a girl child is born in a family. Discriminations begin right from the beginning, and that's how a family is shaped and that's how the children of the family are taught to think. Many educated women, in fact, are conditioned to think that they deserve less when it comes to property in comparison to their brothers. If we need to address gender-based violence in any setting, we need to address the way both men and women are conditioned to think.     Shashanka Saadi, Head of Emergency Response, BRAC International\n Gender-based violence is underestimated in most disaster settings. Even five years back, not much specific attention was paid to protection mechanisms in the preparedness process for an emergency setting whereby humanitarian or grassroot organisations could measure or prevent gender-based violence in such settings. At present, guidelines exist but because of our socialisation, gender-based violence continues to be a lower priority issue especially in humanitarian settings. If we had integrated protection in our preparedness mechanism from the beginning, the first step would have been to create a safe zone for women and children. We only realised the need for this after six or so months. During the floods in 2004, women faced increased violence and they were afraid to stay in the flood shelters. It's the same scenario for cyclones, flash floods or any kind of disaster. If we do not integrate the protection process in the preparedness, orientation and awareness building of humanitarian workers, it will be very difficult to even address the issue. Domination and coercion are aspects of power, and that's where social change comes to play. Many women in humanitarian settings don't think that it's a crime that they are beaten up, as they think it's their husband's 'right'. When women and girls share their experiences in child-friendly and women-friendly spaces in Rohingya camps, they express how the male adults of the family discourage them from attending these spaces because they feel that they will learn things that are not 'permitted in their society,' which is a challenge to men and to the existing power relations. We need to first initiate social change to ensure protection for women and children in humanitarian settings. Social change needs to begin at schools and at the policy level. Trainings and awareness on their own will never be sufficient if the state and law enforcement bodies do not act accordingly or strongly to combat GBV.    Dilruba Haider, Programme Specialist, UN Women\n Across all humanitarian organisations, most programmes are designed and implemented by men. It's natural for men to not understand women's plights. Despite all good intentions, therefore, humanitarian programmes fail to understand the real issues of gender and equality dynamics. In fact, many development workers lack understanding and knowledge about what violence means. Gender-based violence in humanitarian settings is least thought about, and hence the need for us to pay more attention to accountability with regards to violence and sexual abuse. There has been a staggering amount of cases of GBV in Rohingya camps but not that many reports have come up highlighting this issue. UN Women, with ActionAid, runs multiple women centres where women are encouraged to talk and seek support for trauma and violence, but we don't seem to get a lot of women standing up. There is stigma but there is also the inherent issue of the way women are raised. Women are raised as beings who are supposed to contain all the problems that they face. We have to create an environment where women are encouraged to speak out about the atrocities committed against them. Refugees are most at risk and vulnerable against sexual exploitation and abuse when compared to victims of natural disasters or other humanitarian disasters. Victims of floods or cyclones still have their social network and social capital as they are within their own village. In refugee situations, you don't know anybody and have zero power to report anything to anybody.   Rahima Sultana Kazal, ED, AVAS\n We are working at the southern part of the Barisal division to reduce the intensity of gender-based violence. A series of natural disasters like Sidr, Aila, Mahasen and river erosion incurred significant damages to this territory. Gender-based violence reached its peak during Cyclone Sidr and the salinity crisis, but it became less apparent during Cyclone Aila. People did not seek shelters during the tropical storm Mahasen, and therefore, large scale gender-based violence was not reported. Men in the region move to cities as the natural disasters impede their livelihoods. Due to the fear of land grabbing, women and girls are left behind, thereby giving miscreants the chance to abuse them. During natural disasters, menstruating adolescent girls often face harassment at the shelters. They are forced to sit in a corner of the shelter as they are considered 'unclean'. Additionally, the toilets are situated outside the shelter, creating opportunities for further abuse. Like national elections, natural disasters result in the widespread practice of early marriage in these regions. Parents fear that agitation in the post-election period will lead to the trafficking, rape and murder of adolescent girls, and so they get their daughters married off as early as possible, even without completing registration formalities.  Before Mahasen, we encouraged the participation of young women volunteers for our programmes with a view to controlling harassment in the disaster-prone area. During Mahasen, we introduced women-led emergency response projects to reduce gender-based violence. As part of the women resilience project, we facilitated women to build financial capability and taught them skills to confront the disasters. They later dispensed their learnings to other women. We are now collaborating with ActionAid to enlighten girls about good and bad touches. We believe that gender-based violence can be reduced if we create awareness and leadership among adolescent girls.   Gawher Nayeem Wahra, Convenor and Member Secretary, Disaster Forum\n Humanitarian workers employed by organisations are also often responsible for gender discrimination and abuse. Granted that development organisations like ActionAid has a gender-related policy in its mandate, but they lack the mechanism to monitor the people working with them for humanitarian response. We should remember that these people grow up in a setting where abuse is common. HR departments should be a part of such discussions as they extensively deal with recruiting, monitoring and dismissal. We are guided by the misconception that having a women-led workforce will generate a gender-sensitive response, but the reality can be very different. If we develop a mechanism to listen to the affected people, we can probably generate a solution for GBV. We are looking for an alternative solution for cyclone shelters. The construction cost of a cyclone shelter is equivalent to the cost of 32 individual houses. A cyclone shelter can accommodate 1,200 people, whereas over 2,000 people can seek shelters in the individual houses. We saw a similar project in Patuakhali that creates safe space for disaster-affected people and have contributed in reducing the number of child marriage. The government has received a fund to build 500 cyclone shelters; we believe it'd be feasible to use the funds to construct individual houses instead. We also noticed the widespread practice of GBV in the Rohingya community. Our experience tells us that we need to have a concrete plan for intervention. We also noticed that some foster parents are interested in adopting unaccompanied and separated girl children who are later trafficked to an unknown destination. This is a very alarming issue and needs to be strongly addressed.   Kashfia Feroz, Manager, Women Rights and Gender Equity, ActionAid Bangladesh\n When the development actors responded to the landslides in Rangamati, they could not step outside the traditional concept of humanitarian assistance. We consider the distribution of foods and management of shelters but we do not take the special demands of the community into account. When we went to provide dignity kits to the female victims of the landslide, we had to enlighten them about the importance of these kits. We realised that gender sensitivity is essential in order to design and plan our programme. We are aware of the gender-based violence taking place at shelter homes, but unfortunately, we do not have any evidence-based data and media coverage in this regard. Pregnant women do not get the facility of having additional nutrition at shelter homes, and lactating mothers do not have privacy to breastfeed their children. We need to redesign our planning process to prioritise the need for protection in our services. Every organisation should include GBV as part of their mandate. In addition, media coverage should be encouraged to promote sensitivity and to formulate necessary steps.   Shamima Pervin, Senior Programme Officer- Gender, UNFPA\n When we mobilise resources, most donors prefer to see the immediate outcomes of our actions. The context of GBV is very different and it is impractical to consider that we can change the mindsets of people overnight. We have multiple programmes to reduce the intensity of GBV, but what we are missing is the nexus between development and humanitarian settings. When we initiate any GBV-related project, we only do it to facilitate the development in our community, but we do not consider its applicability on the ground of humanitarian crisis. GBV escalates during humanitarian interventions for factors such as, malfunction of the system, failure of the institutions, etc. While responding to the cyclone Roanu in 2016, UNFPA's study reported that an adolescent girl faces two types of fear: a) the fear of the impending flood and b) the fear of spending nights with unknown men. It has also been observed that there is only one toilet at the shelter home. The men stand forward in the queue, and women are forced to use open spaces, exposing them to a more vulnerable environment. Our inter-agency guidelines prompt us to take GBV as an issue requiring protection and to make intervention regardless of the presence or absence of concrete evidence. Coordinated response and the equal participation from all actors can help us eliminate gender-based violence. Multi-sectoral responses are required to assist the survivors of gender-based violence. Consultation is a must before kicking off any GBV project. Additionally, dialogues between several stakeholders need to be continued to minimise the intensity of GBV.   Mitali Jahan, Programme Manager, HRLS, BRAC\n If we do not reduce the trauma of the distressed community and make them aware about gender-based violence, they might not be ready to accept the message. For instance, the women of the Rohingya community in Cox's Bazaar are continuously facing humiliation from their male counterparts. It is not feasible to enlighten them about GBV without reducing their trauma. Countering gender-based violence is not a time-bound project, rather it demands continuous services from the relevant stakeholders. If the authority restricts the presence of policymakers and stakeholders in the Rohingya camp, an accountable platform should be alternatively created which will ensure continuous protection and support to the victims. We can implement alternative dispute resolutions to adjudicate a civil affair in the Rohingya community, but this temporary solution can restart the violence. Our actions will be superficial if we do not trace a case for a longer period. Policymakers need to contemplate about the scope of consultation to combat the GBV. A comprehensive time framework and collaboration between government and NGOs is essential to reach a solution.   Shahida Parvin, Monitoring Officer, Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangha (BNPS)\n We see no changes in the attitude of the people providing services at the shelter home, despite the rise of violence in humanitarian settings. Gender-based violence in our society is resolved through 'mutual understanding', which provides little room for the victim to exercise her rights. The reality gets way worse in the shelters. Nothing supersedes the need of increasing sensitisation and implementing laws. As for the Rohingya camps, we need to implement international laws with support from respective law enforcement agencies and bring the local government under the framework of international law. The planners in charge of camps and shelters should incorporate the issue of menstruation into their agenda and rethink the sanitation facility."

      "text": "I recently took a group of international young researchers from a number of countries on a field visit from Dhaka to the south coast around Khulna to demonstrate to them how Bangladeshis have adapted over the centuries and more recent decades to changes in the ecosystems in which the people live. However, it came to light that adaptation was not equally successful for everyone. There are losers as well as winners.  In this column I will describe three such adaptations in three ecosystems in Bangladesh, from the central to the southern part of the country.  The first ecosystem is the freshwater floodplains of the major rivers like the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna in the central Bangladesh. These major rivers have made Bangladesh what it is over thousands of years and the people living in the floodplains of these mighty rivers have adapted to their ecosystems over centuries.  The main characteristic of these floodplains is that they flood during the monsoon season when the entire floodplain becomes one sheet of water. These water bodies, locally known as beel, are a common property resource and are teeming with hundreds of species of aquatic life, from fishes to snails, which can be caught by fishers and non-fishers alike during the flood period.  Once the monsoon is over the waters recede and the land emerges. The land is now private property and is then farmed (usually rice or jute) by the landowner. This crop belongs to the landowner. The farmers try to make sure that they can harvest their crops before the next monsoon floods begin getting stronger.  Occasionally, the rivers have unusually strong or untimely floods which do not give sufficient time to the farmers to harvest before the floods in which case the farmers lose their crop.  This pattern of life is what can be described as the age-old, traditional adaptation of people to living in the floodplain of these rivers.  As we go further south from the freshwater floodplains to the district of Bagerhat, we begin to see a change that has occurred over the last few decades, namely the intrusion of saline water from the tidal rivers during a part of the year. This makes the water brackish and no longer suitable for growing rice throughout the year. The initial reason for the intrusion of saline water upstream because of tidal causes was the reduction in low season water flows in the Ganges river, mainly due to upstream withdrawal from the river. However, this salinity intrusion will exacerbate because of sea level rise due to human-induced climate change.  During the last few decades however, the landowners in this brackish water zone have developed, partly on their own and partly with assistance from the government, researchers and NGOs, a way to convert their plots of land to shallow ponds, locally called gher (enclosure), that they could use for aquaculture for part of the year during the monsoon season and also grow a crop of Boro rice during the dry season.  They also discovered that they could grow the giant freshwater prawn (locally known as Golda chingri) which can be sold at an attractive price in the market.  Thus, over the last couple of decades the entire area has transformed from being used to primarily grow rice only to aquaculture/rice, and the income from Golda chingri has made landowners much better off economically than before when they grew only rice throughout the year.  This has led to the district of Bagerhat sometimes being referred to as the \"Kuwait of Bangladesh\" as they have discovered the \"white gold\" of Golda chingri.  As we travel further south towards Khulna and Satkhira, the salinity levels get much higher and unsuitable for growing Golda. Here, the main adaptation that has taken place in the last two decades or so is to grow another species of tiger shrimp (locally called Bagda chingri) which can withstand much higher levels of salinity.  However, methods of farming Bagda shrimp are very different from farming Golda shrimp, making the former a more questionable kind of adaptation.  The first difference is in the size of the enclosures needed for growing the two types of shrimp. Golda can be grown in ponds of the size of a farmer's plot while Bagda needs much bigger plots to maintain flow of saline water. Hence in the areas where Golda is grown, the farm owners can do their own aquaculture while in the Bagda-growing areas the landowners either sell or lease their small plots to an outsider who invests in a large area to grow the Bagda shrimp. Local farmers cannot practice this type of aquaculture by themselves and are often forced to lease out their land.  The second difference is the fact that when Bagda shrimp is grown in an area it makes the entire area saline and often kills all the surrounding vegetation, including even homestead gardens of the people living around the enclosures.  The third difference is in who benefits from the adaptation and growing of Bagda shrimp in the most saline zones of the coast. Clearly, the owners of enclosures have made millions and so have the owners of the shrimp-processing factories in Khulna (often also enclosure owners themselves) by exporting shrimp to Europe, US and Japan.  These owners of factories and enclosures own property not just in Khulna or Dhaka but also in London, New York and Geneva! So there is no question that they have benefited from this adaptation. The government of Bangladesh also earns billions in export earnings from Bagda shrimp. What remains a concern however is whether the local people living in the Bagda-growing areas have really benefited as they can no longer grow rice and even other vegetation is being decimated by salinity intrusion.  As for employment, there are women to de-shell the shrimp after it has been harvested but the main employment in the enclosures is for guards and the owners of these enclosures who usually bring guards from outside the area as they fear that the local people will steal their shrimp.  The farmers, entrepreneurs, government, researchers and NGOs of Bangladesh have a long history of adaptation to the conditions in which they find themselves, including the ecosystems and the changes in those ecosystems. However, not all adaptation is equally suitable for everyone.  The goal of any future adaptation to climate change requires us to factor in the dimension of equity to ensure that the poorest and most vulnerable communities are placed at the centre of any adaptation measures undertaken by the government or other actors.  Fortunately, we have a rich history of adaptation--both good and bad. And we must make sure that we learn from our lessons.

We need greater support for climate change adaptation,\" she said at an intervention on climate issues at the G7 Outreach Leaders' Summit at Manoir Richelieu Hotel in La Malbaie here. The prime minister said available climate financing has to be augmented and facilitated for Bangladesh. The countries like Bangladesh also need support to capacity building, technology development and transfer in areas like agriculture, public health and disaster management. She appreciated Canada's commitment to support the poor and most vulnerable countries to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, commending Canada's pledge to contribute US$ 2.65 billion over the next five years to help the developing countries to tackle the climate change issue and US$ 300 million to the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Sheikh Hasina also sought both financial and technological assistance from G7 countries to tackle global effects of climate change. \"In Bangladesh, we foresee intense floods and droughts and heavier monsoons. Rainfall is increasingly unpredictable. The intensity and frequencies of flooding, cyclone and storms are rising. Upstream salinity intrusion in rivers has increased. Natural fish stocks inland is depleting. In the next 20 years, five to 10 million people may have to move from our coast. Most of our development efforts and gains are at stake due to climate impacts, affecting the poorest most. Every year, Bangladesh spends about 1 percent of its GDP in combating climate change,\" she said. At another intervention on Oceans, the Bangladesh Prime Minister emphasized partnerships between the G7 countries and the vulnerable nations like Bangladesh for sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems. \"Partnerships between the G7 countries and the vulnerable countries like Bangladesh for sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems is critical,\" she said citing examples that Bangladesh has been uniquely supporting millions of fishermen for 65 days when it bans all kinds of fishing in the country's rivers to support natural breeding every year. This has helped Bangladesh conserve its national fish - Hilsa - and doubled its annual harvest in recent years. \"We similarly ban juvenile hilsa fish fry harvesting for eight months in our coastal waters and the Bay. So, we would like G7 to stress that. All the countries should engage in oceans based on principles of mutual trust and respect, and mutual sharing of benefits.\" Hasina suggested that science - technology, innovation capacity - in G7 could be mobilised for protection, preservation, exploitation of sustainable development of oceanic resources. \"Development of adaptive technology and transfer of key technologies is crucial. Marine biotechnology has to be in focus. In tackling plastic littering in oceans, let's consider a range of industrial use and application of jute fibre which can virtually replace all forms of plastics. With jute, world can develop cost-effective bio-degradable alternatives.\" She said Climate-vulnerable countries like Bangladesh need robust innovative finance for 'Blue Economy', not just based on market. \"We look forward to creative leadership from G7 countries to lead and make practical difference for our marine life and people. Let's act before it gets late!\""

Once upon a time, Dholai Khal used to be the life line of Dacca. A deceased senior citizen who lived that time informed me that Dacca was wrapped around by Dholai Khal in two and a half coils (araipanch).  Another historian further informed me that at that time one could not reach Sadarghat from Lalbagh, without crossing a bridge or aqueduct. Every cross-section had a bridge or aqueduct with Dholai Khal flowing underneath it. The corners were spotted with boats docked. In fact it was a familiar sight especially under bridges like Lohar Pool and Babu Bazar Pool. Dacca was surrounded by Dholai Khal, which was a part of the then provincial town. During pre-liberation period the planners of the longest serving ruler preferred to convert Dholai Khal into passageway by directing the water flow through concrete pipes laid below. The massive work was done on the stretch from Narinda end to Nayabzar. Dholai Khal is now a thing of the past. Amsterdam, the capital of The Netherlands is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its ring of canals and monumental buildings. It has 100 kilometers of canals, 1,500 bridges, and also 90 islands. The canals were dug in the 17th century to facilitate the management of water in the deltaic region of Amsterdam being at the mouth of the river Rhine. Holland is a low lying area and Dutch expertise is highly appreciated for its water management. Those who visit Amsterdam, find the round the year limpid water of the canals very admirable. The past heritage of the Netherlands scripted its own way of water management by judiciously laying a network of eco-friendly canals and bridges that make Amsterdam an example of splendid urban grace. The eco heritage of Dacca was also surrounded by a network of canals which is Dholai Khal. Dacca and later Dhaka had its own thoughts on the matter and worked accordingly. "

      "text": "Mosammat Rekha's older cousins grew up unable to read and write, their tiny village so frequently cut off from the nearest school by floods that would rise suddenly in their remote corner of disaster-prone Bangladesh. But seven-year-old Mosammat is learning her ABCs aboard a boat fitted with a classroom and play equipment that is helping children thrive even as climate change alters the world around them. \"We can attend classes even during the rainy season, when our homes are barely above water,\" the seven-year-old told AFP aboard the vessel in Chalan Beel, some 175 kilometres (around 110 miles) northwest of Dhaka. Climate change is already taking its toll across Bangladesh, a densely populated and impoverished country the United Nations has identified as among the most vulnerable to a warming planet. Millions in the low-lying nation are being forced to adapt to overflowing rivers, rising seas and increasingly extreme weather in a country frequented by destructive storms and cyclones. Twenty million people there could be made \"climate refugees\" by the end of the century, a UN panel has warned, turfed out of their homes as rivers swallow towns and seas encroach on coastal communities. In villages like Kalidaskhali on the banks of the Padma River, these forces are already reshaping lives by the hour. As much as five metres (16 feet) of riverbank can disappear in a single day, consuming everything in its path, local government official Azizul Azam told AFP. More than 9,000 people have been displaced by the Padma in just five years, as the main tributary of the Ganges encroaches further and further inland. \"Today my backyard is gone. I had a cowshed over there... now it is just water,\" said Rukaiya Khatun, watching helplessly as chunks of earth disappeared into the turbid water inching towards her home. \"The Padma has devoured everything.\" River erosion -- though long a phenomenon in the delta nation -- is rapidly accelerating due to climate change, said Atiq Rahman, a member of a Nobel Peace Prize-winning UN climate panel. A warming planet has made monsoon rainfall more unpredictable across Bangladesh and melted Himalayan glaciers to the north, turbocharging the waterways that criss-cross the country. Many have struggled to adapt as the river has turned, in the words of one villager, \"wild and furious\". But elsewhere, local ingenuity is finding ways around the turbulent and unpredictable forces of nature. Students at BRAC University in Dhaka last month unveiled a model for a floating bamboo home, one that could survive a flood or be easily relocated elsewhere in case of inundation. In Chalan Beel, floating schools chug along rivers and lakes swollen by floods, bringing education to students long denied a chance to learn in one of Bangladesh's poorest locations. \"Now, they have year-round education,\" said Mohammad Rezwan, head of the Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha charity that runs the pioneering project. Today they run more than 20 \"floating schools\" in the Chalan Beel area. Other charities have replicated the idea in different parts of Bangladesh, where the world's largest river delta empties into the Bay of Bengal. Smaller models are equipped with desks, libraries and blackboards while more elaborate, twin-storey designs also boast slippery slides, monkey bars and swing sets for playtime. Children even learn to use laptop computers, all powered by banks of solar panels atop the boats. At night, once school is over, adults come aboard to learn new techniques for farming in an extreme climate. Rezwan said farmers were being taught how to plant flood-resistant crops in floating seed beds, a possible lifeline for rural communities who can lose a year's harvest when the waters suddenly rise. Bangladesh has invested more than $400 million into a new special agency for adaptation projects, including flood embankments, floating farm technology and mobile water-purification stations. \"It shows how seriously we are taking this,\" said Mukhlesur Rahman Sarker, deputy chief of the government's Bangladesh Climate Change Trust, of the new fund. Simple local innovations have changed lives in a generation in Chalan Beel. Mosammat Jharna, a mother of two, spent her youth hemmed in on all sides by water as unpredictable storm surges and fast-rising floods made walking to the nearest school impossible. She now beams at the floating school anchored near her home -- a symbol of hope for her children, no matter how the landscape changes in the future. \"My dream of educating my children, including my daughter, has come true,\" she told AFP. \"I don't want to see them end up illiterate like me.\"    "

      ],
      "text": "In Bangladesh Constitution, neither of the abovementioned two kinds of rights make their appearance. There has only been an insertion of a provision (Article 18A) concerning environment in 2011 which enunciates that the State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment. In absence of a substantive provision on a fundamental right to safe environment, the approach preferred by States like Bangladesh has been the 'greening' of other human rights. This approach suggests reading the right to safe environment into one or more recognised human rights. In other words, it implies broadening the horizon of rights (such as right to life) to accommodate right to environment within that broadened horizon. The countries that can be considered as such 'painters' who in fact played the most instrumental role in 'greening' human rights are Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. For Bangladesh, the landmark decision of Dr. M. Farooque v Bangladesh read the right to a healthy environment into right to life enshrined in Articles 31 and 32 of the Constitution. This case challenged the validity of some flood action programmes taken up by the government in 1995. It was Farooque's case that let the content of right to life travel beyond its hitherto established sphere. In the post-Farooque era, applicants have gone on to obtain favourable rulings in petitions concerning vehicular and industrial pollution, unlawful construction of brick fields, commercial shrimp cultivation, gas explosion, river encroachments and many others.  For India, the constitutional design in terms of environment is a bit expansive, if compared to that of Bangladesh. Alongside enjoining the State to endeavour to protect improve environment like ours, the Constitution casts a duty on every citizen to help in the preservation of natural environment (Articles 48A and 51A respectively). However, absence of a substantive right to safe environment is a reality for Indian Constitution as well. Hence, the 'greening' of human rights was the preferred approach for India too. In the early 1990s, the Supreme Court of India found 'the right to enjoyment of pollution-free water and air for full enjoyment of life' as coming within the purview of the constitutionally guaranteed right to life (Kumar v State of Bihar). Starting from Kumar, the Supreme Court of India later discovered certain other beads in the thread. In 1995, alongside freedom from pollution of air and water, 'the protection and preservation of the environment, ecological balance, and sanitation, without which life cannot be enjoyed' were also read into right to life. The discussion would remain incomplete, if reference is not made to M.C. Mehta v Union of India (2002) which came out to be one of the most famous decisions due to the mandamus orders issued by the Court to oversee the State's compliance with the court's directions. This approach is also preferred by the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter, ECtHR). This too can be explained with the fact that the European Convention on Human Rights does not have a specific provision on a substantive right to environment. An additional protocol to the Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a healthy environment was recommended; however the need for a substantive stand-alone right to environment was persistently downplayed by the Committee of Ministers. And therefore, greening of human rights is what ECtHR has nurtured. In the Budayeva and Others v Russia (2008) case, the Court gave a glimpse of handling incidences of climate change impacts, such as floods and mudslides. The case involved several deaths and injuries caused by a mudslide, attributable to Russia's failure to repair a dam. Upon recognising the severity of the incident and the applicability of the provision of right to life appearing in Article 2 to 'any activity, whether public or not', the Court's focus was on an expansive reading of the right to life. However, the greening of right to life as undertaken by ECtHR in Budayeva is too cautious of an approach if compared to that adopted in the subcontinent. The unanimous opinion by the Court to the effect that there was 'violation of Article 2 because there were injuries and deaths resulting from the alleged environmental manmade hazard' is problematic in a sense that unlike sub-continent, the Budayeva approach did not read right to environment as an integral part of right to live with dignity as such. It is not only the greening of right to life that we can find in ECtHR's approach rather it has also been the greening of right to privacy. In Di Sarno v Italy (2012), the Court went on to recognise a right of the persons concerned to respect for their private life and their home and, more generally, to enjoy a healthy and protected environment to come within the purview of Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights. There is very little in the European Court's jurisprudence on broader issues as biodiversity, the environmental notion of inter-generational equity or precautionary principle. The African and Inter-American jurisprudence appear to be far richer in terms of environment than that produced by the European Court. Article 24 of the African Charter, on the right of all peoples speaks categorically of right to 'a general satisfactory environment favourable to their development.' This Article alone suffices to explain the approach of the Commission in helping peoples realise their right to environment as a substantive one. In 1994, Ms. Ksentini, Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment for the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, urged the adoption of a human right to a satisfactory environment, meaning a substantive right to environment. Human Rights Council seems to have moved after almost two decades by that urge. In March 2012 the Human Rights Council decided to establish a mandate on human rights and the environment, to study (amongst others) 'the human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and promote best practices relating to the use of human rights in environmental policymaking'. A textual interpretation of the mandate as well as the latest resolutions adopted by Human Rights Council on Human Rights and Environment gives the impression that the Council still does not recognise a substantive human right to environment. Judicial enforcement of environmental rights is tainted with numerous challenges and more often than not faces scholarly criticisms. The notion of 'environment' with its associated lack of certainty and an inherent indeterminacy in terms of the contents, adds more layer to those criticisms. And as a cherry on top, comes the absence of a substantive right in the Constitution or the respective human rights instruments. The road to having a substantive right to environment seems coarse and rough; anything but easy. However, optimistic scholars like Karen Hulme expects that a substantive right to environment may sneak up through the surface as a bi-product of the greening approach. Hulme sees greening approach as 'a transitional stage of environmental rights jurisprudence. The writer works with Law Desk, The Daily Star.\n  "

One of the founders of Dacca Art College (now the Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka), he was a friend and colleague of Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin. From 1948 to 1979, he served as the Head of the Department of Printmaking at the institution. He passed away on May 20, 2012 at the age of 90. Safiuddin Ahmed's art mainly focused on rural panorama, pastoral life, landscapes, memories of 1971, the Language Movement, floods and other natural calamities in Bangladesh, as well as the life of Santals. Safiuddin, known for his woodcut engravings, experimented with the colour black and its mysterious tones, tenors and layers from the beginning of his career. He conveyed the message of peace and harmony through his technically masterful work. His first solo exhibition was held in 2008 by the Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts, on his 86th birthday. A two-part exhibition was later held in December 2010, with all his works, titled Shilper Oshesh Alo. Faculty of Fine Art of University of Dhaka, Gallery Chitrak, Bengal Foundation and other organisations and artists will be paying their respects to the artist by placing wreaths at his grave at the Mausoleum of National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam at University of Dhaka, this morning at 10 am."

      "text": "Bangladesh should make its rural infrastructures such as roads, bridges, schools, hospitals as well as houses resilient to make them durable and safe so that they can help sustain economic growth. \"It's a must for an infrastructure to be resilient and sustainable. It is even more important in the context of climate change,\" Hossain Zillur Rahman, a noted economist, said. \"Given the country's population density, infrastructures are heavily relied upon. So infrastructures should be resilient in the context of intense utilisation. As the country has limited resources, we need to be resilient in that context as well.\" Khan Mahmud Amanat, a professor of the civil engineering department at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, said currently Bangladesh does not face dearth of quality raw materials as local companies can produce high-quality key construction ingredients. There are steel and cement manufacturers who maintain global standards and follow all the processes to maintain quality. But infrastructure projects are not up to par because of bad construction practices by contractors and masons. Their lack of skills is responsible for it. \"No matter how good the construction materials are, if the contractors and masons don't apply the appropriate skills, you will not be able to get a structure of the desired quality.\" \"As a result, the infrastructure will have less durability. We should be careful about it,\" said Prof Mahmud. He said when it comes to the high-rise buildings and structures that are being built in major cities, the developers and contractors are maintaining some sort of quality. But a lot of construction projects are taking place beyond the major cities and in rural areas and the quality of work in those projects is bad. Prof Mahmud thinks raising awareness among the general public holds the key to ensuring construction of better infrastructures. \"Major campaigns are needed to this end. The media has a role to play to spread awareness.\" \"Besides, rules have to be stricter. Skilled workforce has to be employed at the local municipalities and other agencies that oversee the construction of these projects so that they have better control.\" According to Prof Mahmud, if the country can't ensure quality infrastructures, there will be huge economic impact. \"If we use quality construction materials and follow proper standards, the lifespan of a project will be 50 years to 100 years. But if they are not built properly, they may face damages after just a decade. This is already happening. \"This means we will be compelled to spend the money to build an infrastructure after just 10 years instead of after 50 years.\" Md Tarek Uddin, professor of the civil and environmental engineering department at the Islamic University of Technology, said resilient means it would be sustainable and it will withstand the impact of natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes and cyclones as well as salinity. \"We have to put in place infrastructures that are not damaged easily.\" Resilient infrastructures have a role to play in the achievement of a number of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Prof Tarek said Bangladesh should build infrastructures in a manner such that energy consumption is reduced significantly through good design. Residential buildings and infrastructures consume 40 percent of all energy in the world.   Prof Tarek suggested passive design, an approach to building design that uses the building architecture to minimise energy consumption. He said a major part of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) comes from the rural areas. So, if the country could make the infrastructures in rural areas more resilient, it would go a long way. According to Prof Tarek, earthquakes are becoming frequent. So, if structures are built using brick walls instead of reinforced concrete columns, then they would be highly susceptible to the impacts of earthquakes. There has to be a minimum number of columns so that the structures can move in case of earthquakes, instead of caving in. He said there is a lot of salinity in coastal zones such as Chattogram, Cox's Bazar, and Khulna, so any structure in these areas has to be built using proper design and quality materials so that it is able to withstand the salinity.  He recalled that thousands of cyclone shelter centres were built in the 1990s but many of them were damaged within 10 to 15 years.   Prof Tarek said there is a complete lack of awareness about making an infrastructure or structure durable on the part of the users. There is, however, some awareness within the government. The government should take up some programmes in rural areas to raise awareness among all stakeholders, including planners, designers, contractors, sub-contractors, and masons, about the importance of a resilient infrastructure, he said. He said there is a need for long-term planning when building an infrastructure. \"There might be some initial investment, but the risk factors will go down tremendously and there will be an overall benefit. When they see the long-term benefit, they would be interested in building a durable infrastructure.\" Prof Tarek said existing infrastructures such as schools, hospitals, government office buildings, and even houses are not resilient. This is a major problem.     Tapan Sengupta, deputy managing director of BSRM Group, said there is no alternative to using quality construction materials to build sustainable infrastructures. \"You will have to use quality products for longevity. It is not for one-time use.\" He said most steel-makers look at the storage facilities of dealers before awarding dealership to them to ensure that the quality of the product remains intact. So, there is no problem with the availability of quality steel products. Many infrastructures such as schools, roads and bridges across the country are in a dilapidated condition. But Tapan Sengupta said this can be avoided if the people who are in charge of supervision of projects put in additional effort. If quality materials are not used and quality work is not delivered, the life-cycle cost goes up tremendously at the end of the day, he said. Amirul Haque, managing director of Premier Cement, also emphasised on quality construction materials and quality work. He said Bangladesh is producing high-quality construction materials. What the country needs is good workmanship. \"We have to emphasise on producing qualified and skilled people.\" Prof Zillur said an infrastructure's lifespan erodes mainly because of two reasons. \"If there is corruption in the implementation phase of a project, it will eat away the structure's longevity. Another reason is this: in our entire infrastructure-building approach, we don't prioritise the issue of maintenance.\" Prof Zillur, also the executive chairman of the Power and Participation Research Centre, an independent think-tank, said in Bangladesh, the whole bureaucratic and resource allocation culture is to set up new buildings, not maintain the existing ones. His suggestion is this: where infrastructure-building is important, it is crucial to address the issue of corruption, incorporate resilience in the design, and promote maintenance culture. In fact, it pays to make homes safer and schools more resilient. Recent research studies suggest that investing in resilient infrastructure can provide a net benefit of USD 4.2 trillion in low- and middle-income countries, with USD 4 in benefit for each USD 1 invested. Such investments can then improve essential services such as transport, or water and electricity supply and contribute to more resilient and prosperous societies, according to an article published on the World Bank Blogs website recently. Investing in safe and resilient infrastructures, including homes and schools, saves lives, protects livelihoods, and safeguards development, the article said.   In a foreword of a World Bank report, entitled \"Lifelines: The Resilient Infrastructure Opportunity\", published earlier this year, Kristalina Georgieva, then chief executive officer of The World Bank, said resilient infrastructure is about people. \"It is about the households and communities for whom infrastructure is a lifeline to better health, better education, and a better livelihood. It affects people's well-being, their economic prospects, and their quality of life,\" she said. Kristalina, currently the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in developing countries, infrastructure disruptions are an everyday concern. When an infrastructure fails, it undermines businesses, job creation, and economic development. With rapidly growing populations and a changing climate increasing the frequency and intensity of natural hazards, the need to adapt and invest in resilience should be an urgent priority, she said. But there is good news. Around the world, there are many examples of investments that make infrastructure more resilient and more economically robust. Kristalina said rather than just spending more, the focus should be on spending better. \"The message for infrastructure investors, governments, development banks, and the private sector is this: Invest in regulations and planning, in the early stages of project design, and in maintenance. Doing so can significantly outweigh the costs of repairs or reconstruction after a disaster strikes.\""

      "text": "India may keep a ban on onion exports until February because domestic prices have risen after the harvest of summer-sown crops, which were expected to augment supplies, was delayed and damaged by untimely rains, a government official said. The ban on overseas sales by India, the world's biggest exporter of the bulb, will keep prices elevated in Asia and require importers in Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to find other sources to fulfil their demand. Despite the export ban enacted in September to keep domestic supply inside India, prices have surged after rain and floods during October and November limited onion supply, especially in Maharashtra, the country's biggest producer. Wholesale onion prices are about 40 rupees (55 cents) per kg, down slightly from 55 rupees earlier this month, the highest in six years, according to data compiled by the state-run National Horticultural Research and Development Foundation. \"We will think about resuming exports once prices come down. Right now it is not possible,\" a senior government official at the Indian Department of Consumer Affairs said on Monday. \"From January onwards supplies are expected to rise meaningfully. Once prices come down to a comfortable level, say below 20 rupees (per kg), then we can allow exports,\" he said, asking to remain unidentified because he is not authorised to speak to the media. A spokeswoman for India's Ministry of Commerce, which enacted the ban at the request of the Consumer Affairs department, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment on how long the export ban would last. Onion growers and government officials expected the ban would be lifted by the middle of November anticipating higher supplies from the summer crop. Sakharam Darekar, a 79-year-old farmer from the village of Ghodegaon, 180 km (108 miles) east of Mumbai, said that last month's heavy rainfall left fields waterlogged for several days and damaged the onion crop on his 2-acre (0.8 hectares) plot that was ready for harvesting. The rains have also delayed planting of the winter-sown crop by damaging seedlings in nurseries. \"I want to plant onion but seedlings are not available,\" said Dinesh Khairnar, a farmer in the Nashik district of Maharashtra. Since India's ban, onion prices have spiralled in Asia and forcing leading buyers such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to source the crop from Myanmar, Egypt, Turkey and China. But the hefty volumes lost will be hard to replace as India exports more than 2 million tonnes onions per year. \"China or Egypt cannot replace the entire Indian supplies. Asian buyers are waiting for Indian supplies,\" said a Mumbai-based exporter. "

Authorities issued flood alerts in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh as the surging water levels of several rivers, including the Yamuna, threatened to breach the danger marks. Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand were the worst-hit states as heavy rains continued, leaving hundreds of people stranded after the rainfall set off landslides, cut off road links and led to shutting down of hydropower projects and release of excess water from dams in the region. Rain-related incidents claimed at least 23 lives in Himachal Pradesh, four in Uttarakhand while in a Punjab's village, three members of a family were killed when the roof of their house collapsed, police said. Delhi government on Sunday sounded a flood alert for the national capital and asked people living in low-lying areas to move to safer places as the water level in the Yamuna is expected to cross the danger mark (205.33 metres), officials said. The Yamuna was flowing at 203.37m on Sunday evening and is expected to touch 207m on Monday as 828,000 cusecs water was released from a barrage in neighbouring Haryana, an official said. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in Himachal Pradesh said on Sunday that the state received the highest ever rainfall for a 24-hour period, since records began almost 70 years ago. in Uttarakhand, at least 10 people were missing as heavy rains damaged 15 houses in the state's Uttarkashi district and four persons died and 20 others were rescued elsewhere, according to the state's disaster management officials said. In Uttar Pradesh, several rivers, including Ganga, Yamuna and Ghaghra, are in spate. The Ganga is flowing above the danger mark in at least four districts. Heavy rains remained unabated in Haryana and Punjab also on Sunday causing floods in some parts. In Kerala, ground-penetrating radars were pressed into service on Sunday to locate bodies at in Kerala's Wayanad district where massive landslides buried two villages. A statewide calamity report on Sunday said 121 people have lost their lives in Kerala since August 8. As of August 15, a total of 1,058 persons have died due to rain-related incidents during monsoon season that started on June 1 with one-fourth of the deaths reported from Maharashtra."

      "authors": "\nStar Online Report\n",
      "text": "Bangladesh and six other countries are the most extreme climate change hotspots in the world, according to a report of The Guardian. Other countries are - Spain, Malawi, Norway, Brazil, US and Philippines. The report, titled 'From heatwaves to hurricanes, floods to famine: seven climate change hotspots,' gives a subjective appraisal of the seven most important climate hotspots, including Dhaka, Bangladesh, based on analysis of numerous scientific models and personal experience of observing climate change in a variety of places. The Guardian report quotes, Saleemul Huq, director of the Bangladesh-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development as saying, \"In the next 20 years we would expect five to 10 million people to have to move from the coastal areas. The whole country is a climate hotspot, but the most vulnerable area is the coast. Dhaka is the place where people head to.\" Huq, who has advised the Bangladesh government at successive UN climate summits, says there is strong evidence that climate change is now impacting Dhaka, reports The Guardian. \"Temperatures have already gone up by 1C. We can see that the weather patterns have changed. Ask anyone in the street, and they will say the frequency of floods has changed. Bangladesh has a long history of floods, but what used to be a one-in-20-year event now happens one year in five. It is what we would expect with climate change models,\" Huq says. Huq and other Bangladeshi climate scientists expect to see more extremes. \"Changing rain patterns suggest we will not get more rain over the coming years but it will be distributed differently, with less in the dry season and more during the monsoons. Paradoxically, this will lead to more floods and droughts, and heavier monsoons,\" he says. \"We are beginning to see sea levels rising and increased salinity in coastal areas. It is a slow onset, which will get worse. It is a climate change phenomenon and not something we had before.\" Huq leads research into how Bangladesh can adapt to climate change. \"We've done a lot of research looking at the most vulnerable hotspots. We are learning by doing,\" he says. \"Government has now invested in a major climate change action plan. To counter coastal salinity there is a big program of rainwater harvesting and coastal protection. Scientists are developing saline-tolerant rice. People and government are proactive. \"The trouble is that we are always catching up with the problem. There is a limit to what we can grow. At some point we will run out of options, then people will have to move. We know that if we don't take action people will all end up in Dhaka, so [we] need to invest in other towns and cities.\" But the bottom line is that climate hotspots intersect, and nowhere will we escape the changes taking place. What happens in the Amazon affects West Africa; the North American growing season may depend on the melting of Arctic ice; flooding in Asian cities affected by warming on the high Tibetan plateau. And urban areas ultimately depend on the countryside, says The Guardian report. So, we're all in a hot spot now."

      "text": "The interest rate on more than one-third of farm loans banks disbursed through non-governmental organisations in fiscal 2018-19 was as high as 25 percent -- much higher than any loan product in Bangladesh. Considering agriculture a priority sector, the central bank usually sets the interest rate on farm loans at 2-3 percentage points less than the major credit products of lenders. If the loans are disbursed through bank branches, farmers can get them at 9 percent interest rate. But when disbursed through NGOs and microfinance institutions, the rate goes up to 19-25 percent as they take the funds from banks first at 9 percent interest and then give them out to farmers -- defeating the purpose of the scheme. In fiscal 2018-19, banks disbursed Tk 8,298 crore in farm loans through NGOs, which is 35 percent of their total disbursed loans in the agriculture sector. The amount is also 4.28 percent higher than the farm loan disbursement through NGOs and microfinance institutions in fiscal 2017-18.  \"The central bank has taken different initiatives to decrease the banks' dependency on NGOs,\" said SM Moniruzzaman, deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, while unveiling the farm loan policy for fiscal 2019-20 yesterday. For instance, it has repeatedly instructed banks to distribute farm loans through their own channels. \"But it seems they do not pay much heed as farm loan disbursement through NGOs is on the rise,\" said another BB official requesting anonymity. Banks turn to NGOs and microfinance institutions for farm loan disbursement to lessen their supervisory- and recovery-related costs. The central bank earlier instructed lenders to distribute at least 30 percent of their annual farm loan disbursement target through their respective branches, but a number of banks frequently disregarded the rule, the official said. \"There is no credit product in the banking sector for which one has to pay an interest rate as high as 25 percent,\" he added. But the high interest rates will compound the woes of farmers, who have already been hit by a large-scale flood. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) estimated that floods affected farmlands in 26 districts until Friday, including 39,000 hectares of aus fields, 11,000 hectares of aman seedbeds and 10,000 hectares of vegetable farms. \"The high interest rate on farm loan is completely absurd,\" said M Asaduzzaman, a former research director of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies. Banks hand over their responsibility to the NGOs because of their unwillingness to disburse farm loans to the underprivileged farmers, he said. \"But this is having a negative impact on the agriculture sector.\" He also raised a question about the calculation method of the NGOs as there is little scope to charge such high interest rates. \"NGOs usually claim that they are not profit-oriented organisations, but imposing such high rates on farm loans conflicts with their stance,\" he added. Moniruzzaman, however, said the central bank would encourage banks to disburse loans in the rural areas through their agent banking window. Some banks have already started disbursing farm loans through their agents at 9 percent interest rate, he said. \"If required the central bank will provide policy support to them in the interest of the farmers.\""

As part of the initiative, they are rearing and hatching poisonous snakes in a laboratory of the Venom Research Centre, being operated by the medicine department at Chitta-gong Medical College (CMC).  The researchers would collect venoms from the snakes, analyse their properties, and develop techniques to produce the antidote. If the sample antivenom meet the WHO standards, the government would go for mass production. A total of 15 researchers from CMC, Chittagong University (CU), Goethe University of Germany, and Toxicology Society of Bangladesh are involved with the five-year project, which was launched in March 2018. The centre is also breeding rats and lizards to feed the snakes with, and often adds one-day-old chickens to the reptiles' diet. The researchers have collected 60 snakes of three species (viper, cobra and krait) from different parts of the country. Mizanur Rahman, an assistant researcher and zoology graduate of CU, said, \"Apart from collecting snakes, we have hatched 34 snakes in our lab so far.\" According to a 2018 report of the World Health Organization (WHO), seven lakh people fall victim to snakebites in Bangladesh annually and more than 6,000 of them die. This is the second biggest cause of deaths during floods when snakes slither out of their habitats and take shelter in human homes. Dr Aniruddha Ghosh, the principal investigator and associate professor of medicine at CMC, said hospitals treat patients with anti-venoms, but in many cases they do not work and result in deaths. The goal of this research is to develop effective anti-venoms for treating snakebite patients in the country, he added. The problem was explained by Dr Robed Amin, an associate professor of Dhaka Medical College. He said, \"Imported anti-venoms hardly match with the venoms from the snakes in the country. There is a chance of adverse reactions when the patients are administered those. That's why doctors in most cases refuse to use them.\" Bangladesh usually imports anti-venoms from India. Dr MA Faiz, president of Toxicology Society of Bangladesh, said, \"WHO recommends that anti-venoms be made from the snakes of the country where it will be used because the poison properties of snakes vary with geographical locations.\" It was found that the same snakes even within the same country have different compo-sition of venoms if locations change. There are also variations in venom properties of the same snake species, he added. \"So, in 2017, WHO adopted a resolution that snakebite patients would have to be treated with anti-venoms produced in the native country,\" said Dr Aniruddha. \"That's why the government took this initiative.\" There are at least 80 species of snakes in Bangladesh, but only 10 of them are poison-ous (two species of cobras, five of kraits and three of vipers) for humans, according to Dr Aniruddha. Among the three species, bites by kraits and cobras are the principal cause of snakebite mortality, he added. Asked, why CMC was chosen for the project, Aniruddha said some of the teachers here did academic research on snake venoms, and their proposal also convinced the commis-sioning authority, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). Abdullah Abu Sayeed, a co-investigator and assistant professor of medicine at CMC, said the laboratory collects venoms using two techniques. One of them involves a beaker where the snake is made to release the venom. The oth-er uses an artificial environment where snakes are deceived into biting the extraction containers as enemies, he said. \"Now we are analysing the properties of the venoms. It's the first stage,\" said Dr Ab-dullah. \"In the second stage, we will see whether the anti-venoms available in the mar-ket can fully neutralise the effects of the venoms.\" The next stage will be standardisation (documentation of categories and properties) of the venoms. \"Then we will inject a very low dose of venom into the body of a horse or a strong animal,\" said Abdul Wahed Chowdhury, another co-investigator and assistant professor of zoology at CU. \"When injected, the animal body would produce an antibody against the antigen of the venom. We will collect the antibody [a sort of protein] from the animal, do further pro-cessing, and come up with a sample anti-venom in the final stage.\" The entire procedure would follow WHO guidelines. Dr Aniruddha said they would like to have the first anti-venom by 2023. \"Then we will submit it to WHO for approval, which would pave the way for the country to go for mass production of anti-venoms.\" The project is set to cost Tk 8 crore over a period of five years. Anti-venoms are available at all state-run tertiary-level and district hospitals and dis-tributed free to patients in the country, said Dr Abdullah. The upazila health complexes do not keep them, and give primary treatment because administering anti-venoms needs special skills and proper care for patients, he said. One dose costs the government about Tk 15,000-20,000, he added."

Paddy on 50,000 hectares of land was destroyed in 90 villages in Dirai, Tahirpur and Dharampasa upazilas of Sunamganj and 15 villages in Bianibazar, Balaganj and Osmaninagor upazilas of Sylhet, according to a primary estimation of the agricultural extension department of Sylhet.  Prasanna Talukdar, a farmer of Perua village in Dirai upazila, said the hailstorm was so severe that branches of many roadside trees were broken and fell on the paddy fields. Farmers alleged that as the damaged dykes were not repaired, the flood water entered their fields and damaged paddy. Mukaram Hossain, chairman of Sukhair Rajapur Dakhin union in Dharampasa upazila, who visited the affected areas, said the devastating hailstorm damaged crops of 20 villages in his union. Majedul Islam, agriculture officer of Dirai upazila, said he visited different affected areas in the upazila and saw that flash floods and hailstorms damaged paddy of around 1,000 acres of land in 40 villages. Nazmul Haque, Dharampasa upazila nirbahi officer, said he asked all the union parishad chairmen to take immediate steps to save paddy in the haor areas. Firuj Khan, deputy assistant agriculture officer at the Sunamganj agricultural extension department, said paddy of around 29,000 hectares of land was destroyed in the last nine days. Flash floods were hitting different parts of the haor areas every day. In these circumstances, the agricultural extension department officials asked the farmers to harvest their paddy quickly, said Krishna Chandra, additional director of the Sylhet agricultural extension department.   Paddy of over 9,000 hectares of land in Sylhet was damaged, 600 hectares of land in Moulvibazar, 2,000 hectares in Habiganj and over 37,000 hectares of land in Sunamganj, he added."

Records from rain gauges between 3-5 July in the Kutupalong mega camp showed 510 mm. Camp 16 - another major settlement - recorded 530 mm. IOM and partners, including UNHCR and WFP, have been preparing for the monsoon and cyclone season since late 2018 through infrastructure upgrades and awareness-raising campaigns in both the camps and host communities. IOM preliminary damage data covering the period 2-6 July includes: 1,186 households affected by landslides\n\t216 households impacted by flooding\n\t1,840 households affected by wind\n\t15,534 people affected by flooding or other safety risks\n\t391 landslides, 51 wind storms, and 26 floods reported\n\tAs of last July 7 night, IOM damage reports for the previous 24-hour period indicated 13 more landslides, nine windstorms and two floods affecting 2,200 individuals and 432 households.

A notification to this effect has been issued by the country's Directorate General of Foreign Trade, Department of Commerce, Ministry of Commerce and Industries dated 13th September, 2019, it added. \"Export of all varieties of onions...will be allowed only on letter of credit subject to a minimum export price of USD 850 FOB (freight on board) per metric ton till further orders,\" the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) notification said separately. The Indian government last month warned of strict action against hoarding of onion amid supply disruption fears due to floods in parts of major growing states - Maharashtra and Karnataka. It had been decided to cap the retail price of onion at Rs 23.90 per kg for grade A variety of onions. India's retail inflation inched up marginally to 3.21 per cent in August from 3.15 per cent in July, mainly due to costlier food items. India exports on an average 1.5 million tonnes of onions a year and produces around 17-18 million tonnes of onion per year."

Reportedly, the deaths might have been caused by ammonia released from rotten weeds, which is replacing the oxygen dissolved in the water. This is affecting the livelihoods of local people, particularly the Boro farmers who incurred huge losses after this year's harvest. During this time of the year, their only source of income comes from fishing in the haor. Sadly, this is not the first time the fish and other aquatic animals in the haor have died from ammonia contamination. After the flash floods of 2017, there was a similar situation in the haor. Hakaluki haor, which flows over 28,000-hectares of land in four upazilas of Moulvibazar and one upazila of Sylhet, has been declared an Environmentally Critical Area (ECA) under the Bangladesh Environment Protection Act in 1999. This haor needs to be protected at all costs since this is a sanctuary of various species of native fish and aquatic animals. According to the district fisheries department, it is home to 112 species of native fish. If the quality of its water cannot be improved immediately, we may soon witness an environmental disaster in the haor and its adjacent areas.   Therefore, the authorities should investigate the matter and find out the real reasons of water contamination. If the contamination has really been done by ammonia, the pouring of zeolite and timsen into the water could help remove it and bring the temperature of water under control. It is good to know that the district's fisheries departmental has already taken some measures to improve the haor's water quality. But what we think is that they should have taken precautionary measures before the contamination took place, since this is not the first time such contamination happened there. Because of a lack of proper planning of the relevant government agencies in maintaining the environment of the haor, the livelihoods of local people are now at risk.  "

However, Malind Biswas, a sharecropper of Panisail village under Barlekha upazila in Moulvibazar has gained success in broccoli cultivation, growing the foreign vegetable for the first time in the area. The dark green nutritious vegetable resembles popular local vegetable cauliflower. The arable lands around Malind's village submerges round the year except the dry season when farmers mostly cultivate Boro paddy there. \"I was almost broke after losing my paddy during floods in 2017. I cultivated paddy in last Boro season too but I could hardly see any hope of profit by cultivating the usual crop,\" Malind said. \"Then, I heard about the broccoli and decided to cultivate it. I collected 2200 seeds of the vegetable with the help of the upazila agriculture office and planted the seeds in late October last year. The seedlings were then planted on 15 decimals of leased land.  \"I faced problems due to lack of experience in broccoli cultivation but Upazila Agricultural Officer Debal Sarkar and Sub-assistant Agriculture Officer Subinoy Chandra Das helped me with their suggetsions. \"I have already sold 1200 broccoli at Tk 37,000. There are some 1000 broccoli in my field for sale,\" he said, adding that he is planning to increase broccoli cultivation in the next season. He spent around Tk 15,000 for the cultivation.  \"When I started cultivating the foreign vegetable, people laughed at me. But I took the risk and gained success. Now locals honour me as a pioneer. Many of them have shown interest in broccoli cultivation,\" Malind said. Upazila Agriculture Officer Debal Sarkar said they have taken initiative to encourage farmers to grow broccoli as the soil and climate of the haor area is suitable for it. \"Malinda Biswas is cultivating broccoli using locally produced organic fertilizers.  Seeds of the vegetable are sown in the second half of October. Later the seedlings are planted. Flowering takes place within 80 to 90 days,\" he added. Dr Md Sharaf Uddin, chairman of agro forestry and environmental science department of Sylhet Agricultural University, said, \"Broccoli is rich in vitamin K, vitamin C, folic acid, potassium and fibre, which are extremely beneficial for health. It contains sulfurorphine, an ingredient helpful for prevention of cancer.\" The low calorie vegetable is also useful for keeping the heart healthy, he added. The nutritious vegetable is likely to be an economically viable crop in the haor area, said Dr Nurul Haque, health and family planning officer of Kulaura Upazila Health Complex."

      "text": "At present, issues leading to global warming and climate change have arguably become a global priority. Scholars today recognise various vulnerable populations and claim that the impacts of climate change are not spread equally in terms of location, economic status, gender or age. Several studies on the impacts of climate change have identified Bangladesh as one of the most vulnerable countries of the world. Bangladesh faces different natural disasters almost every year, including floods/flash floods, cyclones, storm surges, extreme temperature and drought leading to loss of life and damage to infrastructure and adversely impacting livelihoods. Bangladesh is among the countries most vulnerable to tropical cyclones, and the sixth most vulnerable country to floods. Its citizens are vulnerable to the hostile effects of natural disasters as most of the primary livelihood opportunities are dependent on environmental conditions and access to natural resources.  However, women and men experience disasters differently due to some social and cultural reasons and existing gender norms. Natural disasters magnify the existing inequalities, reinforcing the disparity between women and men in their vulnerability to, and capability to cope with, a disaster. In Bangladesh, women are more vulnerable because of gender disparities in different social, economic and political institutions. Poor women are more likely to die or suffer fatal and non-fatal injuries. During the last few disasters in Bangladesh, it was found that the death rate for women was almost five times higher than for men. Women and girls tend to have less access to, or control over, assets including the resources necessary to cope with natural disasters, such as information, education, health, and wealth. And it is inequities endured on a daily basis--not just in times of disaster--that create greater risk for them and reduce their life chances. It is often stated by different disaster reports that during the natural disaster, men were able to warn each other as they met in public spaces, but they rarely communicated information to the rest of the family. Some aid agencies reported that in Bangladesh the disproportionate number of female deaths is due in large part to the social norm that women should not leave their house without permission from their husbands. Many children and women die because the men weren't at home to permit them to leave the house and they wait for their relatives to return home and take them to a safe place. It is also evident that due to social restrictions women have very limited access to opportunities to learn to swim or climb trees--skills that may be necessary to rescue themselves in the event of a disaster. Moreover, the society accepts that the female role in a community is to remain at home to perform domestic duties and take care of children, the elderly and others in the family, livestock, food and other assets. Being the primary caretakers (or caregivers) of the family, women stay behind in times of disasters, instead of running to safety. In general, women often have limited access to healthcare, education or other skill-building exercises, which causes them to suffer more during disasters. Besides the immediate impacts of a disaster, it is often the post-disaster recovery phase that exposes women to even greater gender-based risks. Based on evidence gathered from the last few disasters in Bangladesh, it is apparent that women and adolescent girls in shelters and camps for displaced persons suffer from sexual and gender-based violence, which includes physical, mental and emotional violence committed due to the gender of the victim. Women are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse and trafficking. Also, post-disaster impacts aggravate the cases of gender-based violence, domestic violence, forced and early marriages. The traditional division of roles tends to intensify more the daily workload of women. Hence, natural disasters add an extra burden on top of existing problems in Bangladesh, with women on the receiving end.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007) reports that, whether in developing or developed countries, there is evidence to suggest that women are more likely to die as a result of disasters, and if they survive, they suffer more than men in their aftermath. Over the last decade, awareness of climate change and its impacts has risen dramatically but some key areas have been missing from the debate. The gender aspect, for Bangladesh, is one of them. It is imperative that the impacts of natural disasters on women are reviewed in detail. Particularly the single women, female-headed households, women with disabilities and older women, as well as adolescent girls, are in need of greater attention. The government of Bangladesh passed a climate change strategy in 2009 with action plans, and the National Adaptation Program of Action (NAPA) was also developed to further advance climate-friendly development and adaptation measures. But until now, initiatives on climate change lack gender sensitivity. Women have had little chance to express their needs and opinions and get involved in climate-related decision-making. It is evident that women are not included adequately in disaster risk reduction or resilience planning. Their needs are yet to be addressed in the government's disaster management strategy.  This also indicates that the resulting response and reconstruction efforts tend to overlook the specific vulnerabilities and needs of women when disasters strike. Therefore, the impacts of climate change on women should be explored. Emphasis should not be placed merely on women's greater vulnerability but on how to reduce these vulnerabilities to make them more resilient. They should also be included in every decision-making process aimed at reducing their vulnerabilities. Women should be considered an integral part of disaster risk reduction planning and capacity building programmes.

      "text": "Bangladesh saw around 234,000 deaths, including 80,000 in urban areas, due to environmental pollution and related health risks in 2015, making it one of the worst affected countries in the world, reveals a World Bank report. The number was more than 10 times that of deaths the same year from road accidents, which was 21,286, it pointed out.   Some 18,000 lives and 578,000 years of potential life were lost in Dhaka city in 2015 -- the second least livable city in the world, showing the urgency to immediately address the city's environmental issues.  \n Deaths due to various causes totalled 843,000 in the country that year. Of those, nearly 28 percent were caused by environmental pollution -- the highest among South Asian nations, according to the report released yesterday.   The average rate of such deaths in South Asia is nearly 26 percent, while it is 16 percent worldwide. The World Bank said this in this year's country environmental analysis report titled \"Enhancing Opportunities for Clean and Resilient Growth in Urban Bangladesh\" unveiled at a hotel in the capital. Air pollution in South Asian countries is the highest in the world with fine particulate matter measuring 2.5 microgram both outdoor and indoor. This is by far the most leading environmental risk in Bangladesh, causing about 21 percent of all deaths in the country, according to the report. Nearly one million people in Bangladesh, mostly poor, are at risk of lead contamination, which can lead to IQ loss and neurological damage, especially for children, and can increase the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth among pregnant women, the report cited. \n In greater Dhaka, the sites contaminated by heavy metals are mostly in poorer neighbourhoods. The report focuses on three areas: cost of environmental degradation; clean and resilient cities; and institutions for clean industrial growth. Based on data gathered from 11 air quality monitoring stations in eight urban areas, concentration of 2.5 microgram particulate matter from 2013 to 2015 was estimated five times the Bangladesh standard and eight times the World Health Organisation standard. Household air pollution disproportionately affects women and young children, who spend most of the time inside houses. Pregnant women are especially vulnerable to this hazard. \"Bangladesh pays a high price for environment degradation and pollution in its urban areas. This puts its strong growth at risk,\" said Rajashree Paralkar, acting WB country director for Bangladesh. \n Addressing the programme, Anisul Islam Mahmud, minister for environment, forest and climate change, said 58 percent of air pollution are caused by illegal brick kilns, 10 percent by vehicles, 20 percent by construction activities, and the rest by various other factors, including industries. Anisul said his ministry is working on a new law likely to be passed during this government's tenure. Kseniya Lvovsky, WB practice manager for environmental and natural resources, said environmental conservation is doable if there are strong will and planned urbanisation. According to the WB report, parts of Dhaka city are more susceptible to flood inundation due to filling-up of wetlands and construction of high-rises on sand-filled areas. Unplanned urbanisation is also taking a toll on smaller cities as well as towns like Pabna. Since 1990, Pabna lost half of its wetlands, and its lifeline, the Ichamati river, is dying. Vehicles move as a thick cloud of dust and smoke reduces visibility in Dholaipar area of the capital. The photo was taken yesterday afternoon.  Photo: Amran Hossain\n The economic cost of the deaths and disability in terms of labour output has been estimated at $1.4 billion in all urban areas of Bangladesh and at 310 million in Dhaka city alone, equivalent to 0.6 percent and 0.1 percent of the country's GDP in 2015.  Given the growing environmental challenges that Bangladeshi cities face, the WB analyses the impacts and causes of pollution levels and degradation of natural resources in Dhaka and other rapidly growing cities. Over the past three decades, Bangladesh has experienced dramatic increase in pollution linked to urbanisation. Rapid growth of readymade garment industry and increase in urban population from less than 40 million in 2006 to more than 55 million in 2015 had been key factors in exposing the growing urban population to environmental hazards. \n Workers in the country's industrial establishments, including micro, small, and medium facilities that use harmful materials as inputs, face the risk of cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and other health impacts due to the lack of mitigation practices, including the use of personal protective equipment. The WB report mentioned that occupational pollutants such as asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and silica are used as industrial inputs. The other pollutants include sulfuric acid, trichloroethylene, arsenic, benzene, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, diesel exhaust, formaldehyde, and nickel in the form of gases and asthmagens. \n Women and girls bear a disproportionate burden of limited access to clean and safe water. Water pollution and water scarcity affect women's health, nutrition, workload, and, consequently, their opportunities to overcome poverty. Poor sanitation, lack of safe water supply and arsenic contamination in groundwater lead to diarrhoeal and other diseases causing deaths.    Urbanisation and industrialisation have increased the amount of waste generation. Without proper collection and disposal, solid waste clogs channels, leading to urban floods. Unsafe recycling of hazardous waste such as used lead-acid batteries poses a growing public health hazard. An estimated 22,000 workers in Bangladesh's ship-breaking industry are exposed to increased levels of asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, cadmium, lead, and mercury in the naval and merchant ships they dismantle. Dhaka, ranked as the ninth largest megacity in the world, has seen its population rise by about three times from 6.8 million to 18.2 million over the past quarter of a century, the report cited.  Continued unplanned urbanisation, filling-up of wetlands and rivers, and shrinking of a canal network across the city has exacerbated urban flooding and contributed to various environmental problems. Flooded roads contribute to traffic congestion and health hazards from the spread of vector-borne diseases.  Dhaka's Detailed Area Plan identified and recommended protection of 30,252 hectares of flood flow zones and 2,240 hectares of water retention areas to reduce the risk of flooding. But in just eight years since 2010, 41 percent of flood flow zones and 21 percent of water retention areas have been converted, raised, and used for other purposes, including settlements, industries and brick kilns. At least 100 hectares of four rivers around Dhaka city -- Buriganga, Balu, Turag and Shitalakkhya -- have been encroached upon to make way for various commercial and residential settlements. \n To put Bangladesh on a greener growth trajectory, the WB recommended that the government strengthen policies and institutions, and enforce environmental standards with a shift to cleaner technologies to contain the increasing air, water and soil pollution as well as industrial pollution.  Bangladesh had its first-ever legal framework \"National Environment Policy\" on governing environmental conservation in 1992. Since then, more than 25 laws, policies, guidelines, and regulations have been formulated to regulate the environmental footprint."

      "text": "What is now urgently required is very large-scale, immediate transformation to set a course to reach a net-zero emission in the future by limiting the temperature rise to 1.5-degree Celsius. Many economists, including Sir Nicholas Stern and Joseph Stiglitz as well as climate pundits argue that a major ramp-up of national commitments in 2020 is essential to keep the Paris Agreement's goals within reach. They also see lot of opportunities, very positive returns and benefits. Countries will benefit from enhancing their nationally determined contribution (NDC) in other ways as well, including helping achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and alert public finance institutions and donors of major investment opportunities.     Under the 2015 Paris Agreement every country, developed or developing, rich or poor, agreed to prepare and communicate an updated NDC every five years, showing progress toward its highest possible ambition. Countries are now preparing to submit new or updated NDCs by 2020. In order to fulfil the ambition, the UN Secretary General has convened the Climate Action Summit in New York next week. This summit is for galvanising global political momentum to deliver much stronger national climate plans at this key moment and just ahead of the 25th Conference of Parties (COP 25) in Santiago in December.   The United Nations Development Programme and the World Resources Institute on September 18, 2019 released a joint publication titled \"Enhancing NDCs: A Guide to Strengthening National Climate Plans\" to help assist the crucial UN process. It is designed to help practitioners think how to structure a country's NDC across three dimensions: strengthening targets to reduce emissions (mitigation), enhancing climate resilience (adaptation), and clearly communicating their actions to build trust and facilitate effective implementation.  Apart from this guidance, there are also some resources for countries to enhance national climate plans under the Paris Agreement. Some countries have committed to strengthening their NDCs in 2020, but many others, including Bangladesh, are yet to revise it.  Another interesting joint report styled \"The Heat is On: Taking Stock of Global Climate Ambition\" was also released on September 18 by the UNDP and the UNFCCC, offering the most comprehensive assessment to date on the world's climate ambitions. It shows huge ambition gap to reach the global goal on both mitigation and adaptation.   The Global Adaptation Commission, led by UN former secretary general Ban Ki-moon, in its report published on September 11 has also shown investing $1.8 trillion in adaptation in five key sectors from 2020 to 2030 could generate $7.1 trillion in total net benefits. As a lead climate negotiator for LDCs for many years, I have also argued that the cost of adaptation is on the rise but socio-economic benefits are manifold although adaptation has also limits.  Now the trillion dollar question is how to take advantage of the opportunities across a range of areas, including power, forests, oceans, agriculture, transportation and short-lived climate pollutants. How Bangladesh and many other least developed countries (LDCs) and developing countries would like to seize the opportunities and mount pressures on industrialised countries to cut back their greenhouse gas emissions is a huge challenge. As a lead author of the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan 2008, updated in 2009, I know that this flagship document is now being revised. The inception workshop to formulate the Bangladesh National Adaptation Plan (NAP) based on the Bangladesh National Adaptation Programme of Action 2005, revised in 2009, is all set to be held next month. I hope the NAP would be prepared in a participatory consultative process involving all major stakeholders, sectors and regions. I think economics of climate change should dictate our policies at national level as well as global level to help rescue nations from current climate emergency.

So, we've to live with the phenomenon with necessary plans to keep the extent of damages and loss of lives to a minimum during any disaster,\" she told a meeting of the National Disaster Management Council (NDMC) at her office. PM's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim briefed reporters after the meeting. The PM said the geographical location of Bangladesh is such that natural disasters might happen anytime and the country's people will have to live facing various natural calamities, including flood, landslide and earthquake. About disaster preparedness, she said her government has taken measures to face any kind of natural disaster. Hasina said her government had preparations to provide necessary assistance and support for the victims of recent floods. The government took necessary measures to that there was no food shortage and people didn't suffer, she said. \"The government is importing food grains to ensure food security.\" She put emphasis on starting cultivation and food production so that the future food security is ensured properly. The PM said although flood causes disasters for farmers and other people through damaging houses and crops, sometimes it also becomes a blessing for the people as it carries silt to cultivable land to make it more fertile. About the \"Mujib Killa\" established by Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to tackle the tidal surge along the coastal belt, Hasina said the steps were taken to protect people. \"The Bangabandhu government also set up 1,000 cyclone shelters in the coastal areas.\" She said following the ideals and initiatives of Bangabandhu, cyclone shelters and other shelter centres were constructed to provide people with necessary shelter during the disaster period. The PM said her previous government had tackled a long-spanning flood in 1998 when about 70 percent of the country went under water and there was a prediction of death of 2 crore people. Ihsanul said the NDMC meeting reviewed the progress of implementation of the decisions made in its earlier meetings. NDMC members, including LGRD Minister Khandkar Mosharraf Hossain, Relief and Disaster Management Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, Housing and Public Works Minister Mosharraf Hossain and Water Resources Minister Anisul Islam Mahmud, the chiefs of the three services and the inspector general of police were present at the meeting."

All that it did on Feb 6 was to notify allowing export of 10,000 tonnes of Krishnapuram (Andhra Pradesh) variety of onion until March 31 only from Chennai airport. In the meantime, the decision of the Indian government to withdraw the ban on all varieties of onion has prompted exporters to begin booking onions in large quantity, resulting in the rise in prices of the kitchen staple by about 25 per cent in Lasalgaon market, Asia's biggest wholesale market, in Maharashtra.  The ban on onion export was taken about six months ago when wholsesale and retail prices escalated for kharif crop damage caused by floods in major growing states. The lifting of the ban on onion would be effective only after the DGFT issues a notification in this regard. Despite huge arrivals of late kharif crop and early rabi crop onion, prices have shot up since Thursday last week just because of the increased pressure on demand from exporters on anticipation of the DGFT notification allowing the lifting of the export ban, according to sources in Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Lasalgaon. In Lasalgaon, onion price shot up to Rs 21.50 a kg from Rs 16.50 on Thursday the previous day. Some 1,500 tonnes of onion arrived in Lasalgaon on Thursday after 1,000 tonnes had come a day earlier. Trade sources believe that the decision on lifting the export ban was taken at a meeting of Group of Ministers on Wednesday last week. The meeting also discussed reducing the minimum export price (MEP) of $850 a tonne. Rabi season crop of onion is set to reach Lasalgaon in full swing in another ten days, which may again see onion prices decline further. But what is bothering the exporters is the stock limit of five tonnes for retailers and 25 tonnes for wholesalers imposed by the Maharashtra government in December.   "

      "text": "The demand to decommission and demolish the Farakka barrage is getting louder in India. Among the politicians, Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar, has been making the above demand for quite some time. He had raised this demand formally with the Indian central government, meting with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 12, 2016. He has raised the demand again on February 20, 2017. Many prominent Indian river experts have now joined Nitish Kumar. Among them is the Magsaysay award winner Rajendra Singh, also known as Waterman, who said in the international seminar on \"Incessant Ganga\", organised by Bihar's water resources department in Patna in February, 2017, \"Farakka is inauspicious (ashubh) for Bihar. It is a curse (abhishap) which needs to be removed, because unless and until we remove it, we cannot move forward\" (The Hindu, February 27, 2017).\" In the same seminar, Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of South Asia Network on Dams, River and People, New Delhi, urged for an urgent review of the Farakka barrage, which, in his view, had failed to fulfil any of the purpose -- irrigation, hydro-electric power, water supply -- of the barrage for which it was built (The Hindu, February 27, 2017). Of course, the Indian politicians and river experts are demanding demolition of Farakka not out of any concerns for Bangladesh. Unfortunately, consequences for Bangladesh, of river intervening structures built by India, do not figure highly in the considerations of Indian experts and policymakers. In raising the demand for demolition of Farakka, they are motivated by the damage it has done and is doing to India itself. It has been reported that about 328 million tons of sediment - about 40 percent of the current sediment volume of the river - is getting trapped behind the Farakka barrage and deposited in the upstream riverbed. As a result, the riverbed has risen in elevation, aggravating floods. The barrage has also triggered the funnelling process, as a result of which upstream riverbank erosion has worsened. It has been reported that more than 3,000 hectares of land has been lost to river erosion in the Murshidabad and Maldaha districts of West Bengal alone. The extent of erosion in Bihar is reported to be greater. Meanwhile, the Farakka barrage has failed to live up to its professed goals. It failed to desilt the Kolkata port to the extent that it could continue to be a sea port. The fate of Kolkata as a sea port was actually sealed by the fact that it is located about 100 miles inland along a shallow, winding river. This was alright when Kolkata was chosen by the British East India Company as a port in the 17th century when ships had sails and shallow drafts. However, it was simply impossible for Kolkata to continue as a sea port in the age of super tankers and container carrying mega-sized ships. Farakka did augment the flow of the Bhagirathi-Hoogly channel. However, it is difficult to see what tangible, significant benefits this brought to an area that had already adjusted over several centuries to the eastward shift of the main flow of the Ganges toward Bangladesh and away from the Bhagirathi-Hoogly channel. By contrast, the damage done to Bangladesh by Farakka is simply huge. It has dried up most of the rivers of southwest Bangladesh, harming the ecology and economy of the entire region. By reducing flow of fresh water and aggravating salinity ingress, Farakka has harmed the health of the Sundarbans. Farakka has been damaging for the ecology of northwest Bangladesh too, as it cut off the flow into the Baral River - the main river of the Chalan Beel area, extending over several districts of the region. Farakka has been the main reason for the drastic drop of the sediment carried by the rivers to the Bay of Bengal from an annual about two billion tonnes to only about one billion. As a result, the coastal land elevation and normal delta formation processes have been thwarted to a significant extent, making Bangladesh more vulnerable to the sea level rise caused by global warming. In view of the above, Bangladesh Environment Network (BEN), Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA) and many other organisations in the country have been calling for the demolition of the Farakka barrage for a long time now. In recent years, they made this demand very forcefully in the presence of top Indian water experts and policymakers during the International Conference on Regional Cooperation on Transboundary Rivers (ICRCTR) held in Dhaka in 2004. In this backdrop, it is heartening to see that Indian politicians and river experts themselves are now asking for the demolition of the Farakka barrage. The government of Bangladesh should formally raise the demand for demolition with the Indian government. In fact, it should also ask for the demolition of the Gajoldoba barrage and other river intervening and diversionary structures. The failure of Farakka is an example of the inappropriateness of structural interventions in rivers in general. These interventions, promoted by a commercial approach to rivers, ultimately prove to be counter-productive. It is important in this regard for Bangladesh to sign and ratify without any further delay the 1997 UN Convention on Non-navigational Uses of International Watercourses, which can provide a legal basis for Bangladesh's demand. This convention upholds the lower riparian countries' right to historical and customary use of river flows and prohibits upper riparian countries from construction of river intervening structures without the consent of lower riparian countries. It is also important for Bangladesh to take lessons from the Farakka experience in deciding about the proposed Ganges barrage to be built inside Bangladesh. Like Farakka, this barrage, if built, will cause upstream riverbed aggradation, leading to increased flooding and riverbank erosion. There is no doubt that flows of the rivers of southeast Bangladesh need to be increased. However, the real solution to this problem lies in the demolition of Farakkka and other diversionary barrages, so that the full natural flow of the Ganges can be restored. This, in turn, will restore the flows of the rivers of southeast Bangladesh. The growing demand inside India for the demolition of the Farakka barrage signifies a paradigm shift in the Indo-Bangladesh negotiations regarding common rivers. It proves the futility of the commercial approach to rivers and the desirability of an ecological approach, which advocates for restoration of the natural flows of rivers. Bangladesh needs to take note of this paradigm shift, adopt the principled position of ecological approach to rivers, sign the 1997 UN convention, and ask the Indian government to remove the Farakka and other river diversionary barrages. This should be the main water-related agenda in PM Sheikh Hasina's upcoming meeting with the Indian PM. Merely focusing on the arithmetic of the dwindling Teesta flow will not help, because unless the root problem is addressed, pretty soon there may be no water left in the river for Bangladesh to share!

Incessant rain and an onrush of water from the upstream have caused the floods, while some rivers are flowing over the danger level. Road communication between Bandarban and other districts remained suspended over the last two days, as roads in Satkania Upazila's Bazalia area remained submerged, reports our correspondent in the district. Many parts of the district town have also already been inundated. Crop lands in these areas have gone under water, while ponds have been overflowing. District administration officials are trying to evacuate the affected people and provide them with food and other necessary support, Baghaichhari Upazila Nirbahi Officer Muhammad Ahsan Habib Jitu told The Daily Star. In Rangamati, around 3,000 families remained marooned due to floods. Many educational institutions have been closed and families are moving to flood shelters. In the north-eastern regions, floods have worsened as river water has been flowing above danger levels, reports our Sylhet correspondent. Low lying areas in Sunamganj Sadar, Tahirpur, Dowarabazar, Bishwambarpur, Jamalganj and Dharmapsha upazilas of Sunamganj, and Sylhet's Gowainghat and Kanaighat upazilas have been flooded. Water from Gowainghat's Sari-Gowain river has been flowing 40cm above the danger level in Sarighat area. Road communication between Tahirpur upazila and Sunamganj Sadar remain closed off. Md Fazlur Rahman, relief and rehabilitation officer in Sunamganj, said 300 tonnes of rice and 1,265 packets of dry food have been allotted for the flood-affected people of the district. Abul Kalam Azad, supervising engineer of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWBD), yesterday said excessive rainfall was likely to continue for next two to three days. In Lalmonirhat, chars and low-lying areas, that are homes to around 35,000 people, in Teesta and Dharla river basins are inaccessible due to flood. \"Our houses have been flooded. Now we have taken shelter on roads,\" said Nazar Ali, resident of Bagdora village in Sadar Upazila. \"We have got some dry food from government officials. But we are in severe need of drinking water,\" said Saheda Bewa, another resident of the village. Contacted, the district's Deputy Commissioner Abu Jafar said the administration was providing necessary help to the flood-affected people. Meanwhile, the Spar dyke at Gobordhan village in Aditmari upazila is under the threat of collapsing due to heavy pressure of water from the Teesta. The dyke was declared risky last year, but it was not repaired by the BWDB. Amid such a situation, several thousands of people from six villages are in fear of losing their homes in floods if the dyke collapses. Sub-Divisional Engineer of BWDB in Lalmonirhat Bazle Karim said they were trying to protect the dyke by dumping Geo Bags and have requested higher authorities concerned to allocate funds to repair the dyke on an emergency basis. In Netrakona, different areas of Kalmakanda Upazila have been flooded over the last two days, affecting some 6,000 families. Situation was worsening as water of the Sumeswari, Foli and Ghumai rivers has been flowing into Bangladesh's crossing border. \"All of the areas have been flooded and road communications remains snapped,\" said Md Rafiqul Islam, chairman of Pogla Union Parishad in the district. Many educational institutes have been closed due to floods, said Ruel C Sangma, acting UNO of Kalmakanda, adding that the district administration has allocated 300 packets of dry food for those who have been affected by the floods. Our Bandarban, Rangamati, Sylhet, Lalmonirhat and Mymensingh correspondents contributed to the story.  "

Among 57 transboundary rivers, three mighty river systems, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna (the GBM), drain a total of 1.72 km square watershed before they enter Bangladesh territory, an area that represents only 7 percent of the total catchment basin. Most of Bangladesh consists of flood plain and delta and 70 percent of the area is less than 1 metre above sea level, a feature that poses significant challenges due to natural hazards such as cyclonic storms and climate warming induced sea level rise. The annual cross border river flows entering Bangladesh territory are estimated to be 1,200 billion metre cube (BCM), of which three major river systems (the GBM) contribute some 981 BCM. The spatial distribution of flows through the dynamically interconnected GBM systems leads to complex flow dynamics. Out of the 981 BCM, 54 percent is contributed by the Brahmaputra and 31 percent by the Ganges and 14 percent by the Meghna river system. The rest of the flows (1 percent) are contributed by other minor rivers. These dynamically interconnected river systems carry a big volume of flows that pose significant challenges when they confluence at Aricha and Chandpur and then finally empty out into the Bay of Bengal. The combined flow dynamics has its own dimension of complexity when the flows with significant temporal variations meet at the confluences during monsoon seasons. It is interesting to note that 85 percent (834 BCM) of the total transboundary flows, contributed by the GBM systems, enter the country between June and October (only 5 months) and 15 percent (148 BCM) flows are available during 7 months of the dry season including only 1 percent (11 BCM) of the flows in the dry month of February. The complexity of floods becomes more intense when the peak flows from Brahmaputra (usually in mid-August) coincides with the peak flow from Ganges (usually in mid-July) at the confluence near Aricha. A couple of examples are the devastating floods that occurred in 1988 and 1998. The coincidence of flood peaks of the Brahmaputra and the Ganges Rivers coupled with the southerly monsoon wind set-up in the Bay of Bengal were widely blamed for these devastating floods. All these mechanisms (coincidence of two peak flows and a wind set up in the Bay of Bengal) appeared to overwhelm the drainage capacity of the river systems, resulting in devastating floods in the country. Cyclones hitting the coastal zones are regular phenomena in Bangladesh. A severe cyclone strikes the country every three years, on average. Intensity of cyclonic storm surges as well as depth and extent of storm surge induced coastal inundation are likely to increase amidst the changing climate through rising sea surface temperature and sea level. The Bay of Bengal is known as an active region of complex mesoscale hydrothermal features called warm core eddies, which, when encountered by cyclones, intensify the cyclonic intensity. Cyclone Aila in 2009 is an example of this phenomena for which the intensity of the storm went up by 43 percent before it made landfall. Riverbank erosion leads to millions of people being affected as it causes damage and loss of crops, cattle, housing structures and farmland. The unpredictable migrating behaviour of the rivers has disastrous socioeconomic effects. Coastal erosions are also common problems along the coastlines of Bangladesh. The Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna river systems transport about a billion tonnes of sediment every year, part of which is contributing to land accretion. The average annual growth rate in the Meghna Estuary is about 19 km square. The present rate of the Jamuna bank erosion is about 17.70 km square per year while bank erosion by the Padma River is about 12.98 km square per year. The lower Meghna erodes at a rate of 29 km square per year. Despite all these challenges, Bangladesh has made significant socio-economic progress in the last 48 years since independence. GDP has grown many folds and the economy has transformed from an agrarian base to a modern manufacturing and service economy. The exceptional growth in economy and the population and its livelihood has not only successfully leveraged the hugely abundant labour force, fertile land and plenty of water and monsoon rains, but has also generated an increasing demand forecast for these resources. Bangladesh Delta and the Bay of Bengal offer enormous opportunities, that are mostly untapped. Economic growth along with population and their lifestyle demands more resources than the delta ecosystem can provide. Therefore, a careful and excruciating balance between the economic activities and the capacity and resilience of the ecosystem must be maintained. An adaptive and integrated approach The Government of Bangladesh has recently approved a sweeping plan that calls for a secure, safe, resilient and prosperous Bangladesh. An adaptive delta management (ADM) practice is said to be the cornerstone of this comprehensive plan called Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100. Its primary goals are to achieve long-term food and water security, while ensuring environmental sustainability along with economic growth. The plan is a robust, adaptive and integrated strategy using a holistic approach and equitable water governance. Adaptive and integrated approach in implementing the Delta plan have been proposed because of the uncertainties in the forcing functions that will have indelible impact on the Delta. Therefore, a comprehensive and integrated modelling approach has been presented here, which includes not only the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, the Meghna rivers and the Bay of Bengal, but also all the inland rivers and coastal estuarine systems of the country. Different types of interventions including the coastal polders and topographical feature of land are also considered in the integrated modelling framework. This integrated modelling approach is necessary to address the challenging issues presented by the water sector described earlier and it forms the basis of a delta-wide comprehensive modelling framework, called the Bangladesh Delta Model. An operational BDM model will emerge as a tool for adaptive delta management (ADM) to manage all the river systems and the Bay of Bengal. This tool is capable of assessing the impacts of any anthropogenic or natural interventions in the Delta and help achieve the objectives of the Blue Economy.  Bangladesh Delta Model (BDM) The BDM model constitutes five modules of Delft3D modelling suite: a) hydrodynamic model; b) morphology model; c) salinity model; d) wave model; and e) storm surge model. The model has been calibrated and validated during previous studies. The BDM model domain covers the entire Bangladesh, which includes all the major rivers and their flood plains, and the model domain is extended southward to the Bay of Bengal down to Sri Lanka. The blue economy To realise the full potential of the blue economy, a deep scientific understanding of the river, coastal area, the Bay of Bengal and their dynamical interactions is crucial. The BDM model has been designed to develop an understanding of the hydro-morphological dynamics of the delta system including the bay. Freshwater harvesting and land reclamation\n The BDM is designed to formulate a plan to manage freshwater resources in the coastal areas of Bangladesh. The goal is to make freshwater available throughout the year, especially during the dry season when the salinity intrusion is at its peak. The BDM is applied to assess the impact of cross-dam for building the freshwater reservoir at Char Kukri Mukri, Bhola. Considering freshwater flow from Tetulia and the Lower Meghna River, the southern tip of Bhola Island offers a favourable condition as a location to develop a freshwater reservoir. This one-of-a-kind effort to harvest freshwater offers a roadmap to build a reservoir at Char Kukri Mukri and will lead to further studies to explore other potential areas for additional freshwater harvesting and promote economic growth in the region. In addition to exploring the viability of a freshwater reservoir at Char Kukri Mukri, this study is centred-around reclamation of land and its development to allow a continuous southward extension of Bhola. A proposed reclaimed land, an area of 9 km square, will provide infrastructural support to the tourism industry and will promote economic activities. The land can be used to build a domestic airport and a golf resort to promote tourism in the area. The airport will serve as a connecting hub between the Char Kukri Mukri and the rest of the country. A potentially high value property, a Golf Resort, may be developed in the char overlooking the reservoir and the West Shahbazpur Channel. This high value property will add significant economic value to the region and thereby to the national GDP. The airport and other infrastructure in the area will support the operations and economic activities of the nearby Payra Port. The prospects of leveraging the open access to sea into a major source of growth and development are also being considered as part of developing the emerging blue economy of Bangladesh. The efforts made in the study are aligned with the Vision 2041 and consistent with the sustainable development goals (SDG 6, 7, 13 and 14) adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2015. Monsoon depression and livelihood support model (MDLS) for the fishing industry Access to sea provides an enormous opportunity for Bangladesh to exploit the fisheries resources available in the Bay of Bengal. Marine fishing has gained growing importance in recent years and the value-addition and employment in fisheries have increased significantly. However, a sustainable fishing operation is important to maintain a balance between the exploitation and the health of the ecosystems. A policy intervention based on scientific understanding of the Bay's ecosystem is necessary to regulate the fishing industry. An example of a policy intervention on banning Hilsha catch to protect the juvenile Jhatka has turned out to be a great success for Bangladesh. However, a comprehensive study must be made to determine the size and nature of the fisheries resources in the Bay before making any policy intervention. In addition, the unpredictable weather systems that developed in the Bay pose serious threats to the fishing industries. It has been reported that the lack of accurate prediction of monsoon depressions and tropical cyclones developed in the Bay severely limits the ability to fish during inclement weather. Generalised warnings by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department forced the fishermen to stay away from fishing. The fishing industry has been severely affected by the warnings that turn out to be inaccurate pretty often. Therefore, an ability to accurately predict the monsoon depression and assess the associated risks may help avert overly conservative and sometimes misleading warnings. The Bangladesh Delta Model is being configured to develop a monsoon depression and livelihood support modelling system (MDLS System) in which a process-based outcome of risk zoning for fishing and impact assessment on marine ecosystem will be formulated. The MDLS model also provides an assessment of the fish availability and fish-catch value during an event of Monsoon Depression (MD) in the Bay. The MDLS will help design policy interventions for an effective livelihood support to the fishermen in an event of a monsoon depression, to further realise the objectives of a sustainable blue economy. The BDM model simulated wind speed, wave heights, water velocity are used to assess the MD hazards. The fishermen population profiles and the boat size are considered as important model parameters used for exposure and sensitivity to determine the risk of fishing during MD events. Fishing risks in the ocean and estuaries are being assessed by using MD hazards and fishermen exposure and sensitivity in district levels. The assessment-based warning at district levels should be more effective and consistent and it is highly recommended that the Bangladesh Meteorological Department use this outcome based effective warning for any MD develops in the Bay. Bay of Bengal and the storm surge forecasting system While Bangladesh is blessed with the bounty of natural resources like the Bay of Bengal, it is also highly vulnerable to natural hazards. It has a long history of resilience and capacity of coping with major natural disasters. The government and the people have a wealth of experience in preparing for, and responding to, disaster events. Bangladesh has been increasingly respected and recognised as a leader in adopting a more holistic approach to risk reduction. Being a world leader in developing comprehensive planning and implementing operational disaster management, Bangladesh needs to focus on capacity building on tidal (astronomical, meteorological and tsunami) forecast modelling and research. The Bangladesh Delta Model has provided such capability, which could be a part of a multi-agency programme to produce a sustainable and comprehensive tidal and storm surge forecasting modelling and observing system. The system will function both as an operational and research tool to be used not only to support adaptation to natural hazards and disaster risk reduction, but also to foster a sustained economic growth with managed environmental, infrastructural and economic resources of the coastal areas and the Bay of Bengal. A key to the programme is communicating the results of the forecasting model to the officials and decision-makers involved in disaster and risk management. The system will also share scientific results and resources with other governmental agencies such as the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), Ministry of Water Resources (BWDB), Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, Ministry of Environment and Forest, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Meteorological Department. The storm surge forecasting system would be the portal to disseminate the flood and surge information. It is envisioned that an automated text messaging system will send alerts to appropriate authorities when predetermined location(s) in coastal regions are forecasted to exceed a flood depth threshold. The text message alert will direct the receiver to visual GIS flood depth layers supported by actual elevation data specific to each coastal zone. The GIS layers of the forecast will be available 72 hours, 48 hours, 36 hours, 24 hours, 12 hours, and 6 hours prior to surge impact. The forecasts will also continue to be displayed on government websites and large LED display screens hosted in the Prime Minister's Office, relevant ministries and governmental agencies directly involved in natural disaster and risk management. This system can also be used as a modelling and research tool to investigate the social and economic impact of global warming in the coastal regions of Bangladesh. The modelling tool would be useful to address and mitigate various coastal issues, such as, increase drainage capacity and reduce floods, water logging, salinity intrusions, riverbank and coastal erosions, reclaim new lands and water way transport. Scientists and engineers in academic and governmental and non-governmental sectors will have a scientific edge to address short-term and long-term hydro-meteorological, climatological, social, economic and geopolitical challenges. The scientific and technical capabilities will allow Bangladesh to effectively formulate its maritime strategy and gain upper hand in projecting its interest in the highly contested and strategically important Bay of Bengal. Marine and inland water transport and intelligent dredging The Bay of Bengal has fuelled the development and economic growths in the region for centuries. It provided a maritime transportation system that facilitated the efficient movement of goods and commodities, supporting cluster of industries such as manufacturing, shipbuilding, agribusiness, commercial fishing and energy exploration. Bangladesh being a riverine country, offers a significant comparative advantage in inland water transport. The country is crisscrossed by a network of about 24,000 km of rivers, streams and canals. The open access to sea is a significant advantage to Bangladesh. Although the port facilities that could serve the growing domestic trades and commerce may also become a regional hub for marine transportation. Bangladesh is slowly capitalising on the open access to sea by establishing new ports, in addition to Chittagong and Mongla ports. The ongoing Payra Port construction in Patuakhali is an example. There are many other opportunities that could boost Bangladesh's trade and commerce by reducing the cost of trade logistics through easier and lower cost access to ports in terms of time and money. Marine Spatial Planning is an important element in making a plan to exploit the resources in the Bay of Bengal. The Bangladesh Delta Model can be a useful tool to develop a spatial planning based on the hydrodynamic and morphological and other environmental characteristics of the coastal and oceanic environment. The BDM model is capable of providing solutions to the balancing act between the economic activities and capacity and the resilience of the marine ecosystem. For example, the modelling simulations under different atmospheric and climatic conditions in the coastal area can identify the area feasible for port development, identify the shipping route so that it doesn't conflict with the fisheries exploitation and other economic activities, while maintaining a sustainable ecosystem. There are 14 crore waterways network recommended in the IWT Master Plan, 2009 that covers altogether 1,822 km of waterways. The waterways linking two maritime ports (Chittagong and Mongla) and river ports Dhaka-Narayanganj area and routes under Bangladesh-India Protocol on IWT28 were marked as the highest priority routes. Dredging and maintaining river navigability can be expensive and development of river navigability for transportation purposes must weigh the relative costs and benefits. The BDM model is being configured and updated using the real-time draft data collected by the LiDAR technology. A computer algorithm is being developed to analyse the LiDAR generated high-resolution topographic and bathymetric data to produce dredging pathways along the river that will be configured into the modelling system. A series of iterative modelling exercises will be performed in order to determine optimised dredging paths that will maximise the conveyance capacity and produce a managed river system that will provide enough draft for ships to navigate. After the optimised dredging paths are determined, the model will generate a detailed channel configuration including cross-sectional geometry and GPS coordinates of the dredging alignments in order to support field crews to dredge the riverbed with surgical precision and allow the ships to navigate through river freely.

In Gaibandha, the flood situation has turned critical as water in the Brahmaputra river was flowing 146 centimetres above danger mark at different points of the river. Rail communications between Gaibandha and Bonarpara section remained suspended since Wednesday morning when floodwater gushing over a section of the rail tracks at Trimohoni washed away soil and stone chips from underneath, reports our correspondent in Gaibandha. Consequently, the west zone of Bangladesh Railway has suspended all trains for an indefinite period on the section since 11:00am yesterday, said Khalilur Rahman, station master of Bonarpara rail station. Vast tracts of land were flooded and about a 300-foot stretch of Gaibandha-Shaghata regional highway was washed away by floodwater gushing through Poragram area. In Sundarganj upazila, road communications broke down after a 200-foot stretch of a road was washed away by surging waters. Affected people in the area took refuge at different flood shelters. They are facing scarcity of food and drinking water. In Kalmakanda and Durgapur upazilas of Netrakona, around 5,700 fish farmers in the upazilas suffered a serious blow as fish in nearly 3,000 ponds were washed away by floodwaters, reports our correspondent in Mymensingh. The total loss incurred by the fish farmers is estimated at around Tk 9 crore, said sources. Mosharraf Hossain, a farmer of Charulia village in Kalmakanda said he invested Tk 15 lakh in his 13 ponds, but he was done for as all his fish have been washed away by floodwater. Ibrahim Khalilullah, sub-assistant engineer of Water Development Board in Netrakona, said the overall flood situation in Kalmakanda and Durgapur upazilas has improved as water levels in the Sumeswari, Kangso and Updakhali rivers have started to recede. In Patgram upazila of Lalmonirhat, boats became the sole mode of transport for around 20 thousand inhabitants of six villages in Jongra union as an approach road to a bridge, which connects them with the upazila headquarters, was washed away by floodwaters from the Dharla river on Sunday morning, reports our correspondent in Lalmonirhat. The bridge is on Jongra-Patgram road that is the only major road for the six villages -- Jongra, Dhabalguri, Nanderghat, Dangapara, Barabhita and Mandirpara. Only small boats are plying the flooded area to ferry people, but without any road communication, transport of goods is being affected, said a number of villagers. \"We already informed Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) officials of the collapsed road to the bridge, but they are yet to repair it,\" said Atiar Rahman, a villager from Mandipara. \"The bridge's approach road became risky last year after it was damaged by floodwaters from the Dharla. LGED officials were informed about it. But since they did not take any step to repair it all this time, it collapsed this year,\" alleged Ahadul Islam, a businessman from Barabhita village of the upazila. Contacted, AKM Amiruzzaman, executive engineer of LGED in Lalmonirhat, said it would not be possible to repair it until the floodwater recedes."

Many people in different shoal areas of the Teesta and Jamuna basin under four upazila of Gaibandha have been marooned as the Jamuna was flowing 14 centimetres above the danger mark. During visits to the affected areas, many of the houses were seen under knee-deep water. Sixteen unions of four upazilas have so far been affected by floodwater. Jalaluddin, chairman of Kapasia Union Parishad in Sundarganj upazila, said eight wards of his union went under water where about 3,000 people had been marooned. Almost all the village roads went under water, leaving communication suspended. Banana tree rafts were the only means of transport for the affected people, who were taking shelter on dry land and dyke with their cattle and poultry. Cropland, houses and roads in Shaghata union went under water, leaving the marooned people with no work to feed their families. The disaster management and relief ministry has allocated 125 maunds of rice and Tk 4 lakh for the affected people. In Jamalpur, around 40,000 people have been marooned in seven unions in Islampur upazila, four in Dewanganj, three in Sharishabari and two in Melandah. Kulkandi, Sapdhari, Belgachha, Noarpara and Chinaduli under Islampur and Chukaibari and Chikajani under Dewanganj were affected badly, said local government sources. \"Around 10,000 people of my union remained marooned for last three days. Most of them are living on dry food,\" said Chinaduli UP Chairman Abdus Salam. \"Only 50 packets of dry food were distributed among the badly-affected people. The supply was too scanty for such a huge number of people,\" he added. Forty-three primary schools, six high schools, six madrasas and one college were declared closed because of flood. Around 3 lakh fish fry released in two beels in Islampur upazila were washed away with the floodwater, said Abdul Majid, district fisheries officer. In Bogra, 30 villages in six unions of Shariakandi, five villages in two unions of Sonatola and four villages in two unions of Dhunat upazilas were inundated. At least 20,000 people of the areas were affected, local upazila and WDB sources said. Around 2,200 hectares of Aush paddy, 1,900 hectares of jute, 25 hectares of seedlings and 35 hectares of vegetables was inundated, according to Department of Agricultural Extension. Nur-e-Alam Siddiki, deputy commissioner of Bogra, said 120 tonnes of rice and Tk 1 lakh were allocated for the affected people in Shariakandi and Sonatola upazila. The government had allocated sufficient amount of relief for the affected people, he added. The Jamuna was flowing 21cm over the danger mark at Nolin point in Tangail, leaving several thousand people of the low-lying villages in three upazilas marooned. The affected areas are three unions of Bhuapur upazila and one union each in Kalihati and Gopalpur upazilas. More than 100 villages in 28 unions of Pabna have gone under water. WDB Executive Engineer of Sirajganj Hasan Imam said the water level in the Jamuna might increase in next four to five days."

The water level of the Padma almost touched the danger level at Hardinge point in Natore on Tuesday morning. The water was flowing 45cm below the red mark at Charghat point.  Meanwhile, the swelling water submerged 18 chars under three unions of Lalpur upazila in the district, rendering about 3,000 families homeless. New areas were inundated in Chapainawabganj as the water level of the Padma and Mahananga continued to rise. Sources at the local office of Bangladesh Water Development Board said the Padma water level rose by 15cm while that of Mahananda by 24cm in the last 24 hours till Tuesday morning. However, both the rivers are still flowing below the danger level. They were flowing 41cm and 34cm below the red mark respectively in the morning. According to the Times of India, the Centre opened all the gates following a request from Pataliputra MP Ravi Shankar Prasad. Ravi Shankar Prasad contacted Union minister for water resources and urged him to ensure that 119 gates of the Farakka barrage were raised to prevent floods in Patna and 12 other districts, sources close to Prasad said, adding the Union minister would reach Patna on Monday night."

The Indian state of Assam has been experiencing heavy floods for the last few days and its water is overflowing to Bangladesh through the Brahmaputra river, said Sazzad Hossain, executive engineer of Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of the Water Development Board (WDB). As a result, water level in the Brahmaputra and the Jamuna witnessed a rise that caused floods in the low-lying areas of the river basins, he told The Daily Star yesterday. According to the Indian media reports, flood situation in Assam worsened on Friday, affecting around 4.5 lakh people in 17 districts. Three more people were killed, taking the death toll to 22, reports the Times of India yesterday. The water level of the Teesta has meanwhile been increasing as most of the gates of India's Gajoldoba Barrage were left open, a WDB official said. The flood situation in the Sylhet region saw little improvement yesterday as the water level in two major rivers -- the Surma and the Kushiyara -- flowing over the danger point showed a declining trend. However, the situation might deteriorate again as the water level of the Kushiyara saw a rising trend last evening, Sirajul Islam, executive engineer of WDB in Sylhet, said. According to the latest bulletin of FFWC, the Brahmaputra, Jamuna and Padma rivers were also showing a rising trend. It also forecasted that the Jamuna might continue rising for the next 48 hours, while the Ganges-Padma rivers might continue rising for next 72 hours. The Brahmaputra might remain steady in next 24 hours, while the Surma and the Kushiyara might witness a decline in next 48 hours, said the bulletin issued at 9:00am yesterday. Of the 90 monitoring stations, water was flowing over the danger level at eight points, said the bulletin. The water level rose at 49 points and dropped at 33 points, two points remained steady and six points remained unreported, it added. Sazzad, however, said the water level at the bordering monitoring stations saw a declining tread in their latest observation. The Jamuna was flowing above the danger level at Bahadurabad, Sariakandi, Kazipara and Sirajganj points, while the Kushiyara, Surma and Kangsha were flowing above the danger mark at Amalshid, Sheola, Kanaighat and Jariajanjail points, the bulletin said. In Sirajganj, huge areas of Kazipur, Chowhali and Shahzadpur upazilas were flooded in last 24 hours due to a rise in water level in the Jamuna. The floods inundated more than 100 villages of 25 unions in three upazilas. Hasan Imam, executive engineer of the WDB, Sirajganj, said the floodwater submerged low-lying areas outside the embankment. An around-70-metre-long stretch of the flood protection embankment in Chowhali upazila has meanwhile been eroded again. The Sirajganj town protection embankment has been kept on high alert to avoid damage. The Jamuna was flowing one centimetre above the danger level on Friday, but the water level rose rapidly in last 24 hours. The Jamuna was flowing 15 centimetres above the danger level yesterday morning, Hasan added. The water level may keep increasing for one week due to the heavy flow of water from the upstream, he said, adding that the Padma and the Teesta were overflowing, so there was no possibility of receding water level in the Jamuna immediately. In Bogra, the low-lying areas of 15 villages in Shariakandi, Sonatola and Dhunat upazilas were inundated with the sudden rush of water. Around 5,000 people were marooned, upazila and WDB sources said. Aush paddy on 1,060 hectares of land, crops on 1,900 hectares of land and 20 hectares of land for seedlings were inundated, the Department of Agricultural Extension sources said. Mohammad Hossain, district primary education officer, said at least 15 primary schools in Shariakandi and four primary schools in Dhunat were closed. Nur-e-Alam Siddiki, deputy commissioner of Bogra, said 70 tonnes of rice was allocated for Shariakandi and Sonatola upazilas. In Kurigram, the overall flood situation worsened as water levels in the Brahmaputra, Dudhkumar, Dharla and Teesta rivers increased in last 24 hours. According to local sources, about 65,000 people of char and lowland areas in nine upazilas of the district were marooned due to floodwater. Ayub Ali, chairman of Jatrapur Union Parishad under Kurigram Sadar, said around 9,000 people were marooned and were facing fuel and cattle food crisis. Civil Surgeon Dr Aminul Islam said 88 medical teams were formed for emergency treatment of the affected people. In Gaibandha, more than 3,000 people were marooned in remote char areas of Gaibandha Sadar, Fulchhari and Shaghata upazilas as water level in the Brahmaputra basin rose. A vast tract of cropland went under water as the Brahmaputra was flowing 12 centimetres above the danger mark yesterday. The Teesta, the Ghagot and the Karotoa might cross the danger mark as the water level continued to increase, according to WDB officials. At least 15 points along the flood control dyke in Fulchhari and Shaghata upazila have been marked vulnerable and might collapse any time. People of Balashi Ghat in Fulchhari formed a human chain demanding immediate measures to stop erosion and rehabilitate the flood victims. In Jamalpur, flood situation worsened as the Jamuna swelled, with vast areas of low-lying land of 16 unions in Islampur, Dewanganj, Sharishabari and Melandah being affected by the flood. Around 40,000 people have been marooned, upazila administration officials said. Of the affected unions, Kulkandi, Chinaduli, Belgachha, Sapdhari and Noarpara of Islampur upazila and Chukaibari and Hatibandha unions of Dewanganj have been hit badly. Chairman of Chukaibari UP Selim Khan said around 5,000 people of his union were marooned and facing a shortage of drinking water and sanitation facilities. Twenty-two primary schools and two high schools were declared closed due to the floods. In Lalmonirhat, more than one lakh people living in the Teesta shoal areas were in fear as the water level was rising. Most of the gates of India's Gajoldoba Barrage were kept open, resulting in a rise in water level downstream, said Mostafizur Rahman, executive engineer of WDB at Dalia. Hatibandha upazila's Dawabari UP Chairman Rezzakul Islam said many char people started moving to safer places. If the Teesta water crossed the danger level, about 50 percent areas would be inundated, he added. \"Gajoldoba Barrage authorities will alert us if they faced a red alert situation. Then we will take an immediate step,\" Mostafizur said."

      "headline": "Poor nations pay price as millions flee 'climate chaos', Oxfam says",
      "authors": "\nThomson Reuters Foundation, London\n",
      "text": "Fiercer weather and worsening wildfires drove more than 20 million people from their homes over the last decade - a problem set to worsen unless leaders act swiftly to head off surging climate threats, anti-poverty charity Oxfam said today. Much of the displacement caused by cyclones, floods and fires appeared temporary and in some cases due to better efforts to evacuate people ahead of danger, Oxfam researchers said. But its \"sheer scale\" was a surprise, said Tim Gore, Oxfam's climate policy leader, with island nations like Cuba, Dominica and Tuvalu seeing on average close to 5% of their people out of their homes in any given year.  \"This is the warming world we have long been warning about. Now we're seeing it play out before our eyes,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The Oxfam study, released as two weeks of UN climate negotiations start in Madrid, examined the numbers of people displaced inside their home countries by climate-fuelled disasters between 2008 and 2018, based on government and international agency data, as well as media reports. People were three times more likely to be displaced by cyclones, floods or fires than by conflicts, it found. Some countries, like war-torn Somalia, were battered by both droughts and floods, sometimes in the same year. That \"confluence of disasters\" leaves many poor nations - where most of the displacement is occurring - struggling to recover from one crisis before the next hits, Gore said. Some have run aid appeals for both drought and flood relief simultaneously, he said. \"This is extraordinary,\" he said. \"This is climate chaos - what it actually looks like.\" Seven of the top 10 countries with the highest displacement by proportion of their population were developing island states, largely in the Pacific and the Caribbean, the report found. But around 80% of all people forced from their homes by weather disasters over the last decade were in Asia, where large populations in countries from the Philippines to Sri Lanka live in areas threatened by cyclones or flooding, it said. In May, Cyclone Fani alone led to the displacement of 3.5 million people in Bangladesh and India, most of them evacuated in advance of the storm in order to hold down casualties. Overall, the number of weather disasters considered extreme grew five-fold over the last decade, researchers said. The study did not look comprehensively at how many people were uprooted by \"slow onset\" disasters like droughts where it is harder to judge the beginning and end, Gore said. Including drought-linked displacement would make the numbers \"much higher\", he added. It also did not estimate how much of the displacement became permanent - \"a really unknown quantity\", Gore said. In 2018, Oxfam made a rough estimate of the number displaced by extreme weather disasters during the year who were still out of their homes by the end of it, and came up with about 10-20%. As more people leave their homes as a result of weather disasters, costs - and threats to social stability - are rising quickly for the countries trying to manage that displacement, often with few resources, the report said. At the UN climate talks in Madrid, environmental and development groups are pushing to establish a fund to bail out countries on the frontline of \"loss and damage\" as a hotter planet brings wilder weather and rising seas. A Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage was created at climate negotiations in 2013 with the aim of aiding poor nations that have produced few of the emissions that drive climate change but are suffering its strongest effects. So far, however, the mechanism has produced little concrete help or new money for those countries, beyond backing the use of insurance policies to limit losses, critics say. Gore said insurance alone could not address the whole problem. \"Loss and damage is the next key battleground of the climate talks,\" he added. Recent analysis by the Stockholm Environment Institute, endorsed by nearly 100 civil society groups, estimated new finance of at least $50 billion a year would be needed by 2022 to deal with loss and damage, rising to $300 billion by 2030. Gore said no amount of help would enable everyone to stay in their homes as climate change impacts strengthen, and preparing now would help protect those on the move. \"Are we going to manage this, or see the people least responsible for the crisis forced from their homes in a chaotic way that tramples on their rights?\" he asked. \"The costs are going to continue to spiral. The sooner we get down to serious negotiations about how to manage it in a serious, responsible way, the better,\" he said."

      "authors": "\nStaff Correspondent\n",
      "text": "Individuals, businesses, real-estate developers, organisations, and even government agencies have gobbled up 1,072 acres (57pc) of the 1,879-acre flood flow zones in core Dhaka city in this decade, said leading urban planners yesterday. They said the land was lost even though the capital city's master plan makes it mandatory to conserve the zones within the 300sqkm core Dhaka city (between Uttara, Badda, Mohammadpur, and Old Dhaka). The picture of urbanisation becoming a devastating process is more vivid when water retention areas and water bodies, including rivers and canals, are taken into account. Since the official gazette on the city's Detailed Area Plan (DAP) was issued in 2010, the core city lost 3,440 acres of 9,556 acres of flood flow zones, water retention areas, and water bodies, said Prof Adil Mohammed Khan, general secretary of Bangladesh Institute of Planners. \"Conservation of water bodies like rivers and canals, wetlands, water retention areas, and flood flow zones are all vital for making development and urbanisation sustainable with ecological balance, heat absorption, and bio-diversity, and for drainage of storm water,\" said Adil.  The city planners revealed this during a press conference jointly organised by Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB), Bangladesh Institute of Planners, Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (Bela), Nijera Kori, Association for Land Reform and Development, and Nodi O Poribesh Unnayan Parishad of Savar at the TIB office. In the entire 1,528-sqkm jurisdiction of the master plan that includes Tongi, Rupganj, Keraniganj, and Narayanganj, a quarter of the 74,699 acres of legally binding conservable flood flow zones have been filled up in the name of \"development\", said Adil. During the same decade, 57 acres of 154-acre water retention area were lost, the urban planners said.  DAP has marked over 1 lakh acres as conservable water bodies, water retention areas, and flood flow zones. At least 22,206 acres of these have been lost this decade, said Adil. The findings were based on the master plan maps and periodic images from satellites. Basila, Bashundhara Residential Area, Beraid, Amin Bazar, north Uttara, Baktarchar of Narayanganj, and areas beside Dhaka-Mawa highway were some of the worst affected parts. Feroze Ahmed Kanak, research associate of the government-run Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services, in his presentation said the government's Amin Bazar landfill was on a designated flood flow zone. The government had acquired 52 acres but the landfill is now 74 acres, he said, adding that many people of adjoining areas had to leave their ancestral homesteads and livelihoods because of this. Ishrat Islam, professor of urban and regional planning at Buet, said those responsible for destroying the wetlands must be made accountable.  The grabbers are far more powerful and united than those who fight for conservation, said Ishrat. Ishrat said she, as a technical expert on DAP revision, sat for a meeting once and realised that the upcoming revised DAP renamed flood flow zones and wetlands to conservation zone, which has no legal protection.     TIB Executive Director Iftekharuzzaman said in the name of development, such destructive activities were carried out in connivance with businessmen, law enforcers, and politicians and taking advantage of poor governance. Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha, custodian of the master plan, has been a part of the destructive activities, he said. Iftekhar said, \"Frustrating is the fact that those who we seek the rule of law are involved in undermining the rule of law.\" When the country's top court in its verdicts asks a matter be brought to the attention of the prime minister, it shows the court's lack of confidence in the regular mechanism of implementing a verdict, he said. Isolated filling up makes flood flow zones fragmented and facilitates further land grabbing, said architect Iqbal Habib, adding that tools like satellite images and drones should be used for monitoring wetlands.  Contacted, Rajuk Chairman Md Abdur Rahman last night told The Daily Star, \"It needs to be looked into as to why the designated flood flow zones of the capital reduced since 2010. I would be able to comment after that.\" Khushi Kabir of Nijera Kori and Syeda Rizwana Hasan, chief executive of Bela, also spoke at the press conference among others."

      "text": "The village of Khidramatia in Belkuchi upazila, once a vibrant community with around 200 homes, now stands utterly deserted. Rising water levels have submerged the entirety of the Sirajganj village and residents have long since left behind the desolation.    Hatem Ali, 50, along with nine members of his family in tow, was wading along with what seemed like their most important belongings.  \"The Jamuna has taken a turn for the worse in the last few days and my house is now under water. So we are moving to our in laws' house,\" Hatem said, when approached by this correspondent. \"On Saturday, flood waters reached near our knees. Now, they have risen near chest-high so we had to leave,\" he added. For days, the family subsisted on a diet of puffed rice as they could no longer cook in the flooded conditions. They will now travel almost 40 kilometres to reach his in-laws house in Sirajganj Sadar upazila. Elsewhere, in Mokimpur village, Shathi Begum was going with her husband to their relatives' house.  \"On Tuesday noon, I saw the flood waters rushing with such strong current that it washed away our furniture. I tried to stay and fight the water but it is no longer possible,\" she said. While many have opted to seek safety in an acquaintance's house, for some even that is not an option.  Visiting different flood affected areas in Sirajganj, many people were seen taking shelter in makeshift tents on the highway.  Talking to The Daily Star, Sayed Hasan Imam, executive engineer of Sirajagnj Water Development Board said the Jamuna water has been increasing rapidly in the last four days. The water may continue to increase for a few days, he said. While the north remains severely affected by the flood, the rising water levels are threatening Dhaka district as well. Sazzad Hossain, executive engineer, Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), mentioned that the rivers around Dhaka are slowly going above the danger level. \"The water level in Tongi khal is currently at 5.46 m with the danger level considered to be 6.8m,\" he said.  \"The other point of danger is the Turag river, near Mirpur. Currently the water level there stands at 5.14m with the danger level at 5.94m, with a mere 80 cm preventing it from flooding,\" he added.  The Balu river on Demra currently has a water level of 5.09m, closing in on the danger level of 5.75m, he further mentioned.  \"We predict that the danger level may be crossed on the 20th or 21st of the month,\" he said. In the areas already affected by the flood, the loss of homes and properties isn't the most tragic tale. A total of nine people, four in Dinajpur, three in Jamalpur and two in Kishoreganj, died yesterday in the floods. The total death toll has reached an alarming 39 in the last four days, said the director general of the Disaster Management Department.   To meet the crisis, the government has cancelled holidays of all medical officers in the flood affected areas and also deployed more army personnel as the situation has deteriorated in the northern parts.  A platoon of soldiers was sent to Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari and Panchagarh districts with essential life- saving equipment, said a press release of Inter-Services Public Relations yesterday. As the water cascades down from upstream, people in the central part of the country are also suffering. The rapid rise in Jamuna's water level has added to the tribulations of the people from Jamalpur, Sirajganj,Tangail,   Manikganj, Munshiganj and Faridpur area. Like Sirajganj, the overall flood situation in Tangail, Maninkganj, Faridpur and Munshiganj has also deteriorated. In Faridpur, 146 villages have gone under water within a day as the water level of the Padma is currently above the danger level. In Manikganj, different places on the banks of the river Jamuna along with croplands have gone under water.  On a hopeful note, our correspondents report, that the water level of the Teesta and Dharla rivers have gone below the danger level and that the water has started to recede in Thakurgaon, Panchagarh, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Dinajpur and Kurigram except low lying areas. Though the situation is improving, the lack of pure drinking water is only adding to the worries. Standing crops and vegetables have been damaged and thousands of educational institutions remain shut either because they were hit by the floods or are now functioning as shelters.  Visiting different flood shelters our correspondents report, most of the victims have not got any relief materials. \"I got a quarter kilogram of flattened rice (Chira) as relief in last four days\", alleged Jyoti Bala Roy, 62, of Maljhar village, who took shelter at Maljhar Government Primary School under Biral upazila of Dinajpur on Saturday when her village flooded. Like her, many flood affected people of Biral upazila of Dinajpur are still without access to government relief.    Reaz Rahman, director general, Bangladesh Department of Disaster Management said, so far  16 lac people were affected in 20 districts due to the flood. They have distributed total 4.5 metric tons of rice and Tk 1.5 crore in those affected districts, he added."

      "text": "Flood has disrupted road and rail communications across the country as roads, bridges and rail tracks in several districts have been damaged or inundat-ed, causing immense suffering to people.  Flood water completely damaged at least 171.78km of roads and partially damaged at least 3,303.25km of roads in 14 districts until Thursday, according to the Department of Disaster Management, Besides, at least 4.65km of embankments were destroyed and at least 382.3km of embankments partially damaged in 10 districts. Moreover, some 235 bridges and culverts were damaged in nine districts, the department said. According to Water Development Board, water level of main rivers except for the Jamuna, the Ganges and the Padma were receding.\n Yesterday, WDB forecasted that in the next 24 hours, water level of Jamuna may recede while water of Ganges and Padma may continue to rise in the next 48 hours. It also said flood situation may remain unchanged in Tangail and Sirajganj, may deteriorate in Manikganj, Rajbari, Faridpur, and Munshiganj, and may improve in Bogura, Jamalpur, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Netrakona, Sunamganj and Sylhet in the next 24 hours. Meanwhile, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies yesterday reported that days of heavy downpour had battered the northern and south-eastern part of Bangladesh, putting more than four million people at risk of food insecurity and disease. In Tangail, a 50-metre stretch of Bhuapur-Tarakandi road-cum-embankment was damaged in Tepibari area of Bhuapur upazila around 8:00pm Thursday, said local Water Development Board's Chief Engineer Akhil Kumar Biswas.  The damage caused suspension of vehicular movement on the road, he said, adding that it would be repaired by putting Geo bags within 72 hours. Yesterday, the water of Jamuna river increased 8cm and was flowing 99cm above the danger level at Sirajganj point, reports our Tangail correspondent. In Gaibandha, flood water suspended road communications of five upazilas -- Gaibandha Sadar, Sundarganj, Phulchhari, Shaghata and Gobindaganj -- with the rest of the district. Gaibandha Roads and Highway Department Executive Engineer Asaduzzaman said about 70km of a regional highway -- from Sundarganj to Shaghata -- went underwater. About 517km of earthen roads and 187km of paved roads in four upazilas were submerged, according to local Disaster Risk Reduction office. Rail communication on Gaibandha-Bonarpara route had remained suspended as the water washed away the soil beneath the track, stretching about 1km from Trimohoni to Badiakhali, said Abul Kashem, station master of Gaibandha Railway Station. However, the train communication was restored by diverting two Dhaka bound trains -- Lalmoni Express and Rangpur Express -- via Parbatipur-Santahar section, he said. A large number of Mymensingh and Dhaka-bound commuters from Dewanganj, Islampur and Melandah upazilas of Jamalpur suffered as rail communica-tion on Jamalpur-Dewanganj route has remained suspended due to the flood since Tuesday, said Shahabuddin, station master of Jamalpur Railway Station. Rail commuters of Sarishabari upazila experienced the same problem as Jamalpur-Tarakandi rail route was declared suspended since Wednesday due to the flood, he said. Flood has badly affected around 30km paved and unpaved roads in Kalmakanda upazila of Netrakona, reports our Mymensingh correspondent. In Bandarban, connecting roads from Ruma, Thanchi, and Rowangchhari to Bandarban town have been badly damaged by rain and flood. Around 12km roads have been damaged as landslides occurred at some 32 spots along the roads, said Bandarban Roads and Highway Department (RHD) Executive Engineer Sajib Ahmed. \"We will need around six months to fully recover the affected roads. The loss could be worth around Tk25 crore\", he said. Meanwhile, a bridge constructed by the RHD spending around Tk10.47 crore has collapsed recently in the district's Golden Temple area before its inaugu-ration, reports our Bandarban correspondent. In Rangamati, link roads on Rangamati-Chattogram, Rangamati-Khagrachari, Rangamati-Bandarban and Rangamati-Naniarchar-Longadu routes were damaged heavily in the last few days due to heavy rainfall and water stream, reports our correspondent there. Heavy vehicles were banned on Rangamati-Khagrachari and Rangamati-Chattogram link roads for three days due to landslide. According to Rangamati RHD, landslide occurred at 58 places on the four link roads and 35 main pavements were collapsed. CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver Shanti Chakma told The Daily Star that many parts of Rangamati-Khagrachari link road were damaged in 2017. But the RHD did not repair it permanently which resulted in the damage this year, Shanti added."

      "headline": "Floods fuel onion prices in Bangladesh",
      "authors": "\nReuters, Dhaka/Mumbai\n",
      "text": "Onion prices in Bangladesh have doubled over the past two weeks after floods ravaged the crop and as imports from top supplier India became expensive after New Delhi withdrew incentives for overseas sales, industry officials told Reuters. Onions are used as the base for traditional dishes across Asia such as biryani in Pakistan and India, belacan in Malaysia and fish curry in Bangladesh. Prices in Bangladesh doubled to 50 taka ($0.59) per kg because of floods and traders say they could rise further ahead of the Eid-ul-Adha festival in August, when demand usually goes up for the vegetable. \"The upward trend due to supply shortage could continue over the next few months,\" said Dhaka-based trader Hazi Shahid, adding the country has to raise imports from India to calm prices. Severe flooding has killed at least 61 people, displaced nearly 800,000 and inundated thousands of homes across one-third of Bangladesh, government officials said on Tuesday, after two weeks of heavy monsoon rains. The price rise has become a headache for the government of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which may plan sales of subsidised onions through the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB). \"The price hike is like a nightmare for me. If prices of onions don't come down soon, we'll start selling in the open markets through the TCB,\" Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said. Indian supplies have fallen after New Delhi discouraged exports. India withdrew 10 percent export incentives on onion in June after the prices of the bulb jumped 47 percent in a month in the local market due to dwindling supplies.  As the subsidy has been withdrawn, Indian exporters have to charge more for overseas sales, said Ajit Shah, president of the Mumbai-based Onion Exporters' Association. Even in India supplies are limited and the planting of summer-sown crops has been delayed in some areas due to low rainfall, Shah said. India's monsoon rains to date have been 19 percent below average since the season began on June 1, according to the India Meteorological Department. India exported 2.2 million tonnes of fresh onions in the 2018/19 fiscal year ended on March 30. During the same time, Bangladesh imported 578,111 tonnes of onions from India, according to data compiled by India's Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority. Onion prices in Bangladesh are unlikely to come down unless prices fall in India with a bumper production, said an exporter based in Kolkata, adding, however, that the \"Indian crop is not looking great due to uneven distribution of monsoon rains.\""

At least three children drowned yesterday including two Rohingya boys in Cox's Bazar. Thousands of people remain stranded in the flood affected districts, as road communications have been snapped by flood water. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre said the worst was yet to come as rivers would swell even further, inundating new areas. In Lalmonirhat's Hatibandha, the authorities started using loudspeakers late last night to order thousands of villagers near the Teesta barrage to evacuate immediately. Officials said the water has risen 86cm over the safe level. \"Rescue teams of firefighters, police, and volunteers have been alerted. They are ready,\" Upazila Nirbahi Officer Samiul Amin told reporters. In a Ukhia refugee camp, police found the bodies of Anwar Sadque, 7, and his younger brother Anowar Faisal, 6, on Thursday night after they were washed away in a flash flood. In Chattogram's Fatikchhari, Imam Hossain, 12, drowned in flood water yesterday morning. Around two lakh people of 30 villages in Fatikchhari have been suffering due to the flash floods. Other affected districts are Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Bogura, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Netrokona, Bandarban, and Nilphamari. \"The met office has forecast heavy rains over the next few days. It could worsen the flood situation,\" State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief Enamur Rahman said. The authorities have flagged 628 points in different rivers as risky. Of them, 26 were marked very risky. In Lalmonirhat, new areas were flooded yesterday. Around 50,000 people in 60 villages have been stranded as the Teesta and Dharla rivers swelled. Mozahar Ali, 56, a resident of Gobordhan area of near the Teesta in Aditmari, said villagers have been facing an acute shortage of drinking water as tube-wells in the area have gone under water. \"We have been surviving on chira, muri, sugar, bread and biscuits as cooking is impossible in flooded stoves and kitchens. In Kurigram, people in almost 250 char areas in Sadar, Ulipur, Chilmari, Rowmari and Rajibpur upazilas have been severely affected. Flood water in Sunamganj and Sylhet have risen as the Surma and Kushiyara rivers are overflowing. In Sunamganj, 13,100 families of five upazilas are seriously affected, officials said. In Sylhet, water level in the Sari-Gowain river began to fall yesterday, giving hope to thousands of affected people. In Netrakona's Kalmakanda upazila, vast new areas were flooded yesterday, officials said. Over 10,000 families have been seriously affected while farmed fish from 5,000 ponds were washed away. In Bandarban, around 1,000 families have been stranded as road communication to the areas remain snapped. Chattogram-Bandarban and Bandarban -Rangamati highways have been blocked by floodwater for three days. In Rangamati, about 20 villages of Baghaichari have been submerged. Flash flood has damaged crops on around 100 hectares in the upazila. Officials said the flooding was caused mostly by heavy downpour."

On top of this, it wants another Tk 150 crore for patch-up work to make those \"usable\", RHD officials said. \"A proposal in this regard is being sent to the [road transport and bridges] ministry today [Monday],\" said Abul Kalam Azad, superintendent engineer of RHD's maintenance circle, yesterday. The request for fund is in addition to the Tk 2,550 crore the government allocated to the RHD in fiscal 2019-20 for repairing and maintaining roads, Azad said.  \"We want the additional amount as emergency funds since there is no special fund for such a disaster,\" he told this correspondent.  According to the Flood Control Room set up at the RHD headquarters in Dhaka, 1003.9km of roads and highways had been damaged by floods this year. The country has 21,576km of national and regional highways and district roads.  Of the affected roads, 195.3km are national highways, 167.6km regional highways, and 641km district roads. At least 15.6km of roads were washed away and seven bridges and culverts were damaged. \"We collected the information on affected roads and repair requirements from our divisional offices,\" Munir Hossain, executive engineer at the control room, told this newspaper. The RHD has 65 divisions and 31 of them were flood-affected. WHY SO MUCH DAMAGE? Experts blame poor planning ahead of road construction and ignoring impacts of climate change as the main reasons for floods causing so much damage to roads and resulting in high repair costs.  In 2017, at least 5,015km of roads were affected by two floods and the RHD had to ask for an additional Tk 1,166 crore from the finance ministry for repairing them. Transport expert Prof Shamsul Haque yesterday said flood usually causes more damage to roads in Bangladesh as roads and highways are often built blocking natural flow of water. When a road is built this way, more culverts are needed. But engineers give this little consideration, he claimed. Due to climate change, intensity of rain has increased, he claimed. \"But we haven't considered this climate factor while designing our roads and other infrastructure. That's why we often see damages to large structures by floods.\"  Prof Shamsul, also a former director of Buet's Accident Research Institute, (ARI), said absence of proper drainage system, which should be an integral part of roads, is another reason for the damage to roads and highways. The RHD and Local government Engineering Department give little emphasis on this, he said. Asked about remedies, he said the authorities should go for climate resilient infrastructure development approach. \"Otherwise, we will spend huge amounts of money every year and not see benefits.\" \"Engineers and contractors doing the repairs must be held accountable for their work,\" he said. Transparency and accountability in fund use must be ensured.  Kazi Md Shifun Newaz, assistant professor of the ARI, also said the authorities should consider potential impact of climate change while designing roads and highways. He said roads should be built considering the highest flood level and submersible roads could be constructed in suitable places. Submersible roads can stay under water for months and not get damaged.  AK Mohammad Fazlul Karim, superintendent engineer (road design and safety circle) of RHD, admitted that many roads built decades ago were not \"properly engineered structures\". While building those, connectivity got priority over structural design. \"So, when we go to work on those old roads, we find that many are not properly engineered. \"But now we are constructing properly engineered structures that would survive 10 years without any major maintenance,\" he said, adding, \"We also consider the climate issue and prepare climate adaptive designs for roads.\" He said they are now building roads with bases a metre above the highest flood level considering climate change impact. THE DAMAGE   Around 25 percent of the roads under the RHD are in \"poor, bad or very bad\" conditions, according to an RHD survey on 17,452km of roads in March, well before the floods. The recent flood has worsened the situation, RHD officials said. Although, they made many roads passable ahead of the Eid rush, it would take several months to properly restore the roads, especially the district roads, they added. The roads in Sirajganj came off worst this year compared to those in other RHD divisions. At least 185.74km of roads were damaged, including 33.74km of national highways there.  Ashraful Islam, executive engineer of RHD's Sirajganj division, told The Daily Star over the phone that they sought Tk 9.85 crore for patch-up work and Tk 29.40 crore for road restoration work. He said they were not sure when or how much of the money they would get but they have made the roads \"usable\" with their regular road maintenance fund. The division received Tk 7.35 crore for regular road maintenance in the last fiscal year. Rangpur had 88.5km of roads flood-damaged, Cox's Bazar 79km, Kurigram 72.4km, Naogaon 58.75km, and Feni 57.33km.  Roads and highways were also damaged in Jamalpur, Netrakona, Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, Bandarban, Chattogram, Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, Moulvibazar, Sylhet, Sherpur, Sunamganj, Habiganj, Faridpur, Bagerhat, Bogura, Rangamati, Khagrachhari, Natore, Tangail, Laxmipur, Pabna, Feni, Rajshahi, Khulna and Dohazari RHD divisions, according to the Flood Control Room.  Asked when they would get the money they seek, Superintendent Engineer Azad said, \"It is not possible to say for sure ... but we have already made the roads passable using our own resources [regular repair and maintenance fund].\"  The road transport and bridges ministry would forward the proposal to the finance ministry which would have the final say regarding the allocations, he added. Another RHD official said the finance ministry, upon receiving the proposal, usually asks them to use their regular repair and maintenance fund to patch up the roads as such allocations takes some time to process."

The flood had left one of her two tin shacks completely wrecked, the latrine and many other objects were gone, and there was a thick layer of wet silt on everything that had not got washed away.  \"We haven't earned anything in about two weeks.  Will we buy food or fix the home,\" said the landless peasant woman of Lalmonirhat's Bagdora area. Another victim, Josna Begum, 30, a resident of Singra Bazar area under Phulchari upazila of Gaibandha, passed nine days at a local embankment as her house was inundated by floodwater. After returning home yesterday, she found that her three tin-roof houses was washed away by water. Like her, around 1.10 lakh people were affected by the flood in Lalmonirhat, officials said. The receding flood waters are leaving trails of devastation also in Chattogram, Cox's Bazar, Bandarban, Khagrachari, Rangamati, Feni, Brahmanbaria and Nilmphamari, according to the National Disaster Response Coordination Centre. About 47 lakh people are being directly affected by flood water in Kurigram, Bogura, Gaibandha, Sirajganj, Netrakona, Sherpur, Tangail, Jamalpur, Faridpur, Shariatpur, Rajbari, Madaripur, Manikganj, Munshiganj, Chandpur, Sylhet, Sunamganj, Habiganj and Moulvibazar, the report said. Meanwhile, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) said the situation in Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Bogura, Tangail, Sirajganj, Manikganj, Rajbari, Faridpur and Munshiganj may improve today. The Teesta river at Nilphamari's Dalia and Dharala river in Kurigram are likely to may rise abruptly today while there would be heavy showers in the northern districts, the FFWC bulletin said. Many flood victims are still suffering from food and water shortage. \"We got 10kg rice as relief a few days ago. Now, we don't know what we will eat in the coming days,\" said Soneka Bala, 58, a resident of Tajpur village under Lalmonirhat. Another victim, Ataur Rahman, a resident of Nowbosh area in Kurigram, said, \"I stored some rice in my house. When the flash flood water entered my house, we evacuated immediately. After nine days, we returned home today only to find that our rice has been destroyed.\" Many families have become victims of river erosion and lost their houses and lands. In Munshiganj, houses of over 100 families of Kharia and Teutia area in Lauhajang upazila have been eroded by the Padma in the last one week. Houses and lands of over 100 other families are at the risk of being eroded. Many of them have taken their household essentials, tin-roofs and furniture elsewhere. "

      "text": "In 1989, the United Nations observed the first International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction on October 13 to promote a global culture of risk-awareness and disaster reduction. This year's theme focuses on one of the seven targets of the \"Sendai Seven\" campaign: reducing disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services. The world in 2018 had to face 315 natural disasters with 11,804 deaths, over 68 million people affected and USD 131.7 billion in economic losses. Asia suffered the highest impact and accounted for 45 percent of disaster events, 80 percent of deaths and 76 percent of people affected. Among those disasters, earthquakes were the deadliest (45 percent of deaths), followed by flooding (24 percent) and storms (28 percent). The \"Asia-Pacific Disaster Report 2019\" revealed that the annual economic loss due to disasters cost the region nearly USD 675 billion, about 2.4 percent of its gross domestic product. According to Armida Alisjahbana, the head of UN-ESCAP (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific), the region's countries cannot achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 if their people are not protected from disasters. Around the transboundary river basins of South and South-East Asia--home to hundreds of millions--poverty, hunger and under-nourishment are coupled with intensifying floods that alternate with prolonged droughts. The fragile environments are converging with critical socioeconomic vulnerabilities with disastrous consequences across the region. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world, constantly battling with multiple threats--such as on June 11, when there were lightning, fire, nor'wester, landslide, flash flood, waterlogging, building collapse, boat capsize, bridge collapse, riverbank erosion and flood. The \"Asia Pacific Disaster Report 2019\" (UN-ESCAP) gives a grim picture of how disaster-prone Bangladesh is. Its population are subjected to recurrent annual flooding. Cyclones and associated storm surges and floods have led to almost all of the nearly 520,000 natural disaster-related deaths in the last 40 years, economic damage notwithstanding. Cyclone Sidr in 2007 cost an estimated USD 1.7 billion in damages and losses. What's more, the country's extreme vulnerability to hydro-meteorological hazards, including storm-induced tidal flooding, is likely to increase due to climate change. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (2015), about 13 percent households and 12.64 percent of the population live in disaster-prone areas of the country. Between 1980 and 2008, Bangladesh experienced 219 natural disasters. The geographical location, land characteristics, multiplicity of rivers, coastal morphology and the monsoon climate render Bangladesh highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Bangladesh suffers from floods, cyclones, storm surges, riverbank erosion, earthquakes, droughts, salinity intrusion, fires and tsunamis. Cyclones in 1970, 1991, 2007, 2009 and 2019 killed 364,000, 136,000, 3,363, 190 and 14 people due to various cyclone induced causes. However, Bangladesh is also known as one of the most resilient countries. Despite the regular and devastating events, the country manages to attain significant progress in almost all sectors. Now the challenge is mainstreaming the disaster risk reduction into development interventions. Local governments should consider natural hazards in the respective areas for any rural infrastructure. Each and every village/char should have the bare minimum of a raised plinth with cattle sheds as flood shelters and or cyclone shelters. A monitoring mechanism is needed to ensure that rural housing follows standard guidelines of disaster management. Unfortunately, severe inequalities between low-and high-income countries persist, with the lowest-income countries bearing the greatest relative cost of disasters. Human losses and asset losses relative to gross domestic product tend to be higher in countries with the least capacity to prepare, finance and respond to disasters and climate change. The obligation and opportunities to address inequalities in terms of disaster needs to be incorporated into future diplomatic agendas. Reducing risks must start with understanding the reality of the people most affected--to take initiative with multi-stakeholder's participation. Disaster risk management, response and climate change adaptation are never stand-alone actions. Many individuals need to be pro-active for a common goal, as a collective safeguard against disaster. Besides, people in areas where there is risk of multiple hazards often face discrimination based on gender, age, ethnicity, religion and other differences. The Community Initiated Disaster Risk Reduction (CIDRR) approach can be a gateway if civil societies are instrumental in blending local and global knowledge. As independent actors, NGOs and the private sector along with civil society can foster the community's engagement with the government's framework. Though NGOs and private sectors are characterised by a diverse range of capacities and scopes, a platform like Global Network for Disaster Reduction (GNDR) is essential. This network should ensure that the local voice to be heard at the national, regional and global levels. This network can initiate dialogue and build bridges among countries in the region. One of the most extensive such example is the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna river basin shared by Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and India. A vibrant national civil society platform on disaster reduction with NGOs and private sectors can strengthen advocacy to make governments and the international community be more responsive to the felt need. The solution for risk reduction or climate change adaptation can't be an external prescription or imposition but rather spontaneous local initiative--which can be improvised with global expertise and experiences. The government can also explore and support local solutions beyond big projects like embankments. The Standing Order on Disaster (SOD) in Bangladesh has defined roles at all administrative levels in the country, with spaces to accommodate local innovation and actions. But many stakeholders remain unaware about this \"way-forward\". However, two significant gaps in addressing the risk reduction remain big challenges. One, the gap between preparedness and emergency response which can be minimised with the help of forecasts. And the other between disaster response-rehabilitation and resilience. \"Transition Funding\" can be a unique way forward towards resilience--by enhancing economic ability, ensuring social safety net and access to market through poverty mapping. Forward momentum in disaster reduction by the GO-NGOs at site, the major challenge here is accessing humanitarian funds immediately. The procedures and protocols to get access at the local level remain an obstacle to optimise the use of resources so that they reach people immediately. When forecasting indicates floods, rescue boats and water-sanitation facilities are the immediate priority within a few hours. If local government holds adequate funds and if local NGOs have access to immediate funding, it can reduce crises significantly. The START Fund in Bangladesh has demonstrated how access to humanitarian funds by local organisations within 48 hours can make a big difference. The government and other UN/International agencies can actively think about this idea and to review how \"humanitarian funding complexities\" can be reduced.

      "text": "As many as seven thousand fish farmers in Jamalpur have suffered huge loss, estimated at around Tk 48 crore, in this year's floods that washed away their ponds. After the floods inundated 9,032 ponds in the district, about 2,984.32 tonnes of fish from the ponds escaped into floodwaters, according to Fisheries Department in Jamalpur.   Fisheries Officer Abdul Majid said the flood caused Tk 47.95 crore worth of damage to the fish farms and Tk 7.19 crore of it is infrastructural damage. The damage also includes Tk 3.47 crore worth of fingerlings or baby fish that the floodwater washed away.   Fish farming plays a vital role in meeting demand of protein intake for Jamalpur's 23 lakh inhabitants as the local farms, run by 16,500 farmers, produce almost half of the fish required annually in the district, he also said.  Many affected farmers said their loss was extensive this time since most of their ponds were stocked with a large quantity of fish. While speaking with this correspondent, fish farmer Omar Faruk, from Kotamoni village in Sadar upazila, said this year he spent Tk 3.5 lakh on his five ponds, on 2.5 acres of land, and before getting flooded, the ponds had 40 to 50 maunds of fish, each weighing 500 to 600 grams. \"All the fish have been washed away by the floodwater. Otherwise, three months later, I could make Tk 7 to 8 lakh from the fish and 50 percent of it would be profit,\" he said. Without assistance from the authorities concerned, especially without loans or subsidies, the fish farmers might not be able to recover the loss and stand up on their feet again, he also said.  Humayun Kabir Jamali, another fish farmer from Sawnia village in the same upazila, said he invested Tk 7 lakh in a netted fish enclosure in an open waterbody. But he lost the entire investment due to the flood. Now the fish farmers desperately need financial support from the government, he added."

      "text": "Every Bangladeshi living overseas is used to having their motherland associated with natural disasters, namely floods and cyclones. This can feel humiliating at times. It is the expatriates' burden to perpetually challenge the sometimes negative, international image of Bangladesh. Now Bangladeshis living in Australia have embraced their adopted homeland in the wake of the worst bushfires in living memory. Australia is the driest continent in the world and much of its eastern seaboard has been charred with inferno in the past month. Twenty-five people have died. There have been estimates of half a billion animals having perished with pictures of kangaroos fleeing fires broadcast across international media outlets. Twelve million acres have been burnt, six times the land mass of the Californian fires of 2018 which forced one of the biggest peace time evacuation in the country's history. Few Bangladeshis have been directly affected. Australia has attracted large numbers of skilled migrants and International students in the past decade but the vast majority live in urban areas, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. But all have been moved to action, giving money, food and water where possible. A local community radio outlet, Gaan Baaksho, has captured the community's attention with a Facebook driven funding round. Others are reaching out to Australian natives in messages of support and sympathy. The challenge of building a collective identity among different ethnic groups is raised as a problem in multicultural societies like Australia. The bushfires have functioned as a force for unifying the nation giving a sense of common purpose. Meanwhile the Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has been heavily criticised in the international media. This is in relation to an ill-advised holiday to Hawaii he undertook with his family during Christmas and the limited government action on climate change. Booker Prize winning novelist Richard Flanagan wrote scathingly in the New York Times: \"Australia today is ground zero for the climate catastrophe. Its glorious Great Barrier Reef is dying, its world heritage rainforests are burning, its giant kelp forests have largely vanished, numerous towns have run out of water or are about to, and now the vast continent is burning on a scale never before seen.\" This outpouring of anger is significant. Only last year the Bangladeshi High Commissioner in Australia, Suifur Rahman, urged Australia to engage more closely with Bangladesh. Rahman has expressed disappointment about Bangladesh remaining a high security threat in Australia's diplomatic classification since the Holy Bakery attacks, downgrading the country's status. Australia is however the world's second largest exporter of coal and Bangladesh is set to have at least eight more coal power plants by 2026. \"There is enormous opportunity for export of Australian coal and LNG to Bangladesh given Bangladesh's sustained energy demand,\" said Mr Rahman to Nine newspapers. \"If these are added to the traditional traded items, Bangladesh could emerge as a major trading partner of Australia soon.\" These comments made last year raised eyebrows and concerns among Australian climate change activist groups. This is because Bangladesh is known to be one of the most vulnerable countries in the world from the effects of climate change, given it is so low lying. A quoted statistic in Australia's press was that if sea levels rise according to some United Nations estimates, twenty percent of the Bangladeshi landmass would be underwater and some thirty million people will be displaced. If Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable poor countries with regards to climate change, recent events have exposed Australia as one of the most vulnerable rich countries. It is the land of drought and bushfires. The expatriate Bangladeshi community is rapidly increasing in Australia, one of top five fastest ethnic groups. Ties between the two countries are already growing, cemented further by the foreign Minister Marise Payne visiting late last year, including monitoring the Rohingya crisis on the Burmese border. The recent bushfires have aroused a wave of patriotic feeling among Bangladeshis for their adopted home. It has also built a new kind of mutual bond regarding natural disaster and climate change. The potential in the near future is for Bangladesh and Australia to be locked into an unusual, ironic embrace, a combination of coal and climate change. Let us hope the relationship is as mutually beneficial as it may be profitable. The writer is a Bangladesh-origin psychiatrist, based in Sydney."

      "text": "A flash flood in early April of 2017 devastated the boro crops in six haor districts that were worth Tk 13,000 crore (Kaler Kantha, July 8, 2017). Since then, a shadow of anguish engulfs millions of farmers every time there is a grey cloud in the northern sky in early April. This year too, according to news reports, rain accompanied by hailstorm damaged crops on vast tracts of paddy fields in Kishoreganj and Moulvibazar districts during the first week of April.  In general, yearly floods in the haor region occur during late April and last for several months. Boro crop is harvested after Bangla New Year around April 15 or so. Any early hailstorm and flash flood during late March or early April cause havoc for farmers. In addition to damaging the boro crop, the flood in 2017 also devastated poultry, fisheries, and livestock in Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, and Kishoreganj districts (The Daily Star, April 17, 2017). Flash floods in the latter part of March or early April are not a regular occurrence in the haor region as it happened in 2017 and 2019. Against this backdrop, it is imperative to investigate the underlying causes of early flash floods in the haor region and to look for possible solutions to such devastations. Are the early floods becoming a new trend in our weather? First, let us investigate underlying causes of any flood in a region and the reasons why the frequency, magnitude, and duration of floods increase over time. The causes of floods can be broadly divided into several categories: (1) the amount, timing, and duration of rainfall over a catchment or watershed area, (2) an increase in surface run-off following a rain event and a decrease in water-carrying capacity of natural drainage network within the watershed to accommodate the surface run-off, and (3) a reduction in land elevations in floodplain in comparison to riverbed and sea level. Most rivers in the haor region originate in Meghalaya and Assam states in India. About 60 percent of the total catchment area of the rivers draining the haor region are located outside the territory in Bangladesh. Part of the rainfall in upper reaches of the watersheds ends up in rivers, creeks, and beels in haors as surface run-off. It should be mentioned that Cherrapunji in Meghalaya receives the highest amount of rainfall in the world, which eventually drains through the haor region. A total of 1,262mm of rain fell at Cherrapunji during the period between March 28 and April 4 in 2017, which was 5.5 times greater than the amount of rainfall during the same period in 2016. Besides, the rainfall occurred in a consecutive manner, which did not allow enough time for the downstream rivers in the haor region to effectively discharge the surface flow to the ultimate destination--the Bay of Bengal--through the Meghna River at Bhairab Bazar. To calculate the total amount of surface flow in rivers that results from rainfall in various parts of the watershed, it is important to have hourly and daily rainfall data for various locations within a watershed. Although continuous rainfall data at a rain gauge station at Cherrapunji is available on the Internet, such data is not publicly available for other locations in the haor region. However, monthly average rainfall data starting from 1901 for Garo, Khasia, Jaintia Hills, and Sunamganj is available, except for Sunamganj, for which data since 1956 is available. A statistical analysis of the monthly rainfall data reveals correlations between the rainfall in Cherrapunji and all the other locations. Based on such correlations, the amount of daily rainfall was calculated for Garo, Khasia, Jaintia Hills and Sunamganj for the period of March 28-April 4 in 2017. For example, although the amount of rainfall at Cherrapunji was 1,262mm during the duration of the flood in 2017, Sunamganj received only 350 mm during the same period. An analysis of average monthly rainfall data also revealed that during 1901-1957, the total amount of rainfall in May was much higher than in April and that there was a 3-5-year periodicity in the amount of high rainfall in May. However, the data indicated that during 1958-2017, the gap between the monthly rainfall in May and April has declined and that the amount of rainfall in April has increased. This is worrisome, because more rainfall in early April will mean increased incidents of flash floods in the haor region, which will cause havoc on boro crop in the future. Hopefully, this year's early rainfall accompanied by hailstorm is not a sign of validation of the changing patterns in rainfall in the haor region. If the occurrences of early flash flood become a new normal, then a lot more research will have to be done to adjust the crop type and embankments in the haor region to protect the crop. Now, let us investigate the water-carrying capacity of the rivers in the haor region. An analysis of satellite images of the region indicates that most of the rivers have lost depth and width over the last few decades, resulting in a net loss of water-carrying capacity during floods. The reduction in water-carrying capacity has resulted due to siltation in riverbeds, land-use changes, unplanned development, deforestation within the watershed, and unplanned mining of sand from riverbeds. In addition, building of roads and embankments also interferes with the natural flow of surface water in the haor region. For instance, the width of the Jadukata River near the India-Bangladesh border was 168m in 2004; it stood at 68m in 2017. The total cross-sectional area of any river increases as it flows downstream to accommodate more flow from groundwater and tributaries. The analysis of the changes of Ghorautra-Meghna River indicates that its cross-sectional area, which is indicative of its water-carrying capacity, has drastically declined at Bhairab Bazar bridge. It should be noted that all surface water flow in the haor region discharges through the Meghna River at Bhairab Bazar. This reduction in water-carrying capacity at Bhairab Bazar can be attributed to slow discharge of upstream flow which, in turn, is responsible for prolonging the haor floods. The increase in sea level due to climate change is compounding the flood problem further by making all inland river sluggish due to backwater effect, and by reducing surface elevations of floodplain with respect to sea level and riverbeds. What are some possible solutions? I think we should increase the water-carrying capacity of the drainage network in the entire watershed; supplement the water-carrying capacity of the Meghna River at Bhairab Bazar though capital dredging and establishing a bypass spillway above the railway bridge; reach a treaty with the upper riparian country on integrated water-sediment-landuse management; and carry out research to invent crops that can be harvested prior to early flood season.

      "text": "The Global Economic Prospects, a flagship report of the World Bank Group, said activity in Bangladesh would grow at an average of 6.7 percent a year over fiscals 2018-2020, benefiting from strong domestic demand and strengthening exports. \"Low interest rates and improved infrastructure are expected to lift investment,\" said the report, which was unveiled globally on Tuesday. Remittances are expected to rebound as growth firms up in Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the report said. Bangladesh is among the top 17 out of 134 countries in the list of GEP forecasts that are projected to have a growth rate of 6.4 percent or more in 2017-18, said Zahid Hussain, lead economist of the World Bank's Dhaka office. The government has set a target of 7.4 percent GDP growth for the current fiscal year. Recently, Finance Minister AMA Muhith said the gross domestic product may grow by 7.5 percent. But Hussain said, \"Achieving the government target of 7.4 percent growth this fiscal year will be challenged by banking sector vulnerabilities, infrastructure deficiencies, uncertainties in the run up to elections, and the slow pace of structural reforms.\" The Bangladesh economy is projected to grow 6.4 percent in 2017-18.  The government's Seventh Five-Year Plan aims to achieve 7.4 percent GDP growth annually for 2015-16 and 2019-20. The WB report said commodity importers across Asia continued to register solid growth, in line with potential rates, supported by robust domestic demand and strengthening exports. According to the report, the growth remained strong in Bangladesh despite disruptions related to floods. Main downside risks to the outlook for Bangladesh include fiscal slippages and a setback in implementation of reforms to improve corporate and financial sector balance sheets. In South Asia, growth slowed to an estimated 6.5 percent in 2017, marginally below the June 2017 forecast owing to temporary disruptions from adverse weather conditions across the region. Elevated credit growth continued to support investment in some countries, including Bangladesh and Pakistan. About the risk confronting the countries, the report said the main risks to the outlook are domestic. Current account deficits gradually widened across the region, including in countries such as India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Balance sheet weakness for corporate--for example in India--and financial sectors--for example in Bangladesh and India--continued to weigh on private investment, the report said. Corporate debt overhangs and high levels of non-performing loans have been long-standing concerns in some countries, including Bangladesh and India. \"Setbacks in efforts to resolve these domestic bottlenecks would continue to weigh on investment, and more broadly on medium-term growth prospects in the region.\" Slippages relating to upcoming elections and weak tax revenues (e.g., Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan) could derail fiscal consolidation efforts, said the WB. Remittance inflows have been subdued recently due to fiscal consolidation and growth slowdowns in the Middle East, which constitutes roughly half of remittances to South Asia. A protracted slowdown in remittance inflows would weigh on domestic consumption in countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.  Bangladesh's remittance earnings dropped to a six-year low to $13.53 billion in 2017 as many expatriate Bangladeshis sent money home through illegal channels. The WB said the global economy is experiencing a broad-based cyclical upturn, which is expected to be sustained over the next couple of years, although with downside risks. In contrast, growth in potential output (full-employment output) is flagging, languishing below its longer-term and pre-crisis average both globally and among emerging market and developing economies. \"The forces depressing potential output growth will continue unless countered by structural policies,\" the World Bank said."

      "text": "Floodwaters continued to recede yesterday in the country's north and northeast, leaving trails of massive damages to crops, houses, roads and dykes. Many flood victims were still living on embankments or government shelter centres while some started returning to damaged homes. Visiting Jamalpur in the last three days, photojournalist Amran Hossain of The Daily Star saw huge low-lying areas with aman seedlings, fish and vegetables affected by flooding. \"After harvesting, farmers immerse jute plants in water bodies for rotting, but a good portion of the crop has been washed away by floodwaters,\" he said. Some 25 families took shelter at Jarultala Govt Primary School flood shelter centre in Islampur union on July 25. They alleged the government did not supply any relief aid to them. On July 31, some locals gave them some rotis only. Having lost crops and fish, farmers were worried about the coming months. Osimuddin Miah, a farmer in Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila, lost aman paddy on 1.66 acres of land to flooding. \"I borrowed Tk 20,000 from an NGO for cultivating aman, but the floods have ruined everything,\" he said yesterday after returning home along with his five-member family from an embankment. The 62-year-old had no idea about how he would repay the loan, go for growing another crop and repair the house, reports our Lalmonirhat correspondent. Mofazzal Hossain, 56, a farmer at Shiberkuti village, could not buy aman seedlings as the prices were high.  \"If the govt doesn't provide necessary support, we won't be able to grow aman paddy,\" he said, adding that it would ultimately have an adverse impact on their livelihood. Fish farmer Mohammad Ali in Melandah upazila of Jamalpur said he spent Tk 10 lakh for farming in two ponds, but the total investment is lost due to flooding. As of yesterday, crops on 1.07 lakh hectares in 23 districts have been inundated by floodwaters, according to Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE). The DAE would make a complete assessment of the damages after the flood is over. Based on the assessment, the government would decide on how to help the affected farmers, DAE Director General Md Hamidur Rahman told The Daily Star. The government would ensure availability of paddy seedlings and vegetable seeds so that farmers can resume cultivation after the subsidence of floodwaters, he added. According to the Department of Disaster Management, at least 6,34,409 families in the country's 16  districts, mostly in the north and northeast, have been hit by flooding since mid-July. The deluge killed 21 people and fully damaged some 8,140 houses. Some 2,000 km of roads and 58.09 km of embankments in Jamalpur; seven km of roads in Nilphamari; 327 km of roads in Sirajganj and 300 metres of dykes in Gaibandha were damaged fully or partially. Disaster Management and Relief Minister Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya yesterday said the government would take a 40-day programme to rebuild the damaged houses in low-lying areas. \"Immediately after the receding of floodwaters, the government would start rebuilding the damaged homes,\" he said while distributing relief materials among the victims in Phulbari of Gaibandha. Two hundred more flood shelter centres will be built to protect people from flooding, Maya added. Meanwhile, water levels in the Buriganga, Turag, Balu and Shitalakhya around the capital are rising and the trend might continue in next 24 hours, according to Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC). \"There is no possibility of flooding in northern and western areas of Dhaka. But the low-lying areas in the east might see flooding,\" said Ripon Karmaker, assistant engineer of FFWC. "

      "text": "In 2017, a large quantity of rice was imported from India and mainly from the bordering state of West Bengal. Exact figures of imported rice from India are not known yet and, most probably, it will not be known and, as always, approximate figures are the basis for following the trend in Indo-Bangladesh trade in rice. One is left with this impression based on the experience of rice imports from India during 1998 floods. In 1998, government figures showed 4.2 million tonnes of rice were imported from India. Of this amount, 2.2 million tonnes were imported to make up for the shortage created by floods and 2 million tonnes to cover the usual annual deficit in domestic rice production. At that time, the only land port of entry of Indian rice into Bangladesh was Benapole. Bangladesh's customs authority at this checkpoint provided figures of Indian rice imports that don't match official government statistics. When the Indian central bank (as sole authority of opening letter of credit) was approached to verify which estimates were correct, it provided a different figure. It shows uncontrolled border trade played a significant role in entry of Indian rice into Bangladesh. It is likely this scenario may also play out in current situation. Last year when price of coarse rice was rising rapidly, I had the opportunity to observe the coarse rice auction systems in Bardhaman district of West Bengal auction place and the price at auction was Rs 20-21 per kg subject to availability of rice in the auction place. Sometimes the price rose to Rs 22-23 during short supply. The price of rice in the local market of West Bengal at that time was Rs 28-30/kg. Price of one kg was equivalent to Bangladeshi Tk 26-27. In the local market of Bangladesh rice price during the same period was Tk 42-43. I was told that upon reaching Benapole border rice price increases to Rs 26-27 per kg, which is equivalent to Tk 34-35. Price of one kg rice within Bangladesh until it reaches local market increased Tk 9-10 taka. The issue is here whether there is any scope to reduce the cost of transportation and handling of the merchandise during transit so as lower the retail price of imported rice in local markets. India's total rice production in 2016-2017 (October/September) was 107-107.5 million tonnes against the demand of 99 million tonnes. It means India has a maximum exportable surplus of 8.5 million tonnes of rice, of which 4.5 million tonnes are Basmati rice. In other words, only 4 million tonnes of conventional rice is available for export. As India maintains close friendly relations with other countries to further its geo-strategic interests, Bangladesh should be mindful of a stark reality that India cannot be taken as granted as the sole source of importing rice. Additionally, India has its some own internal problems in different states in handling rice issues. For example, the central government of India requested West Bengal state government to provide it with some quantity of rice for supply in other rice-deficit states of India. For its part, the West Bengal government has its mid-day meal programmes and supply of rice to the people living below the poverty line. The West Bengal state government's programme of subsidising rice to poor people is larger in scope than the central government's programme. However, the state government has been facing some problems to run these two programmes. The system of procurement in West Bengal is as follows: farmers sell their paddy to the millers and millers sell milled rice to the government. However, this year, due to higher price in local market, farmers are not giving the paddy to the millers. The system is that millers should buy rice only from real farmers (government provides identity card to the real farmers) and not from individuals other than farmers. Farmers are not happy with this approach because very often millers do not buy farmers' rice saying quality is not good, moisture contents are high and lack of money to the millers and delays in cashing miller cheques received from the government by selling milled rice to the government as government has no money in their account. In these circumstances, farmers incur losses in labour and transportation costs for bringing paddy to the millers. Media reports say in some places, to avoid this situation, a group of farmers sell their rice to the middlemen and certify that he/she is authorised by farmers to sell their rice to the millers. This system also did not work due to dishonesty of the middlemen.  Because of above situations both social safety net programmes of the state government are under threat and government has very little options to overcome this situation. However, one of the options may be to reduce export of rice to Bangladesh in future. Other points to take into account for long run rice import from India is that the MSP (minimum support price) of rice has been increased 1.5 times of the cost of production and will be effective since October 2018. It has been announced in the recent budget of 2018-2019. It may cause rice price hike in India. Another point is that rice is grown in India mainly in monsoon period and is considered as rainfed crop and the major winter crop of India is wheat and not rice. In view of that production and productivity performance of rice depends mainly on rainfall distribution in the country. In India only 40 percent of rice areas are irrigated. The third point is that the geo-political landscape has been changing very rapidly in this region. It may stand as one of the weighty factors of receiving rice from any country including India. Considering the above situation, Bangladesh should not entirely rely on rice import from India and try to open up new opportunity for importing rice. We have to remember that Bangladesh's efforts to import rice from Vietnam, Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand in 2017 were less successful. It says policies in this regard should be more straightforward and transparent and country capacity to negotiate import deals will also play a crucial role.

      "text": "Wheat imports slumped 17.8 percent year-on-year to 34.20 lakh tonnes in the first seven months of the fiscal year owing to its escalating price in the international market and the relatively lower prices of its substitute rice locally. The import of the grain soared last fiscal year following losses for recurrent floods, according to two private importers. Since then farmers have bagged good harvests of rice, reducing the appetite for wheat among a section of consumers. \"Rice prices are competitive this year while the prices of wheat have increased in the international market this year,\" said Abul Bashar Chowdhury, chairman of BSM Group, a major commodity importer from Chattogram. The low-protein wheat's price soared to $240-$270 a tonne in recent months from $190-$230 a year ago, he said.  In addition, higher domestic production of rice has also dampened the prices of the staple in the domestic market. Retail prices of coarse rice, consumed mostly by the low-income people, fell 10 percent year-on-year to Tk 38-42 a kilogram yesterday in Dhaka city, according to market data by the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. Wheat flour prices remained unchanged. \"There is a section of people who switch to wheat if the prices of rice are higher. They return to rice if the prices of the staple remain relatively low,\" Chowdhury said. This is the first time since fiscal 2011-12 that wheat imports dropped. Over the last seven years, spiralling domestic demand trebled wheat import as local production fell short. Total import by the public and private sector rose to 4.8 percent year-on-year to 58.80 lakh tonnes in fiscal 2017-18, according to food ministry data. As of January 31, public sector imported 1.97 lakh tonnes and private sector imported 32.22 lakh tonnes, according to Fortnightly Foodgrain Outlook by the food planning and monitoring unit under the food ministry. \"We see a kind of negative growth this time. Total wheat import is likely to fall if the international prices continue to remain up and farmers harvest bumper rice in the next season,\" Chowdhury added. Abdus Shukur, head of supply chain (food and energy) of Bashundhara Group, one of the leading importers and processors of wheat, however, expects wheat imports to not fall come the end of the fiscal year. \"Imports picked up in January,\" he said, adding that the total imports this fiscal year would be 60 lakh tonnes. Domestically, wheat area has contracted further to 3.29 lakh hectares during the current season as many growers have switched to maize and other crops to cash in on higher gains, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension. Farmers grew the grain on 3.50 lakh hectares and harvested 10.98 lakh tonnes in fiscal 2017-18, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics."

      "text": "We are trying our best to reach the status of middle-income country but an earthquake of magnitude of 7 or above can shatter that dream, prevent us from achieving the sustainable development goals, slow down growth, and push us down to a lower economic status.  We talk about earthquakes and then we quickly forget about them. We talk about earthquakes when a tremor jolts Bangladesh. We panic, we jump out of high buildings, we get injured, and we lose our family members and neighbours, we lose our lives. Media outlets rush to the scene, try to get a sound bite from those who are traumatised. A few talk shows cover the incident and we hear from experts, including senior government officials and practitioners about what to do, what the gaps are, what people should do, and what the government and non-government bodies should do. We feel that things have changed, become hopeful about having a better system, earthquake-resilient infrastructure and services. But in reality, we tend to forget about the threat within a few weeks or months after the initial shock. We have become habituated with this post-earthquake dementia. This is not to say that nothing has been done so far in Bangladesh regarding earthquake preparedness. A number of actions have been taken to enhance earthquake preparedness in Bangladesh. It ranges from equipping Fire Service and Civil Defence and Armed Forces Division; creating a large group of volunteers in major cities; conducting risk-mapping, zoning, and contingency planning of government departments; carrying out research to understand the magnitude of risks, and so on. However, there are many things that should be done immediately to build earthquake resilience.  Stanford University's Earthquake Disaster Risk Index 2010 ranks Dhaka among the 20 cities most vulnerable to earthquakes. Earthquakes will not only kill or injure people but also damage our export capacity and displace millions. THE SCIENCE OF EARTHQUAKE RISKS AND THREAT TO BANGLADESH\n Earthquake is a natural phenomenon which is created as a result of the sudden movement of rocks along the existing fault under the surface of the earth. The point on the surface of the earth directly above the focus of the earthquake is known as the epicentre. Earthquakes are powerful due to their strength. For example, a magnitude 7 earthquake releases 30 times more energy than a magnitude 6 earthquake and 300 times more energy than a magnitude 5 earthquake.  Densely populated Bangladesh sits at the juncture of three tectonic plates: the Indian plate to the west and southwest, the Tibet sub-plate to the north, and the Burma plate to the east. Moreover, the plate boundary between India and Burma passes through Bangladesh and these tectonic blocks were responsible for many earthquakes in the past. For us, some major faults should be noted due to their potential for giving way to devastating earthquakes: Bogra Fault, Tripura Fault, Dauki Fault and Assam Fault Zone. All of these can produce earthquakes of a magnitude of 7!!-8.5. Among these fault zones, Dauki Fault has a history of creating high-magnitude seismic activities and impacts. The Dauki Fault has been active in the past and associated with the magnitude-7 Cachar Earthquake that struck Sylhet (Shilchar) in 1869. This fault has become inactive but it is considered as one of the major threats in Bangladesh. The number of earthquakes has been increasing significantly over the last 20 years. From 1997 to 2018, more than 13 earthquakes above a magnitude of 4.5 have been felt in Bangladesh. Some of these had an epicentre within Bangladesh. A recent study published in the science journal NATURE (Michael Steckleretal, 2016) showed that scientists have discovered new evidence of a hidden fault, which is buried under miles of river sediment. This could cause an earthquake of magnitude 8.2 to 9.0 in Bangladesh, and affect nearly 140 million people across the country, India and Myanmar. The destruction will not directly be due to the shaking. It will happen through changes in the courses of great rivers. Dhaka is within the zone of destruction. Overall, the general consensus is that rapid urbanisation of Bangladesh has created a greater vulnerability to seismic events because urban planning and preparedness of the essential services have not been at par with the risks. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE SO FAR IN BANGLADESH\n Bangladesh has been widely regarded as the \"champion of disaster management\" globally. We have improved our management and mitigation measures against cyclones and floods. However, coping and mitigation strategies for earthquake have remained in the preliminary stage. The Government of Bangladesh (GoB) has taken up a number of programmes to build earthquake response capacity. A good amount of search and rescue equipment has been bought with support from bilateral and multilateral donors. The Fire Service Department's fire-fighting capacity has been tremendously improved. Some of the good examples are:  (I) Sector-specific risk assessment guidelines and mapping for earthquake for major cities (such as Dhaka, Chattogram, and Sylhet) and for medium and small urban areas, as well as for tsunami in 13 coastal districts; (ii) Seismic micro-zonation of Dhaka city, comprising probabilistic calculation of peak ground acceleration levels, estimation of predominant period of local amplification for micro-tremors, and amplification factor of each geomorphological type; (iii) Establishment of three new earthquake observatories, four seismometers and 30 accelerometers in earthquake vulnerable locations; (iv) Development of National Earthquake Contingency Plan by anticipating future earthquake risks, debris management plan and dead body management plan; (v) Development of Ministry and Sectors' Contingency Plan anticipating future risks of multi-hazards. With the support of the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction & Recovery (GFDRR), the GoB has also developed Guidebooks on City Earthquake Risk Atlas, Legal and Institutional Frameworks, Dhaka Risk-Sensitive Land Use Planning, and an Information, Education, Communication and Capacity Building Roadmap as part of earthquake preparedness for Dhaka. Emergency Operating Centres (EOCs) have been identified, equipped and made functional during disasters like cyclones and floods. The Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP) Phase I and II of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR) has developed an urban risk assessment (URA) methodology which is widely used by different actors to develop urban risk assessment of Sylhet, Rangpur and parts of Dhaka and Chittagong. UNDP and GoB jointly developed seismic exposure level and contingency plan of Mymensingh city. The earthquake risk atlas of Chittagong City Corporation (CCC) was developed by CCC and NGOs with support from the European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office in 2005. The Bangladesh National Building Code has been revised by experts, and is now awaiting final approval of the authority. The concerned authorities with the support of structural experts and earthquake scientists have identified a number of vulnerable buildings in Dhaka city and drafted a debris management plan. MoDMR and NGOs are regularly organising national and international workshops and symposiums to highlight the risk of earthquakes and to raise public awareness. MoDMR with Public Works Department has retrofitted a couple of buildings in the Secretariat and other parts of Dhaka city. Yearly earthquake drills have been organised involving all stakeholders and international actors in Dhaka for the last decade.  WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE\n Earthquake preparedness should be everybody's business. All stakeholders have a role to build an earthquake-resilient Bangladesh, not only the concerned authorities. Action needs to be taken at the individual, family and community levels to build a culture of earthquake resilience. Private sector, mass media, and social media have a critical role in enhancing awareness on earthquake preparedness. Earthquakes are not only a national threat but also a regional threat. We should not only be satisfied by taking all necessary steps for earthquake preparedness in the country; we should also strengthen regional cooperation to tackle earthquake threats. Locating the epicentre and monitoring each shock may improve our understanding. However, it is important to focus on training and public awareness; integration of seismic resistance in infrastructures; development of safety systems in all public buildings; and introduction of local actor-based earthquake management. First of all, it is important to implement existing policies and acts such as the Disaster Management Act without any delay. The rules of the Act need to be finalised and approved immediately. The building code should be strictly enforced for all new construction. All constructed buildings should be investigated to measure earthquake resilience. In this regard, the private sector can play a big role. Insurance should be made an essential requirement for all kinds of construction. If all the buildings are brought under an insurance scheme, the risk will be transferred to the private sector. Insurance companies will be responsible for ensuring standards and enforcing the building code for their own businesses. This will also make the real estate companies, contractors and building owners responsible for maintaining seismic resistance of constructions. We have to: (i) Take measures to minimise gaps in urban planning to reduce the increasing risks. Steps need to be taken for complete decentralisation of urban governance and shifting power to elected city bodies for comprehensive planning and execution; (ii) Effectively utilise educational institutes to reduce the impact of urban risks. All educational institutes should be assessed for earthquake vulnerability and ensure investment for retrofitting vulnerable buildings; (iii) Ensure more effective resource allocation for earthquake preparedness and make earthquake risk reduction measures an integral part of all development programmes; (iv) Continue refresher trainings and orientation programmes for volunteers and ward disaster management committees and awareness-raising and preparedness activities at school to enhance knowledge and disseminate public announcements, alerts and education materials on earthquakes. Children are the change-makers and can bring an effective change in the mindset of their families about earthquake preparedness. The youth in our society are the first responders in any emergency situation. We should look beyond vulnerable urban centres and reach out to the youth at the grassroots level around cities. They can be a valuable local resource for raising awareness in society on earthquakes and fighting disasters in times of need. We should build: (i) A strong volunteer group and first responders in the least vulnerable areas surrounding risk cities. When the city is on the verge of collapse, those trained volunteers and first responders will be able to act fast and save lives in the devastated areas, and (ii) Capacity of our water-police and ability of fire service department to move through the waterways around all major cities and other earthquake vulnerable urban areas so that they can respond quickly during any big earthquake when the major roads are damaged or blocked by debris.  We need to have a plan for transport management. During a major earthquake, millions of people will try to leave the cities and urban centres and go to relatively safer locations, mostly to their semi-urban and rural homes. During the Nepal earthquake, the transport workers and owners' association played a key role to assist more than 700,000 people to leave Kathmandu city. We need to be prepared for such mass evacuation with proper planning and support system. We have to raise awareness and management capacity of the transport workers and owners. Coordination and management of hundreds of groups during a mega-disaster become a nightmare for local and national governments. The Disaster Management Act and Standing Order on Disaster need to incorporate the scope of regional cooperation and facilitation of international search and rescue teams and responders during any major earthquake in Bangladesh. Our airport authorities and staff should be trained to handle record amounts of relief materials, personnel and cargos in the major airports. In case the airport collapses, alternative airports need to be made ready to facilitate the necessary international and regional support during a mega-earthquake. All identified evacuation centres, locations and open spaces should be equipped with water supply, sanitation, faecal sludge management system, health care, energy supply and shelter to prevent post-earthquake deaths due to cold, waterborne diseases or lack of essential services. We would need trauma counsellors who will be able to provide psychosocial support to the survivors immediately after the devastation and help them recover quickly.  There is no early warning for an earthquake. But scientists have developed household level sensors which can track the first wave of earthquake energy and give a signal for second wave of energy which is stronger and can create major devastation. Depending on the location of the epicentre of an earthquake, people have anywhere between 30 seconds to a couple of minutes to get out of the buildings or take shelter in a safe location in the buildings. People should be instructed to install those systems in all government buildings, religious centres, shopping malls, industries and residential buildings.       Above all, all plans, preparedness and risk reduction measures for earthquake should be inclusive--ensuring that no one is left behind, that all persons with disabilities, children, women, third gender, elders are identified and taken care of, that they are involved in preparation of evacuation plan and drills. Since the last most devastating earthquake in 1950 in the region, the population of this seismically active region has increased 50 times. Major cities like Dhaka, Chattogram, Sylhet, Mymensingh, Bogura, and Rangpur now have populations of more than several millions. Unless these measures are taken seriously and given adequate priority, earthquake preparedness will remain a distant dream for a country like Bangladesh. It's time we took earthquake preparedness seriously.   Shashanka Saadi is the Head of Emergency Preparedness & Response Programme, BRAC International."

      "text": "The success of Dhaka, one of the megacities of the world, is critically important for the economic and social development of Bangladesh. The city's astonishing growth, from a population of 3 million in 1980 to 18 million today, represents the promise and dreams of a better life: the hard work and sacrifices made by all residents to seize opportunities to lift themselves from poverty towards greater prosperity.  However, as Dhaka has grown to become one of the most densely populated cities in the world, its expansion has been messy and uneven. Dhaka's growth has taken place without adequate planning, resulting in a city with extreme congestion, poor liveability, and vulnerability to floods and earthquakes. Many residents, including the 3.5 million people living in informal settlements, often lack access to basic services, infrastructure, and amenities.  Unplanned and uncontrolled growth has created unprecedented congestion: the average driving speed has dropped from 21km per hour 10 years ago to less than 7km per hour today. Continuing on current trends would result in a further slowdown to 4km an hour--slower than the average walking speed! Congestion eats up 3.2 million working hours each day and costs the economy billions of dollars every year. Some of the most important economic benefits from urbanisation are missed out due to this messiness, resulting in lower incomes for the city and the country. These problems will not go away on their own. Dhaka's population is expected to double once again by 2035, to 35 million. Without a fundamental re-think requiring substantial planning, coordination, investments, and action, Dhaka will never be able to deliver its full potential. Dhaka is at a crossroads in defining its future and destiny.  Up to now, urban growth has mainly taken place in the northern part of Dhaka and expanded westward after the flood of 1988, when the government built the western embankment for flood protection. This resulted in high-density investments near the city centre, where infrastructure and social services were accessible. However, real estate investments were not coordinated with other infrastructure and transportation services.  A similar process is taking place eastward of Dhaka despite the absence of an embankment to protect it from flooding. If properly managed, the development potential of East Dhaka is massive, as it is mainly a rural area with parts that are within the walking distance of the city's most prosperous neighbourhoods. A well-planned East Dhaka could boost productivity and liveability, while helping relieve congestion in the rest of the city; but with a business-as-usual approach, doubling the size of Dhaka could amount to little more than doubling the current messiness. For Bangladesh to become a middle income country by its 50th birthday, a lot depends on the success of Dhaka's urban expansion. Based on the current path, East Dhaka runs the risk of facing the same low productivity and high congestion as the rest of the city, with greater vulnerability to floods and earthquakes. Retrofitting infrastructure in the current, dense and congested Dhaka is much more difficult and costlier than planning and building towards the East, with the future in mind. However, this needs to be done quickly, before East Dhaka densifies too. The time to act is now. Today, ministries and agencies responsible for Dhaka's development and experts from around the world gather for the \"Dhaka Toward 2035\" conference to share global experience in managing urban development while presenting scenarios and options for Dhaka's future. Rigorous simulations of the city's development will be discussed, and the experience of other major developing country cities that achieved a radical turnaround will be reviewed. For example, Shanghai's population growth from 6 million to over 24 million has been accompanied by improved access to services, economic activity, liveability, and mobility through greater transportation services. Much of this success has been due to its strategic approach to the development of East Shanghai (Pudong), and its integration with the rest of the city. The Pudong \"miracle\" transformed Shanghai into a global city in just 25 years. The experience of Shanghai and other cities shows that success requires a clear vision--one that is embraced by government agencies, private investors, citizens and development organisations, and supported by careful planning and tight implementation.  Leading up to a forthcoming report, to be released this fall, the conference presents four scenarios for Dhaka's future depending on the actions that it takes today, through decisions such as completing an embankment in East Dhaka, investing in transportation, and managing and enforcing planning and zoning laws. The simulation results show what a big difference a strategic approach to Dhaka's urban development would make. The opportunity to create a bright future for Dhaka, as a vibrant and liveable city, must be seized now before it is too late.

Yet locals can meet just 2 percent of the demand at home, prompting garment, pharmaceutical and food processing industries to import the rest from Thailand, India and Vietnam. Cassava takes around a year to grow on being planted between November and March and the variety available in Bangladesh can be harvested once. Food processor Pran estimates that 30,000 tonnes of Cassava were grown on 6,000 acres of land in 2018 whereas in 2017 some 14,000 tonnes were harvested from 3,700 acres.    However, extracting just one kilogramme of starch can require some four kilogrammes of cassava. While the industries seek around 3.50 lakh tonnes of starch, local growers can garner only 5,000 to 6,000 tonnes, said Mahatab Uddin, chief operating officer of Pran Agro Business. Meanwhile, industrial demand for cassava starch is growing by 10 to 15 percent every year, he pointed out. The solution, according to cultivators and sector insiders, lies in expanding its farming while using high-yield varieties. Uddin said cassava's sole weakness was waterlogging. Flash floods and excessive rains dented 2017's harvest as 2016's yield was around 1,000 tonnes more, but required 700 acres of less land, he said. Agriculture graduate Rajib Kumar Roy echoed Uddin, saying two to three days' waterlogging would do the damage, for which hilly or partially-hilly areas were the land of choice. Roy too was interested in expanding his farm, for he hopes to make a profit of Tk 5 lakh from a 200-tonne harvest cultivating some 60 acres of land in Srimangal upazila. There is no need for extra efforts demanded by paddy and other crops, except that fertiliser has to be used, he said, adding that it was very easy and cheap and anyone could cultivate it without any prior training. Liton Datta, another farmer who cultivated cassava on 200 acres of land at Rongirkul village in Moulvibazar's Kulaura upazila, expects to make a profit of roughly Tk 20 lakh from his harvest which he believes would amount to 1,400 tonnes. According to him, every acre of land requires Tk 25,000 to Tk 35,000 and yields at least 6 tonnes of cassava. There are varieties of the crop which can be harvested twice a year and can raise per acre output to 14-15 tonnes, Datta said.  Masuk Mia, a grocer, cultivated cassava on 350 acres of land in Bijoynagar of Brahmanbaria and Kanighat of Sylhet under a contract with Pran. Pran says it provides farmers Tk 17,000 per acre in advance for cassava farming before it purchases each kilogramme for Tk 7.5. He said a profit of at least Tk 10,000 can be made from an acre with minimum invest and labour. He accused the Department of Agricultural Extension of not cooperating with farmers and not giving clues on how to improve the quality of the harvest. Talking to The Daily Star, Bimal Chandra Kundo, principal scientific officer of the Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute (BARI), said they did not have enough scientists to research and develop high-yield cassava. He acknowledged that it fell upon the BARI to develop a hybrid variety as had experts in the Philippines and India had done. Kundo pointed out that collection of hybrid seeds from any country requires permission from the agriculture ministry's seed wing and certification from the source country. The BARI plans to develop a high-yield variety through research on collecting seeds from India's Tamil Nadu, where the cultivation was widespread, he said. \"We need to develop the crop in Bangladesh as the economic benefit is there through the multidimensional use in the industrial sector,\" he said."

Like Anwara, thousands of other marginalised people are left in a tight spot amid a 10-day government shutdown from Thursday. They cannot go out of their home and earn their living. The government is enforcing the shutdown as part of its efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus, which so far has claimed five lives in the country. According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 20.5 percent of the country's population of 16.6 crore are poor. Of them, more than half fall under the extreme poverty line. Recently, the government has announced some initiatives taking the plight of these people in consideration, including measures to reach food to them, and to encourage them stay indoors.    The Department of Disaster Management (DMM), under the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, has a stock of about 24,717 metric tonnes of rice. It also has an allocation of Tk 7.58 crore under its Humanitarian Assistance Programme to deal with the crisis. On March 24, the department allocated 6,500 metric tonnes of rice and Tk 5.5 crore to the deputy commissioners of the 64 districts so that the DCs can help those in need. The DCs along with the Upazila Nirbahi Officers and local government representatives are now preparing lists of those in need of support in their respective districts, said sources at the DMM. Economists, however, said the government must start distributing relief materials immediately among the marginalised ones. \"The government needs to prepare a map with details of the beneficiaries and the places they live,\" noted economist Hossain Zillur Rahman, also the executive chairman of Power and Participation Research Centre, told The Daily Star yesterday. Another important thing is that the government must ensure that the initiatives do not get stuck in bureaucratic tangles. Therefore, it has to be done immediately with coordination among DCs, city governments, NGOs and volunteer organisations, he added. Prof Mustafizur Rahman, distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), said since a large number of people have already moved to the villages from urban areas, their names might not be on the lists being prepared by the local administration. \"These people will have to be included in the list immediately so that they too get the relief materials,\" he said. One major challenge would be to identify those who lost their homesteads to floods or river erosions and shifted to the cities and other urban areas, he noted. That section of people could not go back to their homes, said Prof Mustafizur, adding that the city corporations with help from other organisations should identity them and create a database so that they don't remain left out. Volunteer organisations can play a big role here, he added. Senior Secretary Shah Kamal at the disaster management and relief ministry said they would sit in a meeting next week to find out what else could be done. He said the DCs were asked to send demand lists. \"Once they send those, we will make arrangements,\" he said. \"The DCs are the centre of the government relief efforts. They will work in coordination with the local government bodies to distribute relief materials among the poor,\" Shah Kamal told The Daily Star. According to estimates of the local administrations, there are nearly 9.5 lakh day labourers in the country, he said. He also said the DCs were preparing packets of relief materials -- each containing 10kg rice, 5kg potato, one kg lentil, one kg salt, one litre soybean oil, and a piece of soap -- for the distribution.  The relief materials will be sent to the homes of the beneficiaries as part of government efforts to ensure social distancing, which is vital to slow the spread of coronavirus. Shah Kamal said they have already allocated 2,000 tonnes of rice and Tk 55 lakh for the poor people living in Dhaka and Chattogram cities. Of the amount, Tk 30 lakh has been allocated for those in the capital. Of the allocated rice, 1,200 tonnes are for those in Dhaka while the rest for Chattogram, he said. The secretary also said they were giving topmost priority on the villages as a huge number of people have already left for their village homes. In Dhaka, the DC office and the city corporations will soon start working to distribute relief items among slum dwellers and day labourers. Dhaka DC Abu Saleh Mohammed Ferdous Khan said they had already received a support of Tk 20 lakh and 200 tonnes of rice from the DDM. \"We are still preparing the list of the needy people. Those who are in dire needs will be given priority,\" he told The Daily Star. This newspaper reached the DCs in several other districts for comments. Satkhira DC SM Mostafa Kamal said, \"We're making a list of rickshaw and van pullers, auto-rickshaw drivers, cobblers, porters and day labourers.\" \"Our primary target is to give relief materials to 200 people in the municipality area and 100 marginalised people in each upazila,\" he said. Satkhira has six upazilas and a municipality. He said they were likely to begin the distribution today. The district administration of Gaibandha also received Tk 20 lakh and 200 tonnes of rice. DC Abdul Matin said he instructed the UNOs to prepared lists of the marginalised people. \"We'll send the relief packets to people's home directly to avoid any sort of crowd,\" he added. As part of the efforts to help the poor, the government is planning to lower the price of per kg rice to Tk 10 from current Tk 30 at the open market sale (OMS), said several sources. Asked, Mosammat Nazmanara Khanum, secretary at the food ministry, however, said they were yet to get any instruction in this regard. Sarwar Mahmud, director general of the Directorate General of Food, said they had an adequate stock of rice -- around 18 lakh tonnes. \"If the government says, we have our manpower ready to distribute rice among the people,\" he said. Only 17.84 percent of the poor people living in towns and cities receive support from the government's social safety schemes, whereas 35.77 percent of the poor people in rural areas get the benefits, according to a World Bank report released last year. In the meantime, people in need want the government to distribute the relief without any further delay. \"I earned only a few bucks yesterday. There is hardly any passenger on the street,\" said Md Firoz, a rickshaw puller in the capital. \"What will I eat if things don't change soon?\" he asked.

      "text": "Bangladesh will import 600,000 tonnes of rice in an effort to replenish reserves and rein in prices of the staple. Authorities are also considering waiving the tax on rice imports, said Badrul Hasan, the head of the Directorate General of Food, as local prices have hit a record high and state reserves are at a six-year low. The state buyer issued a tender to import 50,000 tonnes of parboiled rice today, its first such tender in many years, after flash floods hit fields about to be harvested, potentially wiping out 700,000 tonnes of crops. \"We will import a total of 600,000 tonnes of rice, while we have already issued a tender and another tender will be issued very soon,\" Hasan said. He said the state agency also planned to import rice through government-to-government deals with producers such as Thailand, Vietnam and India as importing via tenders is a lengthy process. The world's fourth-biggest producer of rice with more than 30 million tonnes of rice, Bangladesh consumes almost all its production to feed its population. It often requires imports to cope with shortages caused by natural disasters such as floods and droughts. Bangladesh was ranked as the fourth-largest importer of the grain by the US Department of Agriculture in 2011, as low stocks and soaring prices led the government to import. Since then, the state grains buyer has not imported rice although private traders have done, mostly from India. In 2015, Bangladesh's government imposed a tariff of 28 percent on rice imports to protect local farmers after private traders imported around 1.5 million tonnes of rice from India that led to a drop in prices in domestic markets. State rice reserves in government warehouses have fallen to around 350,000 tonnes, the lowest in six years. Rice is the main staple for Bangladesh's 160 million people, but wheat consumption is also rising due to lifestyle changes. Bangladesh imports about 4.5 million tonnes of wheat annually to meet growing demand, making it south Asia's top wheat buyer, while the country's output has stagnated at about 1 million tonnes."

      "text": "The plastic sector may contribute more than 1 percent to the economy, but it also produces 8 percent of Bangladesh's waste, which is alarming for the environment, experts said yesterday. Only raising awareness among people on the usage of plastic, especially polythene bags, can save the country from the devastating threat of environment pollution, Md Ziaul Haque, director of the environment department, said at a seminar at Ban Bhaban in the capital's Agargaon. Bangladesh ranks 10th among countries, which are the responsible for most of the plastic pollution. Plastic comprises 8 percent of the country's waste generated every year, weighing some 800,000 tonnes. Of the waste, 200,000 tonnes end up in the ocean and rivers, said Haque while presenting a keynote paper. According to Haque, roughly 14 million pieces of poly bags are used every day in Dhaka city, often ending up in rivers and the ocean and posing a hazard to marine life. Bangladesh experienced floods in 1998 and 2008 when plastic bags were one of the major causes for blockages in drainage systems, he said. Anisul Islam Mahmud, environment, forest and climate change minister, said the environment would have to be protected for future generations through raising awareness about the negative impacts of the use of plastic and poly bags. He said the use of plastic and poly bags would bring devastating consequences for the environment if they were not recycled. \"We will not be able to avoid plastic and poly bags in our daily life. But we should find out alternative products and cooperate with plastic producers in collecting used plastic products and poly bags to ensure recycling,\" he said. Jashim Uddin, president of the Bangladesh Plastic Goods Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said initiatives are being taken globally to stop single use of plastic to mitigate environmental hazards. \"If we can put in place a proper plastic waste management system, it will help protect the environment. It is already happening in Japan, Singapore and the Netherlands,\" he added. He said plastic manufacturers recycle about 70 percent of used plastic products and export them to China as scrap. Billal Hossain, additional secretary to the ministry, said although the government banned poly bags in 2002, they are still in use. Sultan Ahmed, director general of the environment department; Ram Sharma, forest specialist of the United Nations Development Programme, and Arif M Faisal, a programme specialist of the UNDP, also addressed the programme. The department of environment handed over crests as awards to three participants of an environment fair based on their contribution to environment protection. The Clean and Sustainable Environment Project secured the first position, KPC Industries Ltd came second, and Craft and Kraft third."

For instance, Bangladeshi researchers used supercomputers for genome sequencing of jute in Malaysia.

It will help us save assets worth thousands of crores of taka,\" Palak said at a programme held at the Daffodil International University in Dhaka on Tuesday. In the absence of one in Bangladesh, people go to Malaysia or developed countries during emergencies to access supercomputers. \"We need this computer for the sake of digitisation, which will ultimately save our assets and money,\" the state minister said, adding that the purchase will be made shortly. The supercomputer will be sourced from Inspur, a Chinese information technology company with speciality in server hardware manufacturing. The ICT division has asked Inspur to share the price of the supercomputer and the rate of return on investment. Officials of the ICT Division said they would involve the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission and other allied public offices with the process."

      "text": "DEVASTATION IN THE WAKE OF FLOODS In March, a punishing flood left haor areas across Sylhet and adjacent districts completely devastated. Subsequently, floods hit 32 districts--including low-lying northern ones--claiming dozens of lives, resulting in acute water and food crisis. While water resource minister, Anisul Islam, echoed the statements of local officials claiming that rats were to blame for the collapse of dams that exacerbated floods in that region, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) sued 61 people, including engineers of Bangladesh Water Development Board and contractors, for purposeful mismanagement and corruption in the construction of dams. Flash floods caused significant damage to Boro crops across the country, as more than six lakh hectares of agricultural land were submerged. Many blamed the floods for the subsequent rice crisis. In June, The Daily Star reported that the country saw 42 percent rise in rice price in a year. The crisis forced the food ministry to take steps to import rice from Myanmar, in spite of strains in bilateral relations due to the recent Rohingya influx. In addition, floods halted academic activities in thousands of educational institutions in north and northeastern districts, affecting several lakh students.   JUDICIARY: NOTABLE RULINGS Last year, Narayanganj district court condemned 26 convicts--including former RAB officials--for their involvement in the infamous seven-murder case in the district. Four convicts were awarded the death sentence for ruthlessly killing Rajon, a teenage boy in Sylhet, whose death sparked outrage across the country. The High Court in May declared that mobile court led by magistrates was illegal--an issue that strained judiciary-executive relations. Also in May, the Supreme Court upheld the life sentence of Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, the Jamaat leader and cleric, for committing crimes against humanity during the liberation war in 1971.   A submerged Boro field at Purakandulia in Dhobaura upazila of Mymensingh. Photo: Star\n In August, the apex court asked the government to return tax collected by intelligence agencies during the tenure of the last caretaker government. In yet another landmark ruling, the High Court asked the concerned parties such as the government and insurers to pay Tk 4.61 crore in compensation to the family of Tareque Masud, a noted filmmaker who had been killed in a road accident in 2011, paving the way for getting compensation for victims of road accidents. In February, the apex court awarded the life sentence to the bus driver who caused the accident. The High Court in August declared illegal and void the two deals Niko Resources Bangladesh Limited signed with Bapex and Petrobangla during the last BNP-led government, as those had been procured through corruption.   THE SINHA SAGA\n Surendra Kumar Sinha, the former chief justice, had been vocal about issues of judicial independence. Throughout his tenure, the relations between the judiciary and the executive branch of government were tense, especially over the issue of the gazette notification on the rules determining the disciplines and code of conduct for lower court judges. (After his departure, in December, the law ministry finally issued the gazette notification, keeping the power to appoint and remove lower court judges in the hands of the president and the executive branch.) On many issues, Mr Sinha often traded heated words with the attorney general. However, the ruling party responded sharply when the apex court nullified the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, which had granted the parliament power to remove sitting judges. In particular, the-then chief justice found himself in hot water because of a sentence in his judgment: \"No nation - no country is made of or by one person.\" The pro-ruling party voices alleged that by writing this sentence, the chief justice questioned the leadership of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in the Liberation War. He denied it. The situation was exacerbated when he cited the Pakistani judiciary's removal of the country's prime minister as an example of how judicial decisions should be respected by the political establishment. Subsequently, Mr Sinha \"applied\" to go on leave for one month on health grounds--something critics alleged he was coerced to do. While on his way to the airport to Australia, in an unforeseen move, he told reporters that he was not ill, contradicting the law minister. He also accused the government of interfering with the judiciary. After one month, he did not return as promised to resume his role as chief justice. Instead, he was said to have sent his resignation letter--an unprecedented incident in the history of Bangladesh-- from abroad. Meanwhile, the government brought up a number of charges-- including corruption, money laundering, and moral aberration--against him. However, the government did not appear to pursue these charges once he resigned.   A NEW ELECTION COMMISSION\n As the tenure of the last Election Commission expired in February 2017, a new Election Commission was formed to conduct the next general election to be held in 2019. Twenty-six registered political parties proposed 100 names from which 20 names were primarily shortlisted by the search committee for reconstituting the five-member Election Commission. Subsequently, the new Election Commission was formed on February 6, 2017 and KM Nurul Huda, a former secretary, was appointed as the chief election commissioner. After the formulation of the new Election Commission, the prime minister said in parliament that an initiative could be taken to formulate an \"appropriate law\" in light of the Constitution to appoint the CEC and election commissioners the next time. She also expressed her opinion in favour of introducing the e-voting system. The BNP, however, wrote to CEC urging not to use EVM in the next JS polls as the party believed that EVM would lead to digital rigging in the election. Later, during its dialogue with the Election Commission, BNP proposed the dissolution of parliament and a polls-time \"supportive government\" to oversee the next election. In addition, it also proposed for deployment of the army with magistracy power. While the ruling Awami League insisted that the elections would be conducted as per constitutional provisions, at least 25 out of 40 parties that talked with the EC since August 25 also demanded deployment of army during the election.   BNP'S PRESENCE IN THE POLITICAL SCENE\n Ahead of the election to be held in 2019, the main opposition party BNP took up some political programmes which were met with resistance from the government. The party in May 2017 unveiled a 256-point vision paper that it called \"Vision 2030,\" in which it revealed a long-term plan for the country's governance and economic development. However, Awami League General Secretary Obaidul Quader alleged that the BNP stole the idea from AL's \"Vision 2021\" and said that it was nothing but \"a joke and an attempt to deceive the nation.\" According to BNP, if this vision is implemented, the country's per capita income will rise to USD 5,000 from current USD 1,466, and it will achieve a double-digit annual growth rate by 2030. In May 2017, police raided Khaleda Zia's Gulshan office to seize \"materials for carrying out anti-state and subversive activities\" but they found nothing during the over-two-hour-long search. The party leaders termed the move as \"provocation by the government\" and it was aimed at spoiling the \"election atmosphere.\" BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia's motorcade was attacked in Feni when she was heading towards Cox's Bazar to visit the Rohingya refugee camps on October 28. At least 45 people were injured and some 30 vehicles damaged in the incident. Nearly 15 journalists were also assaulted. Earlier in June, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir's motorcade also came under attack in Chittagong's  Rangunia when he was en route to visit the landslide-affected areas in Rangamati. Mirza Fakhrul termed the attack as \"an example of the government's intolerance.\" In November, the party held a big rally at Dhaka's Suhrawardy Udyan. But many of its supporters could not come to Dhaka to attend the rally as most of the Dhaka-bound buses carrying them could not enter the city. BNP Senior Joint Secretary General Rizvi Ahmed alleged that the government suspended public transport services to bar the leaders and activists of the party and its allies from entering the city so that they could not attend the rally.   NO TEESTA WATER-SHARING DEAL\n In April 2017, the prime minister's visit to India was a disappointment for the people of Bangladesh as the much-delayed Teesta water-sharing deal was not signed. The prime minister went on a four-day state visit to India with the hope of breaking the stalemate on Teesta. However, the deal could not be signed as West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee could not be persuaded. Previously, the Teesta water-sharing deal was set to be signed during the then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to Dhaka in September 2011 but had to be scrapped at the last minute due to Mamata's objections. Although this time the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi signalled a quick solution to this issue, the reality on the ground was different. Coming out of a meeting held between Mamata Banerjee and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Mamata told journalists that there was no water in the Teesta river to spare for Bangladesh. However, Bangladesh and India signed six agreements and 16 memoranda of understanding (MoU) during the PM's visit.   BANKING SECTOR IN TURMOIL The banking sector had been particularly volatile throughout last year. The turmoil began with the news that Islami Bank, the largest private bank in the country, suffered a \"peaceful coup d'etat,\" with major changes made in its key positions including the chairman, vice chairman and managing director. The bank, long suspected as the financial backer of Jamaat-e-Islami, saw another round of change in May. Chittagong-based S Alam Group, under the auspices of the government, reportedly assumed the charge of the bank after having bought much of its shares. Proponents of the changes argued the efforts were part of the \"de-Jamaatisation\" process of the bank. In a similar fashion, S Alam Group swiftly took control of Social Islami Bank in October last year. Two incidents, preceded by a similar manoeuvre in Bangladesh Commerce Bank in 2016, coupled with soaring default loans, which now constitute 10.67 percent of total distributed loans--an all-time high--raised concerns about the stability of the financial sector. The state-owned banks, in particular, are in extreme crisis. The government also moved ahead with amending Banking Companies Act, extending the tenure of directors and doubling the number of directors in a bank's board from a single family. A number of economists and bankers, including former deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, Ibrahim Khaled, criticised the move, saying it would hurt the interest of the depositors, and that the owning families would further consolidate their grip.   TERRORISM: YEAR OF DECLINE\n While 2016 was heavily categorised as the year of growing militant activities, 2017 saw a coterie of high-profile, successful, and deadly anti-terrorism operations. With the tide of global terrorism declining and ISIS stronghold in Syria nearly diminished, the statistics of Bangladesh's domestic militancy showed a downward trend in 2017. A top \"Neo JMB\" (or, the local affiliate of ISIS) leader, Nurul Islam Marzan, who allegedly coordinated the notorious Gulshan cafe attack in 2016, was killed in a shootout in early January. March was the most turbulent month in the whole year. At least two attempts to attack security forces took place in March. On March 17, a man sneaked into a RAB barrack in the capital's Ashkona and blew himself up during Jumma prayers. A week later, a man was killed when a bomb attached to his waist exploded near a police box at the airport intersection. ISIS claimed responsibility for both the \"suicide attacks\". In the following days, a number of raids were conducted in suspected militant \"dens\"--in Dhaka, Sylhet, Comilla, Moulvibazar, and Chittagong. Operations in Sylhet even involved army personnel. In the Moulvibazar operation, Lokman Ali, a suspected militant, killed his entire family of seven members including himself. On August 15, security forces foiled a plot to target National Mourning Day commemorations. In September, during an anti-terror operation in Dhaka's Darus Salam area, suspected militants--at least seven--killed themselves by detonating bombs. In November, a RAB operation in Rajshahi and Chapainawabganj left three suspected militants dead. In March, the government banned Ansar Al Islam, the al-Qaeda affiliated militant organisation that had hacked a number of bloggers, writers and publishers to death.   RAMPAL POWER PLANT: CONTROVERSY NOT SETTLED\n The controversy surrounding Rampal power plant near the Sundarbans continued throughout most of last year. Apart from warnings of dire environmental consequences, a Greenpeace study claimed in May that the plant would cause at least 6,000 premature deaths and low birth weight of 24,000 babies during its 40-year life. Earlier, Unesco had threatened to inscribe the Sundarbans in the list of World Heritage in Danger. In July, it was claimed, rather misleadingly, that Unesco had \"lifted\" its previous objections and \"endorsed\" the construction of the plant. Later, as the official decision came to light, it turned out that Unesco did soften its position, but remained short of lifting its objections. Though it did not specifically mention Rampal plant, it retained its position to not allow \"any large-scale industrial and/or infrastructure developments\" to proceed before a Strategic Environment Assessment (SEA) was submitted. Later, Unesco made it clear that \"large-scale industrial and/or infrastructure developments\" included the Rampal plant. Despite the clarification, Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, prime minister's energy affairs adviser, vowed to continue with the plant's construction. UNESCO'S RECOGNITION OF   HISTORIC 7TH MARCH SPEECH Unesco recognised Bangabandhu's historic 7th March speech as part of world's documentary heritage. On October 30, UN's top cultural body included the speech in its Memory of the World International Register, a list of world's important documentary heritage. On November 18, the government arranged a public rally to observe the recognition.   ROOPPUR PLANT: FIRST CONCRETE POURED On November 30, Bangladesh witnessed the pouring of First Concrete of its first nuclear power plant at Rooppur, Pabna. It marked the beginning of the main construction of the plant, a Bangladesh-Russia joint project that will have two power units, each of 1200 MW capacity. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was the chief guest at the First Concrete pouring ceremony, while a postal stamp featuring a photo of a nuclear power plant on the background of a rising sun was released to commemorate the occasion.   LANDSLIDES IN THE HILLS\n In June 2017, at least 146 people died in the worst ever landslide since 2007 in the hilly areas of Chittagong, Rangamati and Bandarban following daylong continuous downpour. In 2007, the death toll in landslides in Chittagong was 128. Increasing settlements, destruction of forest over the years, and construction of roads without enough impact assessment were some of the causes identified for these landslides. Although the reasons were well-known to the local authorities and people in general, no steps were taken to prevent such manmade disasters. Under the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act 1995 (amended in 2010), cutting of hills without government approval is banned. But as this law is not implemented, hill-cutting goes on unabated making people vulnerable to landslides. According to district administration office, in Chittagong city, over 50,000 people of low-income groups live on the slopes of 30 hills and an estimated one lakh people live on hilltops and slopes in Cox's Bazar town.   EDUCATION SECTOR: BELEAGUERED BY NEVER-ENDING CONTROVERSIES\n The education sector was mired in a series of controversies in 2017. In January, the new textbooks were found to have contained numerous errors and blunders, including spelling mistakes, wrong arrangements of paragraphs, omissions of articles, etc. Particularly, a sentence in Class I's Bangla textbook--\"I want a scarf (orna)\"--caused a stir in social media circles. In addition, the withdrawal of some poems and prose by progressive writers and poets led many--including TIB--to allege that the government did so to appease radical groups like Hefazat who demanded those changes. The allegations gained fresh momentum when the government accorded the Dawrah-e-Hadith certificate the status of masters degree in May. From primary school exams to Dhaka University admission tests, question paper leaks continued unabated. Many question papers of JSC and even PSC exams reportedly appeared in social media before the exams actually took place. In DU's cases, the police arrested at least 10 persons allegedly involved in the leak, despite the authority's initial denial.   THE HAJJ FIASCO\n Every year, Hajj pilgrims have to go through a lot of hassle before going to Hajj. But last year, a large number of Hajj pilgrims faced uncertainty over performing Hajj because of the private Hajj agencies' failure to collect visas and air tickets for the pilgrims on time. In 2017, a total of 1,27,198 pilgrims--4,200 under government management and 1,22,998 under private management--were scheduled to go to Saudi Arabia for performing Hajj. One of the main reasons for the delay in visa processing was the imposition of an additional fee of 2,000 Saudi Riyal on repeat pilgrims by the Saudi Hajj authorities. The fact that the ministry of religious affairs did not know in advance about these extra fees added to the woes of the pilgrims. Biman Bangladesh Airlines had to cancel many of its scheduled flights due to shortage of passengers. The ministry of religious affairs gave an ultimatum to the agencies which failed to complete the visa-related procedures on time. Also, Biman Bangladesh Airlines had to arrange extra flights for Hajj pilgrims at the last moment. Although the private Hajj agencies' inefficiency became evident in the whole episode, the religious ministry's failure in managing the entire procedure came under criticism during the months of July and August.   DHAKA STUNG BY CHIKUNGUNYA Dhaka city saw the spread of Chikungunya disease for the first time in 2017. The outbreak of the disease raised a new public health concern in addition to dengue. The two city corporations as well as the health ministry had totally failed to act when it came to taking preventive measures to contain the outbreak of the disease. Like dengue, Chikungunya is contracted through mosquito bite. People from almost all parts of the city were affected by the disease. However, the worst affected were the residents of Kalabagan, Kathalbagan and Hatirpool areas. As many as 566 people in the capital had been diagnosed with Chikungunya, according to the findings by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), which conducted laboratory tests on patients from mid-April till the first week of July. According to an IEDCR newsletter, the number of Chikungunya patients was 519 in May-June with a peak of 95 people recorded positive in the fourth week of May alone.   A SHARP RISE IN ROAD ACCIDENTS\n On March 27 last year, the cabinet had approved the draft of Road Transport Act 2017. Although the draft law was welcomed by all, it did not include any provision for punishment for fatal accidents or accidents that cause severe injuries. The highest punishment for fatal road accidents is a three-year jail sentence. News of road accidents made headlines in local newspapers throughout the year. The numbers of deaths from road accidents were particularly high during the two Eid festivals. The findings of Bangladesh Health Injury Survey (BHIS) 2016 were made public on February 16, 2017 which revealed that on average, 64 people die every day from injuries in traffic accidents. And National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways (NCPSRR), an organisation campaigning for safety in the transport sector, said in a report that at least 2,297 people were killed and 5,480 injured in road accidents in the first six months of 2017, a sharp rise in the death toll compared to the same period in 2016. However, on December 3, the High Court in a landmark verdict had ordered the bus owners, driver, and insurer to pay Tk 4.61 crore in compensation to the family of eminent filmmaker Tareque Masud for his death in a road accident in 2011. This is the first compensation trial held directly in the HC instead of a lower court in the country. In her reaction after the verdict, Catherine Masud said, \"It has been legally recognised that accidents are not merely an accident. The drivers, bus companies and even the insurance companies have the responsibility behind such accidents. We have sought redress under the law. I hope that many others will get compensation in the same way.\"   LANGADU ATTACK In 2017 we witnessed at least two major incidents of attacks on minority communities where the local authorities totally failed to contain the violence. On June 2, at least four villages in Rangamati's Langadu upazila were torched by Bangalee settlers over the death of a local Jubo League leader Nurul Islam Nayan, the organising secretary of Langadu sadar union Jubo League, a pro-Awami League youth body. Bangalee settlers who carried out the attacks claimed that Nayan was killed by indigenous people while the indigenous people of the upazila refuted the claim. An elderly Chakma woman was hacked to death by the attackers. Following the attack, section 144 was imposed in the area, prohibiting large gatherings, yet several attacks were reported after that. According to indigenous people, over 200 homes and shops were vandalised and burned to ashes after they were looted. Following the attack, some 300 Chakma families from three villages fled their homes. The victims and many locals believe that it was a planned attack to drive indigenous people out of the areas.   MAYHEM IN THAKURPARA HINDU VILLAGE\n On November 10, violence flared up in Horkoli Thakurpara village of Rangpur over an alleged Facebook post \"demeaning Islam\" by a Hindu youth. At least 30 Hindu houses were burned and vandalised as religious zealots ran riot in the village and staged demonstrations blocking the Dinajpur-Rangpur highway. At least one person died in the violence. According to law enforcers, digital evidence showed that the Facebook post was uploaded on October 28 from the account of Md Titu. After it came to the knowledge of the influential locals, they ran a hate campaign in the area. Announcements were made through loudspeakers and in local mosques since November 5 about holding protest rallies and forming human chains. Local people formed a human chain in protest of the Facebook post after offering the Jumma prayer on November 10. After that the situation became tense and around 10,000 to 12,000 people, carrying sticks and brickbats, marched towards Horkoli Thakurpara village where they vandalised Hindu houses and looted valuables. The villagers alleged that the attack was carried out as per a plan and the local authorities did not do anything to prevent the attack. According to many, the attack was aimed at evicting the Hindus from their land. However, it was not confirmed if it was the alleged Facebook user who posted the anti-Islam content or whether his account was hacked.   THE CURIOUS CASE OF DISAPPEARANCES The issue of enforced disappearance continued to dominate the headlines in 2017. According to data by Ain o Salish Kendra, from January to October, at least 50 people were reported to have been abducted. The fate of 12 of them could later be known. In May, 15 people went missing within nine days in Jhenaidah, after law enforcement agencies had made some arrests and conducted raids.  In July, the alleged abduction and recovery of Farhad Mazhar, noted writer and poet, stirred controversy. Businessman Aniruddha Roy also went missing in August but returned in November. The cases of journalist Utpal Das and journalist and researcher Mubashar Hasan also triggered outcry late last year. Both of them returned as mysteriously as they had disappeared. One of the latest to disappear was Maroof Zaman, a former ambassador.   SECTION 57: OLD WINE IN A NEW BOTTLE? Criticism over the much-talked-about Section 57 of ICT Act was far from fading away last year. In the first seven months of 2017, some 300 cases--including two dozen against journalists--were filed under the section, which many consider a draconian law designed to restrict freedom of speech. At the end of November, Information Minister Hasanul Haq Inu declared that the several contentious sections--including the Section 57--of the act would be repealed. However, several newspapers reported citing sources that the government would keep these sections in the Digital Security Act."

      "text": "The development of domestic transport and communication is a prerequisite of economic advancement of a country. In general, means of transport influences the distribution of both economic production and population. The physical geographical condition of a country in turn largely determines the nature of its transportation. Bangladesh is fortunate to be served by various means of communication - waterways, railways, roads, and airways - each having its own advantages and disadvantages. Inland water transport Bangladesh is a riverine country. It is crisscrossed by over 700 rivers, which include the mighty Ganges (Padma), the Jamuna (Brahmaputra), the Meghna, and the Karnaphuli and their innumerable tributaries and distributaries. These rivers have for centuries provided good means of water transport, but at the same time have made building of roads and railways difficult and expensive. The rivers provided excellent domestic communication in the past and are still one of the major means of transport today. There is however a wide variation in the length of navigable waterways during the rainy season when vast areas of the land are inundated and the dry season when many rivers are rendered unsuitable for navigation, especially for larger water vessels. The navigability of many rivers, including the major ones, has been significantly reduced due to the natural hydro-geographical dynamics, and human intervention both outside and inside the country. Currently, 8433 km of waterways is navigable by large vessels during the rainy season and only about 4800 km during the dry season. Waterways serve both people and goods movement. Despite problems of navigability, the volume of both cargo and passengers has increased significantly over the recent decades. The volume of cargo increased from only 5.69 million tonnes in 1994-95 to 35.86 million tonnes in 2011-12, a nearly six-fold increase in 17 years. The growth in volume of passengers was equally significant. It increased from 68.01 million in 1994-95 to 350.98 million in 2011-2012, also nearly a six-fold growth.     Dhaka, the capital city, is centrally located and enjoys excellent waterway connectivity to almost all major corners of the country. Large passenger water vessels with modern facilities travel through a number of routes. The more important popular routes are Dhaka-Barisal, Dhaka-Bhola, Dhaka-Patuakhali, Dhaka-Khulna and other southern locations. There are now tourist boats making journeys to the Sundarbans and to the coastal islands. There are also water-transport routes between Bangladesh water ports and Kolkata. Transit facilities for India have been introduced through Bangladesh water and land routes. The cargo routes are numerous, well over 100 with similar number of river stations or ghats, and river ports, Dhaka, Narayanganj, Chandpur, Bhairab, Barisal, Bhola, Khulna, Chalna, Mongla, Patuakhali and Chittagong being the busiest ones. Chilmari, Fulchari, Bahadurabad Ghat, Chhatak, Jagannathganj Ghat, Rajshahi, Sirajganj, Nagarbari, Bheramara, Aricha, Goalondo, Daudkandi, Madaripur, Gopalganj, Sandwip, Hatia, Barguna, Cox's Bazar, etc. are the other important river ports. The international ports, Chittagong and Mongla, also serve as inland ports. Bangladesh railway is expected to experience a revolutionary expansion when the under-construction Padma Multipurpose Bridge is completed (hopefully in 2018), as it will also include a railway track and shall connect the hitherto unserved region in southern Bangladesh. The railway today has some 443 stations, with a number of junctions.  The inland water transportation is managed both by the public sector [Inland Water Transport Authority (IWTA)] and the private sector, which has a much larger share (over 90 percent). At one time the country had several hundred thousand country boats, most of which have been converted as engine-driven boats, making life easier for the boatmen. The number of registered water vessels is over 9000. Some private water transport operators have floated very large vessels with capacity for over 1000 passengers in normal times and well over three to four times the capacity during Eid journeys. Travel safety at such times is a low priority. Inland water transport is constantly facing problems of safe navigability due to siltation of the rivers. In certain routes, even in the large rivers, expensive dredging operations need to be carried out. Rivers like Teesta, Karotoa, Doodkumar, in the northern districts experience the closure of navigation routes. Major river crossings even along the major road transportation routes also suffer due to erosion of ferry ghats and lowering of draft level due to siltation. The Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 is proposing large scale dredging for many of the rivers and to improve inland water transportation on a long-term basis.    Rail transport The railway was introduced in the country by the British as early as 1862 (with a short length of 53.12 km between Darshana and Jagati in the south-west to be followed soon by a line between Narayanganj and Dhaka in the centre and another two lengths between Chittagong and Comilla and Laksam and Chandpur in the east). The basic structure of the railway system that exists in Bangladesh today was established during the British period, well within 1947. In 1951, the total length of railways in the Bangladesh territory was 2616 km, of which 805 km was broad gauge (in the western region), 1773 km was metre gauge (east of the Jamuna River) and only 32 km was narrow gauge (in Khulna-Bagerhat). The narrow gauge railway was later converted to metre gauge. The total length of the railways increased marginally to 2791 km in 2011-12 of which 659 km was broad gauge, 1757 km was metre gauge and 375 km was dual gauge. With the construction of the Bangabandhu Multi Purpose Bridge (Jamuna Setu) in 2001, arrangement was made for dual gauge (both broad and metre gauge in the same track). The Bangabandhu Bridge has enabled a link between the western and eastern sectors of the railways. The railways provide comparatively safer and cheaper transportation of people and goods, than road transportation. The country is reasonably well-connected by the railway; the central focus is Dhaka although during the British era, rail routes (and also steamer routes) were oriented towards Kolkata, which was the principal port for export, particularly of jute from the present Bangladesh territory. Bangladesh railway is expected to experience a revolutionary expansion when the under-construction Padma Multipurpose Bridge is completed (hopefully in 2018), as it will also include a railway track and shall connect the hitherto unserved region in southern Bangladesh. The railway today has some 443 stations, with a number of junctions. Dhaka, Chittagong, Comilla, Akhaura, Barisal, Sylhet, Iswardi, Rajbari, Parbatipur, Jessore and Khulna are some of the important railway stations. The three Chittagong Hill Districts are not served by railway. The volume of railway passengers has increased from 39.47 million in 1994-95 to 66.13 million in 2011-12, but the volume of freight has recorded decline over the years, such as from 3.28 million tonnes in 2007-08 to 2.19 million tonnes in 2011-12.  The loss of freight by railways seems to have been compensated by its increase in the road and waterway sectors. The recent thinking in the government is in the favour of expansion of the railways, both in terms of mileage and quality. High speed inter-city train services between Dhaka and other major destinations are being thought about. Rail transportation is a fully public sector operation and characterised by poor governance. Some examples of its recent introductions are the Demu service between Kamalapur/Dhaka and Narayanganj. The Dhaka-Kolkata Friendship Train has been a fairly successful venture. Roads\n Being a delta and crisscrossed by innumerable rivers, some of which are several kilometres in width with shifting courses and experiencing annual flooding, building roads has not been easy in Bangladesh. Floods even wash away existing roads and bridges. Indeed there were only a few pucca roads, even as recent as in 1947, when the total length of such roads was only 480 km, the longest stretch  being the 56.32 km road between Sylhet and Tamabil in the north-east. The total length of kutcha roads at that time in the whole country was 36000 km. The situation had improved somewhat by 1970, when the country (or the province of the then East Pakistan) had 3860 km of pucca roads. But the situation has changed dramatically in the last four decades since independence. The war ravaged road infrastructure was not only fully restored but in fact radically transformed. There was policy support in favour of road transportation, over railways and waterways. There was also pressure from the growing private sector and foreign motor vehicle companies and their governments. People in general also seemed to prefer road transportation, speed and accessibility being prime factors. Roads, pucca or semi-pucca (brick soled) or at least kutcha roads now connect almost all (80,000 more or less) villages in the country. Motorable pucca roads connect all 490 Upazila headquarters and nearly all (of the 4550) Union centres. The few which are not accessible by road (in the southern districts) are reached by waterways. Indeed, Bangladesh today is said to have one of the highest road densities (mileage against unit area of land surface), although it may not enjoy a high ratio of length of road to population. Because of geomorphologic reasons road building is expensive in Bangladesh, but a kilometre of road in Bangladesh serves a higher number of people than in a country of thin population density (such as USA, Canada, Australia or Saudi Arabia). Public roads in Bangladesh are developed by either the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) or the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). Roads are of several categories depending mainly on crest-width. RHD is responsible for building national highways (12.2 metre in width), regional highways (11.0 metres) and Zila roads (7.3 metres), while LGED is responsible for Upazila roads (7.3 metres), Union roads (4.9 metres) and village roads (3.7 metres). All national highways, regional highways and nearly half of the Zila roads are bituminised and the rest are brick-soled. The total length of roads in Bangladesh today is over 354,890 km, with 3813 km of national highways, 4247 km of regional highways, 13,242 km of Zila roads (of RHD), 39,756 km of Upazila roads, 46,259 km of Union roads and 247,574 km of village roads, under LGED. On an average each of the nearly 800,000 villages has almost 4.44 km of road length and there is a kilometre of road for about 450 Bangladeshis (assuming total population being 160 million). These should be respectable figures for a lower middle income country. However, the per capita availability of bituminous roads is very low. With Bangladesh being a country of a large population and experiencing rapid economic growth, the movements of people and goods have increased. Even with expansion of road network, mileage and width of roads, the capacity of roads is far short of the need and demand. For reasons of geography (mainly presence of rivers, floods, erosion etc.), shortage of financial resources (investment in infrastructure), inadequacy of technological knowledge, management weakness (especially in monitoring and maintenance) and alleged widespread system loss (i.e. corruption), the quality of road transportation service is unsatisfactory. Most alarming is the situation of safety on roads, with increasing incidents of fatal accidents. Highway traffic discipline is seriously lacking. Nevertheless, the government gives high priority to the road transportation sector. To meet the growing demand several highways (like Dhaka-Chittagong, Dhaka-Mymensingh, Dhaka-Sylhet, Dhaka-Rajshahi, etc.) are being upgraded to four-lane highways. Long-distance elevated expressways are also being thought of. The Padma Bridge will dramatically improve road connectivity from the capital to the south and southwestern regions of the country. Bangladesh geographically is a small country with a roughly rectangular shape. Its capital Dhaka is almost in the geographical centre, and all national highways radiate out from Dhaka. Railways, river routes, roads, air routes all focus on Dhaka, making it a critically important multi-modal hub. The road network of national highways is organised along a number of corridors: Dhaka-Chittagong (to the south-east), Dhaka-Sylhet (to the north-east), Dhaka-Rajshahi/ Rangpur/ Dinajpur (to the north-west), and Dhaka-Barisal-Barguna (to the south). In fact, almost all districts are directly accessible from Dhaka by road. The two farthest district towns, Cox's Bazar in the southeast and Panchagarh in the north-east, are less than 400 km away from the capital. The capital is also connected with Kolkata by direct bus route. Similar routes are also planned for Agartola in Tripura. Bangladesh is also in the Asian highway connectivity. Domestic air transport Air transport in the present Bangladesh territory started with military aviation during World War II, when a few airstrips were built in Dhaka, Comilla, Feni, Chittagong, Cox's Bazar, Chakaria, Sylhet, Jessore, Rajshahi and Lalmonirhat. Most of these airstrips currently serve as modernised domestic airports. Nine are operative: Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet (which are also international airports), Cox's Bazar, Saidpur, Rajshahi, Iswardi, Jessore and Barisal. The Civil Aviation Authority is responsible for air transport management. With growing economy and increase in private income, the demand for domestic air transport has increased significantly. Biman Bangladesh Airlines in the public sector is the principal operator, while a number of private airlines also provide service. Some private airlines that began business in the 1990s have closed service, while a few new ones are now in operation. There are also private helicopter services available commercially. In conclusion, domestic connectivity in Bangladesh has experienced quite significant progress in the last four and a half decades since independence. We, however, feel that in all modes in the sector, safety concerns must be given priority attention. Overall management improvement is also critical.

      "text": "Climate change-induced challenges have been slowly but gradually grappling South Asia through tentacles of heatwaves, droughts and floods. The symptoms of such vulnerabilities are exposed through displacement and migration incidents. Nevertheless, the issue has not been raised in apt manner across the region. In this respect, Dr. Stellina Jolly and Dr. Nafees Ahmad in 'Climate Refugees in South Asia: Protection under Int'l Legal Standards and State Practices in South Asia' contribute something of a novelty in legal literature on South Asian and climate change-induced displacement. Both authors endeavor to disentangle the knots of problems that South Asia is facing with regard to climate change. Under the rubric of seven chapters, the book seeks to offer an appraisal of climate refugee issues in the region and to discuss the national, regional and international legal aspects of the issue. The first chapter gives conceptual background on the issues of climate change and its nexus with climate displacement. The second chapter examines the fundamental debate of whether and how far climate change acts as a factor of migration in South Asia. Chapter three sifts through the issue of climate-induced displacement from human rights dimension and discusses whether rights violated during climate migration are issues of human rights. Chapter four addresses the extent of protection granted to climate change-induced people under the international environmental law international refugee law and human rights law. The chapter further highlights the pitfalls in the relevant legal regimes. Chapter five depicts a bleak picture of non-compliance with international refugee law and environmental conventions in South Asian countries. Chapter six analyses the position of the judiciary in South Asian jurisdictions concerning the incorporation of international law, especially in the fields of climate change and refugee law. It also examines the judicial interactions on climate refugee crisis by evaluating the judicial appraisal and responses to the refugee law and international climate change law in the South Asian countries. In the concluding chapter, the significance of regional solutions on climate-induced refugee protection has been argued and from that point of view, the role of SAARC has been appraised. The chapter emphasises the need to adopt inclusive, participatory and shared legal approach in countering the climate change-induced crises. As this book reveals, the countries of the region have been quick to catch up with the concept of 'climate change', but has failed to formulate any apt legal framework that would be better suited to tackle the impacts of climate change (i.e., displacement, refugee crisis, impediment to development rights and right to health). Though the book is about climate change-induced displacement in the context of South Asia, it is of relevance to other climate change affected nations in Asia and Pacific as well. The commentaries of the authors are quite straight-forward and dissects the national and regional legal policy framework of the region. This has enabled the book to provide more nuanced observations on climate change displacement in the region. Furthermore, it addresses whether the mere incorporation of international legal rules to the domestic laws of the countries is sufficient to deal with climate crisis. Overall, the book provides valuable insights and is a resourceful and comprehensive work on climate change and displacement issues. The book is a handy research companion for researchers and students of international law and international relations who would like to delve into climate change issues in South Asia.

      "text": "In 2017, the shock was overwhelming for Chan Mia -- he lost all the Boro paddy grown on seven acres of land to flash floods. The next year, the paddy he cultivated on three acres was damaged. This time it was pest attack. After the two shocks in a row, fortune smiled on him. He expects to bring home all his produce this year, thanks to favourable weather conditions and almost a total absence of pest attack. \"I'm happy,\" said Chan Mia while harvesting his crop. \"I hope to finish the cropping by the end of this month.\" Harvesting and threshing are going on in full swing in the area. The photos were taken on Monday. Photo: Mintu Deshwara\n Chan Mia is from Kulaura upazila of Moulvibazar in the haor region where paddy is the main crop. Harvesting started in mid-April and will continue till the end of the month. Chan Mia expects that this year's output would be around 25 tonnes from his seven acres. This year the overall Boro production has exceeded in Sylhet division, said officials at the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE). Initially, the farmers aimed to cultivate 468,577 hectares. But rains in Phalgun (mid-March to mid-April) came as a blessing, allowing farmers to grow paddy on an extra 10,000 hectares. Anyone visiting the two major haor areas -- Hakaluki (Moulvibazar) and Tanguar (Sunamganj) -- would see vast swathes of fields full of ripe paddy and farmers busy harvesting them. They are trying to bring home their produce at the earliest. \"I'm worried nature may strike anytime,\" said Mizan Mia, a farmer of Kulaura. \"We are doing it fast. If there is a hailstorm, all will be gone.\" Azizul Islam, 45, of Tanguar Haor area in Tahirpur upazila, said, \"We are having a nice weather. If the weather continues to be like this for a few weeks, we would have a great harvest.\" Basir Ahmed Sarker, deputy director of DAE in Sunamganj, said till now 30 percent of the paddy has been harvested in Sunamganj. \"If there is no sudden variation in the weather, farmers will be able to complete harvesting by April 30.\" For the farmers, there is a big worry though -- shortage of farm labourers. DAE official Basir Ahmed said, \"We are facing a labour crisis. We've asked the sand and stone quarries to suspend their operation during the harvesting season.\" Altabur Rahman, former additional director of DAE in Sylhet division, said raining in Phalgun, which is usual, has benefitted farmers. Also, the weather was not much foggy last winter, and it significantly reduced pest attack, he added. More than 35 percent of paddy has been harvested in the four districts of Sylhet division so far, said the official. The total Boro production in the region is expected to hit 19 lakh tonnes this year. It was 18.5 tonnes last year, said Shahjahan Chowdhury, additional director of DAE, Sylhet division.  "

Usually dependent on Boro paddy, people of Bhatipara village also catch fish in haor (shallow water body that dries up in winter) area during the rainy season. Now they are engaged in making dried fish in a large scale. During a recent visit to Bhatipara, some 15 kilometres from Habiganj district town, this correspondent saw Ranubala Rani Das keeping tengra, shrimp and other small fishes on bamboo and plastic mats for drying in the sun in front of her house. \"We are doing it for sale to maintain the family, otherwise we would face starvation,\" said the middle-aged woman. Many other people including men, women and children were seen engaged in producing dried fish as the trade provides livelihood for around 350 families at the village. \"We were used to making dried fish for long to earn extra money. Now we are doing this as the main source of income due to repeated loss in Boro cultivation,\" said Shimul Biswas of the same village. Dried fish is sold to buyers from different areas for Tk 150 to Tk 300 a kg, depending on the fish, said Radha Kanto Das, another villager engaged in the trade. For drying fish, it is kept on large mats either on the ground or on bamboo platforms, he said. \"The income from selling dried fish supports our eight-member family. One gets Tk 200 to Tk 500 as daily wage for doing different works related to producing dried fish,\" said Amrit Lal Das, 55, who has been doing the work for 30 years at Bhatipara. \"We have five acres of cropland in haor. After recurrent damage of paddy due to floods, we are now living by making dried fish,\" said Sabita Rani Das, who with her husband, son and daughter-in-law was seen busy in the work at their field. Abul Kashem Chowdhury, chairman of Baniachong Upazila Parishad, said, \"Poor people of haor areas often go to other places in search of work. But villagers at Bhatipara have taken up dried fish making for living.\" Fish is available in the area and so, the trade bears a good prospect, he added."

      "text": "\"Nero fiddles, while Rome burns\" is an apt metaphor for the 25th world climate summit, called the Conference of Parties (COP25), which just ended in Madrid. Government representatives from 200 countries ended their meeting, copping out from agreeing on a pathway to implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming, carbon emission targets and other related measures.   Climate change specialist Saleemul Huq wrote that a big issue at COP25 was the role of children and civil society who urge that it is time to consider the climate change issue as a \"climate emergency\" (\"COP25: Long but barely fruitful,\" TheDaily Star, December 18). Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish girl, named as the Time magazine's Person of the Year for her leading role in a worldwide youth mobilisation for climate action, spoke at the COP at its President's invitation. The negotiators listened politely but then went back to their endless arguments, ignoring her message of urgency to \"make 2020 a year of action,\" because the coming decade will \"define our future.\" Environmental hazards for children A conference on early childhood development attended by development organisations, experts and government representatives from the Asia Pacific Region in Hanoi, Vietnam, on December 4-6, was hosted by the Asia-Pacific Regional Network for Early Childhood (ARNEC). The conference raised an alert about climate change threats for young children and urged early action. Fazilatunnesa Indira, MP, State Minister for Women and Children's Affairs, attended and addressed the meeting from Bangladesh. Besides describing the progress and initiatives about early childhood development in Bangladesh, she noted the climate-related dangers faced by the children and urged consideration of a climate alert for them. The World Health Organization (WHO) has termed pollution of air as the silent killer which causes over eight million deaths of children per year worldwide. Children are more vulnerable than adults because children breathe more air, consume more food, and drink more water than adults in proportion to their weight. Children's central nervous, immune, reproductive, and digestive systems are still developing. At this stage, exposure to environmental toxicants can lead to irreversible damage. The risk of autism spectrum disorder and neurodevelopmental disorder of children is increased by a pregnant mother's exposure to air pollution and toxic chemicals. WHO estimates that environmental risks account for 25 percent of the disease burden in children under five. They are exposed to risk factors where they live, work, play and learn, unless preventive and protective measures are taken. (\"Environment and Child Health,\" WHO, 2018) Urban air pollution Air pollution has become a major health threat in the larger cities of South Asia including Dhaka and it is getting worse. In a recent day (December 14 at 8:30 in the morning), Dhaka's air quality was the worst in the world, according to Air Visual, a US-based organisation that tracks air pollution. With a PM2.5 score of 237, it was by rank order above Ulan Bator in Mongolia, Kabul, Lahore and Chengdu in China, according to a report by a local newspaper on December 15. PM2.5 score indicates the level of microscopic floating particles per cubic metre of air. A safe level is an average of 35 in 24 hours. Dhaka's air had almost 7.5 times more than the acceptable level of floating particulates in the air at least at one point in the day. High levels of PM2.5 reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy. More dangerously, the tiny particles travel deep into the respiratory tract and the lungs and cause short-term eye, nose, throat and lung irritation; coughing, sneezing, runny nose; and shortness of breath. A prolonged exposure affects lung function and worsens medical conditions such as asthma and heart disease. It is associated with high rates of chronic bronchitis, reduced lung function and increased mortality from lung cancer and heart disease. Children and the elderly are particularly sensitive to PM2.5. The sources of the fine particles primarily are exhausts from vehicles burning fossil fuels; other operations requiring burning of wood, coal and heating oil; construction activities; and natural sources such as forest and grass fires. Urban residents of Bangladesh are well familiar with these sources of air pollution, except the last one. What can we do about it?  Much can be, and must be, done to halt the potential carnage and reverse the course. That a crisis is upon us has to be recognised and the obligation of the state and society has to be accepted to protect and nurture children. To do this, we need not depend on or wait for the global actors to put their acts together. First, the Environment Ministry and the Ministry of Women and Children's Affairs need to work together to assess the depth and dimensions of the problem, and a framework for action has to be prepared containing strategies, plans and targets--immediate, short-term and longer-term for 5 to 10 years. Actually, the Comprehensive Policy for Early Childhood Care and Development adopted by the government in 2013 requires such cooperation and coordination. Secondly, based on the framework for action, the concerned government ministries and agencies, government structures at city, municipality and local government levels, NGOs as well as community organisations and the private sector can examine and plan actions of their own. So should the educational institutions, health service providers and other social service agencies that serve children and families. Thirdly, as part of the national and sub-national action plans, the enforcement of environmental safety rules and regulations and meeting all legal requirements by all concerned have to be ensured. The culture of inefficiency, neglect, absence of accountability and impunity for violations have to end. Shutting down illegal brick kilns which defy environmental regulations, enforcing dust, waste and noise control in construction sites, and taking off the street unfit vehicles spewing toxic fumes, among other initiatives, would make a significant difference in and around Dhaka. Fourthly, monitoring mechanisms have to be established with the technical capacity to establish safety and protection benchmarks for major harmful sources and measure and monitor these. Remedial actions have to follow from the monitoring results. Setting up an independent environmental protection agency with the necessary technical capacity and mandate would be an appropriate step. Fifthly, along with urgent actions under a climate alert to protect children, longer-term strategies, goals and plans also need to be guided by a sense of urgency. Adaptation and mitigation actions that we, as a state and society, need to take must be taken. Moving away from fossil fuel and coal as energy sources and fast-tracking into renewable sources, conserving the Sundarbans as a human heritage, making transportation and the built environment carbon-efficient, and generally actions for transition to sustainable production, consumption and lifestyle need not be at the mercy of decisions at COP summits. Finally, citizens and civil society, academic and research institutions and the private sector need to recognise their social and moral obligation and stand up to do what need to be done for the future generations. As Greta Thunberg said, the adults are not taking their responsibilities, so children have to come out on the street. We should not let this happen.

      "text": "I have seen it on TV, read about it in newspapers, but never thought it would be this bad. I watched it from the deck of a launch, looking forward to a spectacular river cruise that our departmental picnic poster promised. I have fond memories of going back to my ancestral home in paddle steamers or launches while watching locals bathing or children frolicking in water; while food was being washed in water procured from the river. The putrid stench and the thick pollutants offered me a different plot. Much water has flowed under the bridge--literally. The Buriganga now sits idly by a thriving city that has lost interest in its partner. The translation that we once memorised while solving test papers, \"Dhaka sits on the Buriganga\", is lost. Instead, the tag of \"most polluted river in the world\" is gained, I look and ponder. \"Eventually the watcher joined the river, and there was only one of us. I believe it was the river.\" I wish I could write like Norman Maclean who felt that kind of \"oneness\" while watching fly-fishing in Blackfoot River in Montana in his semi-autobiographical novel A River Runs through It. I don't think any Dhakaite would anymore share similar connection with the Buriganga, upon which the city was once built. The Mughals liked it, allowing Dhaka to grow. Yet again, the filth that colonises the river starts to colonise my mind--and Buriganga and I were one. I gazed at the Buriganga the way a murderer looks at its victim. The river that gave us life is now dead. We have returned its favour by killing it. We have sipped life out of the river that used to be the major source of our drinking water. The might with which the river once stretched and furrowed while rubbing and scouring, gnawing and kneading, devouring and carrying its ways through the city is tamed. It now stands still like a disgraced fallen hero who has been tainted with tar pit before execution. Small boats ferry across the river to connect the victors of this side with those from the other one; thousands of vehicles cross the bridges that fly over the dead victim that lies like a dirty dead python. Everyday more than 1.5 million cubic metres of industrial and human waste reach the Buriganga and its adjacent rivers and tributaries. Of which, according to the Department of Environment, the daily contribution of the tanneries to the Buriganga is 21,600 cubic metres (5.7 million US gallons) of toxic waste. Add to that the amount of solid waste--4,500 tons per day deposited by the city dwellers. We can blame the tanneries, boatyards and shipyards, chemical dumping from industries, medical waste from hospitals, maritime transportation, city sewage, dead animals, or plastic bags as much as we want, but at the end of the day, it is our collective indifference that has killed the river. The river is lifeless--there is no oxygen left in it to keep its fish or aquatic lives alive. Even a ritualistic immersion of goddess cannot resuscitate life in a river that has morphed in a stagnant lake. The neons at the bank and the lights of the boat can hide the ugliness of the river at night with their artificial makeover, but the day breaks with bad news. Four million people, who reside by this 18km river, live under serious threats of being contaminated by the toxic and polluted waters. Thanks to the daily dumping, the average depth of the river is only 7.6m, which makes the plying of larger vessels quite dangerous especially in dry seasons. The need for dredging is equally felt during monsoon seasons when our drainage system collapses resulting in citywide waterlogs. The famous axiom twists and turns as our failure to go and see the river makes the river come to our feet. Even a posh area such as Dhanmondi gets a taste of the Buriganga near the Rapa Plaza. Jokes apart, the name of the river Buriganga has the distant memory of being connected with the great Ganges which becomes Padma upon entering our national territory. There was a time when this branch of Ganges (hence old Ganges--Buriganga) reached the sea through Dhaleswari River. The course changed and shifted, and Buriganga remained connected with its origin only in name. The main water that flows into the river today comes from the Turag, which meets with the Dhaleswari at Munshiganj. With the exponential rise of land price in Dhaka, the rivers around it have come under the greedy glances of land grabbers and water-body hoarders. They use every weapons in their arsenal to justify their presence by the water. They use poly tricks of politics, they use holy signs of holy sites, they use under the table exchanges to bring changes over the table to get hold of the rivers, while strangling them to death. Often government bulldozers will come amidst resistance, local politicians will cry for rehabilitation before dismantling of illegal structures, harsh words will be exchanged, new promises will be made--but the elastic reality will soon retract to its previous band to choke the rivers. As we dream of solidifying our middle-income country status by 2024, leaving behind our LDC tag, is it too much to ask for a capital city that is liveable? The city has many problems. Saving its rivers is a prime one. One way to restore life in the city is by giving life back to its lifeline--the Buriganga. Restoring a river is more than having beautiful walkways by the riverbanks or making it less dirty. We need to have a complete understanding of the ecological and social functions of a river. The filth with which we look at a river often clouds our judgement. We think of a river as a natural resource to profit from. Time has come to repair the way we look at the river, and appreciate its value as a fellow creature of our ecology. For this we need to bring in changes to our curricula so that our children grow up loving their surrounding; our young ones make informed decisions before joining a save-the-river campaign; and our policymakers prioritise the flow of a river over the bank FDRs in foreign banks they are saving for their posterity. The community members must become stakeholders in sharing the responsibilities of maintaining natural resources such as a river. Restoring a river involves repairing of the waterways that can no longer perform the necessary ecological and social functions. The Buriganga today cannot help us mitigate floods, provide clean drinking water, offer essential nutrients and sediments to its banks, support fisheries and wildlife. All these damaged issues need our attention. Even in commercial terms, healthy rivers enhance property values and can become a hub for recreation. Not having the river repaired is a callousness that we can ill afford. We do not have to look far to find instances of river restoration. Singapore has done it successfully, and their efforts can provide us with a template. It is about time we dig out the foul mud and bring in fresh water into the Bruriganga. It is about time we drain out filthy thoughts, and breathe in positive thoughts. That will give us the impetus to celebrate the 50 years of independence where the river runs through the city without being chartered.

      "text": "Around 73,400 houses and 36,000 hectares of crops have been damaged by recent floods in 21 districts, causing thousands of people to suffer. Of the houses, around 4,000 have been completely damaged, while the other houses were partially damaged. Of the croplands, over 500 hectares are completely damaged and around 34,500 hectares only partially. The damage was calculated based on the statistics released by the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, reports our correspondents in different districts. The districts affected by the flood are Chattogram, Bandarban, Khagrachari, Rangamati, Cox's Bazar, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Sunamganj, Netrokona, Sylhet, Bogura, Gaibandha, Kurigram, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Feni, Brahmanbaria, Sherpur, Tangail, Jamalpur and Sirajganj. In terms of household damages, Gaibandha is the worst affected. In the district, 25,930 houses were partially damaged, according to the ministry's report. On the other hand, maximum areas of cropland -- around 10,000 hectares -- were damaged in Rangamati. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) forecasted that the flood situation in Kurigram, Jamalpur, Gaibandha, Bogra, Sirajganj, Tangail, Manikganj and Faridpur may deteriorate today. However, the situation may improve in Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Habiganj and Moulvibazar. The water levels of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Ganges-Padma rivers may continue to rise in the next 48 hours, while the Padma river at Bhagyakul point may cross its danger level today, according to the FFWC bulletin. The FFWC monitored river conditions at 93 river stations across the country. Of these, 23 stations showed that water was flowing above danger levels. Meanwhile, rail communication between Gaibandha and other districts remained shut since around 11:00am as the rail track was submerged in Sadar upazila's Trimohoni area. Thousands of people were suffering due to the floods across the country. \"My house, furniture and all other household items have been washed away by water from the Dharla river. I am now homeless,\" said Ziaul Rahman, 32, a resident of Kumarpur village in Kurigram's Sadar upazila. Razia Begum, a resident of Aurar Para char in Bogura's Sariakandi upazila, said, \"We cultivated jute in eight hectares of land. But the sudden flood has washed away our jutes. We cannot understand how will we recover the loss.\" In Naogaon's Manda upazila, the flood-control embankment on the right bank of Atrai river breached early yesterday, causing floods in low-lying areas of at least eight villages. People of hilly areas have also fallen victims to floods. U Chai Marma, a resident of Bandarban town, said, \"My house is totally damaged in the flood. I don't have any money to repair it. I don't know how my family will survive the upcoming days under the open sky.\" Meanwhile, Bangladesh Army Chief General Aziz Ahmed yesterday said the armed forces were ready to help if the flood situation worsens, reports UNB. He made the remark while replying to a question at the end of the first session of the deputy commissioners' conference yesterday. General Aziz said they have informed everyone that the Army, the Navy and the Air Force were ready to help if needed.

      "text": "The ongoing flood has submerged 60,000 hectares of paddy and vegetable fields, mainly in the northern districts, affecting both farmers and consumers, as crop loss has sent the vegetable prices soaring for reduced supply in the market. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) estimated that floods affected farmlands in 26 districts until Friday, including 39,000 hectares of aush fields, 11,000 hectares of aman seedbeds, and 10,000 hectares of vegetable farms. The flooded aush fields constitute 3.39 percent of the total acreage of aush this year.  A senior official of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) said 20 percent of the submerged aush crop might get damaged fully. This would mean the loss of 20,000 tonnes of paddy if the average aush output of last year is considered.  \"The plants that are in the tillering stage is unlikely to be damaged, but those in the flowering stage will be lost,\" the official said.  Matiur Rahman, a farmer of Ghogadaha union in Kurigram, which is one of the worst-hit districts, said, \"All of my aush paddy has been ruined by water.\"  Having only three bighas of farmland, he has to rent land and farm it to make a living.  Matiur planted paddy on five bighas during this aush season with the hope to augment his income after suffering for the low prices of boro, harvested in May-June. The flood has started receding from his locality but Matiur said nothing would be left. \"I was planning to harvest aush in three weeks' time.\"  His peril does not end here. \"All the aman seedlings and standing vegetables were damaged,\" he said. \"The same befell other farmers in my locality. Many of them lost their stored paddy, too.\"  Cultivation of aman, the second biggest rice crop after boro, faces setback with 11,000 hectares of its seedbeds having been inundated, said Md Abdul Muyeed, director of field services wing of DAE. Floods came as a successive shock after growers were trying to recover from low boro prices this year, caused by a good harvest and higher public and private stocks. \"Nothing we had in the field will remain after the flood,\" said Matiur, who grew vegetables on four decimals of land to meet his family needs.  \"This is the worst-ever flood after 1988. There is water everywhere. We are suffering badly.\" Matiur has taken shelter on an embankment near his residence.  According to DAE, the flood submerged summer vegetables on 10,000 hectares of land until Friday, and none of them may survive after the flood. A trip to village two unions of Kurigram sadar revealed that all the farmland was flooded, with no crops standing above the water level. Only the remains of dead vegetable plants were visible. DAE official Muyeed said all aman seedlings might get destroyed, but there is time to prepare seedbeds newly for aman plantation. \"Farmers may have the seeds.\"  The official said a portion of aush paddy could be saved if water recedes within one or two days. \"We will be able to calculate the total financial loss after the flood.\"  DAE estimates that farmers have planted aush on 11.49 lakh hectares, while it aimed to bring 58.79 lakh hectares under aman cultivation this season.  Aman is harvested in winter. Farmers have planted summer vegetables on 3.32 lakh hectares this year. Chhakmal Hossain, a farmer in Pachgachhi Union of Kurigram upazila, who grew painted gourd on two bighas, said all his crop is gone. The same happened to his neighbour Moazzen Hossain. \"I was hoping to make a good a good profit from the harvest,\" he said. With farmers and people of affected areas suffering, residents in urban areas, particularly Dhaka, are seeing a sharp rise in the prices of greens.  Green chilli sold at Tk 80 a week ago per kilogram, but the price soared to as high as Tk 200 in the capital, said Imon Mia, a vegetable retailer at Sankar in Dhanmondi area. Prices of other vegetables including brinjal, okra, wax gourd, and bitter gourd rose by Tk 10-15 per kilogram, he said. \"This is because of flood.\"  Delwar Hossain Kusum, joint secretary of wholesalers association Karwan Bazar Aratdar Samity, echoed Imon. According to the Department of Agricultural Marketing, the average prices of green chili soared by 54 percent to Tk 140 per kg in Dhaka on Thursday from a week ago.  Prices of eggplant, pointed gourd, okra and snake gourd also shot up by 13 to 32 percent during the same period, it says. DAE Director Muyeed said flood situation has improved in some areas such as Lalmonirhat and Nilphamari, but new areas are getting affected. To support farmers, DAE has taken an initiative to prepare aman seedbeds on government-owned land for plantation after the flood, he said. \"We are also planning to make 2,500 floating seedbeds in flood-hit areas,\" he said, adding that seeds of a variety of pulses would be provided to growers."

      "text": "More often than not, climate change is analysed from a long-term perspective. Surely, the word \"change\" itself requires one to look at it through a futuristic lens. However, in an interview with The Guardian on July 7, 2019, Mami Mizutori, a top UN official, warned that climate crisis disasters are occurring every week causing death, displacement and suffering. In other words, \"climate change\" is not so much about the future anymore. It is a current crisis as well. Similarly, European Academies' Science Advisory Council had examined the rise in extreme weather events and published a statement on March 21, 2018, concluding that \"man-made climate change has proven to have increased recent extreme rainfall and associated floods and coastal flooding due to sea-level rise.\" A study performed by researchers at the University of Oxford titled \"Risks of Pre-Monsoon Extreme Rainfall Events of Bangladesh: Is Anthropogenic Climate Change Playing A Role,\" also concluded that anthropogenic climate change doubled the likelihood of extreme pre-monsoon rainfall over north-eastern Bangladesh. In reality, extreme weather events are defining a new normal in terms of hydro-climatic conditions. In July 2019, we experienced flooding in three different regions (north-western, north-eastern and south-eastern) of Bangladesh, where flood-water level has exceeded the previous record at a number of observation points that experienced unprecedented flooding. Earlier, when we talked about unprecedented environmental shocks, most of us would assume that they weren't frequent. But such notions are redundant now, as we experienced unprecedented flooding in the nation for the past four years. Until 2016, the recorded highest flood (in terms of magnitude) for the low-lying areas of Jamalpur was the one that occurred in 1988. The severity of that flood was surpassed by the 2016 monsoon flood; the new record was again broken during another flood that happened in 2017. On July 19, 2019, that level was again exceeded by a much greater margin when an ongoing flood hit over a million people in Bahadurabad point of Jamalpur. While some regions of the country are experiencing floods, some others are swept by heat waves. On March 2017, extreme rainfall triggered the earliest flash flood in north-eastern Bangladesh since 2000, damaging huge amounts of Boro rice just before the harvest. Consequently, rice import saw the highest rise in a decade in the following fiscal year. During the same year, landslides--which were a consequence of the flash flood--reportedly claimed more than 150 lives in three hilly districts of Bangladesh (Rangamati, Chattogram and Bandarban). In light of these disasters that have claimed so many lives, we must devise ways to manage the risks of climate change. One way is by monitoring and forecasting imminent risks using Early Warning System (EWS). In Bangladesh, Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of Bangladesh Water Development Board is responsible for forecasting floods using structural and non-structural measures. Quality-checked, processed data are used in their model to generate 5-day lead-time deterministic and 10-day lead-time probabilistic flood forecasts. With 10 days' lead time, FFWC has been able to detect the monsoon floods well ahead of the events. This capability has been highly appreciated in the region as Bangladesh is the only country in South Asia to have this flood forecasting system. Forecasting is just the first step, however. Forecasts need to be listened to, understood and used to actually take precautions. The communities at risk should have the capacity to respond to the warnings. FFWC issued a warning well ahead (at least 8 days) of the flood that happened earlier this month in the north-western region of the country, which marooned millions of people. FFWC also captured the possibility of exceeding the previous recorded highest levels at Jamalpur and issued a special flood outlook on July 17. This was a brilliant job from the forecasting point of view, given FFWC's technical and human resources limitations. When it comes to forecasting, we always ask one question--\"How accurate is it?\" But what we need to inquire and investigate more is whether the early warning for the ongoing flood was used by the responsible officials to devise a proper risk management plan and whether that plan proved useful. The Department of Agricultural Extension issued special advisories for the farmers based on the 10-day flood forecast. We need to find out how much of this information reached the impoverished farmers and whether they were able to take preventive measures at all. We cannot deny that the community needs to be provided with more impact-oriented information; they need to know what the weather will do, not only what the weather will be. To tackle the new normal, we need an integrated multi-hazard EWS. We need to develop the capacity of that software around four crucial safety measures: disaster risk knowledge; detection, monitoring, analysis and forecasting of hazards and possible consequences; dissemination of warnings ensuring last-mile connectivity; and preparedness and enhancing response capabilities through risk education. It is important to note that we need to act very soon and that it is not a time to argue about the quantum of measures to be taken. Our social, environmental and economic foundations for sustainable development have been threatened by non-linear climatic variability. Extreme weather events are happening across multiple dimensions and on varying scales. New risks and correlations are emerging in ways that had not been anticipated. We need to incorporate these findings in development planning, investments and policies. We also need to find a balance between our approaches to Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation, while adhering to their main goals for more effective and efficient long-term development gain. This would open up opportunities to learn from each other, enhance resilience at the local level through risk anticipation and reduce the number of overlapping activities, thus, improving funding efficiency. Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in developing early warning systems for floods. However, rapid development and the environmental concerns that come with it could also affect climate risks. We need more research and development to improve the EWS to face the future challenges that may arise out of man-made climate change. All in all, major changes to the current risk management approaches are needed to be able to realise the outcomes and goals of the agreements we have pursued after 2015--the Sendai Framework for Disaster Reduction 2015-2030 (SFDRR) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We need to improve our foreseeability and look at the risks of not investing in resilience. The urgency is evident as climate change is happening right now in Bangladesh. And so, the time to act is undeniably also now.   Raihanul Haque Khan is the Country Program Lead of Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System (RIMES).

      "text": "The country's northern and northeastern regions may witness flash floods in the middle and at the end of this month due to heavy rainfall.  Floodwater may stay from one to three days in the northeastern districts -- Sylhet, Sunamganj, Moulvibazar, Habiganj and Netrakona -- in the middle of this month. It may last for three to five days in Kurigram, Gaibandha, Bogura and Jamalpur towards the end of this month, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) has said in its weather forecast report of August. \"Moderate to heavy rain may continue in the country's different regions due to ongoing depression in the Bay of Bengal. It will contribute to the rise in water level in different rivers,\" said Arifuzzaman Bhuyan, executive engineer of Bangladesh Water Development Board and duty officer of FFWC. It is likely to rain heavily in the country's northeastern region and its adjacent Meghalaya and Tripura regions of India. It may contribute to the increase in water level in northern rivers. As a result, a short-term flood may occur in some northeastern districts, he told The Daily Star yesterday. Besides, water level of the Brahmaputra and the Jamuna rivers may cross danger level by the end of this month. Following this, a short-term flood may happen in some northern and northeastern districts by the end of this month, said the FFWC forecast report. Also, water of the Teesta river may raise rapidly in the middle of this month due to heavy rainfall in the country's northern region and its adjacent northern region of West Bengal in India. Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) yesterday advised the maritime ports of Chattogram, Cox's Bazar, Mongla and Payra to hoist danger signal No 3 until further notice due to rough weather caused by the depression in the Northwest Bay.    Besides, all fishing boats and trawlers in the North Bay have been asked to stay close to the coast, according to the BMD's forecast. In its daily weather forecast, the BMD said light to moderate rain or thunder showers accompanied by temporary gusty and squally wind is likely to occur at many places in Khulna, Barishal, Chattogram and Dhaka divisions and at a few places in Rajshahi, Rangpur, Mymensingh and Sylhet divisions with moderately heavy to heavy falls at places over the country today. Yesterday's maximum rainfall in Dhaka was recorded 102mm, which was heavy to very heavy rainfall, according to weather experts."

Water of the Dharla River is flowing 45 centimetres above danger level at Shimulbari point while the Teesta River's water is flowing just below the danger mark at Teesta Barrage point but 2 centimetres above danger level at Kawnia point this morning, inundating new areas in the district, our Lalmonirhat correspondent reports quoting Bajle Karim, sub-divisional engineer of Water Development Board in Lalmonirhat. \"Teesta's water level is fluctuating and if no onrush of water from upstream comes across the border then the flood situation in Teesta shoal would develop in next 24-hrs,\" the WDB official said. Over one lakh people are affected by the flood in 90 villages of five upazilas in the district amid health risk and acute crisis of food and drinking water. Their houses, tube-wells, latrines, and the roads in the affected areas went under the floodwaters. The flood water washed away many houses, livestocks and crops in many areas in the last few days. \"Now we are under the open sky as our houses were washed away by flood water from Teesta river,\" said flood victims Amela Bewa and Apia Bewa of Khuniyagachh village in Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila. \"Letter has been sent to the ministry concerned seeking more relief assistance as per requirement,\" UNO Joyoshree Rani Roy of Sadar upazila told The Daily Star. \"Flood victims urgently need relief materials, especially dry food items, but they are demanding for permanent solution to save them from floods by building dam on left bank of Teesta river,\" she said. \"We don't want relief. Every year we are hit by flood. We want a permanent solution to this crisis. Building a dam on Teesta's left bank will help us live safer,\" said Quader Ali, 67, a flood-hit farmer of Khuniyagachh village. \"Relief materials are not permanent solution to save us from floods and for our better living we want a dam on Teesta River bank,\" said Jabbar Miah, 62, another flood-hit farmer of the same village. District Primary Education Officer Jahangir Alam and District Education Officer Azizul Islam told this correspondent that teaching activities at 31 primary schools and 11 high schools have been suspended after the schools went under flood water. Flood victims have taken shelter in many schools in the affected areas. \"Until the flood water recedes from affected areas, the teaching activities would remain suspended,\" said Jahangir Alam adding that he is monitoring other schools in the affected areas."

      "text": "Major rivers continued to rise across the country amid predictions of heavy downpours to deteriorate the situation, prompting authorities to intensify measures to combat a major flooding. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) in its latest bulletin this afternoon said all the major rivers \"are in rising trend\" excepting the Surma in southeastern Sylhet region but it could start rising again depending on rainfalls. \"The rain-fed rivers in all the four main basins of Meghna, Brahmaputra, Ganges - covering the northeastern, northern, northwestern and central Bangladesh -- are on the verge of surpassing their bank lines at different places,\" an FFWC spokesman said. He added the rising trend of rivers in Brahmaputra and Meghna basins including the Dharla, Kangsha, Surma and Kushiyara appeared \"rapid\" which were likely to submerge floodplains in greater Sylhet and greater Rangpur in next 24 hours. Out of 93 river monitoring points across the country, water levels in 25 points exceeded the danger marks so far, FFWC said. \"Until now the situation has not become alarming, but we are getting ready to face a major deluge,\" state minister for disaster management and relief Dr Enamur Rahman told BSS. But he added the number of affected districts overnight stood at 15 while the figure was 10 yesterday as flood hit five fresh ones including some in central parts of the country. Rahman said the 10 affected districts each by now received 500 tonnes of rice and 4,000 relief packs including edible oil, noodles, pressed rice (chira), sugar, flour, salt, candles, matchboxes and rice. \"We held inter-ministerial meetings . . . besides the ministries, the armed forces and Red Crescent and scouts mobilized 24 lakh people to stand by the affected people,\" he said. Rahman, however, said the 176 flood shelters appeared inadequate for sheltering the possible deluge victims and therefore his ministry sent to 15 vulnerable districts 7,500 tents, each of which could accommodate 20 people. Health ministry's flood control room today reported 11 deaths since July 10, saying six of them drowned while lightening killed three and snakebites two. Health Minister Zahid Maleque said his ministry was prepared with 1,368 medical teams and adequate drugs including IV fluids, water purification tablets, anti snake venoms, oral saline which were stored centrally in Dhaka and at upazila levels. The met office, meanwhile, largely substantiated the FFWC predictions of near simultaneous further rise of rivers. Meteorologists said they tallied their data with met office in upstream India which suggested widespread \"medium to heavy rainfall\" and \"very heavy rainfall\" in northern, north-eastern Bangladesh alongside adjoining Assam and Meghalaya states in next 24 to 48 hours. They said there were chances of medium to heavy rainfall in India's Bihar and Nepal adjacent to Bangladesh's north-western region to inflate further the common streams. The FFWC said the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Ganges-Padma rivers were likely to rise further in the next 72 hours and the Jamuna River at Sirajganj \"may cross danger level in next 24 hours\". \"Flood situation in Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Jamalpur, Gaibandha, Bogra and Sirajganj districts may deteriorate in next 24 hours,\" the centre warned. The bulletin, however, expected the water level to recede in Chattogram, Cox's Bazar and Bandarban districts in the coming hours."

Meanwhile, thousands of people in flood-affected areas across the country are suffering from a shortage of food and drinking water for the last couple of days. In Kurigram, the victims were Runa Begum, 28; Rupa Moni, 8; Hasibul Islam, 8; Sumon, 8, and Ruku Moni, 8. Officer-in-Charge of Ulipur Police Station Moazzem Hossain said around 1:30pm, some 20-25 women and children were traveling on boat in the area. Suddenly, a portion of the boat began leaking and it sank. Many managed to survive by swimming ashore, but the five persons could not survive, said the OC. In the district, over three lakh people of nine upazilas are currently marooned in waterlogged areas, while homes of 1,031 families have been inundated in the flood, according to sources at the district relief and rehabilitation office. Many of the affected people are having to have meals only once a day, as food supply has been scarce. \"We have been taking shelter on Guribadh [embankment], on the bank if Dharla river, for the last five days. We have been eating only once a day since then,\" said Mobarak Ali, 66, a flood victim of Char Madhobrum village in Kurigram's Sadar upazila. According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC), the floods may worsen in Kurigram, Jamalpur, Gaibandha, Bogra, Sirajganj and Tangail today, while the situation may improve in Lalmonirhat, Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Habiganj and Moulvibazar. Medium to heavy rainfall may occur in the northern and north-eastern parts of the country, according to FFWC bulletin. FFWC officials yesterday monitored the conditions of rivers in their 93 stations across the country. Of these, 23 had water flowing above danger levels. In Chattogram, most of tube-wells in Patiya upazila's Shovandandi union have been submerged creating an acute crisis of drinking water for villagers. Visiting the area yesterday, our correspondent saw many villagers collecting rain water, while many others had to walk miles through waist or chest-deep water to collect drinking water. \"We are confined by water. But we don't have a drop to drink,\" said Md Lokman, a resident of Adamalla Para area of the union. \"There is only one tube-well left that has not been submerged. It is around two kilometres away from our residence. All the people of our village have to walk through waist-deep water to collect drinking water from there,\" said Md Idris, a resident of Yakub Nagar area. Many flood-affected people are suffering from food crisis. \"All the women and children of my family have taken shelter in our relative's house in another upazila. I am alone here to look after my house. I have been eating biscuits and some dry foods for the past two days,\" he said. Crisis of food and drinking water prevails in other flood-affected areas in the district as well, while some 4.5 lakhs people of nine upazilas are in waterlogged areas. Contacted, Chattogram's deputy commissioner Mohammad Elias Hossain said the district administration had already directed all upazila administrations to take necessary measures for ensuring sufficient relief, drinking water and other essentials for the affected people. In Rangamati, flood-hit people in Baghaichari upazila are in severe need of drinking water as their houses and tube-wells have all been submerged. \"All the members of five families jointly use one tube-well near our residence. But it has been submerged. So, we have to collect drinking water from a tube-well far away,\" said Hajera Khatun, a resident of Muslim Block area in the upazila. However, some are using water purifying tablets to make floodwater drinkable. \"We have got tablets from local medical teams. We are using it to purify floodwater so that it is drinkable,\" said Rahima Begum, 45, a resident of Kuddus Para village in the same upazila. Around 10,000 people of the upazila are affected by the flood, according to locals and the authorities concerned. Speaking to The Daily Star, local upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) Muhammad Ahsan Habib Jitu said they had already distributed dry food, rice, oil, salt and pure drinking water among the affected families. In Nilphamari, around 40,000 people in the Teesta basin area, who are marooned by flood, are facing a crisis of food and pure drinking water. Officials concerned said they were distributing relief, but the affected-people claim those were insufficient.   Our Bandarban correspondent recently visited 10 shelters in the disctrict's town where flood victims claimed that they were facing a serious shortage of food and drinking water and were barely getting help from government. \"We are so worried about our children. They are becoming weak as we cannot provide them with sufficient food,\" said Monwara Begum, who took shelter in Bandarban Govt Girls' High School. In Gaibandha, the flood situation has worsened as fresh areas of four upazilas were inundated yesterday following the collapse of a dyke near the district town. Meanwhile, the flood yesterday started improving in Lalmonihat, while the situations remain unchanged in Mymensingh and Netrokona. In Kaptai, the authoritites of Kaptai Hydroelectric Power Plant (KHPP), the country's lone hydroelectric project yesterday opened its 16 gates of the dam, as water level on the lake rose above 20-feet higher than the dam can hold, posing a threat of flash floods in adjoining upazilas.  The authorities opened the gates yesterday evening, with the aim to control the water level, said KHPP Manager ATM Abduzzaher. Boats and steamers were also warned by the authorities to take precautions as their movement may be difficult due to strong currents.

The water has been flowing 18 centimetres above its danger level at Dharla Bridge Point till filing this report around 12:00noon, our Kurigram correspondent reports quoting an official of Bangladesh Water Development Board (WDB). Some flood affected people started to go back to the flood shelter centres due to the rising of the Dharla river water today. Fazlur Rahman, 50, a bus helper of Madhya Kumarpur village in Kurigram Sadar upazila, told our correspondent, \"I along with my family members returned to our home yesterday following decrease of floodwater. But we have to come back again to my previous shelter at Pateswari Bazar today\". Yesterday The water level was 15cm under its danger level at the point around 6:00pm.

      "text": "The flood has caused crop losses amounting to about Tk 1,152 crore of tens of thousands farmers, mainly in the northern region, according to an estimate of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE).    The inundation damaged crops on 1.09 lakh hectares affecting more than 6.51 lakh farmers in 31 districts, said officials. Vegetable growers suffered the biggest losses from the flood that began early last month resulting from heavy rains, followed by jute and aus paddy producers. The DAE estimates that the inundation destroyed summer vegetables on 9,841 hectares area and almost mature aus paddy on 25,851 hectares. Farmers had planted aus on 11.49 lakh hectares this year, which is less than the targeted area. Overall yield of the summer crop is likely to be 22 lakh tonnes because of decreased acreage for growers' switch to jute, maize and vegetable for higher returns to recover the lower return from winter crop boro and crop damage for flood, said the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in its July issue of Grain and Feed Update on Bangladesh. The USDA said the monsoon season in Bangladesh officially started on June 17 and heavy rains began on July 9 across the country, including the upstream neighbour of Nepal and the two Indian states of Assam and Meghalaya. \"The massive rains triggered widespread flooding and landslides and affected the livelihood of 6 million people,\" it said, adding that aus rice, transplanted aman rice seedbeds, jute, vegetables, sugarcane, banana and chili were the most damaged crops. Bangladesh is the seventh most vulnerable country with regard to the adverse effects of climate change, said the US agency. The USDA lowered its forecast on Bangladesh's rice output for the 2019-20 season -- which runs from May to April -- to 3.52 crore tonnes from 3.53 crore tonnes. Apart from aus paddy, farmers had to count losses of sown aman on 29,635 hectares and seedlings of transplanted aman 11,875 hectares. Aman is the second rice crop after boro and seedlings production of the autumn crop has been on along with transplantation. To help farmers get seedlings, the DAE has taken an initiative to produce seedlings on 75 acres of government-owned land and 530 acres of farmer-owned lands by providing them with production cost, said Md Abdul Muyeed, director of the DAE's field services wing. It is also helping growers to make 2,500 floating seedbeds of aman so that they can transplant, he added. Besides food producers, many growers, who cultivated the cash crop jute this year, incurred losses due to flood. Jute on 22,039 hectares area was damaged, according to the DAE. The DAE has taken a Tk 80 crore scheme to encourage cultivation of mustard, maize and wheat in the coming winter, Muyeed said. \"Priority will be given to the flood-affected regions,\" he added.  "

      "text": "People from all over the world shared their memories about Sir Fazle Hasan Abed. Here are some of the messages published by Brac remembering Sir Abed. He is one of my all-time heroes Extremely saddened to hear about the passing of Sir Fazle Hassan Abed, a true giant and icon of rural development, and one of my all-time heroes. Someone who dedicated his life to help the poor, achieving extraordinary impact through his organization - BRAC. I remember the first time I met him in 1992, on my first working experience in Bangladesh. Since then, through many unforgettable interactions, a wonderful partnership between BRAC and IFAD developed, with BRAC acting as an implementation partner for many of IFAD's projects in Bangladesh and other countries. In spite of countless international awards, he remained one of the kindest, most humble and gentle persons I have ever known. My sincere condolences to Tamara and the rest of Abed's extended family. Nigel Brett A message from former US Ambassador to Bangladesh Dan Mozena The world today is much diminished. The death of Sir Fazle has taken away a true hero, one who was a model for me personally and for us all of humility, caring and service to humanity. Sir Fazle believed and practiced that development starts with the individual, that development is about helping people help themselves by providing them access to better education, health and skills training. Although the world no longer has Sir Fazle to show the way, we have his living and growing legacy in BRAC and the millions of people who benefited and continue to benefit from his vision and work. I offer my deepest condolences to Sir Fazle's family, to the BRAC family, to the good people of Bangladesh, and, indeed, to all of humanity. As we grieve our loss, we must recommit ourselves to sustaining and growing his rich legacy with a heavy heart. Dan Mozena Such was his awareness about development issues I am deeply saddened at the news of the death of Sir Fazle Hasan Abed. I once had the privilege of sitting beside him at a dinner event and we were discussing public health and poverty issues. At one point, I remarked that good development ideas in Bangladesh travel fast because of population density and he immediately quipped, \"So does diarrhoea.\" Such was his presence of mind and awareness of development issues! Incidentally, one of his important contributions was to spread the idea of home-made oral saline through BRAC`s one of the many effective social campaigns. Today, Bangladesh is a global leader in reducing child mortality, which, to a great extent, is due to the reduction of child deaths from diarrhoea through the widespread adoption of orally consumable saline. This is just one example of many of his innovative ideas for development. May his soul rest in peace. Professor Wahid Uddin Mahmud May his legacy last forever Sir Fazle H Abed, a doer until his last breath, an innovator, a visionary, an iconic development practitioner and a proud Bangladeshi has left us quietly in his private space. May his institutional legacy last forever while his soul rests in peace! Dr Zahid Hussain Your light will keep guiding us Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, the esteemed founder of BRAC, was a true visionary. His efforts with BRAC post the liberation war played a key role in eradicating the extreme poverty faced by the rural people of Bangladesh. And he did not just stop at that. His continued efforts gave BRAC a global recognition and made it the Number 1 NGO in the world. Today, we mourn the sad demise of one of Bangladesh`s greatest entrepreneurs. Your light will guide our fight against poverty. Thank you Sir Fazle Hasan Abed. You will be dearly missed. Shakib Al Hasan Our deepest condolences Respected Sir, peace be upon you. We would like to express our deepest condolences for the passing of Sir Fazle Hassan Abed, founder and Chair Emeritus of BRAC. Lubaba Mubashirah A role model for us all Sir Fazle was a global leader and a role model for all of us. I pray to almighty Allah for peace of the soul of Sir Fazle Hasan Abed. Dr Salehuddin Ahmed One of the heroes of modern times Sir Fazle Hasan Abed, a Bangladeshi who is one of the heroes of modern times, died today at 83. Abed founded BRAC, one of the world`s largest aid groups, and targeted the very poor in Asia and Africa. He helped lift Bangladeshis and tens of millions around the globe. RIP, Abed. I can think of few people who have done so much for humanity as Abed. He was a friend and someone I deeply admired and learned from: While US aid efforts in Afghanistan often flopped, his succeeded. Reflecting his humility, no one called him Sir Fazle. He was simply Abed. Nicholas Kristof He was a great gift to humanity Sir Fazle Abed's life was a great gift to humanity. His nearly 50 years of visionary leadership at BRAC transformed millions of lives in Bangladesh and beyond, and changed the way the world thinks about development. Driven by an unwavering belief in the inherent dignity of all people, he empowered those in extreme poverty to build better futures for themselves and their families. I will always be grateful for the chance to see his life-changing programmes in action in Bangladesh when I was President, for his many years of work with the Clinton Global Initiative, and for the kindness, friendship, and inspiration he gave Hillary and me - including the grace and courage of the final months of his life. His legacy will live on in all the people whose lives are better, healthier and more secure because of his remarkable service. Bill Clinton His life is a lesson for us The scale and impact of what he has done, and yet the utter humility with which he has done everything, is a lesson for every single one of us. Jim Yong Kim We will never forget the example he set It was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of Sir Fazle Hasan Abed. Over the course of three decades, under Sir Fazle's inspiring leadership, the humanitarian organization he founded, BRAC, has become one of the world's leading development organizations. From its humble beginnings in Bangladesh - the country he loved so well -- to its expansion to 10 countries across Asia and Africa, BRAC has stood as an inspiring example of how we can gather people together in common cause to improve the lives of the most vulnerable. At UNICEF, we were particularly pleased that Sir Fazle agreed to become a Global Leader of Generation Unlimited, a new global public-private partnership to scale education, skills development and employment opportunities for young people, to prepare them for the world of work. I still remember his inspiring words at the Gen-U launch in September 2018, when he called on world leaders to join our cause, and invest in the next generation of global leaders. All of us at UNICEF will miss his ideas and advice. We will never forget the example he set. On behalf of everyone at UNICEF, please accept our deepest condolences to you, his family, and everyone at BRAC. Henrietta H Fore Deeply shocked I am deeply shocked to hear about the sudden demise of Sir Abed who has been an icon of pro-poor non-state development initiatives in Bangladesh and as well as in many parts of the world. I have worked with him closely both as a researcher and also as a regulator. Today, I deeply remember many of those fond memories which I shared with him for decades. The world will certainly remember him as a great innovator of various low-cost development solutions for the wretched and the disadvantaged, particularly the rural women. His leadership in promoting pro-poor education, health and finance has been simply unparalleled. My deepest condolences to the members of his family and all his colleagues from the non-governmental sector. May Allah bless his soul and let it live in peace. Atiur Rahman Our country will always remember him Dear Colleagues in BRAC, I am extremely shocked due to the departure of our Abed Bhai (Sir Fazle Hasan Abed). I pray for the peace of his departed soul and may Allah enable his family members to overcome this great loss. Our country will remember him for long as well as his nearest and dearest. May Allah bless us with patience. Md. Belayet Hossain Meah He made the world a better place He has shown that Bangladesh being a poor country, if the masses can all come together, we can help each other to come out of the darkness and emit light that goes beyond. He will be missed; his work here has given us hope for our future to come He has made the world a better place even in his absence. Abdullah Talha An asset for humanity Thank you, Abed bhai. You were an asset for humanity and Bangladesh. Dr Imtiaz Hafiz Condolence We are deeply saddened for the sudden death of Sir Fazle Hasan Abed KCMG, founder and chair emeritus of BRAC. We pray for the peace of departed soul & convey our heartfelt sympathy to the members of the bereaved family. Grameen Shamogree Condolence We express mourn for the sudden death of Sir Fazle Hasan Abed KCMG, founder and chair emeritus of BRAC Sir Fazle Hasan Abed contributed immeasurably to the country's socio-economic as well as educational development through establishing Brac and other organizations. We also pray for eternal peace of the departed soul and conveyed profound sympathy to the bereaved family. Grameen Distribution Ltd Exposing respect to Sir FH Abed Dear Sir, we are grateful to you. Rest in peace. In many times I searched and try to know about him. He was most beautiful minded person and he has bold personality. He always keeps responsibility about Bangladesh, which is found in his outlook on the liberation war in 1971. He worked for Bangladesh, Bangladeshi poor peoples. There has no self-beneficial mentality. He 100% succeed. He totally changed Bangladeshi rural areas with beautiful sacrifice. Generation never forget Him. (RIP-Sir Fazle Hasan Abed) Nayeem Rahmann Loss of an extraordinary human being Talent Centric family is deeply mourning the loss of an extraordinary human being Sir Fazle Hasan Abed (Founder of BRAC - The biggest NGO in the world). We are grateful for the life of a giant of humanity. May Allah (swat) grant him Jannatul Ferdous. Talent Centric Legends never dies I joined brac because of you.

Sharmin Sultan Thank you for everything you have done, Abed-bhai One of my hero's in development and one of the kindest and most gentle souls one could ever meet.That is indeed sad news. A massive loss for BRAC, for Bangladesh and for the many other countries where his work made a difference to the lives of the poorest. Thank you for everything you have done, Abed-bhai Debasis Chowdhury He was an extraordinary person Sir Fazle was an extraordinary person and he created an institution which mirrors his vision, commitment, and values. All of us at Save the children are saddened by the news of his passing, but inspired by his legacy. Kevin Watkins More than a great leader We lost more than a great leader. We lost a symbol of what it means to lead. Syed Ekram Uddin It was a pleasure to work with Abed Bhai Such tragic news, my sincere condolences to the family and entire global BRAC family. I have fond memories of my time with BRAC, it was a pleasure to work with and know Sir Abed Bhai. An inspiration. May his soul rest in eternal peace. Sofeena Lalani Thank you for your service sir The true lover of poor people of home and abroad, who worked all of his life bringing happiness and smiles on the sad faces, left us. Thank you for your service sir. Rest in peace. Shakhawat Chowdhury An inspiration to us all He was a tireless fighter against poverty and inequality. He touched the lives of millions over the last 47 years, fuelled by a desire to leave the world a better place than he found it, and did so with characteristic humility and resolve. He is an inspiration to us all. May his soul rest in eternal peace! Ashirul One of the most inspiring people I met Oh what a shocking and sad news. Sir Fazle is one of the most inspiring people I had the privilege to meet. My condolences to his family, to BRAC and to the whole NGO community in Bangladesh. Martine Billanou We miss you Beloved Abed bhai - we miss you already. The love, brilliance, compassion and endless optimism and hope that you brought to our planet lives on in the millions of lives you touched. Vilupti Christina Lok Corlis A great gift to humanity A great soul and a great gift to humanity! He was not a spark but a flame that will keep burning in the hearts of all whom he inspired!

Argha Basu Thanks giving to Mr Fazle We the people you have been and you have always helped will remember you as a *Hero *Soul doctor *Rescuer *the world`s father etcA lot of words to describe your goodness dear Fazle.My sister did have school fees and the option was getting married at 17 years but you chose her and took her to a school which she never dreamt attending in her entire life.We celebrate the gift of life God has given you and we as well humbly pray for your soul to rest in eternal peace until we meet you again dear. Nakyeswa Harriet God's gift on earth Beautiful, such people are simply God`s gift on earth. Sheikh Taimur Nawaz Carrying your legacy forward Thank you Abed Bhai! You were a great source of inspiration not just to us Bangladeshis, but also to the people around the globe. This is an irreparable loss to humanity...you have inspired and changed so many people`s lives in so many positive ways...you will be severely missed! Rest in peace...I am sure that your followers and coworkers will carry your legacy forward. Best wishes for BRAC! Shahidul Islam We will forever draw inspiration from his work In 1972, after Bangladesh's war of liberation had left many homeless, Fazle Abed left his job as a London oil executive and returned to his home country with PS16,000 in his pocket - and the ambitious goal of building 10,400 houses. He ended up raising enough money to build 16,000 houses for some of the poorest people in Bangladesh and still had enough left over to start his next project. That's who Sir Fazle was as a humanitarian, and that's what he helped us learn about development work: How to build a big, efficient organization, while never forgetting who you were doing it for. We were saddened to hear of his passing and will forever draw inspiration from his work, as will the rest of the world, which he left so much better than he found. Melinda Gates He was a great gift to humanity Sir Fazle Abed's life was a great gift to humanity. His nearly 50 years of visionary leadership at BRAC transformed millions of lives in Bangladesh and beyond, and changed the way the world thinks about development.

Jim Yong Kim It's pity! The world has lost a truly remarkable human being and one who has changed the world and my life in an amazing way. He will be remembered forever as the man who touched a valuable thing and an imagination only limited by our thoughts. Condolences go to his family and friends and BRAC family at large. He may be gone but will never be forgotten!!May Good Loard put at his right hand. May your Soul Rest in Peace. Wafula Moses Musia Rest in Peace Sir Fazle Hasan Abed His enormous contribution to make a better world will always be remembered. Such loss of intellectual and dedicated person to humanity is irrecoverable. May Allah rest his soul in peace. Rasel Azam Soul touch We will miss the man of all forms of integrity, good hearted, innovator, employer and everything imagine a just 4 months in the organisation but my life changed immediately so God may his soul rest in peace we shall miss him for centuries. Tuhairwe Fredrick Our hearts grieve On behalf of the BRAC USA team, I`d like to express our profound sadness and condolences to Abed bhai`s family. Abed left a mark on all of those who had the privilege of working with him, and even those who never met him, who were inspired to join BRAC because of him. His works affected millions of other people`s lives, far and wide, yet despite this and his many achievements and accolades, he always insisted that it was the poor and marginalized who deserved the real credit for ending poverty. The role of people like him -- and people like us, and others working in development -- is simply to create the enabling conditions for them to do so. In the days to come, as we celebrate his life, we find solace in one of Rabindanath Tagore's more memorable notes: \"I slept and dreamt that life was joy. I awoke and saw that life was service. I acted and behold, service was joy. \"We also remember Abed Bhai`s own remark: \"I have spent my life watching optimism triumph over despair when the light of self-belief is sparked in people. As a team, I want us to keep lighting these sparks.\" Our hearts grieve, yet I also know that Abed Bhai would not wish us to lament his loss too long, but to honor his remarkable legacy by continuing the work he started. Donella Rapier The most important standard bearers of development for our generation I would like to convey my heartfelt condolences for the departure of Sir Fazle Hasan Abed. One of the reasons why I have been long wanting to work in Bangladesh was because of him who had been one of the most important standard bearers of development for our generation. It is a great loss to Bangladesh as well as to the world. I pray for his soul rest in eternal peace. Tomoo Hozumi He left footprints on our hearts Some people come into our lives, leave footprints on our hearts, and we are never the same. Death is an inevitable state of transition. Not all lives can be celebrated. Let us celebrate the life of Sir Fazle and take the mourning behind us. Salute au grand homme! Dr Chanchal Khan He was a legend I am so sad today! Sir Fazle Hasan Abed was a legend, a man who always inspired me. Bangladesh will remember you forever, sir! My heartfelt condolences to his family, to BRAC and the whole non-profit sector in Bangladesh. Shyda Rashid Remembering Sir Fazle Sir Fazle Abed is the most respected person in my life next to my late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. I spent many meetings learning his humility and simple wisdom. Death is a given. We all die eventually. Abed reminds us that service to humanity is the highest value for our time on this planet. On my last day, I want to say, \"It was a useful journey and I did not waste the opportunity to serve.\" Jack Sim We will never forget the example he set It was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of Sir Fazle Hasan Abed.

Iftekhar Ahmed Sakib He made Bangladesh proud May Allah provide best peace and rest to our brother Sir Fazle Hasan Abed who has brought unlimited success for the people who are in need in Bangladesh and in the world. He made Bangladesh proud and contributed to changing the life of the people and contributed to improving Bangladesh's status. Abed Bhai we missed you, but we have very good memory about you that you build. Abdus Sattar Dulal Your guidance will be followed Your guidance and inspiration will not let us miss You. We will win the war against social injustices that You started so that You can rest in peace. Zahidul Alam May Holy Trinity grant peace for his noble Soul In my career, I have taken interviews of so many people of different arenas. And of course, meeting with Sir Fazle Hasan Abed at the evening of Bangla Academy premises in 2016 was a great experience for me. It`s a 15-minute session. Amidst enjoying a Lalon song, 'Jekhaney Sair Baramkhana', performed by Shikhor, he gave that interview. He said...\" Once I was walking by a poor villager`s house. I saw a malnourished woman was taking care of many ducks. I asked her about the initiative to become self-reliant. The poor woman said she had no way to earn money. Finally, rearing ducks with minimum capital had become a solution to solve her financial crisis\" .... He kept saying...The main objective of development is the changing of culture. When a girl becomes educated, she must bring changes to her surroundings. May Holy Trinity grand peace for his noble Soul. Bipul K Debnath Legends never die Legend has no death for them. The human heart is immortalized for action. Jewel Hossain Gazi In remembering of our sir It is a very sad day for us. We have lost a great visionary, leader and a true hero....as an ex-student of BRAC University i feel heartbroken...let us learn from the life of this great soul that life is not only about making your own life better but to enhance the lives of people around you.... sir we will always remember u. because legends never die.... TAPOSHI MOSHARRAF His ideology will remain in our hearts I am deeply saddened to hear that Abed Bhai passed away last night. I pray for eternal peace of his departed soul. I was associated with BRAC for about 30 years. He influenced me to learn more, work hard and inspire others to work diligently to realise the organisational vision. I learned from him how to expand organisation in other countries, how to handle management and leadership crisis in difficult situations, scale up programs and managing scale effectively. When we scaled up BRAC in Uganda once he told me \"If you cannot manage time to read every report, you should not forget to read program monitoring and internal audit reports. You will get all the information you need to manage large scale operations\". When I was a junior level staff he included me in the list of senior managers to attend meetings during national crisis like floods, cyclone, although I could not contribute anything in decision making processes but learned how to make decision to work during humanitarian crisis, post crisis rehabilitation phase and take up long term development programmes. I got appreciation, recognition and guidance from him that inspired me even when I work with other organisations. After leaving BRAC I met him in several occasions. He always asked how I am doing, how is my family and many more. I will miss his guidance and affection. It was not possible to see him when he was in hospital due to restrictions from the doctors and the hospital procedures. I know we will not get him back physically but his ideology will remain in our hearts to serve humanity in and outside of Bangladesh. Abed Bhai, we will miss you. Ariful Islam A great leader and a true patriot Sir, you were a great leader, a true patriot and spent your whole life in doing good for the country and its people.

MD JAYNAL ABEDIN Condolence from Bangladesh Community Media Sector & Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication Fazle Hasan Abed, KCMG founder of BRAC & Chair Emeritus, passed away on 20th December, 2019. We mourn his depart and offer our deepest condolences to his family & affiliated with BRAC. His achievements are outstanding and will continue to make an impact on the lives of many. There is only little we can say when an important person in our lives suddenly passes away. No words can make you feel better. Bangladesh's economy was ruined in 1972 after the war and Abed identified the needs of the poor. Particularly, the refugees returning from India after seeking shelter during the war inspired him to found BRAC. Enabling them to develop their own capacity to better manage their lives was his main objective. The same can be said about the later 2010 BRAC facilitated community radio Pallikantho 99.2. Therefore, community radio Pallikantho 99.2 broadcasting altogether 12 hours' program per day on information, education, local entertainment and development motivation activities. Around 40 youth women & youth are now working with those stations as community broadcaster in line with giving voices to the rural people. We, Bangladesh Community Media Sector & Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication (BNNRC) extend our deepest sympathies to his family members and staff members of BRAC. Bangladesh Community Media Sector & Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication (BNNRC) will always cherish the wonderful memories made with Fazle Hasan Abed.  Fazle Hasan Abed will always be remembered. His legacy will live on. AHM Bazlur Rahman Chief Executive Officer Bangladesh NGOs Network for Radio and Communication (BNNRC)www.bnnrc.net AHM Bazlur Bazlur Condolences He was great philanthropist, job Creator and born from the development of human beings. Deepest condolences from me and my family. We will never forget you SIR. Swapan Saha Sir Fazle is Bangladesh! Bangladesh would never become what it has become today without your dreams, hard work, spirit and achievements! An eternal lighthouse for the have nots in Bangladesh and outside. You have proved many times that one's vision and perseverance are bigger than challenges, be it in health, education, nutrition, employment, governance and everything. Demise of the second tallest son of this soil after Sheikh Mujib! Syed Khaled Ahsan Remembering Sir Abed I learned for your work, try to flow way you work. Can't forget you!! Apu Chandra Roy Remembering Sir Fazle Abed The greatest way in which the youth can show respect to Sir Fazle Hasan Abed is to emulate at least one of his great qualities and adopt it as a way of life. I sincerely hope through his work and legacy, Sir Abed has sown the seeds of future leaders like him in today's youth of Bangladesh. In each of us, there is a Abed and hence he cannot die! Ashfaque Kabir Tribute to Sir Abed A greatest Bengali person who did everything for his country, people and the liberation war. I remember profoundly his sacrifice, devotion and works. Respect, Love and Prayer for you Mr. Knight Bengal. Ashif Rezwan Lost a person of advancing Bangladesh He will be remembered for his noble works that make a person`s life meaningful and he will be remembered for his extra-ordinary deeds that made him stand out from others. Biplob Kanti Banik FCA Respect and forever love BRAC means Sir Fazle Hasan Abed. Even if we lose him, we will find all his biographies in the works of our BRAC. Rest in peace... Rakibur Rahaman Chowdhury Flag Bearer We have lost national asset who changed our socio-economy. He had played his role in many social sector for minimizing our poverty. We are committed to you, yes, we will carry your dream and bear your works. Mintu Kabir Thank you Sir Fazle He was a knight who led the charge in a very different kind of war. A war to uplift people in suffering. A war to end discrimination in all its forms. He will remain immortalised in the hearts of the millions reached during and after his time. Thank you for giving a damn sir. Ali Iqbal Murshed The Entrepreneur of Soul ...of the Poorest Abid Bhai, you are the Entrepreneurs of Poorest and you have believed and inspired millions of poor in Bangladesh and around the world that they are the most daring entrepreneurs, who can change their destiny and lead the world. Abid bhai you can know take rest and we should work until the last poor in planet is not touched to realise that their potential of entrepreneurship. Muzaffar Uddin"

      "text": "The government and the Bangladesh Bank have come up with several initiatives in response to the evolving public health and economic crisis. Several of the initiatives pertain to flattening the spread curve of coronavirus while the others attempt to flatten the fattening of the economic costs curve due to social distancing measures.  How does the overall response package look like, taken together, and how adequate and well defined are the responses? Flattening the curve The measures introduced to flatten the spread curve include public holiday announced from March 26 to April 4, school closures, deployment of armed forces to enforce social distancing, closure of the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission and the bourses in line with the closure of public offices.  The decision on whether to keep factories open or running has been delegated to the respective industry associations.  The general feeling is that these measures came a little late, though better than never. The measures lacked internal consistency -- with some factories closed and some open, when the conventional wisdom is such middle grounds are self-defeating -- and they failed to anticipate the callous behavioural response from people covered, who chose to travel in crowded transports and went on vacation to tourism spots, thus exacerbating the transmission risk. The deployment of the armed forces could be a lifesaver assuming they themselves have enough personal protection equipment. FISCAL RESPONSE The National Board of Revenue withdrew all duties and taxes on imports of medical supplies related to COVID-19 such as protective equipment and test kits. The scarcity of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol has hindered the supply of enough hand sanitisers. The high duty on rectified spirits continues, thus discouraging its use for producing hand sanitisers and symbolising another policy inconsistency. The recent announced fiscal response is in the right direction, though far from adequate.  The most significant in terms of the amount of financial resources is the Tk 5,000 crore -- which is equivalent to 0.2 per cent of fiscal 2018-19's GDP -- wage support to workers in the export-oriented industries.  Now, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association claims that it pays Tk 4,000 crore in wages every month.  The Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association probably pays an amount very similar.  Then there are the others: leather, footwear, furniture, ceramics and so on.  Most are demanding more than a months' basic pay.  How the announced amount will be rationed among all the different claimants in the export sector is not clear.  But rationing is inevitable since the total is well short of the wage bill in the exports sector.  It could be done on the basis of the number of workers in each export-oriented factory as a proportion of the total workers in the sector.  The difference between the public support and the monthly salary bills will have to be borne by the owners and perhaps the buyers.  More support is already being demanded by the industry leaders.  No support is available for deemed export, domestic market-oriented industries and those in services, who too are facing cash flow disruption due to the sudden stoppage of the wheels of the economy. There is a lack of clarity in the support announced for the at-risk population dependent on the informal sector. Facing the choice between death due to starvation and coronavirus infection leading possibly to death, they prefer the latter. This demonstrates once again that there is nothing more lethal than an empty stomach.  To them the risk of contracting coronavirus pales compared with the pain from starvation. The government has indicated providing 6 months' free food, free shelter, free medicine for poor people without defining eligibility criteria, the financial allocations and the distribution mechanism.  Rice will be sold at a discounted price.  The ministry of disaster management and relief has reportedly received more than 24,000 tonnes of food for distribution to the needy. But where and how -- are unclear. The economically affected are spread all over the country. How will they be identified and reached?  How will the delivery mechanism ensure that social distancing is not traded off in the process?  How many will these assistance cover?  As done in India, why not make cash transfers to the target groups through mobile financial services? MONETARY RESPONSE The BB has reduced the repo rate from 6 per cent to 5.75 percent and the cash reserve ratio from 5.5 per cent to 5 per cent. The latter is estimated to inject about Tk 6,500 crore liquidity into the banking system.  It has also committed to purchase treasury bills and bonds from the banks and the non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) beyond those needed to meet the statutory liquidity requirement. This will help counteract the disruption in recoveries due to a virtual moratorium on loan repayments to the banks and the NBFIs until June 30.  The banks that have rescheduled loans according to the new rescheduling policy will be allowed to keep 50 per cent of the provision required. The BB also increased the repayment tenure of loans given out from the Export Development Fund (EDF) from three to six months.  This will relieve pressure on cash outflows of the beneficiaries of EDF. The monthly transaction limit using mobile financial services (MFS) has been increased to Tk 200,000 from Tk 75,000.  No charge can be applied for person-to-person transfer. Merchants cannot be charged for settling transactions of Tk 15,000 daily and Tk 100,000 monthly while selling medicines and other essential goods if they use debit or credit cards for payment. Transaction limit using contactless debit and credit cards has been increased from Tk 3,000 to Tk 5,000 per day.  All these will facilitate the functioning of payments when restriction on movements outside home require limiting the number of transactions needed to make a payment. The BB instructed banks to extend the tenure of realising export proceeds from four to six months. Importers now have more time to make import payments with extension of the tenure of Letters of Credit to six months from the existing four months. The period of back to back letters of credit opened under suppliers and buyers' credit has been extended up to a year from six months.  Banks are allowed to accept advance payments of up to $500,000 from typically $10,000 from businesses seeking to import COVID-19-related life-saving drugs and essential medical items, including kits and equipment. The BB has allowed increasing the usance period for industrial raw materials up to 360 days from 180 days and the usance period for life-saving drugs to up to 180 days from 90 days.  All these will make trade financing easier and more flexible. WHERE DO WE STAND? Overall, both the fiscal and monetary responses described above are in the right direction, but not even remotely adequate.  They also lack clarity on the implementation modalities. The devil could be in these details. The fiscal response will not see the light of the day without working out the details.  Time is of the essence here. Many governments have introduced support packages equivalent to 8-10 per cent of GDP.  Indian fiscal package constitutes 0.8 per cent of GDP.  Ours is hard to estimate because of the lack of clarity on the amount allocated for food, medicine and housing-based assistance.  However, it is unlikely to be even close to that of India. It is not fair to look only to government for support to deal with a crisis as ferocious and devious as the coronavirus, which has brought the entire global economy close to a standstill.  The financial and non-financial corporates have to come forward as well using their corporate social responsibility funds. The established industries who are virtually living on profits should be willing to dig into their accumulated reserves to maintain their workforce.  After all, social distancing has only artificially stopped the wheels of the economy.  While it may cause some permanent damage if it has to be continued too long, once the economy gets moving with relaxation of social distancing measures, the unleashing of the pent-up demand could lead to a business boom and thus help replenish the depleted reserves.  The well-off individuals should come forward with voluntary contributions to support the incomes of the workers and the self-employed in the informal sector.  The non-governmental organisations and the other social organisations need to deploy their institutional capacity in identifying and reaching the adversely impacted groups with social assistance.  Unfortunately, other than perhaps the cricketers, we are yet to see a significant community response comparable to what we have seen historically in times of floods, cyclones and food price shocks. The government has to lead the effort and the rest of the society must chip in with cash, kind, skills and organising support to contain the spread of lethal virus, deal with the COVID-19 infected cases and cope with the economic fallout of social distancing.

      "text": "Haors and low-lying areas of Sunamganj and Moulvibazar are getting flooded as almost all major rivers in the country's north-eastern districts and in the Indian state of Meghalaya are swelling up due to heavy rains, triggered by Cyclone Fani.  However, officials at Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) do not anticipate that the flooding will be able to cause any significant damage to local agriculture as most farmers have already harvested paddy from croplands before Fani swept through the country on Saturday, reports our Sylhet correspondent.  According to a bulletin, issued yesterday, by Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), level of water in all major rivers in north-eastern region of the country is on the rise. The Kangsha river is flowing 109 centimetres above the danger level, while the Jadukata is flowing above 57 centimetres of the danger level, the FFWC said. While speaking with our correspondent in Sylhet, DAE Deputy Director in Sunamganj Bashir Ahmed Sarkar said, \"Water is rising in all haors including Tangua, Shoni, Matian and Korcha. However, most farmers have already harvested their crops before the water level started to rise in the haors.\" \"Only a small number of farmers in Tanguar haor area fell behind. But hopefully, they will not face any trouble harvesting their crops  [before the haors get flooded],\" he said. He also said around 13,12,500 tonnes of Boro, more than their estimated target, were harvested this season in Sunamganj. In April 2017, flash floods in Sylhet region washed away Boro paddy before those could be harvested. Farmers in Sunamganj were the worst affected by the floods that year. According to DAE, Boro has been cultivated on 2,24,440 hectares of land in the district this year and the figure is 2 thousand hectares higher than the previous year. Farmer Abdul Hakim from Kotamara village in Jamalganj said, \"We reaped a good harvest this year despite fear of flash floods and rains triggered by the cyclone.\" However, the selling price of paddy is not satisfactory, considering the additional cost they had to incur due to shortage of labourers, he added. Meanwhile, our Moulvibazar correspondent reports that a handful of farmers, who could not manage to harvest all their crops in Hakaluki haor before the Cyclone Fani lashed out on the country, are working in full swing to harvest the remainder of their crops before the floods hit the area.   Some farmers said flood water has started gushing in inside the Hakaluki haor since Saturday.  Ranendra Shankar Chakraborty, executive engineer of Water Development Board (WDB) in Moulvibazar, told this correspondent that low-lying areas in haors are getting submerged as water level in the Kushiyara river is rising every day. WDB has been advising farmers to harvest their crops from the area to minimise losses due to the imminent floods, he also said. Mohammad Shahjahan, additional director of DAE in Sylhet division, said Boro production in the region is expected to reach 19 lakh tonnes this year. The production last year was 18.5 lakh tonnes.  Harvesting of paddy in haor areas of four districts under Sylhet division is in its final stage and so far, more than 85 percent of paddy has already been harvested, he said, adding that DAE has been making announcements over loudspeakers, asking farmers to harvest their paddy as soon as possible.   Farmer Monir Mia, a resident of Boromchal area in Kulaura upazila of Moulvibazar, said till Friday, he harvested paddy from three out of his four acres of cultivated land. After the Kushiyara started to inundate haor areas since the afternoon of Saturday, he was running against time to harvest paddy from his remaining one acre of land, he added. Mobossir Ali, another farmer in Hakaluki haor area, said although he is yet to harvest 20 percent of his crops, his losses this year would remain lower than that during the flash floods in 2017."

      "text": "The government is going to double the amount of food grains it planned to import a few months ago amid high rice prices, fast depleting stocks and a flood ravaging crop fields in the north. Ahead of a stocktaking meeting of Food Planning and Monitoring Committee on the tight food situation tomorrow, officials told The Daily Star that public sector import for 2017-18 fiscal year would be increased from nine lakh tonnes to 17 lakh tonnes of food grains. They told The Daily Star that the meeting is likely to approve rice import target of 12 lakh tonnes, instead of the existing plan of six lakh tonnes, and five lakh tonnes of wheat, instead of the previously set three lakh tonnes.  Six ministers and 10 senior secretaries would sit for a meeting of the committee tomorrow to decide how to tackle the situation. The country's food security took the first hit this year when flash floods devastated paddy fields in the north-eastern haor regions, wiping out 10 lakh tonnes of potential Boro harvest. The matter was further complicated with fungal attack (rice blast) that ruined harvests of many farmers. However, the government was slow to respond. It took over two months to reduce the rice-import duty. With granaries not replenished fast enough, rice prices increased by 47 percent than that of last year, ministry sources said. The Food Planning and Monitoring Committee is comprised of ministers for food, finance, commerce, agriculture, LGRD, and disaster management and relief, and 10 secretaries, including the cabinet secretary. It is the committee's responsibility to monitor food security with secretarial and policy support from the Food Planning and Monitoring Unit (FPMU) of the food ministry. Worried over food security and feeling the need for an urgent stocktaking ahead of what appears to be a devastating flood, the FPMU held an appraisal session yesterday, a government holiday for Janmashtami. After the June 20 decision to cut rice import duty to 10 percent from 28 percent, as much as 2.5 lakh tonnes have been imported by traders. It is projected that until the next rice crop (Aman) is harvested in November, private traders would import up to 15 lakh tonnes, the sources said. The prime minister also hinted more imports. Speaking on Sunday at the Bangladesh National Nutrition Council meeting in Dhaka, Sheikh Hasina said the government was procuring food grains from the international market to face the challenges caused by the ongoing flood. \"We've already procured food grains from various countries and more are coming ... ,\" she said.  Tomorrow's meeting would review the current flood situation. Rice-price volatility would largely depend on the next harvest of the staple and if the flood prolongs, Aman crops would be hurt, sources said.   Agriculture Minister Matia Chowdhury told this correspondent on Sunday that a good harvest of rain-fed Aus rice is expected to make at least 27 lakh tonnes of rice available in the market soon. She hoped for a good Aman harvest as well, provided floods do not do major damages. Director General of the FPMU, Naser Farid, told The Daily Star that if the floodwater receded by August and the deluge did not drag on beyond the first week of September, farmers planting Aman would get a scope for recovering from earlier losses. The decision to increase food grains import is being taken at a time when the government has a stock of 2.7 lakh tonnes of the staple but would have to distribute 4.5 lakh tonnes between September and November among 50 lakh ultra-poor under a programme. Under the programme initiated late last year, the underprivileged are sold rice at Tk 10 per kg. A food official said, \"We're lining up rice and wheat imports in a way that allows us to deliver the 4.5 lakh tonnes to the ultra-poor, at least 50,000 tonnes more to people in the haors, and one lakh tonne as gratuitous relief [GR] to flood victims.\" As the government's Boro procurement drive fell flat with only a fifth of the targeted 10 lakh tonnes achieved so far, the official said, it now needs to import more rice to keep a sufficient carryover stock for the future.   The sources said learning from 2016-17's low food stock, the food ministry was vouching for a better reserve so that year-end stock in public granaries remain close to 10 lakh tonnes. Last fiscal year, the year-end rice stock dropped below three lakh tonnes, the lowest in six years. Market sources said prices continuously showed an upward trend since the flash flood in the haors. Traders and rice millers further pushed the prices up by refraining from importing rice with 28 percent duty. The government then could not go for market intervention because of low food stock. Bangladesh, the world's fourth-biggest producer of rice with over 3.4 crore tonnes output, uses almost all its production to feed its population. It often requires imports to cope with shortages caused by natural disasters such as floods and droughts. But since 2011, the government did not need to import rice although rice traders have done so, mostly from India. However, since May, the food directorate has floated international tenders to buy 3.5 lakh tonnes of rice and had also made a deal with Vietnam government to bring in 2.5 lakh tonnes more. The government has also signed two more memorandums of understanding (MoU) with Cambodia and Thailand but has not finalised the prices yet. Sources yesterday told The Daily Star that the food ministry was expecting to strike a deal with Cambodia in the next 10 days."

      "text": "The highest displacements are recorded in China with 7.4 million people getting displaced in their own country due to conflict and disasters, followed by the Philippines (5.9 million) and India (2.4 million), the report said.  The World is faced with the rising crisis of internally displaced people. Each year millions of people are being made homeless as a result of sudden disasters such as floods and storms, new figures show.  The majority of the people who are faced with the high risk of displacement live in Asian countries mostly struggling with various economic hardships. Eight countries with highest risk of internally displaced people are in Asia. China tops the list with most number of internally displaced people due to the natural disasters. Around 7. 4 million people are displaced and earthquakes, storms, floods and geophysical hazards are mostly responsible for their displacement. The Philippines has the second highest number of internally displaced people in Asia. Disasters due to typhoons are a major factor for displacement of people in the country. The armed conflicts in the southern island of Mindano has also forced people to dislocate. Clan based violence and human rights violations by state and non-state actors continue to push people away from their locations. In India which has the third highest number of displaced people, displacement in recent years has been attributed to the environmental factors. India is prone to droughts, floods, tsunamis, earthquakes and cyclones. The third of country's population live in poverty and substandard housing which makes it difficult for them to cope in the face of natural disasters. Combined with these factors is the poorly planned urbanisation and environmental degradation which has led to risk of damage and displacement. Also, the political conflicts in various states of the country and increase of human rights violations also have led to people displacing and moving to safer areas. In Indonesia, people have been dislocated because of protracted inter communal violence and insurgency related violence and as a result of which they have been unwilling to reintegrate and re-establish their lives. Conflict of Aceh, Free Papua Movement, attack on religious minorities, targeting of shia population in the country has forced people to displace, according to IDMC.  People in Japan continue to bear the brunt of The Great East Japan Earthquake, persistent tsunamis and the Fukushima nuclear radiation disaster. The country has fifth largest number of internally displaced people in Asia.   Floods and protracted ethnic conflicts has rendered thousands of  people displaced in Bangladesh making it country with sixth largest number of internally displaced people.  Myanmar has also been witnessing inter community conflicts leading to violence and consequently displacement. The conflict between Buddhists and Muslims in the Rakhine state since 2012 has continuously been displacing people.  Sri Lanka has been witness to a brutal war between State and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE) which has resulted in thousands of people being displaced from Northern and Eastern provinces. The conflict in Thailand between Malay Muslims and the State has resulted in internal displacement along with environmental disasters like recent floods in the county. The Buddhist minority in the state of Pattani has moved to safer places to evade the conflict. The displacement due to natural disasters has been mostly from rural to urban areas. Refugees and people uprooted in their own countries are already at record-high numbers. Worse the internally displaced people are in a much difficult position. While refuges benefit from an established legal system of protection, those displaced internally lack any institutional support or assistance from international community or justice system.  "

      "text": "DHAKA, the capital of Bangladesh, and one of the fastest growing cities of the world, has been infamous for a while for being over-populated, traffic congested, waterlogged (urban flooding) and polluted (e.g. toxic waste, poor sewage system, harmful emissions, etc.). In less than 325 square kilometres of area, it supports more than 15 million people which makes it one of the most densely populated megacities. It has grown from a provincial town into a megacity after the independence in 1971. But the infrastructures, organisations and the systems inevitably could not cope up with the astonishing growth. Dhaka has seen lots of changes in the urban mobility scenario, policies and regulations with their implications in the last 40 years. Motorisation was, and still is, quite low but the congestion is increasing due to various reasons. The number of non-motorised vehicles (NMVs) has increased by almost eight or ten folds; compressed natural gas (CNG) has been introduced; plan for mass rapid transit (MRT) systems and waterways, and phasing out of rickshaws have been going on; and a 20-year transportation master plan, Strategic Transport Plan (STP), has been proposed (which was recently revised). Also, a trend of preference towards private vehicles (e.g. personal cars, motorbikes, etc.) from the late 90s till present has also been observed. A phenomenon which is not unprecedented in developing cities. One of the main reasons behind this trend in Dhaka is the lack of effective public transport and near non-existence of urban rail. The present state of affairs results in serious congestion in the whole traffic network of the city. As a consequence of the horrendous traffic situation, air quality has deteriorated significantly. It used to be termed as the most polluted city in the world in the 90s because of the presence of high level of lead in air (coming from the emissions of the vehicles). Pollution from traffic and brick kilns had been identified as two of the most significant factors by various studies. In order to improve this severe situation, the authorities took some steps (e.g. banning two-stroke engines, introducing CNG, etc.). But there has been little systematic research on air pollution in Dhaka resulting from traffic but some estimations of emission from different sectors (e.g. transport, industry, residential) are available. In spite of few projects in the 90s and 2000s, air quality monitoring data is still rare and mostly unavailable due to limited measuring facilities, economic constraints, and lack of initiatives. Bangladesh has Environment Conservation Rules (1997) and it developed an Air Quality Index (AQI) in around 2005 based on National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) of the US (the AQI value runs from 0 to 500). The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and health concerns. On February 17, 2014, Dhaka's air quality was measured at 172 AQI which is considered unhealthy and on January 25, 2017 it was measured at 361 AQI which is deemed extremely unhealthy. Although particulate pollution levels are quite high in the capital, World Health Organization's numbers say it is 44th among the cities it monitors, in terms of fine particle (PM2.5) pollution. In terms of PM10, or coarse dust pollution, it ranks 71st. With unabated rise of personalised transport (rapid motorisation) and increasing congestion, the air pollution level is escalating to the previous terrible condition. According to the State of Global Air report, India and Bangladesh have experienced highest increases in air pollution levels since 2010. One of the key solutions to solve Dhaka's traffic problem is to provide an adequate and effective public transport system. Dhaka is probably the only megacity where a proper public transport is virtually non-existent. Insufficient number of buses (and minibuses) along with mostly informal transports (para-transit) like rickshaws, CNG-fuelled three-wheelers, battery bikes, human haulers (locally known as Leguna, Maxi, etc.) cater to the demand of city-dwellers. Scarcity of buses is not the only problem of the transport system. From the research studies done in Bengal Institute we have observed that there are mainly five main bus corridors in the city, and all of them run in the north-south direction. East-west connectivity is being provided by other informal transport or para-transit services, especially by human haulers. Even though the public transport services stop indiscriminately almost at every intersection, there is lack service in most of the areas in the city. The routes do not necessarily serve the traffic demand, rather they profit-driven. This results in utter chaos and unhealthy competition on the roads. Experts and users both identified rain, bad roads and VIP movement as the main causes impeding smooth traffic flow. During the monsoon in 2017 the road condition became terrible, waterlogging was everywhere and spending more than two hours stuck in traffic daily has become the norm for Dhakaiites. The normal peak hour congestions in the morning and afternoon are compounded by frequent movement of VIPs and regular processions in the streets. Also, during Eid seasons the traffic situation in the highways was appalling; the commuters had to endure 10 or even 20km-long traffic jams. Apart from traffic problems, the city is mainly facing two big problems, namely constant waterlogging (urban flooding) and migration (huge influx of people from other districts). We are yet to understand that climatic changes i.e. geologic changes and anthropogenic changes have a large impact on the capital city--along with some other factors, as research has indicated. Climate change will physically affect Dhaka primarily in two ways: floods/drainage congestion and heat stress (a brief summary of few of the problems is described in the following sections). Long-term effects include in-migration (the term \"climate refugees\" has been floating around for a while), saltwater intrusion, loss of agricultural land, etc. Interestingly, Dhaka has never been the focal point in most discussions or studies on climate change. But the city had to take the brunt of many catastrophic disasters that have ravaged the country.  Waterlogging and drainage congestion due to river floods and excessive rainfall during the monsoon have already caused very serious damage. Flooding due to excessive rainfall is a severe problem in certain parts of the city, which get inundated for several days mainly due to poor and low capacity drainage system, clogged up sewer system, and inadequate pumping facilities to remove the stagnant water. In October 2017, newspaper reports noted that parts of the capital, including Malibagh, Rajarbagh, Mirpur, Mohammadpur, Shukrabad, Kalabagan and Bijoy Sarani, had been waterlogged. These areas, despite having an elevation of 60 feet and higher, were waterlogged due to excessive rainfall. The situation was so appalling that firemen had to ferry people on the submerged roads on their lifeboats at Shewrapara of Mirpur, Karwan Bazar and Motijheel areas during monsoon last year. Bangladesh ranked sixth among the world's top 10 countries most affected by extreme weather events in the last 20 years, according to Global Climate Risk Index published by the think-tank Germanwatch. The country's temperature during monsoon season is projected to increase by 0.7 degrees Celsius and by 1.3 degrees Celsius in the winter. Over the last 30 years, during March-November, Dhaka has been experiencing a slight increase in temperature and this average has sharply increased during the last five years, at a rate of 0.11 degrees Celsius. In recent days, the city has been going through extreme heat waves and humid weather in terms of frequency and intensity. Besides, Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, i.e. specific characteristics of urban structures and anthropogenic heat sources, makes Dhaka city's temperature 1 to 5 degrees Celsius higher than the surrounding area. Climate change is increasing the temperature and therefore the potential for heavier rain. An estimation of yearly rainfall from 1978 to 2008 reflects an average rise of 4mm per annum in Dhaka. Observation suggests that since the number of days without rainfall is increasing, seasonal rainfall during monsoon (June-August) and winter (December-February) in Dhaka is decreasing during these periods, while sporadic heavy rainfall is becoming more frequent. On August 4, 2017, there was 123mm of rainfall in Dhaka in just three hours. This pattern of weather events has been observed in recent days. There had been no record of rainfall over 100mm in three hours since 2003. Millions of people have already been displaced from the coastal areas of the country due to increasing salinity intrusion, erosion of river banks, cyclone and storm surges as well as lack of opportunities. Unsustainable levels of climate-induced displacement and migration are one of the apparent reasons for overpopulation, highly dense areas and congestion inside the city. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates 20 million people will be displaced in Bangladesh in the coming five years. Of all lifetime in-migrants, 42 percent went to Dhaka district and 56 percent to the three districts making up the Greater Dhaka Area (Dhaka, Gazipur and Narayanganj districts) (UNFPA, 2016). Three regions of Bangladesh are noted for their seasonal migration patterns: a) the Monga-prone districts in the northeast which suffer prolonged and severe drought during the winter, b) the southwest districts' people who suffer from sea level rise and saltwater intrusion in the dry season, and c) the northeastern haor-affected areas, which face flooding and waterlogging during the monsoon. The topic of climate change has generally been overshadowed by other severe natural hazards. For instance, a year after the World Bank's study on climate change and sustainable development in Bangladesh, its country assistance strategy only mentioned climate change briefly, in the context of environmental problems. Nevertheless, BMZ, a German governmental organisation in a case study on climate change and conflict showed that this country has already been a primary victim of extreme weather events (cyclones, floods and droughts) that forced people to migrate. Finally in 2009, the ministry of environment and forests prepared and published Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan. Almost half of Dhaka's population can be termed as urban poor not only in terms of their income level or living standard but also considering their accessibility to basic services and opportunity to resources. The city's existing problems will definitely be aggrieved by climate change, especially with the inflow of climate refugees. It is fast becoming one of the places for the marginalised who cannot afford to live anywhere else, but have to survive in the city for a living and have no other place to go. Dhaka has started to move slowly but surely on the right track. It however is restricted by many problems, especially economic constraints and technical ability. It has developed a plan and various strategies with help from international agencies to mitigate or lessen the effects of climate change, and started taking very small steps to implement. Nonetheless, the planning and implementation of various projects and strategies tend to focus on the mid-term, if not the short-term. For instance, policies continue to be prepared in order to cope with natural disasters like floods, storm surges, cyclones, etc., rather than from the perspective of overall planning of mitigating the effects of climate change. The same can be said about Dhaka's urban and transport planning. Many studies and plans under various projects since the 2000s have been done, namely Bangladesh Urban Air Quality Management Project (AQMP), Dhaka Urban Transport Development Study (DHUTS), Clean Air and Sustainable Environment (CASE) Preparation project, Strategic Transport Plan for Dhaka (STP), Detailed Area Plan (DAP), etc., by various authorities like Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK), Planning Commission, Dhaka Transport Co-ordination Board (DTCB), Department of Environment (DoE) and many more. The two most recent additions to this list are Revised Strategic Transport Plan (RSTP) for Dhaka and Dhaka Structural Plan done by DTCB and RAJUK respectively. But most of their recommendations or suggestions were not properly implemented or not implemented at all. Hopefully, the latest ones will not share the same fate as few of the public transport projects. We can look forward to sustainable planning and design for future Dhaka in 2018, which will take consideration of climate change impacts and transportation equity, and put emphasis on public transport and an inclusive approach.

      "text": "Bangladesh is among the most precarious and unpredictable countries due to climate risks (Bangladesh Country Study, 2013). It is regularly stricken by annual flooding, or shortage of water during dry seasons; it frequently suffers from cyclones, storm surges, along with changing groundwater aquifer situations. Most of the land mass comprises of floodplains, and up to 30 percent of the country experiences annual flooding during the monsoon season, while 60 percent of the country is susceptible to extreme floods (UNESCAP, 2013). The national growth and poverty reduction policies and strategies need to integrate and expand efficient adaptation measures for a sustainable growth pathway. At the local level, the communities in the vulnerable parts of the country need coping mechanisms to adjust to adverse climate hazards. In addition to the current strategies and policies addressing this urgent issue, innovative, unique, and contextual adaptive measures need to be devised. Among the numerous potential unfavourable outcomes of climate change, the risks posed to the agriculture sector and food industry are among the most disruptive to the health of the citizens, to the economy, and growth in Bangladesh. Agriculture comprises a vital economic sector in Bangladesh, amounting for nearly 20 percent of the GDP and 65 percent of the labour force (World Bank, 2010). The performance of this sector has significant effect on economic growth, trade balance, budgetary position of the government, the intensity and patterns of poverty and malnourishment in the country. Furthermore, agriculture sector is the contingent source of income and employment for most of the poverty-stricken rural residents. The achievement of food self-sufficiency continues to be a key development agenda for the country. The UN Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to \"end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.\" The contemporary challenge for Bangladesh is to improve productivity, especially as demand for food increases with the growing population, and improved incomes, whereas, climate conditions are depleting. On the other hand, overuse, decline and changes in resource quality place further pressures on the scarce land and water resources. Climate change poses crucial impediments to sustainable development for Bangladesh. Sea level rise due to climate change could engulf 17 percent of the land area in Bangladesh by 2050, diminishing cultivatable areas and causing 35 million people to be landless (Ismail, 2016). Food system and food security\n \"Food system\" typically describes all the elements of manufacturing, processing, transporting, selling, storing, and consuming food. To be precise, food system encompasses particular actions, resources, and structure that collectively influence the level of food security within a region or community. There are four elements of food security, namely - food availability (manufacture and delivery), food access (affordability, distribution, and preference), food utilisation (dietary value, social value, and food safety), and food stability (government food security strategies) (World Food Program, 2016; Anik et al. 2012). One of the most damaging effects of diminishing food security is that the worst impact of the cascade of risks is borne by the most vulnerable groups of the population. The poorest segment of the population, who spend the largest share of income on food, are likely to be worst affected by any crisis in food availability.                                                Consequences of climate change on food security Agricultural production is anticipated to be extensively harmed by the rapid expanse of soil salinity that arose from sea levels rising, tidal flooding, and intensifying storm gushes. More than half the area of Bangladesh is barely five meters above sea level, posing ominous threats to its coastal population. According to scientists, sea levels could soar 50 to 130 cm by the year 2100 (Ismail, 2016). Despite the most effective measures, for example, the execution of the 2015 Paris Agreement, sea levels are predicted to surge by 20 to 60 cm by 2100. Food security will take a dark plunge because 30 percent of cultivable land is located in coastal areas. A study by the World Bank has suggested that increased soil salinity will lead to a 15.6 percent wane in the harvest of high-yield rice. It can potentially lead to a shortage of irrigation water for farming during the dry season and depleted source of revenue for farmers (World Bank, 2010). Agriculture in Bangladesh is largely dependent on weather. One cyclone may destroy a significant volume of the seasonal harvest. Cyclone Sidr destroyed nearly 95 percent crops in coastal districts when it crashed into Bangladesh in 2007 (ADB, 2013). Food security will be immensely jeopardised due to frequent and intensified extreme weather incidents resulting from climate change.  Smallholding farmers' sustenance of will suffer detrimental repercussions of the increasingly recurrent aridity due to decreased rainfall. For instance, the drought of 1994-95 led to a decline in the production of grains by about 3.5 million tonnes and led Bangladesh to import a substantial quantity of rice and wheat (Ismail, 2016). Adaptation is key\n The government and citizens of Bangladesh have had to cope with risks of floods, famines, and cyclones for generations. Most recently, Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) 2009 has been implemented, which adds to the country's long list of climate sensitive interventions by modes of contemporary and effective policies, programmes, and projects. The BCCSAP is a 10-year programme (2009-2018) dedicated to building capacity and readiness of the systems to confront the aftermaths of climate change. In order to cope with the threats to food security, efforts have been concentrated on community-level adaptation, agricultural technological extension, surveillance systems installation to track patterns of weather, pests and diseases, and sanitation program implementation (BCCSAP, 2009). Nevertheless, the BCCSAP is yet to update its endeavours for a comprehensive disaster management system to mitigate the problems of food security. Research and development needs to focus on low-cost, high-efficiency, and easily adaptable systems for the rural and uneducated vulnerable farmers. Weather-index based crop insurance (WIBCI) The increasingly unpredictable weather and climate changes jeopardise the already fragile agricultural support and elements of food security in Bangladesh. Substantiating losses on innumerable small landholdings can prove to be extremely costly, hence rendering traditional loss-based insurance unfeasible for remote rural small-holder farmers. A new scientific system has been formulated recently, which could simultaneously introduce a new path for strengthened agricultural production and provide financial safeguard for all farmers. Rural areas that were previously deemed uninsurable are able to reap benefits from new satellite technology and data analysis that help avoid the conventional traps of high transaction costs. In 2013, Asian Development Bank (ADB) inaugurated a USD 2.5 million experimental program to introduce crop insurance to Bangladeshi farmers. The programme - supported by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction with additional finance from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and the Bangladesh government - will design and carry out the trial of WIBCI aimed at the small and destitute farmers who are at the most danger of losing everything to hostile environmental factors. The insurance would enable a farmer to retrieve remuneration from the insurer when calamities occur, for instance when a cyclone or tropical storm in a region reaches certain enormity or when rainfall shifts from a specified range. This form of safeguard would enable farmers to plan and save for long term despite their harvests being capriciously destroyed by tumultuous weather. Scale-up public grain storage\n One of the major constrains in Bangladesh agriculture sector is the lack of grain storage systems. This constraint causes farmers immense difficulties in restoring their livelihoods after a natural disaster. Most farmers do not have access to proper storage facilities and hence, they trade their entire harvest in bulk, leaving none for selling or consumption during disastrous times. Currently, grain storage capacity provided by the Bangladesh Government is 1.62 million tons, provided mainly through conventional granaries and warehouses where the typical shelf-life of grain is less than 1 year (Ministry of Food, 2015). These facilities do not have the amenities to control moisture and temperature properly and is plagued by ineffective grain management, leading to high annual losses as depreciation. The Ministry of Food (MoF) plans to enhance the grain storage capacity to 3 million tonnes by 2021. However, there is still a shortage of large-capacity, privately-owned storage; this is an area that can be turned into a source of investment for private-public partnership. Agricultural technological extension Poverty and food insecurity have recently been aggravated due to the interwoven crises of food, environmental, and financial factors, predominantly in the emerging nations. Over the last 5 years, global food prices have spiked, marginalising many from food consumption, and highlighting the deeper organisational weaknesses in the worldwide food production system. Moreover, in the last 40 years, the tools and agricultural procedures have triggered dilapidation of fertile land, enormous greenhouse gas (GHG) discharges, and widespread water pollution - all the factors that have jeopardised the viability of food production and access (World Economic and Social Survey, 2011). Agriculture technology would have to be radically upgraded to facilitate implementation of land management standards and environmentally sustainable technologies to expand food production. Small scale farmers are at the core of the food security challenge - since almost 90 percent of food consumed in developing countries is locally produced. In Africa and East and South-East Asia, 40 percent of the agricultural workforce has limited access to land, credit, markets, and technology. Bangladesh will face significant challenges in the near future in terms of climate change which will severely hamper the steady economic and industrial growth of the nation. As the country approaches towards its goals of sustainable development and steadily continues its successes in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), finding effective solutions for climate change impact on food security is crucial. It is predicted that floods will be frequent, along with cyclones and droughts; these will harm the economy and the health of the citizens. Therefore, it is essential to revise the Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan to incorporate scientific, evidence-based, and need-based strategies into the system, to build resilience against food security challenges.

The Farakka barrage gates remain open during the monsoon for smooth passage of flows of Ganga river which is a routine and unavoidable activity,\" said a statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs, India, yesterday. READ ALSO: 'India didn't do right by opening Farakka' Even a Bangladesh media report on August 31 has quoted the minister of water resources of Bangladesh saying that \"India did not open the gates of Farakka Barrage suddenly, and there is no possibility of fresh floods in the country. All the gates of Farakka Barrage remain open during the monsoon to release water through the Farakka Barrage-it is nothing new,\" the statement said. READ ASLO: India making floods worse in Bangladesh, says Khaleda \"Further, in accordance with the standing arrangement between India and Bangladesh flood alerts during the monsoon season are communicated for Farakka and Sahibganj sites by field offices of Central Water Commission (India) to their Bangladesh counterparts,\" an official spokesperson said in the statement responding to media reports on the release of water from Farakka Barrage. READ ALSO: Sudden rise in Padma water level \"Being a routine procedure no special intimation or alert regarding opening of gates is issued. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre in Bangladesh has been quoted in the media stating that the latest water rise was natural and not unusual or abnormal in the month of August,\" the spokesperson added in the statement. Earlier on Aug 26, Hydrological Department of Water Development Board in Rajshahi alleged that the Padma river might cross the danger level as India started releasing water through the Farakka Barrage in full scale. Yesterday, BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia also criticised India for allegedly opening sluice gates of the Farakka Barrage, which makes floods in Bangladesh worse."

      "text": "Greater level of coordination and accountability are imperative to address the complex humanitarian crisis of the Rohingya, said Dr Alistair Cook, a disaster management expert, yesterday. He said while Bangladesh has been a champion in managing natural disasters like floods and cyclones, the experience of handling humanitarian emergency created by the massive influx of Rohingyas to Cox's Bazar since August 2017 is new, which has created a lot of new challenges. Addressing the crisis involved a number of organisations -- local and central, civil and military -- as well as many UN agencies and international and local NGOs, Dr Cook said in a public lecture organised by the Centre for Peace and Justice, Brac University at the Brac Centre Inn in the capital. Alistair Cook, coordinator of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Programme and research fellow at the Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, said in the early days of the influx, it was local people and individuals who provided food to the Rohingya, and eventually the government, UN and other actors stepped in. Over the subsequent months, many of the issues including food, water, health, sanitation and infrastructure were managed. However, a lot of challenges remain in terms of coordination, funding, accountability and localisation. \"Effective coordination between different actors in this emergency response is made more challenging with the high turnover rate of humanitarian staff, military officials and government appointees...,\" said Dr Cook. Military officials and camp in-charges appointed by the public administration ministry are deployed to the camps on short rotations of two to three months at a time, he said. \"This discontinuity is part of the 'humanitarian business' and often disrupts trust-building between coordinators. It can, however, be addressed with smooth handovers and the localisation of coordination roles,\" said the expert. It also happens in the cases of international staff, creating problems in coordination, Alistair added. In response to the 2017 Rohingya exodus, FD7 clearances (clearance by NGO Affairs Bureau for work in the Rohingya camps) can take anywhere between 72 hours to two months. \"In some sectors such as education and protection, the lack of FD7 approvals continue to hold back available funds, hinder the deployment of new actors and the expansion of programmes by existing actors.\" Visa application procedures are particularly cumbersome for surge capacity staff, who need to enter Bangladesh urgently, he added. Dr Cook suggested streamlining and revision of approval processes for incoming relief goods, funds, relaxing visas for international staff and developing an approval process for INGOs that augments local capacity. He also recommended mapping local community organisations to enhance localisation with international organisations, building stronger linkages between Refugee Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner and local governments. The expert suggested re-establishing camp committees to govern the Rohingya refugee camps to provide greater democratic and equal gender representation in decision-making. Dr Cook also stressed on integrating humanitarian standards and accountability mechanisms. Prof Mohammad Tamim, pro-vice chancellor of Brac University, and Muhammad Badiuzzaman, research coordinator at the Centre for Peace and Justice at the university, also spoke at the programme, attended by NGO officials, academics and development partners.

Bangladesh Cricket Board President Nazmul Hassan had promised that it would be one of the best opening ceremonies in the history of the BPL. However, there was some mismanagement and the programme had to be delayed by more than an hour. Scheduled to begin at 5:25pm, the ceremony finally started at 6:30pm. After the prime minister inaugurated the event, there was a 10-minute fireworks display to pump up the audience before performers from Bangladesh and India kept spectators on their feet. The likes of James, Reshmi Mirza and 'dRockstar' Shuvo from Bangladesh entertained the crowd, but another local singer who was scheduled to perform, Momtaz, did not appear. It was then popular Indian singer Sonu Nigam who surprised everyone by singing the famous Bengali songs 'Dhono Dhanne Pushpe Bhora' and 'Shuno Ekti Mujibur'. By then, the main attractions of the opening ceremony -- Bollywood superstars Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif -- arrived at the venue and met Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and BCB President Nazmul Hassan. Another Indian singer, Kailash Kher, performed all his famous before Katrina lit up the stage with her dance moves. The anticipation reached its crescendo and Salman stepped onto the huge stage and the fans at home of cricket in Mirpur stood on their feet and enjoyed the Bollywood star performing in front of their eyes. Much like the opening ceremony, fans will also hope to witness exciting cricket on the field in the special edition of the BBPL, which is scheduled to begin from December 11."

Continuous expansion and replantation by growers in the last several years as well as favourable weather, adequate rains and steps aimed at keeping diseases under control helped the country set the new record. \"The good yield was the outcome of some initiatives taken in the last few years,\" said Munir Ahmed, deputy director for planning of the Bangladesh Tea Board. There was also no major natural calamities like floods, said Mohammad Ali, director of the Bangladesh Tea Research Institute, adding that steps taken to keep diseases under control through regular monitoring of the gardens were also a factor. \"Whenever we got information about disease outbreak in any garden, we sent our teams and the producers also followed our guidelines,\" Ahmed said. In 2019, yield grew 17 per cent from a year earlier, when 167 tea gardens across the country produced 82.13 million kilograms of tea, according to state-run Bangladesh Tea Board, which released the data yesterday. The output also comfortably exceeded the annual production target of 80 million kg. Before the latest spell of increased production, annual output had actually declined compared to local demand, prompting the country to turn to imports in 2010. Production started increasing in 2016, when yields hit a record high of 85.05 million kg thanks to favourable weather. However, it fell to 78.95 million kg the following year. The government took a roadmap in 2016 for the development of the tea sector, setting a target to produce 140 million kg by 2025. Some steps like expanding tea production area and replantation were taken as per the roadmap. Garden owners went for investment and took up expansion projects on the back of good prices. For the last one decade, tea growers have been investing a lot to expand production areas in their gardens and replant in old areas replacing years-old plants, said Md Shah Alam, chairman of the Bangladesh Tea Association. \"This has been yielding positive results for the last couple of years,\" he added. read more on beTea production on this soil started in Malnichhara tea garden in Sylhet in 1854."

      "text": "The 15th annual global microinsurance conference was held last week in Bangladesh for the first time with the theme of \"Coping with climate risk\". It was inaugurated by the prime minister who felt that the insurance industry could play a key role in not only managing recovery from natural disasters, but also in tackling climate change in the future. The conference brought over a hundred international participants from around the world from the insurance and reinsurance sectors as well as disaster risk managers.\n\tThe insurance industry globally consists of many hundreds if not thousands of insurance companies who provide insurance to individuals (e.g. life insurance, health insurance, etc.), or households (e.g. fire and flood insurance, etc), or companies (e.g. fire, floods or other damages) and to governments as well. All these insurance companies then reinsure their policies with a relatively small number of very big global reinsurance companies. The business model for the insurance company is based on very sophisticated mathematical or actuarial models that give them probabilities of pay-outs against the premium they charge their customers. They are able to take on the risk on behalf of their clients by spreading the risk across the globe. Thus for example, if there are major floods requiring pay-outs in one part of the world, then they will still collect premiums from other parts of the world where there are no floods.\n\tOne of the predicted consequences of human induced climate change that scientists have been warning about for several decades is that major fires, floods and cyclones will become more frequent around the world and will thus put the reinsurance industry in great risk. This is one of the reasons why the global reinsurance companies have been at the forefront amongst the business community to accept the reality of human induced climate change.\n\tOne innovation in the insurance industry that has been developed with climate change in view is called Index Based Insurance (IBI) or parametric insurance. This is an innovative insurance scheme with a number of pilot schemes in the Caribbean, Africa and Asia, providing some initial interesting results. The difference between IBI and traditional insurance lies in the fact that whereas traditional insurance pays the client after the damage is done and assessed by the insurer, with IBI, the trigger for making payments is a previously agreed threshold of climate event, such as a cyclone reaching a certain speed or a flood above a certain level at a predetermined point. In such a case, once the threshold is reached, everyone who is insured gets paid immediately regardless of how much damage each individual incurs.\n\tThese IBI type pilot schemes are also being tested in Bangladesh and have had some interesting early results.\n\tThe real overlap between dealing with climate change and the role of insurance comes in tackling the issue of loss and damage, which is a very politically sensitive topic in the international negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), where the issue is linked to liability and compensation. At the 19th Conference of Parties (COP19) of the UNFCCC held in Warsaw, Poland in 2013, countries agreed to set up the Warsaw International Mechanism (WIM) for Loss and Damage with a five-year workplan to look at the issue in more detail, including the possible role of innovative finance for loss and damage. The WIM had an Executive Committee who carried out the workplan and will be reporting the results at the upcoming COP25 to be held in Madrid, Spain next month in December.\n\tAt the upcoming COP25, one of the key agenda items will be the review of the WIM and its next steps. While the Executive Committee of the WIM has made good progress on the other items in their workplan, the progress on exploring innovative sources of funding has been confined to insurance by the developed countries.\n\tWhile insurance and reinsurance companies can certainly play a role as described above and their climate risk modelling capacity can be of great use, the most vulnerable communities and countries simply cannot afford to pay the high cost of premiums that would be required in a world affected by climate change. In fact, many insurance companies are already withdrawing from fire and flood insurance in developed countries due to the enhanced frequency and intensity of such events in the last year or two.\n\tHence, Bangladesh along with the Least Developed Countries group as well as other vulnerable countries will be pushing very hard in COP25 for the WIM to be given a much stronger mandate to explore financing loss and damage beyond insurance. It will be a tough fight, but one we must not back down from.

      "text": "Over 16 million people in Bangladesh, Nepal and India are affected by the monsoon floods ravaging parts of South Asia and unfolding a humanitarian crisis, according to International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Floods have already reached record levels in Bangladesh with major rivers like the Jamuna surpassing levels set in 1988--the deadliest flood the country has ever faced, IFRC said in a press statement, quoting authorities. Many areas in Nepal remain cut off after the destructive floods and landslides on August 11 and 12, while over 11 million people in four Indian states across the country's north are affected by recent floods, said the statement issued yesterday. \"This is fast becoming one of the most serious humanitarian crises this region has seen in many years, and urgent action is needed to meet the growing needs of millions of people affected by these devastating floods,\" Martin Faller, IFRC deputy regional director for Asia Pacific, said in the statement. Millions of people across Nepal, Bangladesh and India face severe food shortages and disease caused by polluted flood waters, he said. \"More than one third of Bangladesh and Nepal have been flooded and we fear the humanitarian crisis will get worse in the days and weeks ahead,\" he added. In Bangladesh, floods are likely to get much worse as swollen rivers from India pour into the low-lying and densely populated areas in the north and centre of the country. Over 3.9 million people have been affected by the rising flood waters. In Nepal, villages and communities are stranded without food, water and electricity, read the statement. \"This tragic flooding in Nepal has claimed at least 128 lives and 33 people are still missing,\" said Dev Ratna Dhakhwa, secretary general, Nepal Red Cross Society. India's meteorological department is forecasting more heavy rain for the region in the coming days. Meanwhile, Unicef in Bangladesh has started providing initial support to flood affected people in addition to the ongoing preliminary rapid assessment, said a press release yesterday. Citing the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief, it said an estimated 3.9 million people in 20 districts were affected in the country. As of August 14, 89 people have died. More than 282,400 people are living in 1,392 shelters in affected areas. About 1,000 schools are closed while most rivers are flowing above the danger levels. To accelerate immediate response on education, Unicef allocated $90,000 for repairing schools in Mymensingh, Sylhet and Rangpur divisions. The fund will also be used to support district education authorities ensure temporary education arrangement for children in the shelters. \"Unicef will stand by the flood affected people and continue its emergency support in close collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh,\" Unicef Country Representative Edouard Beigbeder said in the press release."

      "text": "Recent floods have had catastrophic effects on the lives of many people across the country, causing severe insufficiency of resources, along with the increase of water-borne diseases like dengue at an alarming rate. In order to tackle such problems, Team Bonna, a flood relief campaign initiated by young students from different universities of Bangladesh, in collaboration with Ghashful Shishu Forum, addressed the urgency to respond. Together, they have helped close to 125 families by providing them with necessary resources like food, medicines and sanitary napkins. The project, which is the brainchild of Shabnam Sharmin Swarnali from the Institute of Business and Administration (IBA), University of Dhaka (DU), received enormous support from various sources as people stepped in to help each other and create a platform for uniform distribution of resources. Shabnam, despite being a business student, has always been more interested in the development sector and is an enthusiastic social worker who also ran projects for street children under her organisation, Jhilimili. \"The agony of people as shown in the news, struck me deeply and I was determined to do something in order to help them. As a result, I formed Team Bonna and gathered members who would help me in the campaign,\" said Shabnam. Initially, they collected funds from their friends and batch mates and after gathering a handful amount, they approached Alamgir Kabir, the Founder of Ghashful Shishu Forum, to guide them in the field work. \"We knew how to plan the distributions and strategically use our saved funds, but the actual field work is quite a different job and we needed experienced people to carry out the campaign efficiently. That's when we approached Alamgir for help,\" she added. \"We received unexpected help from different sources,\" shared Nowsheen Kamal Smita, an active member from the team. \"Sokhipad, a local sanitary napkin manufacturing organisation donated 1000 pads for this campaign.\" Another woman working at Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Hospital helped them gather medicines for distribution. Students and faculty members from North South University, BRAC University, Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh University of Professionals and DU, came forward to help as well. With funding from various sources, Team Bonna targeted three villages in Dewanganj, Jamalpur, for the campaign. To ensure productive distribution, they carried out a token system collection method after conducting a brief survey at the region. \"It has definitely made us more empathetic and inspired us to continue such campaigns,\" said Arif Rayhan, another member of the group. \"My personal takeaway, is an old man coming over to bless me as he kept his hand over my head with tears of happiness.\" He expressed that the project helped them gain exposure to the harsh lifestyles of people residing in disaster-struck areas. The team members were also determined to make menstrual hygiene a prominent part of the relief campaign, as it is generally overlooked as a necessity. They distributed five pads to each family and tried to familiarise them with the use of sanitary napkins. Witnessing the dangers closely while staying with a host family, they were able to comprehend the dire circumstances better. \"The people, despite losing everything, were immensely hospitable and left no stone unturned in making arrangements for us,\" informed the team. The team further plans to set up a tube well and arrange rehabilitation for the affected people, with an attempt to generate employment. \"This is a long-term project and over time, we shall focus on various other social issues and try to help more people,\" shared Team Bonna.

However, the situation may improve in Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Habiganj and Moulvibazar. The water levels of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna and Ganges-Padma rivers may continue to rise in the next 48 hours, while the Padma river at Bhagyakul point may cross its danger level today, according to the FFWC bulletin. The FFWC monitored river conditions at 93 river stations across the country. Of these, 23 stations showed that water was flowing above danger levels. Meanwhile, rail communication between Gaibandha and other districts remained shut since around 11:00am as the rail track was submerged in Sadar upazila's Trimohoni area. Thousands of people were suffering due to the floods across the country."

      "text": "During her recent visit to India, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met with the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. At this meeting, a number of agreements were signed, several of which concern shared rivers. According to press reports, the meeting reached the agreement to \"operationalise the Dhulian-Gadagari-Rajshahi-Daulatdia-Aricha Route (to and fro) and include Daudkandi-Sonamura Route (to and fro) under Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade.\" It agreed to \"exchange updated data and information and prepare the draft framework on Interim Sharing Agreements for the six rivers, namely Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla, and Dudkumar, and to firm up the draft framework of the interim sharing agreement of Feni River.\" At the meeting, the Indian prime minister assured his Bangladeshi counterpart that \"his government is working with all stakeholders in India for conclusion of the Agreement (on sharing of Teesta River) soonest possible.\" Finally, Bangladesh agreed at the meeting to allow India to withdraw 1.82 cusec water from the Feni River. Clearly, some of these agreements cater to the interests of India. There was hardly any concrete progress toward meeting Bangladesh's concerns regarding shared rivers. This is disappointing when many parts of the country's west adjoining the Padma River are experiencing unprecedented flood, the root cause of which is the Farakka Barrage. India regulates the gates of this barrage in winter in a way that diverts water, causing siltation, encroachment, shallowing, and other harmful morphological changes, which reduce the carrying capacity of the Padma River. As a result, when India opens the floodgates in summer and autumn, severe bank erosion and floods occur. The same is the situation with Teesta and many other shared rivers on which India has built water impounding and diversionary structures. Both India and Bangladesh should realise that unless this basic problem of diversion of flow and destabilisation of Bangladesh's rivers is addressed, it will be difficult to meet India's need for water routes through Bangladesh to its seven northeastern states. Maintaining the proposed river routes will require enormous and perpetual dredging, which at some point will become simply untenable. India's plan to divert Brahmaputra water, under its River Linking Project, will aggravate the situation further. Without this basic realisation, efforts to reach agreements regarding sharing of rivers will not be fruitful. The unpleasant fact is that the 1996 Ganges Treaty has not increased the winter flow of the Padma River and has not stopped the process of destabilisation of this river. Similarly, assurances of a Teesta sharing agreement are not of much value, because Bangladesh has been getting such assurances for many years now, and more importantly because, by the time any such agreement may be reached, there will be hardly any flow left of the Teesta River beyond the Gajoldoba Barrage in winter. Against this backdrop, it is ironic that the only concrete river-related outcome of the Hasina-Modi meeting was Bangladesh's agreement to allow India to withdraw part of the Feni River flow. The quantity is small, but the symbolism is large. It shows that, as far as shared rivers are concerned, India gets what it wants while Bangladesh keeps on pleading. It is indeed unfortunate that Bangladesh fails to raise the demand for the removal of diversionary structures built by India, when there is an increasing recognition that the Farakka Barrage has failed to achieve its stated goal of desilting the Kolkata port and has instead become a problem even for India now, causing upstream flooding in the Indian state of Bihar. As a result, there is a growing demand inside India for demolition of the Farakka Barrage. Important figures of the Indian polity--such as Nitish Kumar, the ex-chief minister of Bihar, Rajendra Singh, the \"waterman of India\", and many others--have been urging for demolition of Farakka Barrage for quite some time now. On July 17, 2016, Mr Kumar raised his demand formally at the 11th Interstate Council Meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and attended by Union (Central) ministers and the chief ministers of the states. There is a saying that \"one has to cry one's own cry!\" It is not surprising that Bangladesh is not getting the necessary hearing from India when it hesitates even to cry its own cry. It is, therefore, high time for Bangladesh to insist on its rights on the shared rivers. It should sign the 1997 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses, and use its Articles 7, 20, 21, and 23 to urge India not to cause \"significant harm\" to Bangladesh through its impounding and diversionary structures, and to \"protect and preserve (Bangladesh's) ecosystem\" and its \"marine environment,\" including the Sundarbans, by restoring full natural flow of the shared rivers. Given the experience of Farakka, the idea of constructing a Ganges-Padma Barrage of the usual type inside Bangladesh with India's help does not make much sense. Such a barrage will provide justification for the Farakka Barrage and cause similar downstream and upstream harms as Farakka has already caused. The governments of both Bangladesh and India should, therefore, seriously consider the \"transit in exchange for rivers\" formula that Bangladesh Environment Network (BEN) put forward in 2011. Under this formula, India will restore natural flows of Bangladesh's rivers by removing impounding and diversionary structures, while Bangladesh will provide India transit and transshipment facilities to its northeastern states, subject to common international practices. Unfortunately, governments of Bangladesh have so far been meeting India's demands regarding transit and transshipment without getting much in the way of rivers in return. Such an unequal exchange cannot be sustainable in the long run. It may be hoped that the leaders of both Bangladesh and India will see the merit of the \"transit in exchange for rivers\" formula as a win-win solution for their respective needs. The goodwill that such a solution will create can then spill over into other areas of cooperation between the two countries.

      "text": "The German NETZ and Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS) have undertaken a participatory and multi-disciplinary research to understand and document the climate change trends in the region and the associated impacts of climate change on livelihoods and food security of the poor and indigenous communities. Long term trends and impacts of climate change \n The northwestern region is suffering from both climate variability (temperature rise, change in precipitation and changes in seasonal patterns) as well as climatic extremes including frequent flood and river bank erosion, heat stress and drought, erratic rainfall, thunderstorm, cold wave and fog. The study conducted a long-term trend analysis of climate data and has suggested that the average rise of temperature in the northwestern region would be 1.3degC and 2.6degC for the years 2030 and 2070, respectively. Winter precipitation is projected to decrease at a higher rate in 2030, while in 2075 there would not be any appreciable rainfall in winter. On the other hand, monsoon precipitation would increase at a rate of 12 percent and 27 percent for the two projection years, respectively. This means there would be severe drought in summer and more devastating floods in monsoon in the region. Recent floods in quick succession make the onset of climate induced shocks visible. The increasing trends of floods and river bank erosion in northern Bangladesh are affecting agriculture, food security and livelihood of the millions living in the region. The participatory research has identified several kinds of climate change stresses and natural disasters in the region. The community people are already experiencing increasing drought and heat stresses, flood and river bank erosion, drawdown of under-ground water, cold wave and fog, Nor'wester and thunderstorm and pest attack. The participants in the Rajshahi region have identified drought and heat stress as the most harmful effects of climate change followed by falling ground water levels and cold waves.  The participants in Dinajpur also identified drought, heat stress and declining ground water levels as major climate disasters, along with cold wave, Nor'wester and flood; while the participants in Rangpur, Kurigram and Gaibandha have identified flood and erosion as the most devastating natural disasters, which have been intensified by climate change in the recent years. Climate change, livelihood and our growing problems\n Temperature rise, drought, frequent floods and river bank erosion are affecting resources, infrastructures and livelihoods of the people every year. Subsistence agriculture, share cropping, home garden and vegetable growing were identified as the most affected and vulnerable sectors, which are critically important for nutrition and income of the poor, indigenous communities and women. Crop cultivation, vegetable and home gardening have been highly affected by drought in Rajshahi and Dinajpur. Frequent floods and river erosion have a more significant impact on key livelihood sectors including agriculture, livestock, poultry, food security, water, sanitation and health in the Rangpur region, compared to Rajshahi and Dinajpur. Flood also affects the livelihoods of the poor and the regional infrastructures including roads and communication systems, which again limit the livelihood activities of the poor, women and marginalised people. The farmers have informed that climate hazards are causing huge loss and damage to agriculture. The farmers in Rajshahi and Dinajpur, cannot plant crops in time due to drought conditions and low soil moisture in dry season and have to wait for rain for months. In the villages studied under the survey, the growth and yield of wheat, maize, vegetable and fruits have been affected by drought and low rainfall. Pest attack has been reported as common in the region. Flood damaged standing crops including paddy and vegetables in the charland and flood plains of Rangpur and Dinajpur. The community also informed that wage earning is another problem in the region.  The working potential of the poor is reduced due to heat stress, severe cold and fog. The poor do not get much work in charland in Rangpur region and the male members of the poor families have to migrate to the cities and other districts to earn wages. The women, children and the elderly suffer the most due to food and social insecurity in charland during and after flood.  These people desperately need social safety net and disaster risk reduction support from the government and development partners.

It also added that the country's central part was on the flood's path.  At least five people, including two children, have died and another has gone missing in flood-related incidents in Dinajpur, rising the death toll to 20 in the last three days across the country.  Sazzad Hossain, executive engineer of the FFWC, said 18 rivers were flowing above danger level, and water in those rivers would continue to rise in the next three days. In 1988, water level of the Jamuna rose to 20.62 metres, and it crossed the level last year and rose to 20.71 metres. But yesterday afternoon, its water level went up and stood at 20.78 metres. \"Water level has crossed danger level at Goalanda point [of the Padma], and it means that the country' central part is going to be affected ... ,\" Sazzad added. The country witnessed four severe floods in the last four decades. Of them, the flood of 1998 was the worst when two-thirds of the county remained submerged for nearly three months. Meanwhile, Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, disaster management and relief minister, said the flood already hit 20 districts, and nine more districts, including low-lying areas of Dhaka, could be affected soon.    With upstream countries like China, India, Nepal and Bhutan suffering severe floods, the government is preparing for a really bad situation. \"We are carefully monitoring the situation in those countries because water will naturally flow downstream to us,\" he said. The minister also said all holidays of officials and employees concerned in 20 affected districts were cancelled.  \"All indicators suggest that the flood is likely to be terrible this time,\" leading water expert Prof Ainun Nishat told The Daily Star, citing a forecast of a European research organisation. \"They forecast rain, and as per their forecast, the flood situation could be worst in the last four decades,\" he said.   Of 90 flood situation monitoring stations, water was flowing above danger level at 25 yesterday, while water level was increasing at 65 stations. inundated Lalmonirhat-Phulbari road in Lalmonirhat Sadar's Kulaghat area and a flooded railway line in Kaugaon area of Dinajpur Sadar. Several lakh people have been hit hard as the flood situation in the country has worsened. The photos were taken yesterday. Photo: Sheikh Nasir/ S Dilip Roy/Kongkon Karmaker \n The FFWC also said water level of the Jamuna (Brahmaputra in India) was increasing 50cm a day and water level of the Padma 15cm a day.  Rail communications in Dinajpur, Lalmonirhat and Kurigram had remained suspended since Sunday as railway lines were damaged at several points, a top railway official said. The rail routes are: Parbatipur-Dinajpur-Panchagarh, Lalmonirhat-Burimari and Teesta junction in Lalmonirhat to Ramna Bazar in Kurigram's Chilmari, he said. And a flooded railway line in Kaugaon area of Dinajpur Sadar. Several lakh people have been hit hard as the flood situation in the country's northern and northeastern regions has worsened. The photos were taken yesterday. Photo: Sheikh Nasir/ S Dilip Roy/Kongkon Karmaker \n As the floodwater is flowing down to the country's central part, nearly 100 metres of a dam in Manikganj was washed away on Monday. According to reports from our correspondents in the northern districts, a vast area has been inundated in the region as flood-protection embankments were breached in Saidpur of Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Dinajpur, Kurigram, Rajshahi and Badarganj of Rangpur.   Around 1,000 educational institutions in Lalmonirhat, Panchagarh, Nilphamari, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Bogra, Jamalpur, Tangail, Sunamganj and Sylhet have been closed as those have been either flooded or flood-hit people have taken shelter there.  Akkas Ali, 32, of Jagomaner Char village in Kurigram Sadar upazila, said water of the Dharla river partially submerged their village a week ago. His house and all his belongings were washed away. Another flood victim, Shahima Begum, 40, of Char Madhobrum in the same upazila, said, \"I along with my family have been living in the open beside Kurigram-Bhurungamari road for the last two days as my house has been inundated.\" However, the flood situation started to improve in Nilphamari and Thakurgaon.

      "text": "Small farmers of flood-hit districts, who raised cattle for the Eid-ul-Azha markets, have started selling off their animals at low prices as they are struggling to feed them because of food shortage in the affected districts. The cattle were quickly losing weight and becoming weak for the lack of feed and a place to sleep as most land was inundated, much to the worry of these farmers. Anisur Rahman, a farmer from Purba Kazlapara village of Jamalpur, reared two oxen for the last six months, expecting to a good price before this Eid, but the flood waters washed away his hopes. \"My cowshed is submerged in knee-deep water,\" said Anisur. Yet he had to keep his cows there for two weeks and he also could not feed them properly. \"Finding no other way, I sold them off for Tk 80,000 each. If I had held on to them till Eid, I could have sold them for more than Tk 100,000 each,\" he said. According to the Department of Livestock Services (DLS), about 684 tonnes of granular food, 9,018 tonnes of paddy straws and 27,000 tonnes of grass were destroyed in flood that started in the first week of July. The water began receding later during the month. In addition, about eight cows, 10 goats, 21,000 chickens and 251 ducks died. The total damage has been estimated to be worth Tk 20.54 crore. Mahbubur Rahman, director (production) at DLS, said, \"The small farmers in the flood-hit areas were affected the most as they could not feed their cattle due to a crisis of dry food.\" However, the crisis will be overcome and there will be no shortage of cattle for slaughter during the Eid on August 12, according to DLS officials. \"There are enough cattle ready for slaughter,\" said Rahman. Afaz Sheikh of Santosh village in Shahjadpur upazila in Sirajganj incurred a loss of Tk 10,000 as he sold off his cow. \"My cow became lean as I could not feed it.\" Apart from dry feed, grass is a good source of nutrients for cattle but grass in the grazing fields and low lands have all been damaged in flood waters. In Sirajganj, about 134 acres of low land, where Napier grass is cultivated, was completely inundated. DLS officials said grass worth about Tk 75 lakh has been damaged in the affected areas. Prices of dry food has risen, in response to the shortage. The price of a 50kg sack of chaff and silage shot up by Tk 150-Tk 200 to Tk 1,380 and Tk 1,750 in Sirajganj and Pabna, reports our local correspondent. The price of paddy straw, another popular dry feed for cattle, also doubled to Tk 400 a maund. \"Although big farmers have managed to buy feed, the marginal farmers are facing a crisis,\" said Aktaruzzaman Bhuiyan, deputy livestock officer of Sirajganj. Many farmers took shelter at nearby embankments with their cattle, he said. They procured about 3 tonnes of dry feed and distributed among the farmers in Sirajganj, he added. Dr ABM Khaleduzzaman, assistant director (farm) of DLS, said meeting the feed crisis is now the main challenge. The government has taken an initiative to distribute about Tk 1 lakh to Tk 1.5 lakh each to worst-affected marginal farmers in 160 flood-hit upazilas, he said. Besides, DLS officials collected 100 tonnes of granular cattle feed, about 40 tonnes of which will be distributed in the worst-hit areas of the northern districts. According to DLS, there are 45 lakh cows and buffaloes, 72 lakh goats and sheep and 6,536 other cattle ready for slaughter this upcoming Eid. Last year, there were 1.15 crore cattle before Eid and about 1.05 crore of those were slaughtered. \"We usually add five lakh cattle to the number of cattle slaughtered the previous year to estimate the demand. So, the demand for cattle this year is 1.10 crore,\" said Khaleduzzaman, adding that there is surplus in the number of cattle.

Australia's tropical north typically experiences heavy rains during the monsoon season, but the recent downpour has seen some areas get a year's worth of rainfall in a week. The authorities were forced to open floodgates of a major dam late Sunday, unleashing what they called \"dangerous and high velocity flows.\" In hard-hit Townsville, cars were mostly submerged, with picket fences barely poking through waist-deep flood waters. \"We've never seen so much water in our lives,\" said local radio journalist Gabi Elgood. \"You think there can't possibly be any more to come but the rain just doesn't stop.\" Desperate residents had to contend not only with flash flooding, landslides and power blackouts, but also several saltwater crocodile sightings in residential roads and cul-de-sacs. Queensland Police issued a blunt warning for people to stay out of floodwaters."

They feared further crop loss in flash floods, a calamity the region suffers frequently during this time of the year. The floods are triggered by heavy rains and onrush of water from the hills. In 2017, flash floods wreaked havoc on the country's haors. They submerged the wetland of Sylhet, Sunamganj, Habiganj, Netrokona, Kishoreganj, Brahmanbaria and Moulvibazar. Agriculture officials said crops worth Tk 95 crore were damaged in Moulvibazar alone.  The memory is still fresh in the farmers' mind in Hakaluki, the country's largest wetland situated in five upazilas of Moulvibazar and Sylhet. Anisur Rahman, an official from the Met office in Sreemangal, said it had been raining in Moulvibazar over the last one week. The agriculture department in the district said most of the boro paddies cultivated this year on 53,162 hectares of land in the district were in Hakaluki. During a visit of the haor in Kulaura upazila a few days ago, this correspondent saw fields damaged by hailstorm and rain. Farmers were cutting unripe paddies. Farmer Shipon Mia of Kadipur village in the upazila said he had cultivated Boro on four bighas of land. \"Around 15 percent of the crops have been damaged in the last few days. I harvested the paddy to avoid further loss.\" Fazlu Mia, a marginal farmer in the haor's Boromchal area, said they were experiencing rain and hailstorm from March 31. \"The sky is full of clouds. It scares us,\" he said. Monir Mia, a farmer in Bhuai area of Juri upazila, said, \"I cultivated boro on two bighas of land, but sudden hailstorm destroyed one portion.\" In such a situation, many of the farmers were in doubt whether they would be able to pay back the loans they had taken for cultivating the paddy. \"I see only bleak days ahead,\" said one of them, Ibrahim Mia of Muktajipur village in Kulaura upazila. Joglul Haider, agriculture officer in Kulaura upazila office, said many farmers were cutting standing crops in fear of losses. Contacted, Shahjahan Chowdhury, deputy director of the agriculture extension department in Moulvibazar, said although some boro crops were damaged, the quantity was not huge. He said he ordered to assess the crop loss incurred in the district."

      "text": "On January 27, 1922, in the wake of Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement and the Khilafat movement, hundreds of thousands of peasants, artisans and traders from the entire North and North-West Bengal gathered at a place called Salanga, now located in Bangladesh's Sirajganj district. Led by a firebrand, young leader named Abdur Rashid (later known as Maolana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish), they were protesting against oppression of the local zamindars and trade monopoly of British goods in the local market. Their peaceful movement turned into a bloodbath when British-Indian police emptied their rifles at the unarmed protesters. According to local people of Salanga and a rarely found account of Abdur Rashid titled 'Shadhinota Shangramer Rakta Shiri Salanga (Salanga: The Blood Stained-Step to the Struggle for Independence), more than 4,000 Bengalis were slaughtered on that day. Many of their bodies were thrown into the river; the rest were buried in mass graves. However, the exact number of casualties could not be corroborated as there is hardly any written historical record of this incident. Although it happened only three years after the Jalianwala Bagh massacre of 1919, this tragic part of our history is about to be forgotten and survives only in local legends due to lack of research and preservation efforts.      Almost a century ago, in 1922, Salanga, now one of the least developed parts of Sirajganj district, was one of the biggest centres of trade and commerce in East Bengal. Its river port at the mouth of Karatoa river and the market place adjacent to the port was the regional hub of cattle and agricultural produce trade. On every Monday and Friday, countless farmers, traders and artisans used to gather at Salanga to market their produce. However, burdened with high taxes by the local zamindars and due to overwhelming dominance of British goods in the local market, the local growers made little profit. According to village elders of Salanga, the Hindu zamindars had imposed special tax on cattle trade, which is still one of the most significant sources of income for Salanga farmers. Evasion of this tax used was punished with eviction from the village, ostracisation and merciless beating. On the other hand, the colonial administration used to force locals to purchase clothes and salt manufactured by the British companies at higher price although Sirajganj is famous for weaving industry from time immemorial. In a Muslim majority area, the administration had installed two liquor shops in the market, which was brewing further discontent among the conservative local populace. In his above-mentioned account, Maulana Tarkabagish also left written records of such colonial oppressions and the massacre that happened in Salanga on January 27, 1922. According his description, \"On January 27, I was at the Congress office in Salanga bazaar and speaking to the crowd about non-cooperation and Khilafat movement. A group of 40 armed police led by the district magistrate of Sirajganj R N Das and SDO of Sirajganj Sunil Kumar Sinha arrived and arrested me. They dragged me to a corner of the bazaar and started to beat me with rifle butts and charged bayonet on my body. At one point, I almost lost consciousness. Many of my followers thought I was killed and the people, many of whom venerated my family as a Pir family, became extremely agitated. While the police were carrying my unconscious body, someone hit the police superintendent with bamboo stick. His head started to bleed. He asked me angrily, 'Is this your non-violence?' By that time, hundreds of thousands of people had surrounded the police from three sides to rescue me. Had I been released at that time, I could have controlled the situation. Nevertheless, the police took position in front of the liquor shops, aimed at the approaching crowd and opened fire. 39 of them emptied their rifles at the crowd, killing almost 4,500 people. Many of them died in stampede. However, one of the cops did not fire. When asked why, he replied, \"The people were in a cattle market. Had I fired, my bullet could have killed cows. They are sacred animals. They are my mothers.\"    This account and other local legends are the lone sources to know about this tragic incident. At Salanga, we met Kalipada Kundu, an octogenarian school teacher, who is the only living person who had interviewed Abdur Rashid about the massacre. He runs a library named \"Maulana Tarkabagish Memorial Library\" in an effort to preserve the accounts left by Maulana Tarkabagish and other witnesses of the incident. He says, \"We could not know how many Bengalis were actually killed on that day. However, in the 1960s I talked to witnesses who told me that they had seen hundreds of dead bodies taken to a field of government bungalow (built later in 1940) on the other side of the river by ox carts. From that field, they were later transferred to Rahmatganj graveyard and buried in a mass grave. Many of the dead bodies were thrown into the river on the way.\" Almost a hundred year later, we could not find any families in Salanga whose forefathers were killed or injured in that incident. \"Salanga has always been prone to floods and river erosion. Due to these calamities, many of the families have shifted to other areas. Since the incident happened on a market day, many of the victims were from different places who had come to trade in the market. Probably their dead bodies were buried in mass graves as nobody could come to claim their bodies. However, I had also seen many people who lost their limbs and eyes during the massacre. Some of them used to beg in the bazaar.\" Abdur Rashid went on to spend six months in prison and dropped out from formal education. After attending different madrasas all over India, he devoted his life to anti-colonial movement and to restoring the rights of the Bengali peasants. During the Pakistan period, he supported the language movement and retired from Pakistan Muslim League in protest of the killing of the language martyrs. He was also an inspirational leader of Bangladesh's liberation war of 1971. He played an important role as one of the leaders of the alliance in the movement against the military rule of Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish died on August 20, 1986 in Dhaka. Despite his eventful political career, he left very few written records and never published any memoirs containing substantial information about the Salanga massacre, which produced some of the first martyrs of Bangladesh's anti-colonial independence movement. We must help rescue this forgotten but heroic part of our history from sinking into total oblivion.

      "text": "Torrential rain and gale force winds lashed Australia's biggest city Sydney today causing commuter chaos, flooding streets, railway stations and homes, grounding flights and leaving hundreds of people without electricity. Police called on Sydney motorists to stay off the roads due to the \"horrendous weather\". One person was killed in a car crash during the storm and two police officers seriously injured when a tree fell on them as they assisted a stranded motorist. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said within just a few hours Sydney received more than 100mm of rain, a level that the country's most populous city would normally receive throughout the whole of November. Although the rains offered a welcomed respite to farmers who have suffered through a sustained drought in recent months, the weather caused major disruptions to Sydney's infrastructure. Sydney Airport, the country's busiest, said it cancelled at least 20 flights after closing two of its three runways, while the majority of flights that continued suffered delays. \"The storm is pretty intense in and around the airport,\" Cait Kyann, a spokeswoman from Sydney Airport, told Reuters. \"We are operating from a single runway so that means that there are delays and likely some flights will be cancelled.\" Ausgrid, the nation's biggest electricity network, said the storm had left 8,100 customers without power around Sydney and the Central Coast area to its north. There was chaos on Sydney's roads as the storm struck only hours before the city's main morning peak hour, transforming some streets in fast flowing rivers and parks into lakes. Several stranded motorists were plucked from rising floodwaters. \"We are asking all road users to reconsider the need to be on the roads throughout what will be a severe rain event today,\" said New South Wales state Assistant Police Commissioner Corboy. The BOM said the storms would last through most of the day before easing, with gale force winds whipping up four metre (12 feet) waves which are expected to pound Sydney's beaches. In stark contrast in Australia's northern state of Queensland soaring temperatures near 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and strong winds exacerbated major bushfires. Firefighters have been battling for nearly a week to contain more than 80 fires across Queensland. \"We are expecting a very bad day,\" Craig Crawford, fire and emergency services minister for the Queensland state government told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. \"These are the kind of days where people could lose their lives.\""

From many such rivers, water is pumped out during the lean season, either to cultivate paddy, onions, or oil seeds on the bed of the rivers. Water is also pumped to irrigate nearby plots, drying up the rivers. This has been done all over the country. Although we get some paddy out of the process, the natural production of freshwater fish is totally destroyed. These rivers remain dry till April and May - the breeding period of fish. Therefore, fish migration/spawning is obstructed. The same happens to the beels and jheels. Many wetlands in Tangail, Sirajganj, Pabna, Faridpur, and Gopalganj, once rich habitats of aquatic life, are now devoid of fish. Untreated liquid industrial effluents are being discharged into rivers indiscriminately, especially around urban areas, leaving these rivers biologically dead as the level of dissolved oxygen -- a must for the survival of fish and other aquatic animals -- becomes very low. Impact of encroachment and drying up of riversEncroachment has become a serious issue. All across the country, rivers have been converted into a series of ponds through the construction of cross-bunds. Thus, many free-flowing rivers have now become a series of stagnant water bodies.  Rivers follow some rules of nature. If the width of a river is reduced by encroachment, it may have an impact on the discharge it normally carries; natural volume of flow may reduce; as a response, the depth of the river lessens, thus permanently shrinking the river in terms of size and flow volume. If the river is a part of a network of streams, the flow will be diverted to some other channel. If the river is unconnected to any network, then floods will be generated in case of slightly high rainfall. Many of our flood control projects have contributed to the dying of rivers and wetlands. The connectivity between the rivers, wetlands and floodplains has been jeopardised because of improper functioning of the sluices or regulators. We need these appurtenant structures for effective flood management. They should be designed and operated in such a way that the wetlands remain connected to river networks and the ecosystem remains unharmed.  When we talk about rivers, we always think about mega-rivers like the Brahmaputra or the Padma which have huge flows. Large rivers are left undisturbed by locals, as the height through which water is to be pumped is rather high. Local people use 'low lift pumps', a technology that is readily available, that leads to the drying up of very small rivers. Industrial pollution and the quality of waterMost of our industries do not have Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) though operation of such ETPs has been made mandatory by law. If these ETPs are properly installed and operated, industrial pollution could be contained. But who is going to stop the state which is itself a big polluter? Unlike every major city in the world, the storm sewer line and the domestic sewer line are all connected in Dhaka. Therefore, I would say that WASA is the major polluter of Buriganga.  When it flows naturally, every river would have dissolved oxygen that helps fish and other aquatic animals to survive. If the quantum of dissolved oxygen goes lower than 4 ppt, aquatic life cannot survive. In Buriganga, the dissolved oxygen level comes down to as low as zero in the dry season and therefore, no fish can survive at that time of the year. When the level of pollution gets very high in Buriganga and Shitalakhya, the treatment of water (in order to turn it into drinking water) becomes very difficult.  Can Buriganga be cleaned?I am often asked if the water quality of Buriganga can be restored. My answer is always in the affirmative. One hundred years ago, the condition of River Tames or the Clyde or the Rhine was as bad as the condition of the Buriganga today. But through proper enforcement of the law, it was possible to clean the effluents and bring the rivers to normal condition. We have the necessary laws, rules and regulations. We have the responsibility for the implementation of such laws, rules and regulations. If the government so desires, the Buriganga may be cleaned up in ten years. This time may be allowed to make arrangements for all remedial measures. Only dredging is not the solutionSimply dredging does not bear a long-term or sustainable solution. We must remember that a river does not carry only water; it also carries sediments. And there is an intricate relationship among discharge, sediment load and channel geometry as well as channel pattern. If a river carries a huge amount of sediment, dredging will not provide a durable solution, as incoming sediment in the following monsoons will fill up the dredged channel.  Apparently, the government plans to take up some major projects for dredging big rivers like the Jamuna. Over the last few years, huge funds have been spent on dredging the Jamuna near Sirajganj. We should first evaluate the success of such projects before embarking on any new major works.  However, if we go for properly planned and designed 'river management' projects that include bank revetment, 'river training infrastructures' and plans to dredge in appropriate reaches, then we may find the right solutions. Again, this exercise should be carried out in a phased manner so as to enable the 'observe and learn' approach. Dredging of small rivers, however, poses much less of a challenge. Laws for river protectionArticle 18(A) of our Constitution clearly states: \"The State shall endeavour to protect and improve the environment and to preserve and safeguard the natural resources, bio-diversity, wetlands, forests and wild life for the present and future citizens.\" The State has enacted a number of laws including Bangladesh Water Act 2013, National River Protection Commission Act, 2013, and The Environment Conservation Act, 1995 (upgraded in 2010) which have provisions for the protection of the environment, and control and mitigation of environmental pollution. In 1997, the State had produced the rules and regulations for environment conservation and promulgated the Environmental Quality Standard. Bangladesh is among the few countries that have a separate court on environment. So if a river is polluted or encroached upon, those affected by it should be able go to court seeking remedial measures. However, I am not sure if the legal procedures are fully operational.  Political commitment is a must We have the appropriate constitutional provisions and necessary laws for taking action against encroachers and polluters. I believe that it is possible to do so if the administration is fully committed to save our rivers. The governments of India and China are cleaning up their rivers; they are using modern technology such as Remote Sensing and Satellite Monitoring to monitor the conditions of the rivers. Developed countries are using proper monitoring mechanisms of maintaining the acceptable level of river water quality. I believe that we have the capacity to restore our rivers.  \"Save Buriganga, Save Dhaka\"Raising public awareness is of utmost importance. When The Daily Star raised the slogan, \"Save Buriganga, Save Dhaka,\" we suggested that it be changed to \"Save Rivers, Save Bangladesh.\" This was before the insertion of Article 18(A) in our Constitution. I believe that if we raise our voice for the right cause and tackle problems with technically sustainable solutions, policymakers will eventually respond."

      "text": "WE'RE running out of time on climate change. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) report released in October 2018, revealed that there are only a dozen years left for global warming to be kept to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Reaching temperatures beyond that, even half a degree higher, will significantly worsen the risks of droughts, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people. Of course, we are already feeling these symptoms as the five hottest years on record, globally, all took place within the current decade. According to scientists at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2016 was the hottest, 2015 the second hottest, and 2017 the third hottest--2018 is currently on track to be the fourth hottest. Urgent changes are needed in order to keep global temperatures down.  However, the existing climate regulatory regime, built upon 27 years of negotiations, has already proven woefully inadequate to help the world reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are exacerbating climate change, and to remedy their consequences.   One of the key reasons behind such failure is that the existing, legally binding climate change agreements are designed without a mechanism of enforcement. Being non-punitive, non-adversarial and flexible in nature, existing legal mechanisms are failing to cope with the scale of the global issue and its wide-ranging impact on individuals, leaving climate change justice issues unaddressed.  In this context, there is a growing demand for the establishment of an international court which can address significant gaps in the current international environmental legal order. That sounds like a great idea! Though a number of challenges are rooted there. First, if the existing climate regime is non-punitive, non-adversarial and flexible in nature, how can we enforce it in an international court? Among other things, it involves challenges in identifying the \"actionable rights\" that will determine which climate change transgressions lie within the scope of the court, establishing appropriate standards for proving a legally cognisable causal link between greenhouse emissions and the relief sought, and developing methods for awarding remedies. Obstacles also lie with global cooperation, different priorities for the developed and the developing countries, the exercise of absolute sovereign power, anarchic nature of the world order, and thus the perceived unenforceability of international law.   Nevertheless, these obstacles should not be viewed as insoluble. We should expand our understanding of what is possible by reimagining the tools of international law. Establishing a new specialist International Court can be an effective way forward, depending on how we can design it.   First, the international court should not be structured in a traditional form where prosecutors will look to persuade a judge to punish polluters. That would be more in line with a criminal court and will discourage states to be party to this process. The international court should be a forum with a goal to elevate behaviours/actions in line with mutually agreed standards, rather than to punish.  Second, the judge of the court must be sufficiently specialised so that the judiciary is able to weigh competing interpretations of complex scientific evidence against salient geopolitical, and international economic and social development priorities.  Third, both state and non-state actors should have standing (be able to initiate cases) before the court.   Fourth, states should be bound by the decisions of the court (what is called compulsory jurisdiction). States that allow environmental degradation in contravention of mutually agreed international standards should be held accountable.  Fifth, the court should rely on clear, precise, and enforceable language, to be found in a new era of international environmental laws. Aspirational treaty language is insufficient to protect the environment.  So the overall purpose of the international court on the matter related to environment would be: to build trust among the international community; to clarify legal obligations; to harmonise and complement existing climate regulatory regimes; to provide access to justice to a broader range of actors; and to create workable solutions for enforcement of international standard.  However, on the matter of \"compulsory jurisdiction\" of the court, imagining an international court holding states accountable might seem overly optimistic, particularly when only 66 countries agree to the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). But then again, if we look to the effectiveness of the Dispute Settlement Body at the World Trade Organization, and arbitration under the international investment regime, we can clearly learn the lesson that compulsory jurisdiction is possible when the costs of non-compliance are deemed to be sufficiently high. The European Court of Human Rights, similarly, has demonstrated that compulsory jurisdiction can work for equitable public interest. Moreover, in the European Court of Human Rights, vast majority of cases are initiated by non-state actors which empowered non-state actors in enforcing global standards to change the politics of transnational adjudication.   An international court for the environment could be a better forum to overcome climate inaction, global cooperation, economic conflicts, and enforcement problems if we can construct it adequately with the aim to vigorously enforce mutually agreed obligations and standards. However, establishing an international court will require more support. Therefore, let's start considering how to turn it into a reality in the interest of future generations.

      "text": "At least 141 people (at the time of writing), including children and four army personnel, were killed in separate series of landslides triggered by heavy rains in Rangamati, Bandarban, and Chittagong on June 13, 2017. The losses have been monumental, and officials fear that the death toll may rise even further in the worst landslide since 2007, when a landslide resulted in the death of around 130 people and affected 1.5 million people in the region.  Landslide has always been a geological hazard in Bangladesh, especially in the southeastern part of the country. Southwest monsoon flows over the Bay of Bengal, heading towards northeast India and Bangladesh, picking up more moisture from the Bay from June through September. The winds arrive at the Eastern Himalayas with large amounts of rain. Bangladesh and certain regions of India frequently experience heavy rains during this season, and most landslides occur after heavy rainfall. In recent times, landslides have increased both in frequency and intensity, causing widespread loss and damage to life, infrastructure, assets and property, and posing serious challenges to the existing development process. This increase has been prompted by a blend of several elements (morphometric, climatic and anthropogenic) that cause slope instability, most of which is human-induced.  In 2015, heavy floods and landslides during the last week of June inundated the districts of Chittagong, Bandarban and Cox's Bazar. A second series of heavy rain from July 22-27 caused new floods, landslides and further displacements. The side-effects, so to speak, of Cyclone Komen, were again heavy rainfall, causing additional landslides and flooding which extended to all the coastal regions.  It is disheartening that despite the occurrence of such disasters in the past, we have learnt little from our experiences. Thus, thanks to mismanagement and lack of preparedness, landslides of such magnitude continue to strike our hills.   The Chittagong region is especially vulnerable due to various aspects, ranging from physical, social, political and environmental factors. It goes without saying that comprehensive, well-coordinated steps by the government are needed for sustainable landslide hazard management. How, one might ask, can we prevent a natural disaster of such scale? Actually, there are several ways. First of all, by controlling the grabbing of state-owned land, such occurrences can definitely be limited. Moreover, understanding the rainfall pattern and its exact relationship with landslide in the region could also help us be prepared. Detailed land use planning of the vulnerable areas, a landslide database, landslide mapping and geophysical analysis of the region are essential to minimise landslides and their impacts in the region.  For locals living in the hills, it is imperative that they are taught how to secure themselves against landslides. They could also be taught how to control landslides through proper drainage, protection, soil conservation, and watershed management.  Early warning systems need to be strengthened, with active participation of community leaders. Proper communication amidst the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, community based organisations, the civil defence wing and local government authorities is needed to receive regular data relevant to the area as soon as the monsoon season sets. Volunteers or representatives of the vulnerable communities could also be involved to assist in the alertness and preparedness process. Moreover, existing cross departmental coordination and cooperation on landslide management should be reviewed and strengthened with necessary resources.  In order to ensure sustainable landslide management, contingency planning at different levels for emergency response should be developed and updated at least once a year. The focus of these plans should be on landslide prone areas and their vulnerability status, and the availability of resources and capacity, apart from other requisite elements that feature in such a plan.  Capacity building courses on landslide hazard management is needed after a proper gap analysis. Moreover, the constant planning process should include volunteers, managers, workers, government officials, local government representatives, relevant military authorities and media of the vulnerable districts. Half of the participants in the process should be women, as they should also be trained on how to protect their homes, families and communities against such natural disasters. Landslide mitigation refers to lessening the aftereffects of landslides by taking various projects at vulnerable slopes. Appropriate feasibility studies, along with assessments of risk, uncertainty, possible consequences, constructability, environmental impacts and cost benefit analysis by independent authorities are needed for any mitigation measure. A public hearing and consultation is important in this regard. Many of those living in the vulnerable areas might not even be aware of the legal provisions that are already in place to tackle such natural disasters. And so, laws such as the Disaster Management Act, and Standing Orders on Disaster (SOD) of the Government of Bangladesh should be understood and exercised by all concerned with appropriate resources, planning, and monitoring and accountability mechanism. Landslides are the consequence of the political and administrative incapability to manage urban expansion. Consequently, the risks facing the urban poor remain unaddressed or partially addressed by relevant agencies. Measures to reduce landslide risks need to be integrated into area planning. In this regard, actors, including government and local government authorities, the private sector, NGOs and individuals, have particular roles to ensure compliance with land use and relevant policies and procedures, so that landslide risks are addressed when infrastructure is constructed on hillsides. Moreover, the poverty-stricken who live in landslide prone areas cannot even afford an alternative area to live in which could be safer for them. Therefore, addressing poverty of the hill people should be considered as a priority for reducing landslide-related risk and vulnerability. Politically and socially empowered people of the society in conjunction with corrupt government officials are involved with hill graving and cutting in Bangladesh, violating the existing rules and regulations. Legal instruments should be in place and the enforcement of existing rules should be executed to manage risk-free hills. In addition, integrating landslide risk reduction in existing development works and future initiatives of different government departments and others working in the area should be made a priority. The concerned authorities should develop a database to carry out detailed study and planning. Government organisations and NGOs also need to redesign their development programmes with the active participation of the most vulnerable communities to ensure that they maximise hazard mitigation potential and incorporate traditional community coping practices. To guarantee the best implementation of all this, adequate resources from the central government and development partners should be ensured by authorities and policymakers. Countries like China, Philippines, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Japan and the US have managed to control the frequency of landslide occurrence. We should learn from their experiences and seek cooperation from them to enhance our capacity in managing landslide risks. If we are to truly avoid landslide of such magnitude, we need to learn how to be prepared from the beginning instead of waiting for disaster to strike before taking any concrete step.

A poster with models donning red panjabi and saree pasted at one side of the entrance, while the national flag hangs on the side wall and a mannequin displays clothes in other side. In the middle, a guard stands ready to push the door open for you. Welcome to Kay Kraft, a popular local fashion boutique. Inside, clothes with motifs and colours are all around and sales persons are waiting to greet customers to show off their latest collections, prepared with one eye on the first day of Baishakh, the first month of the Bangla new year. The biggest cultural festival of the nation is one of the major sales seasons for fashion houses that work with hundreds of thousands of local artisans, weavers and micro businesses across the country to make traditional dresses like salwar kameez, panjabi and saree. The festival yields Tk 2,000 crore in sales last year, according to fashion entrepreneurs. This year, indiscriminate spread of the novel coronavirus and the rising number of deaths linked to the disease are shattering their aspiration to make bounty. Since Bangladesh reported the maiden cases of coronavirus infection on March 8, panic has spread and apparel sellers have become one of the early victims. Sales dipped by roughly 50 per cent as shopping malls and stores selling clothes, footwear and electronics got a barren look as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus is increasing every day. Besides, people have made a mad dash for the kitchen markets and supermarket to stock foodstuffs, hand sanitisers and other essentials as part of their preparation to stay home should the capital city or the country comes under lock down of any form. Until yesterday, the total number of confirmed cases of infections rose to 27, with two deaths and five recovered. Globally, the death toll until 5:30pm yesterday stood at 13,049 and 307,341 were detected with the virus, according to the Johns Hopkins University in the US. The virus has spread to 171 countries since the first cases cropped up in China in December.  \"People are not in a festive mood at all,\" said Md Monir Hossain, shop manager of Kay Kraft branch at Sobhanbag on Mirpur road, on Saturday. Until 3.30pm, the showroom received only three customers and logged in Tk 6,000 in sales. \"This is a very low figure. In normal times, we would have received a good number of customers on Fridays and Saturdays than in other days of the week. This time the situation is different,\" he said. Some yards away is located another popular fashion boutique house Anjans and its sales persons did not see a single customer until 12.30pm despite opening the doors at 10am. \"We don't know what we should do now. Clothing sales have been declining and the extent of the slump is increasing daily,\" said Shaheen Ahmmed, president of the Fashion Entrepreneurs Association of Bangladesh (FEAB). Entrepreneurs say most fashion houses have almost completed their preparation targeting Pahela Baishakh before the coronavirus hit the nation. Some of them have even bought fabrics and other raw materials to make dresses for Eid-ul-Fitr, the largest sales season for domestic market-oriented businesses. Baishakh and Eid together generate about Tk 6,000 crore in sales for businesses that work with locally weaved fabrics, said Ahmmed, also the proprietor of Anjan's. Now, the coronavirus crisis is looming over inventory build-ups and has had ripple effects on the supply chain. The value of ready stock for Baishakh would be Tk 1,200 crore, according to Ahmmed. There are more than 1,000 small and medium business that make clothes with local fabrics, according to the FIAB, which has 100 members. A large number of people -- weavers, traditional dyers and artisan -- are dependent on the sector. The number of people employed in the sector is much higher. \"We are yet to take any decision on what to do and what not to do. We have faced fluctuations in sales for short periods of time during floods and cyclones, but this is an entirely new situation that we have never experienced before and we do not know when it will come to an end,\" Ahmmed said. All fashion houses, however, have windows to sell online. \"But, would people be in the mood to celebrate the festival? None have the peace of mind, not only in Bangladesh but also across the globe,\" Ahmmed said. It remains unclear when the crisis will be over, said Azharul Haque Azad, managing director of Sadakalo, another boutique house. A large portion of the clothes made for Baishakh festival might remain unsold unless the situation improves soon. Outfits for the Bangla new year celebration are made with certain motifs and it is very difficult to sell them during rest of the year. \"The concern is, when will this inventory sell out? And this will affect artisans, weavers and others as I will not make new clothes,\" Azad added. Aarong, the country's biggest fashion and lifestyle retail chain, unveiled its Baishakh collections on March 13. \"Daily sales have halved. Customer turnout has dropped drastically,\" said Mohammad Ashraful Alam, chief operating officer of Aarong. The fashion retail, a social enterprise of Brac, supports 65,000 artisans, including 600 micro and small businesses. \"We will be working on so that we can ensure their livelihood. Right now, we are focusing on raising awareness, ensuring safety and security for customers and sales persons to prevent and control the virus,\" he said. Ahmmed also has similar feelings. \"Sales are no longer a major concern for us at the moment. It will be good for everyone as soon as the situation turns for the better. The crisis will slow the progress of the nation,\" he said, adding that it would be difficult for many to continue to pay salaries to staff if the pandemic prolongs. Hossain of Kay Kraft, however, is yet to give up. \"We are giving more time to customers. Still, we have time. If the disease can be controlled and the situation improves, sales may bounce back.\" "

The index is a dynamic quantitative and qualitative benchmarking model, constructed from 28 unique indicators, that measures these drivers of food security across both developing and developed countries. Article 15 of the Constitution of the Peoples Republic Of Bangladesh state- \"it shall be a fundamental responsibility of the state to attain, through planned economic growth, a constant increase of productive forces and a steady improvement in the material and cultural standard of living of the people, with a view to securing to its citizen- the provision of basic necessities of life, including food, clothing, shelter, education and medical care\". Bangladesh is vulnerable to climatic disaster and repeated floods caused great damage to rice crops this year. A section of rice millers allegedly hoarded rice and deliberately hiked prices after the country lost crops -- primarily estimated at 20 lakh tonnes -- to flashfloods in Haor areas and fungal attack in the last Boro season. The National Food Policy of 2006 represents an important departure from the past by applying a comprehensive and integrated approach to food security, including the availability, access and utilisation dimension of food security. Policy has outlined following three main objectives: Objective 1: Adequate and stable supply of safe and nutritious food Objective 2: Increased purchasing power and access to food of the people Objective 3: Adequate nutrition for all individuals, especially women and children However, Cox's Bazar district administration imposed a weeklong ban on NGOs involved in distributing aid to Rohingyas at Ukhia and Teknaf starting from December 11, 2017. Interestingly, government circular stated that the amount of food and non-food items being distributed by the NGOs among the refugees were more than what they require. Food availability does not necessarily guarantee food security and moreover, refugee children largely suffer from malnutrition. Let alone refugees, a large segment of Bangladeshi population still suffers from food insecurity. Recent price hike had an impact on food security and overall poverty situation. At least 5.2 lakh people have fallen into poverty because of rice price hike, according to a recent study of the South Asian Network on Economic Modelling (SANEM). It has also caused a rise in head count poverty rate by 0.32 percentage points in past few months in the country. There is a demand to promulgate food security act. Most of the countries of the world have right to food law but Bangladesh doesn't currently have one. It is high time to codify a law to ensure food security. The Writer is a human rights worker. "

      "text": "Along the banks of the Sitalakhya river in Narayanganj, some 20 villages in Sonargaon, Rupganj, and Siddhirganj in particular, women villagers starch yarn in lime and toasted rice to make warp yarn--the vertical, lengthwise weaves that make up a fabric. The weft yarn--the horizontal snake-like components of a weave--is likewise starched in cooked rice, dried, and wound around a spindle. The yarn that will make up the motif is left unstarched, three strands of which are spun on the spindle. The starched warp dries and spins on a cylindrical bamboo frame. It finds itself on a metal grid, grouped into individual rolls, and is threaded through blind-like wooden frames. Then it goes on a walk, as two women attach the yarn to bamboo sticks stationed at intervals on the ground. It takes them hours to thread each warp yarn through a fine, bamboo reed comb, which affects the fineness of what will eventually become the fabric. Placed side-by-side to be pulled by a lever (a wooden pole) and formed into a sheet, the yarns are then threaded through wooden shafts (heddles). In time, the wefts will snake their way through the spaces left behind by these heddles across the warp. Finally, wrapped around that wooden pole, the warp finds itself on the weaver's pit loom. Thus begins the journey of the Jamdani--one of ancient Bengal's finest cotton muslins, a remnant of the region's Mughal rule. \"The indigenous weavers of India and weavers brought in from Persia--created a new fabric called Jamdani,\" explains Ruby Ghuznavi, executive member of the National Crafts Council of Bangladesh (NCCB), and a member of the research, documentation, production, and exhibition committee of the recently held Jamdani Festival 2019, jointly organised by the NCCB and the Bengal Foundation. The weavers were brought in by Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Sultan of Delhi in the 14th century, writer and editor Farida Noireet writes in her paper \"Sonargaon, the birthplace of Jamdani\". The temperature and humidity of the climate, the soil ecology, and the minerals contained in the Sitalakhya's waters made Sonargaon uniquely suited for the production of cotton, particularly Jamdani. By the 16th century, the patronage of the Mughal emperors had cultivated the art into a thriving fashion trend for both men and women in the Mughal Empire. Positioned as it was at the junction between Bengal and the Far and the Middle East, and the rivers of Sitalakhya, Meghna, and Brahmaputra, Sonargaon (then capital of Mughal Bengal) flourished as a hub of commercial activity until the 17th century; and so Jamdani travelled and became popular also among the courtiers across Britain and Europe.   The trade's decline began from the 18th century, writes human rights activist Dr Hameeda Hossain, author of Company Weavers of Bengal: Textile Production for the East India Company 1750-1813 and Working Conditions of the Company Weavers in Dhaka Arangs. Dr Hossain explains how the East India Company began exercising more and more control over textile production in the region as it grew into a monopsony, particularly from 1753, pushed by increasing competition from other European companies and private merchants. They exerted operational control--gumashtas (agents employed by the buyers) replaced dalals to monitor production; financial control--higher advances indebted weavers to the Company; and legal and bureaucratic control--regulations for weavers curbed their interaction with other weavers. The artisans, as a result, grew increasingly discouraged from taking orders for the fabric. Meanwhile, floods and famine in 1770 destroyed the region's ability to produce cotton as more and more land turned to producing rice. Around the same time, England cut down on its imports and began exporting more of its industrially manufactured goods to colonies. Yet the Jamdani trade survived through private merchants as the East India Company closed its Dhaka factory after being subsumed by the Crown in 1833. Jamdani saris became a favourite among middle and upper-class Bengali women, and became also a symbol of protest, as a hand-spun fabric, following Mahatma Gandhi's rejection of industrially manufactured fabric in his Satyagraha movement. The wars of Bengal brought forth a fresh wave of threats to the trade--the Partition of 1947 saw a loss of rich Hindu clients when they left West Bengal, and both the Partition and the Liberation War of 1971 destroyed raw materials and weavers' homes and looms. *** Back on the loom--a primitive apparatus fashioned out of wood and bamboo--two weavers sit and work in tandem, the master weaver on the right, on the left, the apprentice awaiting his instructions, his buli. Together, they place eight to 18 inches of yarn into the warp to create a motif. This motif yarn will be thicker than the warp and weft in order to stand out.   With each row of the weave completed, a metal spindle will travel across the warp, carrying with it the weft. The whole time, the master weaver will control a foot pedal to move the double reeds on the loom up and down as needed. They repeat the act on each row, sprinkling and rubbing starch on every nine inches of the yarn, until a finished fabric emerges. It was here that Md Jamal Hossain, a master weaver from Sonargaon, began learning the process from his uncle 23 years ago at the age of 14. It was either this or studying in a classroom, which he hated. He sat at the loom from 6 am in the morning to 10pm at night. The joints in his fingers, arms, knees, and feet throbbed. For the first few years there was no electricity, and so working in the dark with a lantern hurt his eyes. \"As the shagrid (apprentice) I had to be the first one to set up at work. I'd wake up at dawn, take a quick plunge in the khaal for a bath, and come to the workstation with soap suds still clinging to my hair,\" he recalls. Today, Jamal Hossain is the proprietor of the Phakhi Jamdani weaving factory in Sonargaon, where he works with 50 other weavers on 25 looms. They used to weave around 25 saris per week, with a thread count of 200 to 300. The fabric was coarse, the designs less intricate. Yet the work still requires him, and other weavers in his area, to work from early morning until late into the night. \"I hardly have any idea how my family are doing back at home,\" Hossain confesses, although more and more women are now becoming weavers of the fabric. Working with the Jamdani festival required around 50 of such weavers to attempt to replicate the original Mughal fabrics. They managed to reach 2,400 thread counts over the past two years--a near-miraculous task for craftsmen who had never seen the products before. Each inch weaved took them almost eight hours to complete; it was excruciating for the limbs and the eyes. Hossain recalls, \"We weaved samples for weeks and threw each away. 20, 25 weavers rejected one particularly difficult design called the 'Mehraab' once presented to a Mughal princess. They said it couldn't be Jamdani, it was so difficult to make. We worked at the loom, got up and walked away in frustration, came back to try again until we succeeded.\" The finesse achieved from the practice now allows them to charge much higher prices for their products.  Weaving these saris, however, takes them six to eight months. But the weavers need to get paid on a weekly basis. \"A fine Jamdani sari costs around Tk 100,000 today. If I pay each of my weavers Tk 2,000 per month, I have to pay Tk 50,000 in wages. Then I have travel expenses, expenditures for my parents, my wife and children. At the end of the month, I don't even have enough money left to repair the broken chowki on which I sleep at home,\" shares Hossain.  This begs the question: How many people can afford saris at such prices? How can the artform and its artists be sustained? Textile and crafts design giant Chandra Shekhar Shaha explains: \"Suppose these saris cost between Tk 10,000 to 150,000, and another separate range costs up to Tk 1,000,000. This automatically creates a classification of patrons at each range. Even the Tk 10,000-25,000 range can secure years' worth of earnings for a weaver if each client has just one Jamdani in their wardrobe. If even a quarter of one percent of our population sought to buy Jamdani, that's almost 4.5 lakh Jamdani pieces. So, what we need is awareness--through media campaigns, a handful of fashion shows per year, donning the fabric and presenting it as gifts when travelling abroad--to preserve this legacy.\"    Yet he highlights other challenges. \"The weaving of the weft in Jamdani requires immense mental focus. It's all mathematical; the slightest miscalculation can distort the entire make-up of the fabric. But many power looms have moved into the regions where Jamdani is weaved, and the noise pollution from these machines disrupts the Jamdani weavers' concentration when they orate their designs.\"  In an effort to address these issues, the NCCB plans to provide weavers with quality tools and materials, such as by setting up yarn banks, share executive members Ruby Ghuznavi and Chandra Shekhar Shaha. Through dialogues with the government, they're aiming to establish pension plans for aged weavers, and set up schools both to educate weavers' children and to help reduce child labour at the looms. There are other plans to collect, document, and publish wider collections of ancient Jamdanis from around the world to nurture further research. Having recently helped Sonargaon win the title of a World Craft City as the birthplace of Jamdani, they are hopeful that the region will now attract more funding, exposure, and flurry of creative activity. *** These efforts highlight the value of Jamdani as a heritage fabric for Bengal. Having researched on the fabric for decades, Ruby Ghuznavi draws the distinction, \"With every other fabric, the designs were either printed or embroidered on top. Jamdani was unique because the designs were woven into the fabric.\" Shaha, who curated the Jamdani exhibition as part of the festival, points out other unique characteristics as we take a stroll through the display at Bengal Shilpalay in Dhanmondi. He steps behind a white Jamdani sari hung a little distance from a white wall on the upper storey of the gallery. As sunlight wafts its way through the fabric, its designs cast a shadow of geometric patterns on the wall, mesmerising in their intricacy. \"Jamdani motifs always have breathing spaces within them,\" he highlights. \"The other element is the 'float',\" he says of the fine lines jutting out of the larger floral patterns, before pointing out small meena butis sprinkled over flowers and leaves, each pierced with countless tiny holes. \"Transparency of the sari's body and density of the threads making up the motifs, each ornamentation placed at a proportional distance from each other, these components strike a beautiful balance in the Jamdani,\" explains Shaha. These designs have been passed down verbally through generations of weavers, but their origins lie in reflecting the local flora and fauna where they were first weaved, as well as the architecture surrounding their first wearers. Butis--individual floral motifs--dot the length of the fabric. The par--the border--contains another different set of patterns. The terchi winds diagonally through the fabric and the jaal--a net-like design--often blankets the entire length. Among the more intricate motifs are the bagnoli, symbolising a tiger's paw, and the kalka, which came to be known as the paisley, christening a town with its name in Scotland. An image of the jasmine, apparently a favourite from the time, reappears often among the older designs. Walking to an old Jamdani scarf on display, Shaha points out the reflection of Mughal ornamentation and architecture in the designs--the marble throne, the archways. Other samples depict angur lota--grapevines--and the corinthian leaf. On the other side of the room, a plain white Jamdani with a thin red border reveals, potentially, the identity of its wearer--the plain design indicating that she was a rather aged woman, but the red border implying that she was most likely not a widow. Over time, these ancient motifs have become simplified, losing touch with the time in which the fabric first flourished. But even today, around 2,000 Jamdani pieces get produced each week in the Narayanganj region. Around 15,000 people from 3,000 families were employed in the trade as of 2013, as per figures provided by Farida Noireet. These pieces mark Jamdani as more than just a relic of the Mughal age. In each individual thread and motif of today's Jamdanis are bottled the artistry of countless weavers and their tired, paining limbs, and ancestral memories of designs passed from father to son, uncle to nephew and now sisters and wives. The fabric symbolises a craft that weaves history--personal, national, political, cross-continental--and the present into a translucent, kaleidoscopic whole. Yet it retains its humility.   \"From trying to revive the original Jamdani we realised,\" shares master weaver Jamal, \"that we can help people rediscover what courtiers wore 200-300 years ago and bring back that craft, only if we are given some financial assistance and access to quality materials. At the end of the day, we want to help make Jamdani a world famous symbol of Bengali Muslim heritage. But we also want to afford basic sustenance.\"   Sarah Anjum Bari can be reached at sarah.anjum.bari@gmail.com \n  "

      "text": "There is no exaggerating how crucial water is for human survival, particularly in countries like Bangladesh, which is crisscrossed by rivers. The level of water in a river here directly affects the lifestyles and livelihoods of the people living on its two sides, so much so that rivers and water bodies of varied sizes are an inseparable part of Bengali culture and heritage. Several hundred rivers and their tributaries flow through the country. However, some of the rivers -- often called the lifelines of Bangladesh -- are dying, inflicting prolonged suffering on the people. For example, the 309-kilometre Teesta flows through northern Bangladesh and drains an area of 12,540 square kilometres on its way from the Himalayas to Fulchhari of Gaibandha in Bangladesh where it meets the Jamuna. The river, which can be up to 2.5 kilometres wide, is reduced to a width of about 70 metres during the winter and is even narrower or completely dry at some places during the very dry season (March and April). This leaves fishermen without work and farmers in acute need of water for irrigation. While a dearth of water plagues the people of northern Bangladesh, particularly during winter, the middle and southern parts of the country reels from its overabundance, particularly during the monsoon. Also, salinity ingress in the surface and groundwater in the coastal region has reached such a state that not even grass can grow in some areas and people face an acute shortage of drinking water. Someone said that a third world war may be fought over water. And it indeed is turning out to be a serious issue, not only in Bangladesh but also worldwide. In any case, quality water access on the one hand and devastation caused by flooding on the other are the hallmarks of water being the cause of large-scale suffering of people in many parts of the world. Water-related natural disasters have occurred in the past, but are increasing in recent times in terms of both frequency and extent of the devastations caused. The reasons behind various water sector problems include a growing population, fast expanding economic activity, spreading water pollution, and the consequences of climate change. In Bangladesh, as a matter of fact, the average annual per capita availability of water is robust -- 7,568 cubic metres per capita, around five times higher than that in India. However, the highly uneven seasonal and spatial distribution of available water in Bangladesh poses serious problems. Adequate water access for drinking or for other purposes by certain groups of large numbers of people and in certain areas of the country is becoming increasingly serious. Another set of problems related to the water sector arises as Bangladesh is at the bottom of three major rivers systems--the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna. A particular feature in this context is severe water scarcity in certain parts of Bangladesh in the dry season, Jan. 1 to May 31, particularly in March and April, due to low-flows through transboundary rivers as a result of excessive upstream abstraction. Also, floods in Bangladesh mostly originate upstream. Hence, regional cooperation in water management is an important issue. Increasing salinity in water in coastal areas, arsenic contamination of water, and water pollution caused by human actions are becoming increasingly serious problems. Devastating floods and prolonged droughts also affect various areas of the country from time to time. Clean, accessible water for all is the sixth among the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations. The Sheikh Hasina-led Government of Bangladesh is working relentlessly to achieve the goals well before the 2030 deadline. The country already has necessary policies to save the rivers and other water-bodies and to ensure even distribution of quality water. What the country now needs is stricter enforcement of the policies and relevant laws, and more effective efforts from both government and non-government actors in realising the goal of ensuring accessibility to quality water for all. Ensuring accessibility to quality water for all is a must for sustainable development. And this has to be ensured before it is too late.

      "text": "Almost immediately after the independence of Bangladesh, Henry Kissinger, former US Secretary of State, dismissed the country as a \"perpetual economic basket case\". Bangladesh has proved Kissinger wrong. In the last forty four years, Bangladesh has undergone a great deal of transformation. There has been some good progress in almost all spheres of life, but still for some Bangladesh means a country of floods, cyclones, poverty, over-population, political turmoil, corruption, Rana plaza etc. These negative events cast a shadow on the many achievements that we have made in the last 44 years. For a change, therefore, let us talk about a positive Bangladesh.   Since half of our population is directly or indirectly involved with agriculture, we will start with this sector. Our main produce is rice; besides we grow wheat, jute, vegetables, fruits etc. In 1971, there were 75 million people in the country and the country's rice production was only 10 million metric tonnes. Presently, our population is around 160 million and to accommodate this extra-large population we have lost a significant area of cultivable land; but rice production, nonetheless, tripled in the last 44 years to over 33 million metric tonnes, as it now stands today. Thanks are rightfully deserved by our poor farmers, who are not only feeding us but have also made the country self-sufficient in rice production. According to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Bangladesh is one of the leading countries in the developing world, in fact the first in Asia, to have a comprehensive country-investment plan for agriculture, food security and nutrition. Since independence, our country has also made significant strides in other economic sectors. Many industries were established, but successes and a considerable progress were made by the garments, textiles, pharmaceuticals, ceramic, cement and many other sectors. Garments alone have around 5,000 manufacturing units, creating employment opportunities for 4.2 million people, of whom 85 percent are women. In fiscal year 2014-15, the country made approximately US$ 26 billion's worth of total garments export, which established us as the second- largest garments and knitwear exporting country in the world. Industrial experts are predicting that in the next five years, Bangladesh will become the largest readymade garments manufacturer. Our leather and leather goods have long been witnessing huge demands in the global market. Fisheries and livestock are playing an important role in our economy. Around 1.3 million people are directly involved in this sector. After garments, shrimp is the second largest export item of the country. In FY2013-14, the country earned US$ 638 million by exporting 55,074 tonnes of frozen foods, including shrimp. Jute, which used to be our famed 'golden fibre', has made a spectacular comeback, as the demand for natural fibre is increasing worldwide. Bangladesh exported raw jute and jute goods worth $1.03 billion in fiscal 2012-13 -- jute sacks and bags accounted for $237 million and jute yarn and twine over $500 million -- according to data from Export Promotion Bureau. Our pharmaceutical sector and the information technology sector are maturing and have already entered the global market. Both the industries have great potential and will definitely bring fortunes to the country in the near future. Today, there is probably hardly any corner on earth where Bangladeshi workers haven't migrated. The inflow of remittance was US$23.7 million in 1975 and it rose to US$15.3 billion in 2015.The revenues earned and sent by the migrant workers make the largest portion of our national reserve of foreign exchange which now stands close to $ 27 billion. As a result, the dependence on foreign aid in framing the national budget has reduced to a great extent. Remittances are playing key roles in lifting people out of poverty. Moderate poverty rate declined from 34.3 percent in 2000 to 12.6 percent in 2015.  One feature that we can make out from the above portrayal is that our economic activity is growing rapidly. Back in 1970, the size of GDP was only US$6.2 billion and in 2015, the GDP grew to $205.3 billion taking Bangladesh to the 44th position in the world economy. Total export in 1970 was US$ 0.36 billion which stands today at more than US$34.5 billion. Our per capita income is $1314, which was only $135.62 in 1970. Besides our economic growth, we have also made significant progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly relating to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, promoting gender equality and empowering women, ensuring universal primary education and reducing child mortality. In 1990, the infant mortality rate was 100 deaths per 1000 live births, and by 2015, it had been reduced to 30.70 deaths per 1,000 live births. Life expectancy is now 71 years from 47.58 years in 1970.  Cyclones, floods and droughts have long been part of the country's history, but they have been managed successfully by the governments in recent years. Bangladesh is the first country to set up its own Climate Change Trust Fund supported by nearly US$300 million of domestic resources from 2009-2012. In appreciation of our remarkable achievements, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina, has been announced as one of the winners of the United Nations' highest environmental accolade, 'Champion of the Earth' 2015. Bangladesh is also glorified and known to the global people because of some of our social and personal achievements made by our people. The micro-credit is generally considered to have been pioneered by Grameen Bank, founded by Nobel Laureate Prof. Dr. Muhammad Yunus. Its vast network in the country has 8.4 million borrowers, of which 96 percent are women. It has opened the door to poor rural women, prompting them to participate in the activities of local government, and take greater roles in other community activities. Its success has inspired similar projects in more than 40 countries around the world, including the USA, with 200 million clients. The Grameen Bank has received several prestigious awards, but the greatest recognition for the bank's achievement came on October 13, 2006 when the Nobel Peace Prize, 2006, was given jointly to Prof. Dr. Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank \"for their efforts to create economic and social development from below\". Recently, Prof. Yunus brought another glory for the nation by getting the highest civilian award of the United States, the Congressional Gold Medal, in recognition of his efforts toward combating global poverty. Bangladeshi youths, aged 18-40 years, constitute 70 percent of our total population. They are our assets and all of them are working hard to bring changes. Four of them have already brought much glory for us by hoisting our national flag at the top of the world - the peak of Mount Everest. Musa Ibrahim became the first Bangladeshi to reach the summit of the Everest on May 23, 2010. After that, M A Mohit conquered the peak in 2011, and two young women, Nishat Majumder and Wasfia Nazreen, in 2012. The above are a few snapshots of our many successes. Things are now looking brighter for us. Our economy worth US$ 205.3 billion is growing at the rate of 6.0 percent - making us the next manufacturing hub in the region. Thanks should go to our poor farmers, workers at home and abroad, the entrepreneurs and all the hard working people, who have successfully contributed in taking Bangladesh out of the 'basket case'.  However, it is feared that because of our current political climate, the country may again drift back to the basket case branding, it never deserved.

      "text": "Each year, the second day of February is commemorated worldwide as the World Wetlands Day, marking the day when the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance was adopted by UN member-states in 1971, in the city of Ramsar in Iran, to raise awareness of the preservation and judicious use of wetlands and their resources. In line with its theme \"Wetlands and Climate Change\", this year's World Wetlands Day particularly stresses the importance of wetland conservation as a key to coping with climate change. Globally, the wetlands are at risk of declining rapidly both in terms of quantity and quality. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, in a 2018 report titled \"Global Wetland Outlook: State of the World's Wetlands and their Services to People\", claimed that globally, the wetlands are disappearing three times faster than forests, with 35 percent of the world's wetlands lost since 1970. This trend is, without any doubt, alarming. Bangladesh is well-known as a riverine country with vast areas of low-lying land including wetlands, locally known as haor. According to the Master Plan of Haor Area adopted in 2012, there are 373 haor/wetlands in the seven north-eastern districts of the country, covering about 859,000 hectares of land. These wetlands can help us stabilise emissions of greenhouse gas and cope with climate change impacts in a number of ways. Wetlands absorb and store excessive rainfall water and reduce the risk of flood. They release stored water that can delay the onset of drought. Well-managed wetlands can also ensure that people living in the wetland areas are resilient and able to bounce back after the occurrence of natural hazards. Moreover, the wetlands also have social and economic importance, providing livelihood opportunities to thousands of people living in the areas. In the context of climate change and increased risk of disaster, conservation of the wetlands is no less important for us than achieving the goals of Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. But, alarmingly, the wetlands of Bangladesh are also at risk of disappearing as the ecology of our wetlands is under constant threat. They are also severely impacted by climate change and global warming. The Bangladesh Delta Plan (BDP) 2100 identified the haor region as vulnerable to climate change impacts. Flash flood hits the region almost every two or three years and damages its Boro crops--the only means of livelihood for most of the people living there. A recent study published in Theoretical and Applied Climatology journal projected that there is a possibility of rise in the amount of total rainfall and frequent occurrence of flash floods with high volumes around the haor basin of Bangladesh. While conducting the study, researchers analysed various aspects of future rainfall projection and temperature extremes. Another study published in Global Social Welfare journal also observed that fish availability, fish diversity, presence of migratory birds, aquatic plants, and the water-retaining capacity of the haor region have all been affected significantly, while the occurrence of sudden floods, storm, drought and human viral diseases increased extensively. The wetlands-based ecosystem is also being affected by pesticides used in paddy fields, over-exploitation of fish resources, increased settlement in the areas, and lack of awareness among the local people of the preservation and conservation of haor resources. However, climate is not the only issue for them. Since their livelihoods are frequently disrupted by natural hazards and the majority of areas are out of road network, they suffer from abject poverty. The region performs poorly in all social indicators--ranging from education and health to sanitation and hygiene. Given the context, any development effort meant for these people should focus on their holistic development, from economic to social to environment. Development projects should take the ecosystem, environmental issues and special requirements of the region into account. The local community should also be made aware of the importance of the preservation and sensible use of the haor bodies. Since the livelihoods of people living in these haor areas are vulnerable to, and affected by, the climate change impacts, climate adaptive livelihood options are also required. Under no circumstances should we alter the natural ecosystem of the areas. Livelihood diversification and creation of alternative livelihood options may reduce the pressure on haor resources. These wetlands should not be drained, for when burned or drained, the most effective carbon sinks may turn into carbon sources. Another issue important for the haor community is data shortage. All available data, except the data available in the Master Plan of Haor Area, from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), provide district-wise information that do not necessarily reflect the situation of the haor community. For instance, a number of haors are located in Sylhet district, but the poverty rate for the district does not reveal the exact rate of poverty for haor dwellers. The BBS can undertake a new project to regularly collect and publish data related only to haor areas that will also help the government monitor the progress of the master plan. The data should include all relevant issues--climate, environmental, economic and social. We all should work together to restore and protect the amazing ecosystem of our haors/wetlands and thus brace for the climate change impacts. To that end, effective and enhanced partnership among the key stakeholders is needed. The government, affected individuals and communities, and development organisations have a stake in this regard. We should keep in mind that if our development takes precedence over haor ecology, the environmental effects are bound to be devastating. On the other hand, leaving the hard-to-reach community behind in terms of development can never bring the optimum result. Our commitment to protecting our haor together with ensuring the holistic development of the haor community can bring a sustainable solution to the problem.

All 193 of the UN member countries have reported the existence of Covid-19 within their borders. We remain homebound, along with a third of humanity. No other global crisis has reached so many countries and people in the past, not even the Spanish flu in 1918. It is levelling socioeconomic gaps. Rich, poor, the powerful and the disenfranchised - all are susceptible. My wife and I decided to give in to the mounting pressure from our children and finally stay home from March 18, 2020--incidentally the day the first Covid-19 related death was announced in Bangladesh. At the risk of sounding insensitive, the first hit for us was in our apartment building. The caretaker left his job without notice. The cleaner became irregular. I decided to take over some of their jobs, including distributing newspapers to different apartments. As a precaution for all involved, we gave paid leave to our help. Now that we are on our own, I'm letting the inner optimist out and approaching this from a glass half-full perspective.  I finally have time to do things that I don't normally do or am not allowed to do. Yesterday, I decided to cook bhaji with shalgom. This particular winter vegetable is normally used as an ingredient with fish or meat, not as a bhaji. My wife appreciated my cooking with a grain of salt-- \"delicious but it has too much oil.\" I have re-taken charge of cleaning, which I used to do while abroad. Watching movies is another popular pastime. Like many others, we re-watched the 2011 hit Contagion, which is very similar to what is happening in the world today. I also read Jajabor's epic Drishtipat after many decades. Staying at home and the additional cleaning and apartment duties has not prevented me from my \"other work\". Many academics and researchers are taking the crisis as an opportunity to engage in research on the pandemic. As part of several virtual working groups, I have had the opportunity to connect with some very insightful people, which is furthering my thinking. Similarly, I am spending considerable time each day on conference calls with colleagues and friends from around the world who are concerned about the crisis and its potential responses. In one such meeting convened by a local group and attended by leading health specialists and some with close connections to the government's Covid-19 responses, it was abundantly clear that a grim future would be inevitable unless effective and decisive steps were taken without any further delay. The additional time has allowed me to become more socially active on social media platforms as well, where my friends and I keep tabs on each other. I was recently surprised to know that some were still meeting up for breakfast and addas. I have recently written about this lacklustre response we are seeing to the requests of \"social distancing\" and how it remains \"foreign\" in our culture. Thinking further, I am also disturbed by the lukewarm actions taken by our mosques and the powerful Islamic Foundation in restricting congregations. When mosques in most Muslim countries including Saudi Arabia have forbidden congregations, we are continuing as if nothing or very little has happened--this can be fatally sloppy, careless and irresponsible. I may not be an authority on this, but wouldn't endangering the lives of your fellow musalli go against the grain of Islam? In times like these, the government must effectively lead and look beyond politics to make difficult choices. Of late, the government has taken a number of positive steps. However, while the country is now in a near \"lockdown\" condition, why are we not calling it so? The government offices have been given chhuti, and to many, as we have seen, this is interpreted as \"holiday\". In such emergencies, it is always critical to be clear, transparent and decisive--call a spade, a spade! In such situations, it is always the poor who suffer most, particularly those who live hand-to-mouth and depend on meagre wages. The Prime Minister, in her address to the nation, announced a package of financial assistance for those who would be hard-hit by the crisis. These include an incentive package worth Tk 5000 crore to help the export-oriented sectors. This, as she said emphatically, would be used to pay for workers' wages. She also announced a few other measures for the rural poor. However, it is not clear whether these are new funds for the looming crisis or part of already existing social welfare schemes run by the government. If it is the former, we need to know how much money the government is committing and also make sure that these are efficiently used. If the latter, the government must commit new funds because the existing schemes reach only a section of the poor. The news of the development of a new kit by Gonoshasthaya Kendra (GK) was exciting. I started wondering what BRAC was doing. In any previous disasters, be it floods, cyclones, civil strife or refugee crisis, BRAC was always at the frontline. As part of this, BRAC and Channel-i have already initiated a joint communication programme on Covid-19. I understand the new Chairman of BRAC is also planning to convene a (virtual) meeting of leading NGOs to coordinate the response efforts. The show of voluntarism across the country is also very encouraging. Many civil society groups are active in producing protective gear and creating awareness. I feel very proud that the alumni of my school in Sylhet have been extending such help to those needing them. There are many others like this. We must also keep in mind our elders. Isolation, especially for them, can be debilitating. I have been trying to do my bit by chatting with elderly relatives and my own teachers. I recently called Professor MG Mostafa, a former Chairman of the Statistics Department of Dhaka University. His wife, also my teacher, passed away many years ago. He is alone in his apartment in Uttara, and I could sense how happy he was to receive such a call in these days of distress and uncertainties. This is the time to stay at home, but we must remember to not shut all doors, figuratively speaking. We have to stay active and innovative and extend whatever assistance we can to face this unparalleled crisis together.   Mushtaque Chowdhury is adviser and founding Dean of James P.

Thankfully, there have been signs of the rain abating, and hopefully the water levels will now come down. There have been efforts by the government and non-government groups to provide some relief. The government must take stock of the ground realities, and instead of standardised distribution of relief items, take the needs of the affected into account. There needs to be special attention given to areas where there is no access to safe water and where food supplies are drying up. We must remember that the affected communities will be needing long-term aid to get back some semblance of order in their lives. For many, loss of crops and lack of access to fodder for their livestock could prove disastrous for their livelihood. Even when the waters do abate, the risk of diseases and other sanitation concerns will remain--care must be taken to address these. Our immediate efforts should also focus on re-establishing communication lines and ensuring relief is being provided to all those affected. But after we deal with the immediate task at hand--ensuring safety and food security--we should take time to evaluate if we could have been better prepared for the rains and thereby averted the disaster through timely measures."

      "text": "In 2010, heavy monsoons led to devastating floods in Pakistan that destroyed 11,000 schools. Thousands of additional schools had to be used as community shelters, preventing them from operating as classrooms. In the immediate aftermath of climate-related events such as this, damage to schools and infrastructure often interrupt a child's education. This is even more devastating in countries and communities where access to educational resources is already strained. Following damage, repairs to schools and infrastructure tend to be slow and delayed. Research has shown an overall reduction in educational attainment, lower academic performance, and higher rates of absenteeism among children who have experienced climate shocks. After these events, children may also miss school due to sickness (e.g., malnutrition during drought, or increased rates of diarrheal disease after floods), injury, or displacement. In the long run, this may reduce lifetime earnings when these children reach adulthood. A recently published Brookings brief highlights the ways that increasing girls' education can make them agents of change in the pursuit of more equitable climate action. Given the opportunity, girls can be powerful agents of change--and this is one area where their leadership will be sorely needed in the near future. But while more education for girls may help make them, their families, and their communities more resilient in the face of natural disasters, the reverse is also true: these disasters are threatening gains made in girls' education. Climate events disproportionately affect vulnerable students, particularly adolescent girls. This pattern is particularly alarming, as evidence suggests that climate-related shocks (cyclones, flash floods, wildfires) and stresses (drought, for example) are increasing in frequency and intensity. Due to the potentially profound consequences of climate events on education, researchers and policymakers are increasingly focusing their attention on this link, and its implications. For example, at the Population Council, we are using satellite imagery and remotely sensed data to measure climate shocks and stresses. We are linking these data with information about where people live, including those who are most vulnerable, and where education is most likely to be disrupted. Detailed information about where climate events occur, who is at risk, and why, is essential for policymakers and school officials to take actions that minimise lost school time. These risks are particularly acute for adolescent girls, who have a short window of opportunity to get back to school before they are forced to take a different path--including marriage or migration for work. Climate shocks such as cyclones and floods are acute and often challenging to plan for. Building maps and models identifying high-risk areas can be useful as countries and communities develop strategies for emergency response and resilience building. Take two districts in Bangladesh where the Population Council is working to delay child marriage, which has been linked to environmental shocks and is likely to derail education for girls. Our analyses show that 45 out of 96 secondary schools are in high flood risk areas. Using this information, schools and communities can develop action plans to prevent education disruption following climate shocks, such as running double shifts at unaffected schools temporarily. Linking surveys from the schools and students in their catchment area with satellite imagery of flood risk can help us better understand which schools close and under what conditions. We can also learn how communities respond or adapt to challenges, the effects on educational attainment, and the risk of child marriage. With climate-related stresses, such as drought, the effects look to be less immediate or direct when compared to shocks, but they often have significant long-term implications. Droughts destabilise the income of poorer households, many of whom are reliant on agriculture for income. As a result, households may pull children out of school early to have them work in the formal labour market or within the household. Evidence from India, for example, shows that households in areas with high variability in agricultural production may send their daughters to get married in areas with less risk as a way to protect against household income and food shortages. As the risk of climate events increases globally, policymakers and practitioners must integrate information about climate risks and their potential impacts with efforts to promote girls' education. National officials or international bodies may be able to identify communities at high risk of disruption by using information about communities most affected by climate events. Additionally, short-term support for families with school-age children, especially girls, is needed and may reduce the risk of more permanent schooling disruptions. The relationship between girls' education and climate events is complex, but work to understand the risks and best practices is growing. But for girls to lead resilience-building efforts in their families and communities--both now and in the future--we must ensure that climate events do not derail their education and, therefore, their opportunities.

      "text": "A report titled \"World Food Security and Nutrition Situation-2017\", brought out jointly by a number of UN organisations, estimates that some 25 million Bangladeshis, mostly women and children, suffer from malnutrition. This is not to say that the overall food and nutrition situation here has not improved over the years. In fact, it is quite the contrary, as evident from the fact that Bangladesh has witnessed stunted growth among children (aged under 5) go down from 45 percent to 36.1 percent between 2005 and 2016.  Despite the progress, natural calamities like floods and landslides are having a disastrous effect on the nutrition situation, which is likely to be more severe this time around, considering the extent of damage caused by floods this year. According to the state-run Trading Corporation of Bangladesh (TCB), coarse varieties of rice were on sale for Tk 50-54 per kg in the capital's retail markets last week--Tk 10 higher than the price only a month ago.  With rice prices soaring across the country in recent months, following widespread fears of rice shortages fuelled largely by the fact that massive amounts of agricultural losses were endured, the government has rightly started to intervene in the market recently by selling the staple at a subsidised price under a nationwide Open Market Sale (OMS) programme. Although, only after wrongly delaying from intervening. Food Ministry sources, meanwhile, said that the intervention was not possible earlier because of the shortage of rice in public granaries, while also blaming a section of rice millers for deliberately hoarding rice and hiking prices. The Anti-Corruption Commission too has \"received the allegation\" that traders were hoarding rice in cahoots with \"some government officials\", which it has said it will \"inquire into\".  Consequently, their attempts to defraud the public also allegedly included dissemination of a confusing letter that said that India had stopped exporting rice to Bangladesh, which was later cleared to have been fake by the government. When seen from a broader perspective, this allegation is much more serious than it initially seems. At a time when the nation had barely recovered from one massive disaster (floods) and was struggling to deal with another crisis (the Rohingya influx), that special-interest groups will attempt to destabilise the rice market--endangering the national interest--for a quick buck should not be taken lightly.  Thus, the government should carefully investigate the matter and transparently deal with its findings. However, what none of this can excuse is the government's own failure to pre-empt a situation in which it would significantly have to intervene in the market in order to stabilise the price of a commodity as essential as rice.  One further indicator of this is the shelving of the government's rice distribution programme to the ultra-poor which it had drummed up for quite some time. The government suddenly postponed the plan as it would require 4.5 lakh tonnes of food-grains, while to operate the OMS programme beyond the district-level for a month, it would also need 50,000 to 100,000 tonnes of rice; whereas, the public food stock had 3.45 lakh tonnes of rice only and 1.21 lakh tonnes were still in the import pipeline, information from food ministry officials revealed.  This and other similar failures have prompted even rice traders to allege that \"the food ministry didn't pay any attention to a fast depleting government food stock, and [had] responded late to the urgency of replenishing the rice reserve after the Haor deluge.\" And to blame the government for \"the delay in reducing the high import duty on rice\" and for refusing \"to give better price for homegrown rice\", only to procure the staple later \"from abroad at much higher prices\" (Govt wasn't alert to depleting stock, September 20, The Daily Star). One leading private rice importer said that had the government reduced duty on rice imports \"right after the flash flood-induced crop loss, a situation like this would not have arisen in the first place.\" And so, this is the crux of the current crisis. While it is understandable that the government has had to deal with a number of crises all at the same time, what is inexcusable is the food ministry's failure to perform its primary and specific duty. This too demands a proper investigation as much as the circulation of the fake letter does. And, finally, there is the matter of what has been happening since then which, bar none, deserves the greatest and most urgent attention; particularly given that it is still rectifiable. And, that is, corruption in the OMS programme, including in its sale and distribution.  One incident of this was recorded in Rajshahi's Durgapur upazila on September 20, where three dealers were alleged to have falsely shown on paper the sale of rice at the subsidised OMS rate. \"Taking advantage of lax monitoring by food officials,\" the dealers were alleged to have sold three tonnes of rice--the total allocation of OMS for the day--on the black market (one can only assume at a higher price for personal profit) in complete disregard for the plight of ordinary citizens and the intent of the initiative (Dealers go rogue with OMS rice, September 22, The Daily Star). One of the monitoring officials had even admitted signing the document confirming the sale, under pressure from someone named Rustom, who also happens to have the \"blessings of local leaders of the ruling party\". No doubt, there are many more cases of similar corrupt practices happening regularly that are going completely unreported. Given the settings, while it is perhaps illogical to ask the government to address each and every case of such corruption individually, what it can do is take exemplary measures against the corrupt in cases that are brought to its notice--particularly when its own party men are involved--to show that no one should feel emboldened enough to chance their luck. Also, assigning responsible and non-partisan monitoring officials at the points of sale is as paramount as properly informing the public about where and how they can easily obtain OMS rice--that has been dismally lacking so far. It has been a difficult year for the government with so much going on, but an even tougher one for those who have lost everything and now have nothing going for them. In some of the cases, the government did well and meant well, but in others, it made a hash of things. In some of the instances it was a handful of individuals at fault, but in others, the government's lack of action that allowed it.  Right now, those who have nothing going for them cannot afford to have the government make a hash of things any longer, nor its lack of action to alleviate their sufferings.

      "text": "Indian Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla's visit to Bangladesh was a breath of fresh air. We should all be grateful to him for the explanations and elucidations he kindly provided to address various \"misunderstandings\" regarding India today.      It appears to be sad but true that no one really \"understood\" the tenderness, compassion and open-mindedness of the current Indian leadership. Those Indian Muslims (who are determined to misunderstand everything), those ungrateful few in Bangladesh (who have apparently forgotten 1971), those progressive forces in India (who are all self-loathing Indians anyway), those people of the world including the UN, human rights activists, civil libertarians (who are confused)--they ALL \"misunderstood\" India's sensitive and enlightened spirit reflected in the policies and initiatives pursued by this administration.  For example, the CAA and NRC are obviously meant only to help the persecuted and marginalised, not to discriminate and exclude. These Bangladeshi Muslims living in India are being encouraged to leave only so that they may participate in the economic development of Bangladesh. Furthermore, they do not send back any money through remittances to Bangladesh, while just a handful of Indians working in Bangladesh remit billions of dollars to India (the fourth or fifth largest source of its foreign remittances). Therefore, the current regime is encouraging these people to return only with the best interests of Bangladesh in mind. There are other non-issues that clutter this relationship. For example, the Babri Masjid actions were necessary to right a historic wrong. It is part of India's efforts to liberate all these architectural sites supposedly constructed by the Muslim foreign invaders, which were actually either built by Hindus, or on Hindu sacred places to desecrate their religion. Do Romila Thapar, Irfan Habib, Ashutosh Varshney, Shashi Tharoor and all those so-called intellectuals know more about India's history than RSS Pracharaks? Those who want to visit these sites should go there promptly before the Taj Mahal becomes Rani Bhabani Mandir, although if President Trump decides to develop this property into a five-star hotel with a golf course, it may be called the Trump Mahal. And Kashmir is the MOTHER of all \"misunderstandings\". India HAS to protect Kashmiris from themselves, to save them from those evil fundamentalists of Pakistan. The government is even willing to change the country's constitution and its secular tradition which may perhaps cause a little inconvenience to a few Muslims, but it is being done to serve a higher cause. Didn't Lincoln suspend some rights during the Civil War in the US?  Why don't these self-righteous human rights activists complain about THAT?  There are some other \"issues\" that are brought up which should be clarified with reference to context. For example, river water is not being shared but only to protect Bangladesh from floods; there are trade imbalances but only to make Bangladesh more competitive; there are border killings but only to save Bangladesh from terrorists and smugglers (as Mr Shringla pointed out, there are more Indians than Bangladeshis who are killed by their security forces); coal-fired plants which would not be allowed to be built in India are being constructed by Indians in Bangladesh but only to ensure that India's environmental laws do not jeopardise the economic growth of Bangladesh; India's response to the Rohingya crisis is tepid, but only because of its conviction that Muslims should go to Muslim countries where they can be more comfortable, and also to demonstrate India's confidence that Bangladesh can handle all this without depending on the \"big brother\". It is sometimes suggested that India may betray a slightly superior tone when dealing with Bangladesh. What India would like to point out is that respect has to be EARNED. India's condescension is not an insult, it is an incentive to Bangladesh, and a message that it must develop greater maturity and self-confidence in order to be taken seriously. It is also worth mentioning that India could treat Bangladesh like Bhutan or Sikkim, but doesn't. There is insufficient appreciation in Bangladesh of this graciousness. It is abundantly clear that everything that India does is meant to help Bangladesh. The constant carping and criticism in Bangladesh are merely the selfish rants of some who have never heard of \"tough love\", nor have they read Shakespeare, when in Act 3, Scene 4, Hamlet says, \"I must be cruel only to be kind\" (though the setting is a bit awkward because he had just mistakenly killed his uncle Polonius).  As President Trump pointed out when neo-Nazi white supremacists rampaged through Charlottesville in 2017, that there were \"very fine people on both sides\". Bangladeshis have not properly understood that there may be some \"very fine people\" who may preach hatred and violence against Muslims in India. Incidentally, it should be pointed out that Mr Trump, with his great soul and subtle wit, \"understands\" Prime Minister Modi and therefore embraced him physically, as well as politically and spiritually.  Everyone must realise that this is a new India, a \"rising\" India, climbing out of the Gandhian/Nehruvian/Congress shadows which perverted its democracy through blatant coddling of minorities, particularly the Muslims. Today, if a Muslim even looks at a cow with longing eyes, appropriate action will be taken. This is only fair. Yes, they have been called \"termites\", but Hindus believe in the sacredness of ALL life, and hence no disrespect should be taken.  Of course, Mr Shringla did not necessarily say all of these things, but it is this narrative that formed the backdrop to his justifiable frustrations during his commanding (at times, perhaps a bit TOO commanding) performance at the public discussion that had been arranged.   The Mexican Nobel laureate Octavio Paz is supposed to have said that living next to a big and powerful neighbour is a blessing, but may also turn into a curse. Bangladeshis have always assumed the first, and fervently hopes that it never becomes the second.

Television images of the frequent devastating floods it suffered confirmed this characterisation. So the description stuck. Today, Bangladesh is a different country. The world may be slow in changing its opinion--although I am not so sure of that--but we in India have no right to be trapped in the 1970s. Yet, that's precisely what the junior home minister revealed last weekend. \"Half of Bangladesh will be empty (vacant) if India offers citizenship to them,\" said minister of state for home, G Kishan Reddy. \"Half of Bangladeshis will come over to India if citizenship is promised.\" Apart from the fact that he was undiplomatic and offensive, Reddy also revealed that he's ignorant of the true state of Bangladesh. Worse, he doesn't know that, in comparison to India, Bangladesh is performing far better on many, if not most of the indices that determine quality of life. First, Bangladesh is growing at a rate that we in India can only envy and hope to achieve two or three years down the road. Whilst we slip below 5 percent, Bangladesh is racing ahead at 8 percent. Second, while Nirmala Sitharaman desperately strives to attract investment leaving China by offering 15 percent rates of corporate tax, Bangladesh is one of the two countries where it's actually going. Consequently, high streets in London and New York are brimming with clothes made in Bangladesh, but very few produced in Ludhiana and Tirupur. No wonder Bangladesh's merchandise exports grew in double digits in fiscal 2019; India's sharply fell. However, economic performance is only one part of the growing difference that separates India from Bangladesh. The other is more telling. To put it bluntly, life in Bangladesh appears a lot more attractive than in India. Just look at the facts. Life expectancy for males and females in Bangladesh is 71 and 74 respectively. In India, the corresponding figure is 67 and 70. When you break down this big picture, the difference becomes even more striking. First, take children. Neonatal mortality in India is 22.73 per 1,000 live births; it is 17.12 in Bangladesh. Infant mortality is 29.94 in India versus 25.14 in Bangladesh. Our under-five mortality is 38.69; theirs is 30.16. Now, come to women. In Bangladesh, 71 percent of women above the age of 15 are literate, while 66 percent are so in India. In Bangladesh, female labour participation is 30 percent and rising; ours is 23 percent and has fallen by 8 percent in the last decade. Finally, the ratio of high school enrolment for boys and girls--a measure that indicates how the future is developing--is 0.94 in India but 1.14 in Bangladesh. Not only are things better on the other side of the border; they're going to get better still. We're falling behind. So when AK Abdul Momen, Bangladesh's foreign minister, says, \"Some Indian nationals are entering Bangladesh illegally for economic reasons\", he may well be right. People migrate to improve their lives, and life in Bangladesh seems decidedly better. If you're an Indian Muslim in danger of lynching because you trade in meat, accused of love-jihad because you've fallen in love with a Hindu, or in fear of losing your citizenship, you could easily be tempted to cross over to the other side. At the moment, there can't be too many inclined to journey in the opposite direction. The statistics I have quoted suggest that it's more attractive to be a termite in Bangladesh than a legal citizen in India. One last point: Someone should tell Reddy that if the United States of America promises citizenship, half of India will cross over. Actually, it will be far more. And, by the way, the fact that America's doors are presently shut isn't stopping us.   Karan Thapar is the author of Devil's Advocate: The Untold Story.

Many low-lying areas in Dhaka and its neighbouring districts, including Narayanganj, Munshiganj and Gazipur, have already been flooded, causing sufferings to thousands of people there. The FFWC said floodwater would enter the capital if the water level in the Balu river increased by another 27 centimetres crossing the danger mark. The Tongi canal has also swelled. Its water level was just 38 centimetres below the danger mark, showed a FFWC flood map. Nearly 100 villages have been inundated in Dohar in Dhaka and Sreenagar and Lohajang in Munshiganj as the water level of the Padma has increased, report our correspondents after visiting the areas. The mighty river has been eroding houses and other establishments. \"The river devoured a house at night. Those inside somehow managed to escape. But they could not take anything with them,\" said Iqbal Hossain of Malikanda village in Dohar's Narisha union yesterday. \"Most of the houses in our village have remained inundated for over a week. Many people have left this village and gone to other places after losing their houses in the flood,\" he said. Many villagers were cooking using LPG cylinders as their kitchens were partially submerged.  The schools in the area were shut. Local people were also facing difficulties in keeping their cattle safe. Tapu Begum, a woman from Brahmandi village in Munshiganj's Lohajang, said her family had been left marooned for the last eight days. She was also not being able to feed her three cows. The FFWC said the flood situation in the northern region would continue to improve as the water levels of the Jamuna, Dharla, Teesta and Dudhkumar rivers were going down. It also said the flood situation at the Meghna basin would improve as the water level of the Surma river was falling. The water level of the Padma was increasing but it was yet to cross the danger level, said the FFWC. People in the northern and northeastern flood-hit areas, especially those in remote places, continued to suffer due to lack of food and clean drinking water yesterday. Meanwhile, a two-year-old child drowned in floodwater in Omar Majid union of Kurigram's Rajarhat upazila yesterday morning. The victim was identified as Shajjad Hossain Rahat, son of Anisur Rahman of Bakshipara village."

      "text": "Every day's headlines tell us that the climate is changing, from wildfires in Australia to the suspicious absence of snow in Moscow. The science of climate change has never been stronger. The evidence base is overwhelming: on the causes of climate change, its impacts, as well as on solutions. Bangladesh, located on the delta of three major rivers and with a dense population, is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change. Its poorest, and women and children in particular, bear the brunt of disasters and stresses. More than 70 percent of the population is exposed to cyclones, and the economic impact is significant. Despite this, Bangladesh has made exemplary progress over the last decade in preparing for and mitigating the impacts of natural disasters. But there is much more to be done. Climate change means that floods, droughts and cyclones are likely to increase in frequency and intensity by 2050. The UK has been supporting Bangladesh in its efforts to adapt and build resilience for the future. It is now time to move forward with a partnership of equals, where the UK and Bangladesh share expertise and jointly invest in action on climate change and the environment. We in the UK can learn from Bangladesh's experiences in disaster management; and can share our own expertise in renewable energy systems. UK funds can complement the international climate finance Bangladesh can access for scaling up programmes that have proved successful. This year, the UK holds the presidency of the 26th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change--or COP26 for short. This event, in Glasgow in November 2020, will be the biggest international summit we have hosted in decades, bringing together some 30,000 people, including heads of state, climate experts, campaigners and entrepreneurs to agree coordinated action to tackle climate change. Countries such as Bangladesh--a vulnerable country but increasingly resilient to climate impacts, and a leading voice internationally--will be important partners in helping to secure the ambitious outcome we all need if the effects of climate change are to be contained. COP26 is the deadline by when parties (countries that have signed up to the Paris Agreement) must update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs; their plans for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases). The new NDCs have to be much more ambitious to close the emissions gap and get us back on track for warming well below 1.5 degrees. But there is also much unfinished business from COP25, which did not deliver the expectations of many countries. This will not be easy but we are up for the challenge. Right now, we are gearing up for the presidency and reaching out to all parties to try to raise the global ambition. It really moves this agenda forward to be working with a partner such as Bangladesh who will lead the Climate Vulnerable Forum and the Locally-Led Adaptation Action Track of the Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA). We need to work together and bring our respective and collective influence to bear on other countries to be as ambitious as possible. Both Bangladesh and the UK have centres of excellence that are contributing to global understanding of the science. Last month's Gobeshona conference organised in Dhaka by the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) demonstrated the wealth of scientific expertise in Bangladesh; and brought together international scientists from across the globe. We must pool our resources and work together more systematically to develop the evidence, test new ideas, and influence the decisions that are taken by governments and the private sector to achieve even greater progress on climate change. This includes filling knowledge gaps and generating new ideas and new technologies, all of which can help us to both adopt a greener development pathway and adapt better and more quickly to the inevitable impacts of the changing climate. When it comes to policies to tackle climate change, the UK and Bangladesh both have progressive and robust policies. The Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan was the first by a South Asian nation, and sets out projects for adaptation to climate change, as well as mitigation for a low carbon development path. We understand that Bangladesh's 8th Five Year Plan will have a strong focus on tackling environmental degradation, promoting low carbon development, and further strengthening Bangladesh's resilience to climate shocks. The Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund is the first ever national climate fund established by a Least Developed Country and has been an example to other countries for institutionalising national climate finance. Bangladesh already has two national organisations able to draw down funds from the Green Climate Fund and has successfully engaged the banking sector to boost its action to build resilience. In 2010, the Central Bank of Bangladesh introduced a USD 26 million refinancing facility for investments in green energy and effluent treatment plants, allowing commercial banks to access capital at lower rates and so increasing the profitability of green lending. We in the UK are playing our part. We were the first major economy to legislate for net-zero emissions by 2050. We are doubling our International Climate Finance (from GBP 5.8-11.6 billion over the period 2021-2025) to help developing countries take action. We will continue to drive forward global action on adaptation and resilience, with over 110 countries and over 70 organisations having endorsed the \"Call to Action\" launched at the UN Climate Action Summit with Egypt. We have called for urgent action on biodiversity as part of global efforts to tackle the causes and impacts of climate change, including investing GBP 220 million in a new International Biodiversity Fund and a GBP 40 million commitment towards reforestation. We set up the first ever Green Investment Bank to boost investment in low carbon projects. And the outgoing Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney, will soon become the UN Envoy on Climate Finance. So we have a lot to offer each other. But this is not a new partnership. Since 2008, the UK and Bangladesh have worked together to refine climate models to provide more accurate forecasting information, which in turn helped over 27 million people gain access to early warning systems for floods and cyclones and provided emergency assistance and recovery support after disasters to more than 900,000 people. The partnership is deepening, especially in the areas of science, policy and action. We are ensuring that climate and environment are a central part of all our development cooperation programmes with Bangladesh, and the UK government's Department for International Development (DFID) is planning major new climate and environment programmes covering mitigation and adaptation and environmental improvements which we hope to launch at COP26. As the leaders of the UK government effort here in Bangladesh, we see this UK-Bangladesh climate partnership as a dynamic force that will demonstrate what can be done to clean up growth and build resilience at home and globally. Partnership is not just for this year in which the UK hosts COP26, but for the long term. We firmly believe that UK and Bangladeshi combined expertise and combined leadership can mobilise global opinion and global citizens to act now to leave a cleaner, healthier planet for the next generation. There is no task more important for us all.   HE Robert Chatterton Dickson is British High Commissioner to Bangladesh, and Judith Herbertson is DFID Country Representative Bangladesh."

      "text": "The Bangladesh parliament has declared a planetary emergency in a resolution adopted a few days ago. This is indeed a major initiative and the parliamentarians should be applauded for it. Although other countries' parliaments--such as the United Kingdom--had declared climate emergency, Bangladesh is the first country to declare a planetary emergency. The difference is that the notion of a planetary emergency includes both climate change as well as biodiversity and pollution concerns. However, I am sure that the parliamentarians will agree that making such a declaration is not enough in itself and must be seen as the first step in tackling the problems that have risen to the level of an emergency. However, a few things should be kept in mind by the policymakers and the concerned authorities while addressing this issue of planetary emergency.  Climate emergency is primarily a global emergency with very strong implications for Bangladesh, which is one of the most vulnerable countries to the adverse impacts of climate change. This has two dimensions for us to consider. The first is for us to do our best to reduce our own emissions of greenhouse gases that facilitates climate change. Even though our emissions are not significant we should nevertheless ensure that we minimise emissions from use of energy, transport and industries as well as enhance our tree plantation programmes. However, the biggest climate emergency for Bangladesh is the fact that we are one of the most vulnerable countries to its adverse impacts, which will include more severe and frequent floods, more severe cyclones, more severe droughts and perhaps most importantly, salinity intrusion in the coastal zone due to sea level rise. The good news in this front is that Bangladesh has been well aware of this problem for over a decade and has developed the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) which has been implemented for nearly a decade and is now being revised to take it to 2030. Once the revised version is adopted it should become integrated into the 8th Five Year Plan as soon as possible. The integration or mainstreaming of climate change into all national, sectoral and local plans should be the highest priority under the climate emergency implementation plan. Another aspect of the climate emergency is the global one in which Bangladesh is among the most vulnerable countries and needs to play a more proactive leadership role at the Conference of Parties (COP) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). An important element in this strategy is to recognise that Bangladesh cannot simply speak for itself but must speak for all the vulnerable developing countries at the global meetings. The upcoming 25th COP which will be held in Madrid, Spain in December will be a good opportunity for Bangladeshi parliamentarians to present their resolution and share how we plan to implement it. The second planetary emergency is to do with protecting our biodiversity which includes both forests and aquatic species. Amongst the many issues to be concerned about is the protection of the Sundarbans, especially with the opening up of that region after the Padma Bridge is opened. This is something that the concerned Parliamentary Standing Committee should make a priority as once the damage is done it will be too late to rectify the situation. Another area to take into account is the planned development of the eastern side of Dhaka city which is currently a major wetland area. If this development does not take a genuine nature-based development approach we will simply repeat the problems of waterlogging that we have to endure in the western part of Dhaka, which has been built by destroying the many wetlands that used to exist. An important point to highlight in this regard is that simply having good legislation and laws to protect our biodiversity and natural environment is not enough as we have allowed the forces who have destroyed it to do so with complete impunity. So laws must be implemented and not just enacted. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Environment has an extremely important role to play in ensuring oversight of these laws by the ministries who are supposed to implement them. The third and final area I will focus on is the pollution that is becoming a bigger and bigger problem around the country, ranging from the overuse of plastic to the problem of effluents from industries, such as textiles and ship-breaking. A more recent problem is the deterioration of air quality in Dhaka. This is another example of good laws being in place but with very poor implementation. It is therefore essential to discuss the responsibility of the various departments or concerned bodies for implementing the planetary emergency plan. In addition, we need to identify and acknowledge our responsibility as conscious citizens and take necessary actions ourselves, from not polluting the environment and preventing others from doing so.

      "text": "Over 19 million children across Bangladesh -- a quarter of them under 5 -- bear the brunt of climate change disasters, according to a Unicef report which says the climate crisis threatens child nutrition in the country. The report also said natural disasters, including floods and riverbank erosion, are driving families to city slums, where they face overcrowding and a lack of access to healthy food, education, health services, sanitation and safe water. In slums, children must often fend for themselves and are at greater risks of malnutrition, child labour, child marriage and exposure to pollution, violence and abuse, according to the South Asia section of the global report. The report, titled \"The State of World's Children-2019 -- Children, food and nutrition: Growing well in a changing world\", was launched a week ago and has been uploaded to the Unicef website. The Unicef's flagship report examines issues related to children, food and nutrition, providing a fresh perspective on a rapidly evolving challenge. The report said despite progress in the past two decades, one-third of children under age 5 are malnourished -- stunted, wasted or overweight -- while two-thirds are at risk of malnutrition and hunger because of the poor quality of their diets. The report was prepared based on data from \"Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey-2014,\" says Unicef Bangladesh, adding that the next report is due next month. \"The latest report of the country's multiple indicator cluster survey is due next month and it will provide the updated situation of children nutrition.\" The report said a total of 58.7 million children under 5 were stunted and almost 25.9 million were wasted in South Asia. Now, more children and young people are surviving, but far too few are thriving, it said. Extreme climatic events such as drought and flash floods cause severe agricultural losses, it said. In a country like Bangladesh where 60 percent of the population counts on agriculture for their livelihood, this means children from the poorest families are most likely to go hungry, said the report. The reduced production also leads to an increase in food prices, hitting the poorest families the hardest. Besides, a rise in communicable and non-communicable diseases linked to changing climate conditions and unplanned urbanisation also threatens children and their families, Unicef said in the report. These diseases include diarrhoea, hepatitis A, cholera, dysentery, typhoid, dengue and chikungunya fever. The report mentions the story of Ruma, a woman living in the Chalantika slum in the capital Dhaka along with her husband and two children Sunjida, 3, and Shahaun, 9. They moved to the city after their home was repeatedly flooded by the Meghna river. \"At least we can stand on dry ground here even if we struggle with the cost of living,\" the report quoted Ruma as saying. \"My husband earns about Tk 7,000 a month. By the time we've paid our rent and bought our groceries there is very little left over. But at least we're able to earn here, which we often weren't able to do when we lived in the countryside.\" Ruma shares a small kitchen -- a few planks of wood atop bamboo poles set in a swamp -- with at least 10 other families. Her family eats rice and lentils most days, she says, and can occasionally afford meat or fish. Her son, Shahaun, is showing signs of malnourishment. In addition to the arduous challenge of trying to provide her family with healthy food, Ruma describes an unhealthy environment with no access to safe water, basic toilets or adequate hygiene. Electricity in the slum is irregular, and rodents and insects in their single room \"make our lives an absolute misery,\" the report says while depicting the sorry state of their living conditions.  The report blames the flooding that forced the family to move to the city on climate change. "

However, the spiraling problem of climate change has added a new dimension to the concept of peace. Peace is no longer just being threatened by violence--climate change has the potential to unleash a chain of events that can lead to war and conflict. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), more than seven million people had been displaced worldwide in the first six months of this year by extreme weather events such as, landslides, tornados, and floods; while as many as 22 million people might be displaced by the end of the year. What is alarming here is that IDMC suggests that this figure is double the number of people who had been displaced due to regional violence and conflict.  Appreciating the threats posed by climate change, the United Nations has declared \"Climate action for peace\" as the theme of this year's International Day of Peace. United Nations  Secretary General, while declaring the theme said, \"Today peace faces a new danger: the climate emergency, which threatens our security, our livelihoods and our lives. That is why it is the focus of this year's International Day of Peace. And it's why I am convening a Climate Action Summit.\" Bangladesh is considered to be at the frontline of the climate change crisis. According to Global Climate Risk Index 2019, Bangladesh ranked seventh among the countries most affected by extreme weather events in 20 years since 1998. The country is facing various climate related problems like droughts, rising sea levels, land erosion, cyclones, rising temperatures, flood, increased salinity, loss of cultivable lands and so on. According to International Monetary Fund, one-third of Bangladesh's population is at risk of displacement in the face of rising sea levels. Thousands of children from various school and colleges joined the global climate strike in Dhaka yesterday, as part of a global movement inspired by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. They staged demonstrations at the capital's Manik Mia Avenue calling upon the world leaders to act against climate change. This highlights the urgency of initiatives that are required to address climate change worldwide.  According to report by Germanwatch, a Berlin-based environmental organisation, in 2017, 407 people died in Bangladesh as a result of extreme weather-related events like storms, cyclones, floods and landslide. The country also suffered an economic loss of about $2826.68 million due to climate change. Environmental degradation presents multidimensional problems for the country. It can cause loss of livelihood, affect social constructs and lead to unhealthy competition for depleting resources, leading to tensions, crimes and violence.   Loss of goods and property, and agricultural land due to flood or river erosion can cause tension among the affected people, since these limit their economic opportunities, make food scarce and consequently put them in a desperate struggle for control of cultivable land. The loss and degradation of land also lead to increased unemployment. This also potentially triggers crimes, as desperate people resort to whatever means they can to earn their sustenance. Moreover, this leads to internal migration, as people move to other areas--especially big cities--in search of subsistence. As per a Deutsche Welle report, in August 2017 flood had drowned the land and crops of 6.8 million people in northwestern Bangladesh. The land that was totally submerged accounted for over 16,000 hectares, while another 560,000 hectares of crops were partially damaged by the flood. According to official estimates, in 2017 alone, the livelihoods of at least eight million people living in Bangladesh had been affected by flood. And flood is just one of the many outcomes of climate change. In addition, increased salinity of water due to rising sea level is not only making water a scarce resource, but is also severely affecting farming. This is encouraging competition for access to useable/drinkable water, leading to unrest and clashes. Health complications are also on the rise in areas affected by rising water salinity, as people who are being forced to drink this water, often end up with serious health problems. This also potentially triggers internal migration, as people are often forced to seek livelihood elsewhere when the water in their areas become contaminated.    The loss of habitable, cultivable land, droughts, storms and other problems faced by the people living in rural areas are forcing them to migrate to cities, adding further pressure on our strained resources. According to Internal Displaced Monitoring Centre, 78,000 people were displaced in Bangladesh between January 1 and December 31, 2018, due to disasters. As of December 31, 2018, the total number of internally displaced in Bangladesh stood at 426,000. The constant outflow of people from rural areas of Bangladesh to the cities, due to depletion of resources and shrinking employment and livelihood opportunities are resulting in major problems for urban planning and management. After migration these people, if lucky, end up in slums, where lives are always at risk of fire hazards among other potentially fatal threats. These internally displaced people add to the burden of unemployment, overpopulation and increase tension over sharing of the already strained resources, causing resentment among the city dwellers. This social stress can be a trigger for unrest and conflict. Moreover, often the displaced people have to resort to criminal means to earn their livelihoods: peddling drugs, mugging and getting involved in other crimes. This creates further unrest in the society, causing fear and antipathy among the residents. The migrants often have trouble assimilating with the existing residents, as the latter see them as \"outsiders\" and often blame them for unemployment and underemployment. The Bangladesh government has taken up pragmatic steps to address the problem of climate change. It has developed the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) and cleared the Delta Plan 2100 in order to combat the negative impacts of climate change. These measures are commendable; however, the government must follow through. The policy makers must also take measures to address the immediate problems created by climate change. The authorities should focus on empowering local administration with resources and decision-making capacity to address the issues locally, since most of these climate related problems are localised, and consider decentralisation of the capital and relocate key industries and institutions to the outskirts of the city to take off the extra load. It should also ensure proper implementation of the climate adaption and mitigation strategies to avert the bigger problems that would surface in the long-run. The Bangladesh government must strongly urge the world leaders at the upcoming UN Climate Summit to take immediate measures to address global climate emergencies and urge America to came back to the Paris Agreement and work with the other countries in fighting climate change. Efforts at global, regional and, most importantly, national levels are required to make the world more peaceful by eliminating the risks posed by climate change. Historically war has been about resources, and depletion of resources by climate change has the potential to push the world towards further wars. It is high time, our government and world governments rollup their sleeves and get down to meaningful actions, in order to bring sustainable peace to the world.

Her childhood was a happy one; she had rice to eat, fields to play in and a heart filled with hope that, in the coming years, she would be a wife and a mother.    Over the four years of her marriage, her dreams were slowly shattered, with not one but three miscarriages, and the beginning of social ostracism. Mashkura was a victim of exposure to excess salinity. As sea levels rise and the coast is hit by increasingly erratic storms and tidal surges, the salinity levels of the open sea spread north into non-coastal areas, impacting the lives of millions like Mashkura. Her story is only one example of how Bangladesh pays dearly for the world's failure to take action against climate change. This unnecessary pain is unacceptable. Even though developed countries are primarily responsible for climate change, the International Institute for Environment and Development found that the rural poor in Bangladesh were spending an average of USD 2 billion a year to address the impacts of climate change--more than the government and aid agencies' spending put together. International financing covers only 4 percent of spending on climate action in Bangladesh. Thus, struggling rural communities are left to bear most of the burden of climate change themselves. World leaders agreed in 2015 at the 21st sitting of the Conference of Parties (COP21) on the importance of \"averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change,\" including slow-onset disasters like salination. Little has been achieved since then. The parties were caught in a tussle about how to define and measure the losses, while thousands like Mashkura continue to suffer. Bangladesh is a low-lying delta crammed with 170 million people, battered frequently by fierce cyclones, and threatened with submersion in a matter of decades if the world keeps warming at its current rate. The Long-Term Climate Risk Index ranks Bangladesh 7th among the countries most affected by extreme weather events since 1998, and predicts that it will have 42 million people at risk by 2050. There are around 35 million people currently living along the coastal belt of the Bay of Bengal, on the edge of a climate catastrophe. The immediate impacts of storms and tidal upsurges are well-known and often spoken about, but we hear less about the resulting salinity increases, and the dangers they bring. Each time a tidal surge sweeps inland, salty water from the sea contaminates farms and water sources. The effects are manifested in worsening crop yields, malnutrition and drastic economic effects. Diseases and miscarriages during pregnancy are major concerns. ICDDR,B monitored 12,867 pregnancies between 2012 and 2017 and found that women living within 20km of the coastline were far likelier to miscarry than women who lived further inland. Other areas of Bangladesh are also battling climate change. The northeast faces floods every year, which are increasing both in duration and magnitude as the climate crisis intensifies. The hill tracts in the east face drastic landslides causing loss of lives and homes each year. The riverine sedimentary deltas, or \"chars\" as they are locally known, are continually eroding, breaking up and disappearing in one place and forming in another. Millions of people live in these neglected places and their migratory communities. Many of them have had to relocate and start anew as many as 20-30 times in their lives. Each time, they lose nearly all of their assets, becoming poorer and poorer. The char communities have long been vulnerable to floods, droughts and erosion. But now the increasing unpredictability of these events has made life nearly unbearable. The impermanence of the land makes it impossible to have electric or gas lines, roads or permanent buildings on the chars. Traditional infrastructure is impossible in these regions, and a service delivery mechanism suited to this unique landscape is yet to be put in place. As a result, in spite of goodwill from all sides, they are, in reality, totally cut off from basic services--be it healthcare, education, legal services, financial assistance, or often even disaster relief. The rivers at their broadest can be 25km in breadth and, whilst in spate, can flow between 10 to 12 knots! The little worn-out boats available in the areas are inadequate for service delivery, rendering the communities more vulnerable to the impacts of the changing climate. It was in these areas that Friendship began its journey with a floating hospital in 2002. Since then, the organisation has expanded to include more floating and land hospitals, satellite clinics, \"community medic-aides\" and programmes for climate adaptation, economic development, education, inclusive citizenship and cultural preservation. We have developed a three-tier system structured around the floating or land hospitals, with satellite clinics and community medic-aides trained by Friendship and equipped with app-based mobile health services. This system allows Friendship to reach 6.5 million people from the most remote and unaddressed communities in the world. And it is thus with the help of Friendship paramedic Sangita Boral that Mashkura has finally become a proud mother. The solution was simple: she switched to drinking water from a nearby desalination plant, which Friendship had installed a couple of years ago. But there are many more climate victims like Mashkura. They do not get any benefit from the progress of the 21st century, the growth of companies, innovations of our world, the onrush of the 4th Industrial Revolution. They only see their one life ebbing away in a state of bare survival. The government of Bangladesh and non-governmental organisations have been working on disaster preparedness in the coastal belt, and there have been massive improvements in prediction, mitigation, preparation, protocols, procedures, lifestyles, architecture, infrastructure, etc. The death rates have drastically diminished in the last few decades; however, lives are still lost, along with harvests, livestock, homes and properties. Cyclones and floods still disrupt millions of lives. Only when you die and become a statistic, are your issues addressed somewhere in the world scene; but while suffering mentally or physically, you are not a statistic and thus you remain unaccounted for, unaddressed. However, Bangladesh's vulnerability makes it an important player in the fight against climate change. The government and many non-government agencies, like Friendship, have worked for years to develop innovative solutions for the communities to cope with the climate change issues. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called our prime minister \"one of the few global leaders on climate change.\" He also said that Bangladesh was \"the best teacher to learn from about adaptation.\" This is because we get to learn harsh lessons from the climate each day. The entirety of Friendship's work is in climate-impacted areas, and all of our beneficiaries are people who are displaced or otherwise endangered by immediate climate impact. The work we do could help climate-impacted communities around the world. Bangladesh has learnt many lessons in climate change resilience. It is, however, impossible for us to make a difference in the world without a committed and sincere effort on the part of the international community. This is why every nation, regardless of whether they are contributing to or impacted by climate change, needed to agree at COP25 to invest in averting, minimising and addressing loss and damage due to climate change. Instead, final decisions on rules for carbon markets and trading emissions credits have been again postponed to next year at COP26... whilst millions of lives are likely to fall apart during these 365 days of waiting. Leaders have tended to treat the matter of loss and damage as a \"compensation\" paid by wealthy, polluting nations to climate-impacted ones--like a yellow card to the offending team. But the reality of the situation is that there are no teams. We are all one team, on the brink of a great loss. It is true that today countries like Bangladesh are most vulnerable to climate change, and therefore pay the price for carbon emissions all over the world. But climate change is not a Bangladeshi problem, and its impacts are not going to be felt by any one country alone. As such, if the developed countries of the world invest in solutions, and even if they happen to be put into practice in Bangladesh, this is merely a test run for solutions that everyone will eventually need. We need to reframe the question of \"loss and damage\" as a global expense, for which the sooner we start paying, the better.

In Lalmonirhat, more than a half lakh people of shoal areas of Teesta and Dharala rivers were trapped in floodwater. At least 63 villages of Hatibandha, Kaliganj, Aditmari, Sadar upazilas were inundated with floodwater for the past few days. The water level of Teesta River is flowing 18 centimetres above the danger level while Dharala River water is flowing 13 centimetres above danger mark. Embankments in Shiberkuti area of Kulaghat upazila and in Dhuni area of Hatibandha broke down as the Indian government opened 54 gates of Gajaldoba barrage. Following the incident, the Teesta Barrage Authority is trying to control the water by opening 44 gates of the barrage, according to sources at local office of Bangladesh Water Development Board. The people were suffering from scarcity of pure water, sanitation, food and enough shelters, witnesses said. In Kurigram, the overall flood situation has further deteriorated as new areas are going under water due to the increase of water levels of all the rivers including Brahmaputra, Teesta, Dharala and Dudhkumar. The water level of Brahmaputra River is flowing 20 centimetres above the danger level at Chilmari point while Dharala River at Bridge point is flowing 12 centimetres above the danger mark. More than 1.5 lakh people of over 200 villages of Ulipur, Chilmari, Roumari, Rajibpur and Sadar upazilas have become marooned. Scarcity of food and pure water has become acute in the flood-affected areas and normal life is being hampered as many roads went under water. People are facing acute shortage of food and drinking water. Waterborne diseases were spreading fast in the flood-hit areas while no relief or medicine reached yet. At least 80 educational institutes were shut down following the flood, said locals, adding that hundreds of hectares of cropland were inundated. District Civil Surgeon Dr SM Aminul Islam said a total of 88 medical teams have been formed for rendering services to the flood victims. Moreover, the district health department has cancelled all kinds of leave for its staff including doctors and health assistants to tackle any situation, he added. Contacted, Deputy Commissioner of Kurigram Abu Saleh Mohammad Ferdous Khan said some 2,000 packets of dried food, 150 metric tonnes of GR rice and Tk 3,25,000 were allocated for the flood affected people. So far, the overall situation is under control, he further said."

      "text": "Inflation rose 10 basis points to 5.62 percent in July as both food and non-food prices moved upwards. In June, inflation was 5.52 percent, down 11 basis points compared to the previous month, because of a decline in both food and non-food prices. Planning Minister MA Mannan released the monthly consumer price index report of the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics at the National Economic Council in Dhaka yesterday. He said the inflation slightly increased in the first month of the fiscal year as prices of vegetables rose because of heavy rains and floods in the rural areas. The floods and rains hampered production and disrupted the supply chain.  Besides, people bought more products in Eid-ul-Azha, pushing up the price of both food and non-food items. Food inflation was up two basis points from 5.40 percent in June to 5.42 percent in July, while non-food inflation rose to 5.94 percent last month, up 23 basis points from 5.71 percent a month ago. Zahid Hussain, a former lead economist of the World Bank Bangladesh, said floods were likely to have caused the increase in food inflation in July relative to June, while implementation of the new VAT law and the upward revision in gas prices contributed to the rise in non-food inflation both relative to June 2019 and July 2018. He said a very strong growth in remittance in July is likely to have boosted demand pressure on both food and non-food inflation. The spending on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha added about Tk 40,000 crore to the economy, up 29 percent year-on-year. About Tk 28,687 crore came from cattle sales and the remaining Tk 15,000 crore through the sales of commodities, refrigerators, freezers, clothing and furniture alngside transportation and tourism. This expenditure hit the inflation in July, according to a BBS statement. Vegetables became significantly pricier throughout July largely due to inundated farmlands. Green chili was sold at Tk 180 to Tk 200 a kg at kitchen markets in the capital last month, up from Tk 70 to Tk 90. Prices of onion and garlic were up by Tk 10 to Tk 30 per kg."

      "text": "Heavy monsoon rains across South Asia claimed more lives Wednesday, with the death toll passing 200 as authorities tried to reach stranded villagers cut off by surging floodwaters. The annual deluge is crucial to replenishing water supplies in the impoverished region, but the rains from June to September often turn deadly. Across India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan, millions of residents have been affected and hundreds of thousands displaced, with homes and boats washed away. In flood-prone Bangladesh, which is criss-crossed by rivers, around one-third of the country is underwater and people were being killed by lightning strikes, officials said. In India, the death toll rose to at least 120 and entire communities were cut off by rising floodwaters which damaged or submerged roads. \"It's been 15 days (since) this area has been flooded,\" a local resident in Assam, where the death toll reached 22, told AFP. \"The damage it has caused is very bad. Cattle have also been affected. Everything has been destroyed.\" Video footage shared on social media showed rescuers pulling a rhinoceros calf from swollen floodwaters at the state's World Heritage-listed Kaziranga National Park, which is home to two-thirds of the world's remaining one-horned rhinos. In Bihar, which borders Nepal -- and like Assam is one of the worst-affected regions in India -- locals told AFP they were unable to reach food supplies. Some 33 deaths have been reported and 2.5 million residents affected. Locals were erecting makeshift shelters on elevated land with the meagre belongings they had salvaged from the floodwaters. In Mumbai, the number of victims from a building collapse following heavy rains rose to 13. In the worst-affected Bangladesh district of Kurigram, deputy district administrator Hafizur Rahman told AFP a woman and four children died after their small boat sank in floodwaters. Others were killed by landslides in Cox's Bazar district -- home to nearly one million Rohingya Muslim refugees who have fled a military crackdown in Myanmar. In Nepal, the aid agency Save the Children said severe flooding and landslides had left tens of thousands of people homeless, with many stranded outdoors or marooned. At least 78 people have died and 16,000 families have been displaced. \"It's absolutely essential that we reach these communities to avoid this turning into a health emergency,\" Save the Children's Nepal country director Ned Olney said in a statement."

The situation in Kurigram, Jamalpur, Gaibandha, Bogura and Sirajganj districts is likely to worsen today, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre said yesterday. The FFWC has been monitoring different rivers from 93 stations, of which 26 stations reported dangerously high levels of water. Moreover, the northern and north-eastern regions may see medium to heavy rainfall today, it said. The Road Transport and Bridges Ministry directed its officials to ensure road communication across the country. In Netrakona, at least 213 schools in Kalmakanda and Durgapur upazilas have been closed, officials said. \"We were forced to suspend classes as students can't reach school using to flooded roads,\" said Ataur Rahman Khan, headteacher of Nazirpur Palli Jagoron High School in Durgapur. Classes have been suspended in at least 813 schools in Sylhet region, 392 in Kurigram, 300 in Bandarban, 65 in Mymensingh's Dhobaura, 37 in Sherpur, 64 in Lalmonirhat, 21 in Nilphamari, 65 in Bogura, and 115 in Gaibandha.  \"Our home has been flooded. We have evacuated for survival. How will I send my son to school?\" asked Sirajul Islam, whose son goes to Bandarban Town Primary School. Head teacher of the school Sohel Azad said, \"Around 100 families took shelter in our school. Classes are out of question.\" However, the district's overall flood situation started improving yesterday. In Kurigram, 76 schools are being used as flood shelters. \"I haven't been to school in a week. My teachers and parents asked me not to go to school until the flood goes away,\" said Baizid Alam, a fourth grader of Pachgachhi Government Primary School in the town. In Sylhet division, an additional 37 schools may have to shut down in a day or two, said Jahangir Ahmed, deputy director at the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education in Sylhet. In Lalmonirhat, Head Teacher Abdus Salam of Arazi Chongadar Karim Uddin Govt Primary School said teachers were coming to schools on boats while the classes have been suspended three days ago.  In Nilphamari, 12 schools were severely damaged by flood in Dimla and Kishoreganj upazilas. In Gaibandha, father of a 5th grader, Solaiman Ali said, \"We are busy struggling to survive. We will think about education later.\" Education officials in different districts said they would try to compensate for the missed classes by taking extra ones after the flood.

Many people, along with their livestock, had to seek shelter on roads, Water Development Board dams and flood shelters in the areas. \"We took shelter on the road as floodwater from the Teesta entered our house on Friday night,\" said Nazrul Islam, 58, of Bagdora village in Lalmonirhat. In Sylhet, six rivers were overflowing at seven points on Friday evening. Reduced rainfall, however, has resulted in the water level decreasing. The river Surma was flowing 35cm above the danger level at Kanaighat point and 54cm at Sunamganj town yesterday. The old Surma river was overflowing 19cm above the danger level at Derai, according to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) of the Bangladesh Water Development Board. Flash floods following heavy rains submerged Tahirpur, Derai and Sadar upazilas in Sunamganj, Habiganj Sadar upazila in Habiganj, Jaintapur, Kanaighat, Gowainghat and Companiganj upazilas in Sylhet and Rajnagar upazila Flash floods hit Sylhet and parts of north in Moulvibazar. People in many of the places were unable to go out as road communications were snapped. Karuna Sindhu Chowdhury, chairman of Tahirpur upazila, said about 50 villages in the upazila had been affected by flash floods so far and the situation would worsen if the water did not recede. Upazila Nirbahi Officer Bishwajit Kumar Paul of Jaintapur in Sylhet said the overflowing Sari and other rivers triggered Friday's flash flood. FFWC sub-divisional Engineer Sardar Uday Raihan said the flood situation would improve in four to five days as no rain was forecasted for the next seven days. Officials of the four district administrations said they had taken necessary steps, including giving out flood alerts and preparing relief materials. In Lalmonirhat, overflowing water from the two main rivers -- Teesta and Dharla -- and of the 10 other small rivers inundated over 40 villages yesterday. Low-lying areas in Teesta and Dharla river basin under five upazilas of the district were also inundated. In Lalmonirhat alone, the flood has left 40,000 people marooned. He said water in the two major rivers were flowing near the danger level, which could be crossed in the next 12 hours if the situation did not improve. The floods have also resulted in an acute lack of drinking water in many of the affected areas. Sirazul Islam, 52, of Balapara village in Aditmari upazila, said many tubewells were submerged, leaving the locals with a few sources of drinking water. \"We are living a subhuman life,\" he said. Meanwhile, river erosion turned fiercer in some villages of Lalmonirhat Sadar, Aditmari, and Hatibandha upazilas. Azahar Ali, 48, of Kurul village in Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila, said his four bigha arable land was devoured in the last four days. Lalmonirhat Deputy Commissioner Abu Zafor said they were monitoring the flood situation and working to rehabilitate those affected. WDB official Bajle Karim said temporary work would be done to primarily check erosion. In Gaibandha's Sundarganj, char lands along the Teesta river basin in Kapasia, Belka, Haripur, Chandipur, Tarapur and Sripur unions were inundated. Water started to rise on Thursday night, said Rafiqul Islam, ward member of Kapasia union, adding that if the trend continued, the char lands would be flooded in the next 24 hours. Meanwhile, Haripur Union Parishad Chairman Rafiul Islam said some 700 families have been marooned in his union.

Teesta, Dharla, Jamuna, Dudhkumari, Bangalee and its adjacent rivers are flowing above the danger level, said the Water Development Board (WDB). In addition, fresh areas were inundated after dam collapse, and around 40 villages in Kurigram are at risk with two embankments being on the verge of collapse.     \n \"Water in the rivers of northern districts will rise in two or three days before starting to recede,\" said Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, executive engineer of WDB, and duty officer of Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC). Over 4.8 million people are still affected by floods in 17 districts, according to National Disaster Response Coordination Centre. The FFWC yesterday monitored river conditions at 93 stations across the country, and found that water was flowing above the danger level at 18 stations. The water level in Teesta, Dharla, Brahmaputra, and other rivers of the northern region and Surma-Kushiyara will rise today, but the Jamuna water level may remain steady, according to a bulletin of the FFWC, which was updated yesterday. Flood situation in Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Bogura, Tangail, Sirajganj, Manikganj, Rajbari, Faridpur and Munshiganj may remain unchanged, but conditions may deteriorate in Sylhet and Sunamganj to some extent.

LALMONIRHAT\n Many areas of Lalmonirhat were submerged yesterday although water started receding a few days back. \"We returned home on Sunday after staying on the road for 10 days. But water entered our home again today (Wednesday). So, we came back to the road,\" said Asadul Islam, 56, of Char Shiberkuti area under the sadar upazila. \"My house was damaged by the first phase of flood. I could not repair it due to lack of money. But flood has hit again. I can't understand what to do now,\" said Kadbanu Bewa, 58, a resident of Char Kulaghat under the sadar upazila. Dharla was flowing 27 centimetres (cm) above the danger level at Shimulbari point in Lalmonirhat sadar upazila, and Teesta above 15cm of the danger level at Teesta Barrage point in Hatibandha upazila yesterday noon, said Bajle Karim, sub-divisional engineer of WDB in the district. BOGURA Around 80,000 people of 60 villages in Sonatala, Sariakandi, Dhunat, Gabtoli and sadar upazilas of Bogura have been freshly affected by floods in the last couple of days, said sources at the district administration. Bangalee and Jamuna rivers were flowing 100cm and 14cm above the danger level in the district respectively, said Hasan Mahmud, executive engineer WDB in Bogura. KURIGRAM Flood situation worsened again in Kurigram with the river water rising. Dharla was flowing 50cm above the danger level at Dharla Bridge point in the sadar upazila and Brahmaputra 25cm above the danger level at Chilmari Ghat point of Chilmari upazila yesterday evening, according to local WDB office. Besides, two embankments at Phulbari and Ulipur upazilas are at high risk of collapse. If the embankments give way, around 40 villages will be flooded. \"Our houses and land will go under water if the embankment fails. We, the local people, are trying to protect the dam with sand bags and bamboo pillars. But it may collapse anytime,\" said Jewel Miah, 48, of Char Barolaye village under Phulbari upazila. Kurigram WDB Executive Engineer Ariful Islam said they would take prompt action to protect the embankments. MYMENSINGH Around 200 houses and vast areas of croplands were freshly inundated in Mymensingh yesterday after a portion of the flood protection embankment collapsed in Charshirta Konapara area of the sadar upazila. The dam collapsed around 8:00am. As a result, a huge amount of water entered, inundating houses and land within a few hours. Many affected families were seen rushing to higher grounds and flood shelters with their belongings and cattle. Due to the onrush of water, the ponds overflew and released the fish, said locals. The district WDB executive engineer, Jahurul Islam, said necessary steps will be taken soon to reconstruct the dam. Local Government Division Deputy Director in Mymensingh AKM Galib Khan said they were preparing a list of victim families to distribute relief."

      "text": "Around 6.77 lakh hectares of croplands have been damaged by the recent flood that affected about 61 lakh people in 28 districts, says the government statistics. Crops on 5.32 lakh hectares were destroyed and the rest damaged. Besides, 5.66 lakh houses were affected -- 33,635 destroyed and 5,32,643 damaged. Talking about road communications, Shah Kamal, senior secretary of the disaster management and relief ministry, at a press briefing at the ministry yesterday said over 7,000kms of roads were affected. Of them, 292km were destroyed and 6,735km damaged. The flood also razed 42 educational institutions and damaged 4,857 others. But the secretary did not give any details about what kind of educational institutions those were. The financial loss caused by the flood was yet to be estimated. It will be assessed after water recedes from all the affected areas. It may take 15 days more, said Kamal. Aimed at protecting the people from flood, the government is planning to build embankments on both sides of all major rivers across the country. The embankments will be constructed with the financial assistance of the Japan government. Discussion is going on in this regard, said the secretary. Addressing the briefing, State Minister for the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry Enamur Rahman said the government allocated Tk 4.71 crore, 27,350 tonnes of rice, 1.13 lakh packets of dry food, 8,500 tents, and 3,900 bundles of corrugated iron sheets as relief materials for the affected people.  Furthermore, Tk 1.17 crore was allocated for repairing houses, Tk 24 lakh for procuring cattle fodder and Tk 18 lakh for buying child food, he said. \"There is no scarcity of relief materials. Even though flood continues for three months, the government has the capacity to provide the affected people with relief.\" Replying to a query, the state minister said there was no possibility of prolonged flood. He also presented a document that said 75 people died due to the flood in 14 districts from July 11 to 25. Sixty-seven drowned and eight died in boat capsize. Of the victims, 56 were children, 13 men, and six women. At the briefing, Bangladesh Water Development Board Executive Engineer Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan said water of all major rivers was dropping and water of the rivers would come below the danger level in the next two days. There is no possibility of massive flood in the country within the next two weeks, he said. Speaking at the briefing, Bangladesh Meteorological Department Director Shamsuddin Ahmed said rainfall decreased in Bangladesh as well as the upstream areas in India and Nepal. So, water level of all major rivers in Bangladesh will continue to fall. Our correspondents reported on the flood situation at different districts yesterday. In Lalmonirhat, different waterborne diseases have broken out in the flood- affected areas. \"We returned home from a flood shelter on Saturday as water receded. Just after returning home, two members of our family had diarrhoea,\" said Mahir Uddin, 66, of Khuniagachh in Sadar upazila. In Kurigram, many flood victims have been passing their days in misery at flood shelters for around two weeks. \"I took shelter here around 15 days ago. Since then, we are getting food once or twice a day. We are facing crisis of drinking water and toilet facilities,\" said Jahanara Begum, 30, of Tapu Bhelakopa village under Kurigram municipality, who took shelter on an embankment. Our correspondents in Pabna, Sirajganj and Gaibandha reported that flood situation was improving there."

      "text": "Let me begin my speech in this birthday webinar organized by the High Commission of India in Dhaka to commemorate Rabindranath Tagore's 159th birthday by referring to his last public address, Sabhyater Sankat or Crisis in Civilization. Read out on behalf of the unwell poet four months before his death on 14 April, 1941, it is an address made pessimistic initially, not only by the shadow cast on the whole world by the seemingly all-engulfing Second World War, but also by the colonial arrogance on display then. But for Rabindranath, though the situation was grim, and though misery, misunderstanding and violence seemed to cloud the horizon, hope was not something to be forsaken, even in an apparently apocalyptic situation. To quote from the concluding section of the poet's speech, although all around him were \"crumbling ruins of a proud civilization strewn like a vast heap of futility,\" he would not \"commit the grievous sin of losing faith in Man\" (The Essential Tagore, 215). Rabindranath goes on in his speech to envision \"a dawn\" emerging eventually, in all likelihood from the East, \"where the sun rises,\" to allow humankind to reclaim their \"lost heritage\" (216). Rabindranath Tagore thus offered to a world, even when fratricidal armies were clashing bloodily in one of the gloomiest phases of human history, a \"ray of hope\" through his vision of the future. This is why I believe that the theme chosen by the Indian High Commission of Bangladesh at this critical juncture of human existence is a particularly apt one--kabiguru offers us through this final address to the world, as he always did through his works and philosophical musings as well as his actions, a demonstration of his unwavering faith in humankind. Rabindranath, is ultimately the poet of hope, encouraging all of us to cope with public as well as personal crises, through his actions, as well as his words. Now that we are in a corona-infected world, confined to our homes, constricted in our movements, and leading cramped lives in shrinking, bordered spaces, more than ever, we need to remember on this birthday event what Rabindranath articulated at every turn of his eighty years in the planet---hope is what we can never abandon. For him, the sun will rise again and break through night, inevitably, naturally and invigoratingly. Surely, his father Maharshi Debendranath Tagore had been prophetic in naming him Rabindranath-- for he is truly \"Robi,\" a sun who can guide us in these, and all other times of crisis. Personally, I am more addicted to Rabindranath's songs than any other genres or creative outlets that streamed from him, and so let me focus in particular on one of his best-loved songs, \"Anandodhara Bohiche Bhubane,\" (Happiness Streams Across the Universe), to see how he himself coped with personally difficult situations. The song was composed in 1908 at a time when Rabindranath had become overwhelmed by personal tragedies. His dear wife and unfailing helpmeet Mrinalini Devi became ill and died on 23 November, 1902; nine months later, his daughter Renuka died at the age of thirteen; Satis Roy, a young poet and teacher of his Shantiniketan school he was particularly fond of, died four months later of typhoid then raging in Bengal, and his youngest and dearest child, the thirteen-year old Samindra, died of cholera in November 1907. As Rabindranath's biographer Krishna Kripalani, puts it, it was as if God had \"sent him, as He had done to His Servant Job of the Old Testament, a series of bereavements and afflictions\" to try him (201). What he does in the song, however, is admonish himself for letting depression grip him when God seemed to be sending down every day reasons for living. As Rabindranath berates himself in the song, why was he sitting alone, submerged in the self, and \"feeling forlorn,\" when day and night heavenly bliss was splashing across the universe, and the sun and moon beaming down forever? He should rather consider his sorrows \"inconsequential,\" fill the void in his life with love for others, and act positively. This then is the kind of philosophical musing offering rays of hope to us that we can recall on his 159th birthday in this corona-infected year. Let us remember at this time too that during these years of bereavement, Rabindranath was fully involved in all kinds of humanitarian and national causes and not only writing poetry and staying depressed. After all, these were the years when he was running his fledgling school in Shantiniketan set up for altruistic purposes with his own money, taking an active part in the swadeshi movement till he got fed up with its excesses and increasingly communal bent, and working on schemes to help the peasants in his estates in east Bengal lead better lives. Always, Rabindranath was the activist coming up with ways of helping people cope with the consequences of the natural or man-made disasters periodically ravaging the subcontinent. An example that comes to my mind on this occasion is the way he decided to aid the victims of people suffering from the famine-like conditions created by floods in North Bengal in 1932. What he did on this occasion was adapt for performance the long poem he had first written in English titled \"The Child\" that he had subsequently recreated as the Bengali poem \"Shisu Thirta\" in 1932. This adapted version became a Kolkata fund-raising event organized to help distressed people. What we find then is Rabindranath typically contributing the way he could at a moment of crisis, yet again. The Rabindranath I would like us to commemorate on this birthday webinar is therefore the activist, as well as the seer-poet, who offered again and again rays of hope for his people through his life and works. In a part of the book he translated as Thoughts from Rabindranath Tagore, he urges us to \"meet the morning light\" and not sit with our face \"turned away\" from it; in his essay on \"Hindus and Muslims,\" he exhorts them to 'demolish the barriers that have been built\" in their minds; in another essay titled \"The Tenant Farmer\" he points out that no matter how difficult the situation is, one must not give up \"the will to live\"; in his breakthrough poem \"Nirjharer Swapna-Bhanga\" or \"The Fountain's Awakening\" he is rhapsodic in the final line because \"the sun has finally found its way!\" In another poem \"Sabhyatar Prati\" or \"To Civilization\" he declares that we must \"burst through all barriers that hem us in and feel/This boundless universe's pulsating heartbeat!\" In his last, death-bed poem, \"Tomar Srishtir Poth\" or \"On the Way to Creation\", he tells us to embrace \"truth\" and cleanse \"our innermost being by its light\". And in a song-lyric he wrote on one of his birthdays, \"Hey Notun\" or \"O Herald of the New,\" he urges himself to be \"Like the rising sun/ Burst through the heart of the void and unveil yourself/ Let life be revealed as triumphant.\" Rabindranath Tagore, then, is forever our \"robi\" shining steadfastly over our part of the world, sending his rays of hope across the subcontinent, and even to other parts of the world, warming our hearts and minds with his poems, songs, plays, dance-dramas, fiction, prose, the institutions he created like Visva-Bharati or Sriniketan, and, indeed, through his exemplary life. His musings on the world of the spirit, harmony between peoples, the limitations of nationalism and the need for an international outlook; his thoughts on rural reconstruction, cooperative development, preserving the environment and education amidst nature are as relevant as ever.  For us in Bangladesh, in particular, he has been an unending source of inspiration and a sustaining force.  For our two nations, of course, he is a bond that is permanent. On this birthday webinar, being organized at a time when our people are trying to cope with the crisis brought about by Covid-19, we know that he is a ray of hope we can turn to and be inspired by as we move on to better days and a brighter future.

He also called upon the government to take necessary steps to properly provide the relief materials to the flood-hit people. Quader said their party will remain beside disaster-affected people as it was in the past. \"Former president and Pallibandhu HM Ershad always stood beside flood victims.

      "text": "The flood has hit Rangpur division the hardest as it rained in the region almost three times more than it had until this point last year.  So far, 4,327mm rainfall has been recorded in Rangpur division until Wednesday. There was only 1,745mm until July last year, according to the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Mymensingh, Sylhet, and Chattogram divisions also got more rain than they had last year. As the rivers became shallow over the years due to siltation, heavy showers caused the water bodies to swell and flood vast areas. \"Basically, flash floods in Chattogram division and heavy showers in northern districts aggravated the flood situation. The country's rivers could contain only one twelfth of the water that came from up-stream this year. The rest of the water caused the flood,\" Shah Kamal, senior secretary to the Disaster Management and Relief Ministry, told The Daily Star. Arifuzzaman Bhuyan, executive engineer of Bangladesh Water Development Board, said this year's flood hit at least 12 districts at the same time. \"Flood usually hits Sylhet division and then gradually affects other parts of the country. But this year's flood had affected the northern, Chattogram and Sylhet regions at the same time,\" he said. Kabir Bin Anwar, secretary of the Ministry of Water Resources, said, \"Due to heavy siltation, rivers have become shallow, causing floods every year. We have taken a project of dredging 448 small rivers and canals. We hope that the flood situation will improve within the next three or four years.\" The office of the UN Resident Coordinator's estimates that 5.3 million people were directly affected, 419,336 houses damaged, and 287,513 people were displaced in this year's flood. EROSION LOOMS Meanwhile, experts said although flood waters would continue to recede in the next few days, rivers might start eroding their banks. Gaibandha, Kurigram, Jamalpur, Rajbari, Shariatpur, and Faridpur are likely to be erosion affected, they said. \"Flood situation has started improving and we are hopeful that by August 3, the situation will be normal unless there are more heavy showers,\" Arifuzzaman told The Daily Star. Earlier this year, the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services predicted erosion at 22 locations in 13 districts by the Padma and Jamuna rivers. The report predicted that about 2,860 hectares, including 500 hectares of settlements, might be erod-ed. It also predicted that 420 metres of embankments, 8km of roads, 35 educational institutes, five mar-kets, and five health care centres might be devoured by the rivers. \"Erosion will be worse than predicted, especially in Kurigram, Gaibandha, Jamalpur and Bogura,\" said CEGIS Deputy Executive Director Maminul Haque Sarker."

Chattogram Met Office recorded 94.2mm rainfall in 24 hours till 12:00noon today, our correspondent reports quoting met office source. \"Heavy to moderate shower may continue in the next 24 hours,\" said Bishwajit Chowdhury, forcasting officer of the met office. Low-lying areas including Chawkbazar, Bakalia, Sholakbahar, Agrabad, Halisahar, Muradpur, Bohaddarhat, Kapasgola, Parbartak Intersection, KB Aman Ali Road, DC Road, Chandgaon, Sholashahar Gate No. 2, East Nasirabad and Dewanbazar areas were inundated in nearly knee-to-waist-deep water. Most of the commuters in the areas were seen walking through filthy water overflowing from the roadside drains, our correspondent reports from the spot. There are a very few number of vehicles plying on the roads and three-wheeler rickshaws are demanding double to triple of the usual fare, some of the commuters told our correspondent. Many commuters expressed their resentment over the authorities \"failure\" in addressing the waterlogging issue of the city. \"The city people have been suffering each year in the same way. Water entered my house and damaged the valuables. I don't understand what the authorities are doing except giving assurances,\" said Mohammad Hannan, a resident of West Bakalia. Contacted, Shafiqul Mannan Siddique, chief conservancy officer of Chattogram City Corporation, said the city corporation workers were working relentlessly to clean the drains so that water can pass easily. Heavy shower during high tide caused this year's waterlogging in low-lying areas but water was draining out quickly, he said. On the other hand, Chattogram District Administration evacuated around 800 families from risky hill slopes in the city fearing landslide, said Mahmud Ullah Maruf, revenue deputy collector, adding, they were taken to eight shelter centres. Over 39 unions of nine upazilas in Chattogram are affected due to flash flood and onrush of hill water, said local sources. In Fatikchhari upazila, 30 villages under five unions were suffering due to flash floods resulting from damage of Halda dam and torrents from the hills, said Najibul Bashar Maijvandari, lawmaker from Tariqat Federation in Fatikchhari constituency. In Rangunia upazila, twenty villages of five unions were affected due to flash flood, said Khalilur Rahman, upazila chairman, adding that acres of agricultural land is under water. Ali Shah, Former upzila Chairman of Rangunia urged the government to declare the upazila flood affected. Meanwhile, three unions of Anwara, five of Patiya, four of Satkania, three of Lohagara, four of Banshkhali, three of Chandanaish and seven of Hathazari upazila were affected due to flash flood, according to local sources. Hundreds of acres of agricultural lands in the upazilas are under water. To combat the situation, Chattogram Civil Surgeon Office formed 284 medical teams and a control room for emergency situation in flood affected areas, said Azizur Rahman Siddique, Civil Surgeon of Chattogram. \"A total of five medical teams in each upazila and one in each union have been performing their duties round the clock,\" he added.

The vast lowlands in the regions are a major source of rice for the entire country, and the damages could affect the national supply, experts fear. The rice growers have already suffered a blow because of coronavirus restrictions. Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC) on Friday said the northeastern region and many areas of India's Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura states may witness moderate and heavy rains between April 17 and 24. As a result, water levels in four of the local rivers may cross the danger level and cause flash floods in parts of Sylhet, Sunamganj, Moulvibazar and Habiganj districts, it warned. At least 11 rivers in the region may swell. FFWC in a bulletin yesterday said water levels at 30 of 39 points being monitored have been on the rise.  Meanwhile, only about 10 percent of the harvesting was done until yesterday, said Srinibas Debnath, additional director at Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in Sylhet division. Paddy was cultivated on 4,74,195 hectares of land in the region this year, he said, adding that the boro harvest season had begun last week and would probably continue until the first week of next month, he told The Daily Star yesterday. The farmers have already been complaining of shortages of workers due to the travel restrictions and nationwide shutdown, our correspondents in the districts said. Thousands of people grow paddy on the low-lying wetlands of the Sylhet region just once a year. But flash floods at this time of the year are not uncommon and damage to the crop becomes severe at times. \"If the flash flood happens and damages the embankment, we will be in deep trouble,\" Jwati Mohon Das, a farmer of Dashmontapur village in Sunamganj's Jamalganj, told our correspondent in Sylhet. Jwati, who started harvesting on Saturday at his four-acre farm, urged authorities to take proper care of the protection embankment. In 2017, flash floods submerged hundreds of acres of paddy fields in Sylhet, Sunamganj, Habiganj, Netrokona, Kishoreganj, Brahmanbaria and Moulvibazar, destroying and damaging the crop. According to the government \"Master Plan for Haor Area\" prepared in 2012, \"The total rice area of Bangladesh is 11.35 million hectares, of which 15.3percent falls in the haor areas. Paddy harvested in the boro season accounts for over 50 percent of the country's total production, DAE officials said. FLOOD FORECAST Citing data from Bangladesh and Indian meteorological departments, EU-based ECMWA and US-based NOAA, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center said Sylhet, Sunamganj, Netrokona, Habiganj and Moulvibazar may witness between 220mm and 320mm rains. As a result, 11 rivers, including the Surma and Kushiara may see sharp rise in water, it said. On April 23 and 24,  the Jadukata, Sarigoain, Manu and Khoyai rivers may flow over what officials call the danger level, resulting in flash floods in all four districts of Sylhet division, it said. In yesterday's bulletin, FFWC said water in all major rivers in the northeastern region is increasing, which may continue for 72 hours. It, however, ruled out any flash floods in the next 24 hours. Meanwhile, Indian Meteorological Department on Friday forecasted that iIsolated heavy rainfall is very likely over Assam and Meghalaya on April 17, 18 and 21; Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on April 17 and 18 and Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim on April 19 and 21, according to its website. Talking to The Daily Star, Arifuzzaman Bhuiyan, executive engineer at FFWC, said they are forecasting flash floods in the Northern region, especially in areas of Sylhet, Moulvibazar, Habiganj and Sunamganj by the end of this week. He said the floods may harm the paddy in vast haor areas if the farmers fail to harvest them beforehand. \"It's raining in these areas now-a-days as the monsoon has started. The amount of rain in this region is high this year compared to last year, which may create flash floods,\" he added. Heavy rains may occur in different parts of India close to Sylhet, worsening the possible flood situation. Arifuzzaman said they shared the flood forecast and warning information to the government departments concerned and also to field officials so that early measures to save paddy can be taken. Saying that heavy rainfall has already started in haor areas, he said, \"We have advised farmers to harvest within the next three or four days. Otherwise, they might face trouble. \"We have forecast that the intensity of heavy rainfall might increase in a day or two.\" WHAT GOVERNMENT DOING Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque told The Daily Star that officials have started a war-like situation to complete the harvesting in haor areas. \"After mobilising workers from different parts of the country, especially from the Northern region, we sent around 50,000 people to the haor areas to harvest paddy,\" the minister said, adding that people were working tirelessly. Admitting shortage of workers, Srinibas Debnath of DAE said they have already engaged labourers of sand lifting, stone lifting and tea gardens to harvest the paddy. \"We will harvest all ripe paddy as soon as possible,\" he said, adding that officials of the Water Development Board are also working to strengthen embankments that keep floodwater out. Meanwhile, Ahmad Kaikaus, principal secretary to the prime minister, held a video conference with the officials concerned in Sylhet over the harvesting and other issues of haor areas. \"He directed us to take steps for quick harvesting,\" Srinibas said. Deputy Minister AKM Enamul Hoque Shameem of the Water Resources Ministry in a meeting yesterday suggested transporting workers from one district to another for harvesting paddy. Food Minister Sadhan Chandra Majumder yesterday told this newspaper that everyone, including the prime minister, was concerned about harvesting the boro paddy, especially in haor areas. \"We asked field-level authorities to provide necessary farming tools and to ensure enough labourers to harvest the paddy while maintaining health safety measures,\" he said."

      "text": "Bangladesh experiences flash floods almost every year and farmers are no stranger to crop loss as a result. But the deaths of fish, frogs and fowls in their hundreds as an aftermath of such floods in Sylhet region are a new phenomenon altogether.  And an outcry across the border over India's exposing open pits of uranium to a river system causing deaths of fish has made experts in Bangladesh concerned about a likely link. There is no proof yet, but if uranium is indeed linked to it, Bangladesh's wetland and the river system connected to it will suffer a heavy blow, affecting aquatic species and humans alike, experts have warned.  India's predominantly Khasi communities living in Ranikor River basins, just across the Indo-Bangla border near Sunamganj's Tanguar Haor, raised alarm after the deaths of their river as well as fish population due to what they suspect uranium toxins from numerous drilling pits kept open and exposed in close vicinities.  The late March onrush of upstream hill waters and excessive rains that submerged a vast tract of backswamp in Sunamganj and a few other northeastern haor zones came along the West Khasi Hills' river basins of Ranikor in Meghalaya. For the past one week, people living on the downstream in Sunamganj's Tahirpur and also other haor areas further down in Moulvibazar found fish, frogs and even ducks floating dead.  This development raised serious concerns about a possible connection between uranium contamination of water and the loss of aquatic species in Hakaluki and Tanguar -- two of Asia's largest haors. Recently, locals in the West Khasi Hills noticed change of colour in the Ranikor River water in Ranikor, about 3km from the Jadukata River near the border area in Tahirpur of Sunamganj.  dead fish floating in Matiyan Haor in Tahirpur near Tanguar Haor in the district. Fisheries department officials say the water has turned acidic and it lacks oxygen. The photos were taken a couple of days ago. \n Contacted, Dr Bilkis Ara Begum, chief of chemistry unit at Bangladesh Atomic Energy Centre in Dhaka, said they were aware of the drilling for uranium extraction in the Khasi Hills.  \"It is very much possible that uranium-mixed water is coming down to our haors. If it happens, it would be disastrous for us,\" said Bilkis. The Centre has not yet collected water samples for testing.  The scientist noted that although uranium may not be directly responsible for the change of water colour, there may be some indirect causes. It is not possible to determine the reasons without testing, she added. A fishery department team that visited the haor regions yesterday found the water too toxic for aquatic species to live. But the team is yet to ascertain what made the water so toxic. Livestock department officials also collected dead ducks from the haors yesterday and sent those to Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute (BLRI) for lab tests. \"I think the unusual deaths of fish and ducks in our haor are very much connected with the matter. If the uranium-mixed water comes down to the haor with the flash flood, it would cause a disaster for us,\" said Abdul Karim Kim, Sylhet unit general secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon.  Khasi students have been protesting and demanding that the authorities fill up the uranium drilling pits as they have strong suspicion that toxins from the open pits were causing deaths of fish in their river, Karim said, adding that the students contacted him to give updates of the situation. The Meghalaya state government, however, insisted that uranium had nothing to do with the death of fish species. \"If uranium radiation was the cause of the deaths, all other aquatic life forms there would have also been affected and there would have been lesions on the fish,\" Meghalaya's Deputy Chief Minister Bindo M Lanong, who looks after the mining and geology department, said after thousands of dead fish had been found floating in Ranikor since April 13. Sonai Mia, a farmer in Sunamganj who lost his crops in recent flash flood, told The Daily Star yesterday that not only fish but frogs and leeches were also dying in their haors. The Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) has made it clear that rotting of paddies under floodwaters cannot be the cause of deaths of aquatic resources, as it never happened after previous flash floods. Also, farmers there apply pesticides and fertilisers judiciously, DAE officials added. \n Experts dispatched by the fisheries and livestock departments yesterday found Hakaluki water turned acidic and lacks oxygen. They are expected to visit Tanguar today. It is alleged that after stocktaking drills in the West Khasi Hills many uranium pits were left open. This heavy silvery-white radioactive metallic chemical is used as a fuel in nuclear reactors and weapons. Amid a massive public outcry, the Uranium Corporation of India Ltd (UCIL) was forced to withdraw from a pilot uranium extraction back in 1992, only to get mining clearance from the Indian Ministry of Environment and Forests recently. UCIL is up for setting up an open-cast uranium mine and processing plant there with production target of 375,000 tonnes of uranium ore a year and processing 1,500 tonnes a day, according to Indian media reports. On February 17, Khasi Student Union (KSU) in Meghalaya held a press conference to bring to the authorities' notice that suddenly the colour of the Ranikor River's water started changing from blue to green in December. They also said thousands of fish were found floating in Ranikor River. The river is now almost dead without any fish and aquatic lives in it. \"We highly suspect that the sudden death of fish and now the abnormal change in the colour of the River is due to uranium drilling,\" Khasi leader Marconi Thongni told the newsman. He claimed hundreds of pits were abandoned after carrying out uranium drilling activities in the thick forest at Porkut area in West Khasi Hills. \"Therefore we demand the state government immediately issue necessary direction to the Atomic Minerals Directorate (AMD) to fill up all these pits in order to prevent destruction of the environment,\" Macroni Thogni was quoted in a report published in India media. During heavy rainfall, the water from these pits finds their way into river, which is now feared to be harmful not only to aquatic lives but humans as well, he said.  "

      "text": "Once famed for the ingenuity of its 21 sluice gates designed to efficiently channel the water of several rivers through plains and wetlands, the Bhabadaha area in Jessore has in more recent times become a tale of sorrow. Several of the sluice gates have been inoperative for years, with siltation-aggravated, avoidable flooding the current hallmark of each monsoon. This year, heavy rainfall has caused havoc across the country. Bhabadaha has not fared well. Across three upazilas of Jessore and two in Khulna, areas that should be able to rely on the Bhabadaha infrastructure, over 100 villages are currently inundated with several thousand homes damaged. Many schools are submerged. The flooding is primarily the result of the failure to manage water flows from the Muktershari, Teka, Bhadra, Shree and Hori rivers. In places the riverbeds are higher than the plains around them, with siltation leading to overflow. \"Riverbed siltation has been causing prolonged water-logging in the south-western part of Khulna division for around three decades,\" says Ranjit Bawyali, convenor of the Bhabadaha Water Management Committee. \"Despite our requests the government has not taken effective action.\" On a recent visit to the area, The Daily Star observed over two thousand people taking shelter on the road, together with their belongings, livestock and poultry. \"I was forced to take shelter here along with my six cows, because my home is underwater,\" says Tarapada Mondal, 72, from Dumurtala village in Jessore's Abhaynagar upazila. Usually a solvent farmer, he currently resides in a makeshift cottage on the Noyapara to Moshitati road. \"I am unaccustomed to living on the road,\" says his wife Anarati Mondal, \"so we have managed to rent two rooms in another roadside home for me, my son and my daughter. We will stay here as long as the flooding remains. We have no alternative.\" The stagnant water is itself a health hazard. Many latrines have overflowed and are unusable. Safe drinking water is scarce. \"Twelve out of fourteen villages in our union are submerged,\" says Bikash Roy, chairman of the Sundoli union council within Abhaynagar. \"Drinking water is hard to find because many tube wells are underwater.\" Shakhor Chandra Roy, the council chairman of Kultia union in adjacent Manirampur upazila, also in Jessore, says that in his local government area all seventeen villages are submerged, with eight facing especially dire circumstances. Built in the early 1960s by the then East Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority, the Bhabadaha infrastructure includes sluice gates, polders and embankments. It was designed to protect human settlements from tidal surge, cyclones, floods and the intrusion of saline water. But along with decayed and broken infrastructure, the illegal occupation of around six hundred acres of river lands by influential parties, who have established brickfields, fish enclosures and housing in areas critical to the river management scheme's success, has helped to cause the system's collapse. \"To address the problem, we have commenced excavation works in two phases at a cost of Tk 1 crore, covering eight kilometres from Chomordanga to Dayerkhal in Abhaynagar,\" says Jessore's executive engineer with the Bangladesh Water Development Board, Probir Kumar Goshami. \"The project, scheduled for completion on 30 August 2017, includes an obligation to clean garbage and lift silt from the sluice gates as well. But two out of the four excavators have been out of order for months; we have repeatedly asked the contractor, Sonny Corporation, to repair them as a matter of urgency.\" Locals too are unhappy with the work of Sonny Corporation, which they accuse of not excavating the river deeply enough and of dumping mud along the riverbank such that it will gradually filter back into the riverbed. But the owner of Sonny Corporation, Habibur Rahman, told The Daily Star they are fulfilling their obligations as per schedule. \"The water development board is monitoring our work,\" he says, \"so there is no opportunity not to do the job properly. It is true, though, that we are facing difficulty in repairing our two excavators.\" \"We have taken many steps to discharge water through the rivers but it will take time,\" says Shwapon Bhattacharya, a lawmaker from Jessore-5 constituency. After several decades of 'time', many locals are unconvinced. \"The government has no sympathy for us,\" says Bikash Kabiraj, a disgruntled resident of Soradanga village in Monirampur. \"We have suffered for years and the government hasn't done anything.\""

      "text": "It is estimated that family planning could prevent one in every three maternal deaths and one in 11 child deaths by allowing women to delay motherhood and space their births, avoid unplanned pregnancies and therefore abortion, and stop childbearing once they have reached their planned family size (Lancet, 2006). Approximately 200 million married women who want to stop having children or postpone their next pregnancy do not have access to any method of contraception and family planning services because of logistical and financial barriers. In addition, there are a further 12-15 million unmarried women who want to avoid pregnancy and have no access to clinics or family planning services due to the associated cultural stigma of the region (WHO Media Centre, 2011). Despite a 28 percent increment in contraception uses globally in the last 45 years, data shows a stark disparity in the range of percentage of women taking recourse to contraceptive methods in Asia. The South Asian region still counts for the highest burden of maternal deaths despite its efforts to increase access to modern family planning to reduce total fertility rates (TFR). In India, Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh in particular, the differences in fertility and use of contraception across socioeconomic groups are striking. In India, the fertility rate among the wealthiest part of the population is only 1.8, while it remains 3.9 among the poorest. In Nepal, educated women have on average 1.9 children while the least educated have an average of 3.7. In Pakistan, contraceptive prevalence is 32 percent among wealthier couples and yet only 12 percent among poor couples. In Bangladesh, the urban total fertility rate is 2.0 and that of the rural areas is 2.4 (BDHS, 2014). Rapid population growth in resource-constrained countries impairs the ability to develop quality life and livelihood; family planning contributes to fertility decline. Since the 1960s, contraceptive use introduced as a means of family planning in Bangladesh and fertility has fallen substantially to date. The decline has been uneven as the performance of family planning programmes across the country varied widely. So what can be done to increase consistent use of contraceptive across the country and reduce fertility? Experts suggest three major factors that could aid population and fertility control: (i) uninterrupted supply of contraceptive commodities; (ii) strengthening and extending a structured network through the existing health and family system (government organisations, NGOs, private) to enhance services; and (iii) periodically examining the policy implications of differing patterns of fertility and population growth for national development and individual well-being. Bangladesh now has an estimated population of 168 million. In 1971, a nationwide survey confirmed that there were 71 million people back then. In 1980, the population grew to 90.4 million and similar rises have been recorded on a decade-by-decade basis ever since. The population of Bangladesh is equivalent to 2.18 percent of the global population (seventh largest in the world). The country has a population density of 1,115.62 people per square kilometre (World Population Review). World Population Day today calls for global attention to the unfinished business of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development. Twenty-five years have passed since that landmark conference, where 179 governments recognised that reproductive health and gender equality is essential for achieving sustainable development. In Bangladesh, family planning programmes are carried out by government agencies, NGOs and limited private services which are coordinated by the Directorate General of Family Planning. At the London Summit on Family Planning (FP2020) in July 2012, Bangladesh committed to the overall goal of ensuring quality and equitable family planning services for all eligible couples by improving accessibility to family planning services, particularly for the poor. Specific targets have been set for reducing total fertility rate, increasing contraceptive prevalence rate and method-specific coverage, while reducing the rate of discontinuation and overall unmet needs for implementing family planning programmes. Family planning remains one of the top priorities in the 4th Health Sector Programme 2017-2021, as a path toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Meanwhile, Bangladesh has had commendable achievements during the last decade in reducing population growth and improving maternal and child health. The reduction in the total fertility rate from 6.3 births per woman in 1975 to 3.4 in 1994 and to 2.3 in 2011 is very encouraging, but since 2011, the total fertility rate has remained stagnant at 2.3 births per woman (BDHS, 2014). Besides, 12 percent of married women in Bangladesh are unable to receive necessary family planning services. Such unfulfilled needs vary according to geographical location. The problem is most acute in Sylhet (BDHS, 2014). One of the major concerns for family planning programmes is the rate at which users discontinue use of contraception. It has been found that 30 percent of contraceptive users stop using such methods within 12 months of starting. Discontinuation rates are much higher for temporary methods like condoms (40 percent) and the pill (34 percent), than for longer term methods like implants (seven percent). The BDHS 2014 revealed that 31 percent of women aged between 15 and 19 have begun childbearing; about one in four teenagers have given birth and another six percent are pregnant with their first child. Childbearing among teenagers is more common in rural than in urban areas (32 live births versus 27 per 1,000 women, according to BDHS 2014). A large cohort of young Bangladeshis will reach reproductive age in the coming decades, so the adolescent fertility issue must be addressed with the highest priority. The adolescent (15-19) fertility rate in Bangladesh is 113 per 1,000 women (BDHS, 2014) and has not decreased significantly for decades. Adolescent fertility remains a major social and health concern. Despite rapid improvement in female education, women's mean age at marriage has hardly changed. The achievements in family planning in Bangladesh have so far significantly increased access for poor people in urban slums and remote rural areas. Efforts that emphasise on improving choice--availability of Long Acting and Permanent Methods (LaPMs), including those for men, and post-partum and post-abortion services--also have momentum today. Certain family planning services like counselling needs have to be established in commonly hard-to-reach areas such as char, hilly areas, haor, and minority communities, along with residential workplaces. The \"floating boat hospital\" containing health and family planning services through satellite clinics seems like a great solution to reach char people even during floods. New couple counselling, doorstep package services for faith-based communities, adolescent counselling centre at Upazila Health Complexes (UHCs), and segmented service units for specific target groups can be considered to increase outreach. The EPI centre, community clinics, birthing centres/UHCs, and private clinics shouldn't have a shortage of required supplies and trained midwives. The health system may revisit existing involvement by multi-ministries/sectors and extend its network based on recent experiences so as to engage other sectors and stakeholders including education, women and children affairs, hill tracts, local government and cooperatives, the youth, religious affairs, NGOs, and the private sectors. The collective efforts to provide access to quality, affordable reproductive health care and reduce adolescent fertility rates overall promote optimal birth spacing and establish the importance of family planning, which in turn contributes towards individual happiness and also further national development.

While the Surma river has swollen above the danger level, water levels of the Cholti, Patli and Jadukata rivers are rising every day. Heavy rain upstream, in India's Meghalaya, is aggravating the situation. At least 182 flooded schools and colleges in the districts have been forced to close. Part of Sylhet's Gowainghat upazila is flooded while Kanaighat and Fenchuganj are likely to be inundated soon. People in Sunamganj town, Tahirpur, Chhatak and Bishwamvarpur upazilas are also suffering in the flood. According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Water Development Board, the Surma and other rivers in the region have been overflowing for the last couple of days due to excessive rainfall. Surma was flowing 102cm above the danger level on Wednesday night in Kanaighat upazila, 33cm above in Sylhet city and 70cm in Sunamganj town. The swollen Pirayin, Gowain, Sari and other rivers are wreaking havoc in nine unions of Gowainghat, Abdul Hakim Chowdhury, Gowainghat upazila chairman, said. In Sunamganj's Chhatak, about a hundred of villages in six unions have been flooded, Oliur Rahman, Chhatak upazila chairman, said. Bodrul Kadir, vice-chairman of Sunamganj sadar, said many of his constituents' homes were flooded. The road between Tahirpur and Sunamganj town has been flooded and closed to traffic, said Kamruzzaman Kamrul, Tahirpur upazila chairman. Thousands of families are living in fear of losing their homestead, he added. People who took shelter on the embankments of the upazila are living in the open and suffering from shortages of drinking water and food, locals said. Ponchanon Bala, primary education officer in Sunamganj, said 33 flooded primary schools have been closed in the district. At least 100 other primary schools are affected. Jahangir Alam, district education officer in Sunamganj, said 11 secondary schools and colleges were closed. Anisuzzaman, agriculture officer in Gowainghat, said over 1,000 hectares of paddy fields have been flooded in the upazila. Harunur Rashid, Bishwamvarpur upazila chairman, said thousands of people were suffering in the haor areas. In Sunamganj town, Nabinagar, Tegharia and Jalilpur areas have been flooded due to the excessive rain. Obaidullah, primary education officer in Sylhet, said, 88 flooded primary schools were closed, and 156 others seriously affected. Gulzar Ahmed, education officer in Sylhet, said 50 secondary schools and colleges were also closed in the district."

Crop insurance is an insurance package designed for farmers to protect them from crop losses due to natural disasters such as hail, drought, floods and so on. Farmers in Bangladesh are vulnerable to the vagaries of weather as climate change makes the country highly susceptible to floods and tropical cyclones. But they cannot get protection because traditional insurers have been unable to offer suitable crop insurance schemes. The ADB-administered programme allows a farmer to claim compensation from his/her insurer when certain climatic trigger points are hit, such as cyclone or tropical storm in a given area hits a specified magnitude or when rainfall rises above or drops a certain level. Having this kind of cover would give farmers the ability to continue to plan and save for the longer term even if their harvests are suddenly and arbitrarily destroyed by bad weather, the ADB said. A new weather index in conjunction with the Bangladesh Meteorological Department was generated using weather data for the past 25-30 years. For the pilot, drought-prone Rajshahi, flood-prone Sirajgonj and cyclone-prone Noakhali were selected. Some 20 automated weather observation machines were installed on the roofs of different upazila parishad buildings. The pilot programme will end on June 30 this year, and based on its inferences the government will decide whether it will roll out crop insurance on a nationwide basis. The project cost Tk 21.34 crore, of which Tk 16.38 crore was provided by the ADB and rest by the government. SBC organised a workshop yesterday to chalk out the draft regulatory framework for weather-based crop insurance.  Crop insurance is immensely popular in India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Mexico, said Gokul Chand Das, member of the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority. He went on to suggest SBC to visit the countries where crop insurance is functioning successfully to gather in-depth knowledge on the product. \"It is a very complex product, so learning and awareness is needed among the concerned parties,\" said Arup Chatterjee, principal financial sector specialist of ADB's Sustainable Development and Climate Change department. A strong database of farm households is needed to develop the product design and set premium, he said, while calling for a strong value chain to promote the product. SBC has so far paid insurance claim of Tk 17.55 lakh against aman and potato harvests in Rajshahi and Noakhali districts. "

      "text": "\"Is there a river called Jinjirum that's a trans-boundary river? Are you sure about its name? Is it the name of the locality or the river? I haven't even heard about it,\" says a high-ranking official of the northern zone of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), when we asked him about different issues faced by this river and the communities dependent on it. Jinjirum river might be one of the least important issues for BWDB but for more than 2,00,000 people in Northern Bangladesh, it is their lifeline. It supports their agriculture, provides them with fish and freshwater and, in the remote northern border areas of Bangladesh, where transport infrastructure is inadequate and handicapped by constant river erosion, the river used to serve as a natural highway that connected communities. As a navigable trans-boundary river, it also has immense potential as a trade route between Bangladesh and North-Eastern India, which can reduce transportation costs significantly. However, due to lack of supervision and certain reckless activities, this river is now on the brink of extinction. Jinjirum originates in the hills of Assam, flows through Meghalaya and then enters Bangladesh through Rowmari upazila of Kurigram district. The river continues its journey eastwards and enters Jamalpur district. In Dewanganj of Jamalpur district, it connects with the shrinking old Brahmaputra river and feeds the old Brahmaputra floodplain, stretching from south-western parts of the Garo Hills to the eastern parts of the Madhupur tract. According to the book Bangladesh er Nod Nodi: Bartaman Goti Prokriti by Manik Mohammad Razzak, the length of the Bangladeshi portion of the Jinjirum is 55 kilometres, its average width is 107 metre and its average depth is seven metres. In Bangladesh, the area of its basin is 240 square kilometres. Before partition, this river used to serve as one of the major links between the hills of the greater Assam and the plains of Assam and Eastern Bengal.  Like several trans-boundary rivers, one of Jinjirum's flows that enters Bangladesh through Rowmari is almost dead due to the construction of border roads in the Indian side of the river. Sheikh Rokon, an eminent river researcher and secretary general of Riverine People says, \"A flow of Jinjirum empties into Brahmaputra. But the other flow that enters Bangladesh through Rowmari is completely obstructed by the Indian border roads. A shallow stream that enters through Rowmari is fed mostly by rainwater and some water from the Chatlar Beel (a wetland).\" In fact, when we visited the area, we found that the shrinking flow has dried up completely at the point it enters Bangladesh; after a few hundred metres into Bangladeshi territory, the riverbed becomes entirely unrecognisable. As the soft clay of the dried-up river bed is an excellent raw material for brick manufacturing, brickfields have flourished adjacent to the riverbed. Stone crushing yards have also been established on the riverbed due to proximity with Rowmari landport through which huge quantity of stones are imported from India. A once lush green countryside fed by the serene flow of Jinjirum has been replaced with stone quarries and brickfields producing toxic air and creating unbearable sound pollution.       However, a few kilometres eastwards, Jinjirum's flow starts to change gradually. From occasional clogged water holes, the river starts to swell again and gets its navigability back thanks to two other trans-boundary rivers called Donni and Kalo. These are spring-fed, fast flowing hilly rivers which originate in the hills of Meghalaya. After taking a horse-shoe turn, Jinjirum connects with Kalo river at a place called Bunder Char and takes another horse-shoe turn and meets with Donni river  at a place called Dublabari. From this place, Jinjirum flows with its full force up to a place called Bikribeel, which is around three kilometres away from Dublabari. The eroding banks reveal how the river frequently turns destructive in these parts. Bakbandha is a fishing village located between Dublabari and Bikribeel. There, we talked to Abdul Mutalib, an octogenarian fisherman who knows the river extensively from his childhood.   \"Only 20-25 years ago, the river looked quite different. It was wider and deeper,\" recalls Abdul. \"We never faced erosion along Jinjirum. Both the banks of the rivers were plentiful and the villages were prosperous. I have caught monstrous catfish in this river each weighing 100-150 kilograms. We also caught Hilsa fish in this river. Within a decade, the river has changed so drastically that sometimes I cannot believe it. There is no fish in this river anymore. Both the banks have been eroding constantly. My house, my vegetable patch, my cattle pen have all been eaten up by the river. Now, I live in a rented shanty and work as an agricultural labourer.\" What turned this once tranquil and plentiful river into a barren and devastating current? The answer lies at Bikribeel, two kilometres downstream of the river. At Bikribeel, the local government engineering division (LGED) erected an inflatable rubber dam to provide irrigation for the local farmers. The construction project started in 2009 (effectively from 2012) and the dam was commissioned in 2017. Tk 155,804,000 has been spent to construct the dam. However, such expensive infrastructure now lies completely useless. The river Donni alone cannot provide sufficient water to activate the dam and to feed the irrigation channels. The concrete structure of the dam beneath the river is obstructing the natural flow of the river. Because of the height of the concrete slabs, fish movement has halted and gradually the river is losing her capacity to support a large fish population. Many fishermen like Abdul have abandoned their ancestral profession as they cannot catch anything but some small fry in the waters of Jinjirum.  Sheikh Rokon, explains further, \"Jinjirum is a grassy river which is fed mainly by rainwater and flash floods. Fish from sandy rivers like Brahmaputra have to migrate to small rivers like Jinjirum for breeding. If Jinjirum is destroyed, the ecosystem of the entire Brahmaputra floodplain will be affected. Installing a rubber dam on such a river is an absolutely thoughtless initiative because besides destroying the ecosystem, it will also cause river erosion.\"   A field level official of LGED, who requested anonymity, explains how the dam is causing river erosion. \"As Jinjirum does not receive water from the original source due to the dam on her upstream, damming up this river was not necessary and not effective at all. Currently by obstructing the flow of the river, the structure is accelerating siltation. Decades ago, two flows, one from the hills of Assam and one from the hills of Meghalaya, used to meet at Jinjirum river. The combined current used to eliminate each other's individual forces and flow through a wider course. Since the original flow from the hills of Assam has been completely blocked, the flash floods from the Meghalayas hit the banks unopposed. Since the river is losing her depth due to siltation, it is not able to contain rainwater and flash flood. Ultimately, the banks will overflow and be eroded,\" he explains. Siltation has also encouraged illegal sand-mining. We spotted at least six sand mining machines within two kilometres of Jinjirum from Dublabari to Bikribeel. According to BWDB and LGED officials, sand mining from Jinjirum is illegal because it destroys the riverbed and accelerates river erosion. However, we did not see any initiative to stop the ongoing sand-mining. As a result, hundreds of villages in two districts (Kurigram and Jamalpur) along the Jinjirum river are becoming victims of river erosion every year during monsoon. Besides, the dam has also turned the river unnavigable. Once, the merchants used to ply the river to market their goods at Dewanganj bazaar in Jamalpur district. Even the local stone merchants said that if this river could be used to import stones from India, the transportation cost would have been reduced to half. In 2016, an initiative was also taken to use the river for cross-border trade. Alhajj Mohammad Jahidul Islam, general secretary, association of coal and stone importers of Rowmari, says, \"We have been requesting the government to make the river navigable for cross border trade since more than two decades. We saw a glimmer of hope in 2016 when the then director general of BGB and divisional commissioner promised that the river would be used for cross-border trade from 2017. But the rubber dam has destroyed all our hopes. To import stone and coal from Meghalaya through Rowmari landport, we have to cross two Indian states and pay high taxes. The road is also very bad. But we could easily transport the goods through this river.\"    When asked about the dam and its adverse impacts, Khalilur Rahman, additional chief engineer, LGED, says, \"We along with China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research jointly conducted a feasibility study to assess the potential of inflatable rubber dams. In many parts of Bangladesh, farmers are getting benefits of our project. But the case for Jinjirum river is different. The local people have been demanding at least two bridges across the river for a long time. We are now training the river to construct these bridges which have temporarily blocked the current. But once the bridges are built, the dam will become fully operational.\" When asked about the measures they have taken to prevent river erosion, Khalilur replies, \"It's BWDB's job. They have their own project in this regard.\" Md Ariful Islam, executive engineer, BWDB, could not give us any hope. He says that currently there is no project on Jinjirum River. \"Two years ago, we did some protective works but there is no such project in the near future. Since it's a trans-boundary river, any kind of water regulation, restoration and maintenance project on the river should be done through international agreement. Regarding the rubber dam, it is quite obvious that installing such structure on a river will definitely obstruct its flows, increase siltation and fish migration to the downstream will be hampered. We don't know why LGED installed the dam there. Unfortunately, they didn't consult with us before constructing the dam.\" While the government officials are blaming each other and casting an indifferent look at the problem, more than two hundred thousand people dependent on Jinjirum river are at risk of losing their livelihood. They are appealing to save the river and save their lives. Compared to large trans-boundary rivers such as Teesta, Brahmaputra and Ganges, Jinjirum might be a small river but it plays a vital role in running economic activities and sustaining lives all over the Brahmaputra flood plain. If actions are not taken now, hundreds of thousands living in the Jinjirum basin may face extreme poverty in the near future.

      "text": "Since the late-20th-century, a shift in paradigm has happened in the intellectual arena of architecture, art, literature, philosophy, history, economics, fiction, etc. It happened mostly in the industrialised countries and emerged as Postmodernism, a critique of \"modernism\". Terminologies such as \"deconstruction\" and \"post-structuralism\" have also gained popularity in twentieth-century thoughts. \"Economic growth is not necessarily good\" or the notion of sustainable development (\"Our Common Future\", 1987) urging for \"meeting the needs of the poor, without compromising with the ability to meet the needs of future generation\" directed a rethink of the ways in which economic growth are generated. The shift in paradigm (from human exceptionalism) was also connected to ecological disruptions in many parts of the world. People in industrial societies identified changes in air and water qualities and expressed certain environmental concerns. Voices were also raised by affected women and men in non-industrialised countries (ecofeminism and post-modern feminism). By this time, rapid and unplanned industrialisation and urbanisation grasped almost all the industrialised and some non-industrialised countries following the Durkheimian model. Those who have not stepped into the so-called development process identified with \"mechanical solidarity\". Green movement and environmental think-tanks argued that people living with \"organic solidarity\" did not realise that consumption; resource extraction would turn the world into a fire-ball. Globalisation has exhilarated and extended the process of win-win situation and made the genetically modified varieties common for all. Researchers and policymakers started to search for linkages between increased frequency of disasters and climate change with this historical process mostly in the twenty-first-century. However, the discussions on double exposures and engendered new risks due to climate change and disasters on people living in extremely fragile environments have only started over the last couple of decades. Floods, cyclones, storm surge, heat-waves, cold-waves, drought, erratic rainfall, forest-fires, landslides, scarcity of surface and groundwater etc. continuously attracted international attention. To mitigate and reduce the loss of disasters, United Nations called for action through the declaration of Hyogo Framework of Action (HFA, 2005-2015) and the post 2015 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR, 2015-2030, UNISDR). The four priorities for action and seven targets of SFDRR have to be followed as risk reduction and preparedness mechanisms for member countries. In Bangladesh, though rapid development has not occurred through industrialisation and urbanisation, the then government's exploitative nature of resource extraction from East Pakistan to West, gradually led to the extinction of many of our natural species. The nature of exploitation at all levels forced the people of the land to fight for the independence of the country in 1971. The new country was identified as one of the most disaster prone in the world. Therefore, disaster preparedness has become an integral part of the country and her people. Bangabandhu inaugurated the \"Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP)\" and constructed \"Mujib Killa\" to protect people and their livestock. However, massive initiatives to manage disasters have not followed these early initiatives. This was reflected in the lack of preparedness to face the challenges of the two consecutive floods of 1987 and 1988 and the cyclone of 1991. The devastating nature of these two floods and casualties in the 1991 cyclone attracted international attention and criticism against the government as an example of lack of disaster preparedness. It has been identified that massive destruction and death due to disasters in Bangladesh were not only related to her geographical settings, but also to try to \"control\" disasters instead of \"managing\" or taking risk reduction efforts. Since then there has been calls for disaster management and for disaster risk reduction following HFA. Large number of changes were made in the policy environments and institutional structure: now we have Standing Orders on Disaster (1997, revised 2010); Disaster Management Act (2012); National Plan for Disaster Management (2010); Disaster Management Policy and some other relevant documents published by the Ministry of Disaster Management and relief. The disaster management model has shifted its paradigm from mere relief distribution to risk reduction mechanisms, which acclaimed international recognition, terming Bangladesh as a role model for disaster management. People in Bangladesh have developed a science combining with indigenous knowledge-based disaster preparedness and proving their resilience. Being one of the early researchers in social science discipline, I feel privileged to have produced a grounded theory in the mid-nineties, showing a gender dimension in disaster preparedness at household levels. During those times there was almost no early warning or institutional support for affected people in coping with or better prepare for disasters. It was women's home-based preparedness which was vital in living with disaster. Over the past decade these home-based initiatives have been strengthened through central to local level institutional supports and response. The natural disaster related casualties have been reduced to a remarkable level following improvement in early warning system and constructing multipurpose shelters in both cyclone and flood plains. It is expected that technology based early warning system will be more accurate and advanced with the information flow from the newly launched Bangabandhu satellite. Inclusive approach is one of the recently emphasised agenda in disaster preparedness for Bangladesh at the government level in collaboration with academia and civil society. The country has successfully organised two conferences on disability and disasters towards achieving the inclusive principles of the Seventh Five Year Plan (interfacing climate change and disaster risk reduction) and Sustainable Development Goals (leaving no one behind). However, although Bangladesh is doing well in context of managing \"natural\" disasters, social disaster or human induced disasters require more focus. Emerging \"natural disasters\" such as thunderstorms, landslides, early flash floods in haor areas, are also indicating that further research and initiatives are needed. Most strikingly, the influx of Rohingyas from Myanmar has shown us the increased need for preparedness in case of social disasters.

      "text": "The government is supposed to increase forest land to 20 percent of the country's total landmass by 2030, but the reality is, it is losing land every year to different government agencies who demand land for their establishments and development projects. Official numbers show that so far Bangladesh has 17.62 percent of its landmass covered by forests and of that the Department of Forest (DoF) has jurisdiction over 10.84 percent. Sources in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change said so far almost 1.6 lakh acres of forest land has been handed over to different government agencies and establishments, or used for development projects. That is not all; the feasting on forest has not stopped and several government agencies and wings are demanding a huge amount of woodland from the ministry to build their establishments, make recreation centres, cottages, guesthouses, offices, and roads. The government aims to stop deforestation by 2020 and have 20 percent of the landmass as forests by 2030 with 70% tree density -- a quantitative measure of tree cover in an area -- as per the sustainable development goal (SDG) finalised in 2015. But now it seems unlikely the government would be able to do that. Being worried about failing to meet the SDG, the ministry wrote to the Prime Minister's Office and the cabinet secretary last year and urged authorities concerned to stop acquiring forest land. Citing the constitution, the letter said it was mandatory for the state to conserve the forest, its biodiversity, wildlife and environment for the next generation. Furthermore, the official data of the total forest area is believed to be heavily inflated as experts said it includes deforested areas, land given to different government agencies and development projects, urbanised land and illegal occupation.  Once forest land has been given to government agencies or for development projects, the ministry does not deduct the area from its total forest area, they said. The ministry also has a curious definition of what is a forest. According to a conservator of forests in Chattogram, two- to five- metre tall trees covering at least 1.24 acres are called forests. This allows a lot of land to be considered forests.   Over the years, the DoF has talked about success in creating coastal forests that act as natural barrier to tidal surges, cyclones, and floods. But this very achievement is being undermined as the government has started using forests for development projects. At least 22 projects taken up by the government and deemed important for the nation are on forest land between Mirsharai of Chattogram and Teknaf of Cox's Bazar, according to documents obtained by this paper. Bangladesh Economic Zone Authority (BEZA), Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), Bangladesh Tourism Board, Bangladesh Railway, Power Development Board, Chattogram Development Authority and Water Development Board have projects on a special economic zone, a tunnel, a power station, an LNG terminal, tourist destinations, an economic zone, a road, a rail line to Cox's Bazar and an embankment, according to the data of the DoF.  For instance, the Mirsharai mangrove forest is three kilometres wide and 20km long and is home to about 5,000 chitals, monitor lizards, crabs, birds and aquatic life. The dense mangrove forest was created by the coastal division in 1976 and it asked the ministry to recognise 22,500 acres of the forest as reserved forest. But now, most of the forest has been leased out to BEZA. The BPC would set up an oil refinery and sought 190 acres of a reserve forest in Moheshkhali -- the nation's sole hilly island. Moheskhali has 19,768 acres of hilly forest and 12,355 acres of mangrove forest and is home to 70 species of trees and shrubs, 19 species of mammals, eight types of reptiles, and 27 species of birds. BEZA also plans to develop a special economic zone in Moheshkhali of Cox's Bazar where they would need another 13,000 acres, most of which is expected to be forest land. Paban Chowdhury, chairman of BEZA, told The Daily Star that they had plans to plant two millions saplings along the Mirsharai coastal belt in a bid to recover the loss rendered by development work. He said they would plant more trees than they razed in the area. \"Apart from this, we prepared a green economic zone guideline with a taskforce and technical committee to implement the guideline. Every economic zone will follow the guideline. We can't rule out the concern of environment. Without conservation of nature, the development will not be sustainable,\" he said. Al Amin, professor of Institute of Forest and Environmental Science, told The Daily Star that he feared the coastal belt was being exposed to natural calamities.  BEZA should follow the PM's instruction to set up a green belt along the coastal belt, he said. Al Amin also highlighted new theories like accommodated plan where forest land and development could be merged in a balanced way. \"We need development but that should not come at the cost of our biodiversity and forests. We need coordinated planning comprising of [input from] forest scientists and industrial planners to accelerate the development while simultaneously protecting the forest land as much as we can.\" Jahir Uddin Ahmed, deputy chief conservator of forest, told The Daily Star that they were planning a massive forestation along the coastal belt. \"We have already completed a study ranging from Sundarban to Teknaf, discovering the scope for the forestation of 70,000 hectares. A green belt will be created along the coastal area,\" he added. He observed that the coastal forest was not only a natural barrier for 30 million coastal people; it also served as sources of livelihood for them."

Mentioning that Bangladesh has given shelter to a large number of Myanmar nationals on humanitarian ground, she said the country is stepping forward with a big burden on its shoulder. Hasina said Bangladesh wants the Rohingyas to return to their homeland as soon as possible. \"The quicker they return to their homeland, the better for Bangladesh, and I do believe that.\" Talking about adaptation, she said adaptation measures cannot be spread unless proper mitigation measures are in place. The PM said in this age of science, technology and innovation, there is an enormous opportunity to address climate change. \"I call everyone for your awareness and respective responsibility to fight the adverse impacts of climate change.\" She said Bangladesh is expecting to take advantage of the best adaptation practices, most cost-effective solutions and risk reduction with the help of the Global Commission on Adaptation. \"We're eagerly waiting to see the recommendations of the flagship report next September at the time of the Climate Change Summit called by the secretary general of the United Nations where I, on behalf of Bangladesh and the Least Developed Countries, have been invited to speak,\" the PM said. She recalled that in 2015 in Paris all had been successful in creating a solid ground for a meaningful cooperation in combating climate change impacts. \"Like many others, we firmly believe that climate change is a global challenge and we have to resort to global solutions. \"The Paris Agreement is the most pragmatic and effective global deal towards this global solution. In the final report of High Level Political Forum on Water, which was formed at the initiative of Ban Ki-moon, we wrote 'Every drop counts'. The world community is trying to implement this.\" Hasina mentioned that climate change poses the greatest threat to the present and future generations. Evidence suggests that Bangladesh has already 6 million climate migrants, a number that could more than double by 2050. \"Changes in temperature, increased frequency and severity of floods, droughts, heat waves, cyclones and storm surges, sea-level rise and salinity intrusion are affecting a vast tract of land in Bangladesh.\" These changes are seriously affecting agriculture, crops, livestock and fisheries, and threatening the food security of Bangladesh, she added. The PM said Bangladesh is pursuing a low carbon development path with increasing emphasis on renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy conservation. She mentioned that Bangladesh has been working relentlessly to overcome its vulnerabilities and create adaptation measures for people. \"We've designed a project titled Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100 for combating climate change.\" She said Bangladesh, being one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, is also at the forefront of learning how to tackle the adverse impacts of climate change. \"Due to the present government's various timely and effective measures, the impact of natural calamities has come down significantly.\" The PM said the government has taken initiatives to increase tree coverage from 22 percent to 24 percent in the next five years. Besides, she said, Bangladesh has been engaged in creating resilient forests in offshore areas to protect forest-dependent communities and habitats of important forest biodiversity. \"Our scientists and farmers invented stress-tolerant rice cultivation technologies which produced good results.\" Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine, World Bank CEO and Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) co-chair Kristalina Georgieva, the current chair of the GCA and former UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen and Environment, Forests and Climate Change Minister Shahab Uddin also spoke at the programme. The GCA is guided by 32 commissioners and 19 convening countries, representing all regions of the globe, and co-managed by the Global Centre on Adaptation and World Resources Institute."

      "text": "Alongside his work as a photographer and teacher, Shahidul Alam has always spoken out for the rights of all Bangladeshis, and for free speech. He has been imprisoned for more than a month now for alleged \"provocative comments\". He has been repeatedly denied bail, with the next hearing likely to take place on Sunday. The Daily Star presents a snapshot of Alam's work in, and for, Bangladesh, compiled and edited by Katatare Prajapati, a group of Bangladeshi artists and writers, and journalists Brian Palmer and Erin Hollaway Palmer. We feel that Alam's work speaks louder than anything we can say about his contributions and his commitment to the ideals of Bangladesh's Liberation War. *** 1983: Alam completes his PhD in organic chemistry from the University of London. He works as a research chemist at Bedford College to invent alternative printing processes for photographs. 1984: Returns to Bangladesh; becomes secretary general of Bangladesh Photographic Society. 1987: Alam photographs the people's resistance to section 144 imposed by the Ershad military junta. He is elected president of Bangladesh Photographic Society. 1988: Bangladesh is hit by the worst floods in a century. Alam photographs people's struggles, highlighting the mismanagement of relief efforts by the Ershad junta. 1988: Begins photographing migrant labourers who leave Bangladesh for all parts of the world. This becomes the seed for Alam's multi-year project on labour migration, Migrant Soul. At that time, the Bangladesh government and media were paying no attention to the concerns of migrant workers. 1989: Registers Drik Picture Library (named after the Sanskrit word for \"vision\") with an XT computer, a dot matrix printer on hire, and a telephone line. Continues photographing protests against the Ershad junta. 1990: First annual Drik calendar is published. 1990: Ershad regime falls. Along with the photograph of Noor Hossain's back by Pavel Rahman, Alam's photos become records of the democracy movement. In December 1990, the New York Times carries Alam's image of people celebrating Ershad's fall. 1990: Organises the first photo exhibition after the fall of the regime at Zainul Gallery, Dhaka University. The queue outside is a mile long as 400,000 people come to see the show in three days. 1991: Second annual Drik calendar comes out, featuring photographs by the first and second generations of post-1971 photographers, including Manzoor Alam Beg, Bijon Sarkar, Jahangir Kabir, Mohammad Ali Salim, Naibuddin Ahmed, Shafiqul Alam, Rashidun Nabi, and Shahidul Alam. 1991: Takes iconic photograph of Sufia, a young girl from Anwara who was orphaned in the April cyclone. Alam writes: \"She was soon taken in by another family. The generosity of the poor has always amazed me.\" The photograph is published by the New York Times. 1991: As Bangladesh holds its first elections after military rule, Alam photographs the voting booth. 1991: Photographs Adivasi women in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Alam continues his work on the rights of Adivasi people in the CHT for the next three decades. 1993: Local elders issue a religious fatwa against Nurjahan, mandating extrajudicial punishment. Nurjahan commits suicide by poisoning. Mahila Parishad, the largest women's organisation in Bangladesh, takes up the case. Alam photographs Nurjahan's father in Sylhet. 1993: Dutch organisation TOOL offers to help Drik set up Bangladesh's first email network, DrikTAP, using Fidonet technology, as part of \"South-South exchange\". Drik arranges a seminar on email at the Engineer's Institute, attended by the secretary of the Ministry of Information. 1994: Begins teaching photography to a group of working-class children. The group is named \"Out of Focus\". 1994: DrikTAP launches. The central server is a 286 computer, running from a single telephone line with fax/data/voice switch. In the first year there are 500 subscribers. 1996: Alam takes iconic photograph of a Dhaka University student from the AL's student wing, Bangladesh Chhatra League, inside a police van. The photograph is widely reprinted as an example of police repression under the BNP government. 1996: Seventh annual Drik calendar prints unseen photographs of Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War. The exhibit comprises restored black-and-white negatives, with fungus and scratches removed. In the introduction Alam protests the BNP government's attempts to erase the war: \"Though history books carry distortions, the photographs say otherwise. Photographs say, there is evidence, I am the witness.\" The calendar prints photographs of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (Begart Institute, Rashid Talukdar), surrendering Pakistani soldiers (Aftab Ahmed), and the first Bangladesh flag (Shahidul Alam). 1996: Spearheaded by the AL, protests spread nationwide demanding fair elections under a caretaker government. The BNP retreats behind a high wall of police and security. Unknown assailants stab Alam on the street eight times during a crackdown on journalists documenting street protests. 1997: Eighth annual Drik calendar consists entirely of photographs by the working-class children of Out of Focus, breaking with the tradition of featuring \"established\" photographers. 1997: Alam documents the role of sex workers in distributing condoms to prevent HIV/AIDS, work that was unacknowledged by the Bangladesh government, which was still denying there were any AIDS cases in the country. 1998: Ninth annual Drik calendar features Alam's photographs, which include one showing how domestic workers are not allowed to watch TV in the same room as those for whom they work. 1998: Establishes Pathshala, the South Asian Institute of Photography (renamed Pathshala South Asian Media Institute in 2010). It is launched to coincide with Dhaka's first World Press Photo exhibition, which is inaugurated jointly by AL deputy leader Abdus Samad Azad and BNP deputy leader Dr Badruddoza Chowdhury. 2000: Launches Chobi Mela, the first festival of photography in Asia, with the exhibition 1971: The War We Forgot. Dr Hasib Zakaria writes: \"It took six years for Alam to arrange and collect the photographs of 1971. Thirty photographers from about ten different nationalities affiliated with a dozen international news organisations participated in the exhibition.\" The exhibition features 1971 photos by Raghu Rai, Rashid Talukder, Kishore Parekh, Abbas, Don McCullin, Raymond Depardon, Marc Riboud, Mary Ellen Mark, David Burnett, and Marilyn Silverstone. 2001: Sets up Bangladesh Human Rights Network, which actively promotes human rights reforms both within Bangladesh and across geographical and political boundaries. 2001: Drik is using VSAT technology for its email network but finds costs too high. Alam meets with a member of the Bangladesh Planning Commission and advocates that the country connect to a submarine cable. The government declines, citing security concerns and setting Bangladesh back by a half decade in ICT. 2003: Fourteenth annual Drik calendar expands beyond Bangladeshi photographers to highlight photographs from all over the world. Alam advocates using the term \"Majority World\" instead of \"Third World\". 2005: As the US-led war in Iraq continues, the 15th annual Drik calendar celebrates \"Resistance\". 2006: Alam's photographic installation Belief, and Practices: Justice for Nurjahan is exhibited at the inaugural Singapore International Biennale. 2008: As free speech is shut down during the military-backed \"1/11 Caretaker Government,\" Drik and the International Federation of Journalists host a media roundtable on \"Building Tolerance and Unity through Media\" at Drik Gallery. 2008: Alam photographs protests against the loan of Bangladeshi artifacts for exhibition at the Musee Guimet in France. The protesters claim that the project, led by the military government, did not protect Bangladesh's rights within international cultural exchange. 2009: Police prevent Drik from opening the exhibition Into Exile: Tibet 1949 - 2009, organised by Students for a Free Tibet. Professor Muzaffar Ahmed sits in front of Drik Gallery protesting the ban. 2010: Police prevent noted Indian writer Mahasweta Devi from entering Drik Gallery to inaugurate Alam's exhibition Crossfire about extrajudicial killings. The police blockade is removed after Drik's lawyers file a writ and the exhibition finally opens. 2011: Alam's book My Journey as a Witness is published by Skira of Milan. 2011: The Birth Pangs of a Nation, edited by Alam, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the independence of Bangladesh, is published. This is part of Drik's \"Archiving 1971\" programme, which aims to collect oral, textual, and visual resources to build a one-stop repository for academics, researchers, and the public. 2013: Twenty-fourth annual Drik calendar features some of Bangladesh's early photographers, under the theme \"Pathfinders\". The earliest image is by Golam Kasem Daddy, who writes about developing his first print in 1912. 2013: In the only op-ed the New York Times published on Bangladesh's Shahbag movement demanding transparent war crimes trials, Alam writes: 'Bangladesh's original Constitution had four basic principles: nationalism, democracy, socialism and secularism. Military dictators replaced that with 'absolute trust and faith in the Almighty Allah as the basis of all actions' in 1977, and made another change in 1988 that led to our once-secular nation's being redefined as an Islamic one. Martial law, amnesty and political deals allowed the collaborators to go free and Jamaat-e-Islami to gradually rejoin the political mainstream.\" 2013: Alam opens Searching for Kalpana, a photography exhibit about the long-unsolved abduction of Adivasi activist Kalpana Chakma in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. 2014: Twenty-fifth annual Drik calendar, \"Silver Thread, Frayed Seams\", commemorates the victims and survivors of Tazreen and Rana Plaza, two of Bangladesh's worst garment factory disasters. 2014: Alam continues his work on Kalpana Chakma's abduction and opens his exhibition 18 on the 18th anniversary of her disappearance. The exhibition uses found objects, newspaper clippings, excerpts from her diary, and her personal belongings. 2015: Launches Kalpana's Warriors, an exhibition commemorating the activists who have pursued the Kalpana Chakma case for two decades. 2015: Receives Bangladesh's highest arts award, the Shilpakala Padak, from President Abdul Hamid. 2016: The Best Years of My Life, an exhibition and book of photographs by Alam of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia, opens at Bangabandhu International Conference Center as part of the ninth meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development. The meeting is opened by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. 2016: The July issue of British Journal of Photography highlights two global schools for special mention--the Royal College of Art in England and Pathshala in Bangladesh. 2017: Alam presents Embracing the Other, looking at ways in which we can recalibrate the conversation about Islam by considering the everyday life of devotees, focusing on one particular centre of learning, the Aga Khan Award-winning Bait Ur Rouf mosque in Dhaka. Alam writes, \"Islam (and pretty much all religions) by and large, provides a moral compass for our navigation. It is not Islam we need to fear, but the weapons industry and those who control it.\" 2018: Twenty-ninth annual Drik calendar, \"When Buddha Looks Away\", focuses on Rohingya refugees fleeing genocide in Myanmar. 2018: Alam is selected as the 2018 recipient of the Lucie Awards' Distinguished Humanitarian Award to be presented on October 28 at New York's Carnegie Hall. The Lucie Awards celebrate master photographers and their contributions to the field of photography. 2018: On August 5, along with other journalists, Alam photographs armed men attacking students protesting for road safety. He posts on social media and is interviewed on Al Jazeera. A few hours later, men in plain clothes abduct him from his home at night. After a national outcry, Alam is produced by the police in court, barefoot, unable to walk unaided, and showing clear signs of physical and mental torture. The government takes him into custody in relation to a case filed under section 57 of the ICT Act. More than forty days later, he remains imprisoned.

      "text": "The month of December ushers in the spirit of patriotism in every Bangali as the essence of victory fills the atmosphere. Why wouldn't it? Our beloved nation is the labour of extraordinary struggle, bloodshed, mutiny and beyond. As captivating as the history of our victory may sound to us today, especially to the generation born in an independent Bangladesh, it was much different for those who led us to this victorious moment. Many who fought the Liberation War of 1971 have perished while those who survived have not been able to get over the horrors of those bloody nine months. It is their accounts that we base much of our history upon. Apart from the major incidents during the war that many of us are familiar with, there are many more narratives of individual experiences and encounters that serve as slices of history adding to the glory of our victory. The following is one such chronicle about a Freedom Fighter named Kamrul Alam Khan Khasru during the dark days of war. Known for his stark bravado amongst the community of Freedom Fighters and the general public, Khasru was on the list of the \"most wanted\" by the Pakistani military during 1971. Following independence, Khasru also starred as a Freedom Fighter in the first Bangladeshi film on the Liberation War directed by Chashi Nazrul Islam titled, \"Ora Egaro Jon\". The incident Khasru narrates took place on the outskirts of Dhaka in Ruposhi, on the banks of the Shitalakshya River which was a strategic location during the war due to its proximity to the industrial area with one side facing the Demra ghat and the other Tarabo ghat. It was one of the few locations that the Pakistani army did not wipe out. They had deliberately set up heavily armed bunkers on either side of the road near the bank, one which led towards the Narsingdi-Sylhet highway and the other towards Cumilla-Chattogram highway. Initially, 11 Freedom Fighters including Khasru, who was the group commander, acquired guerilla warfare training from India in Dehradun. They later set up camp near the Shitalakshya. Blending in with the local community, they kept a close watch on the enemy, ready to attack when the opportunity was right. During that time Khasru would also travel to Dhaka to carry out missions, making use of different paths each time. In the first week of December in 1971, Khasru and his comrades assisted the Mitro Bahini (Bangladeshi and Indian allied forces) to cross the river while they were en route to Dhaka. Overtime, the Freedom Fighters established other camps across the area and further made use of an under-construction factory owned by Jahurul Islam to store their arms and ammunition. During monsoon, much of the region would be submerged due to floods, a situation Khasru and his comrades used to their advantage while surveilling the area against the Pak army who were not at all good swimmers. Upon learning about a local aristocrat in the area named Motalib Khan, a former navy officer who supported the Liberation War, Khasru decided to meet with him to secure whatever assistance they could get from him. Armed with his much-admired light machine gun (LMG), five loaded magazines and H E 36 hand grenades, on September 7, 1971 Khasru embarked on his boat (choi nouka) from Shalipur camp along with a steersman named Sunil, a teenager who was an expert at navigating the waters. While departing, Khasru informed his comrades that if they suddenly heard continuous firing, they should assume it was him and take action accordingly. In order to reach the destination, the duo had to cross from underneath a bridge near the Narsingdi road. As Sunil steered the boat which was veiled with a saree--an indication that religious women are on board--Khasru remained hidden. Suddenly, Sunil steadily alerted that a jeep was speeding towards Tarabo ghat and as Khasru peeked through the screen to scan the situation, he immediately figured that they had been targeted as five to six armed men on the jeep had their artillery pointed towards them. Khasru realised that if the boat was turned around, they would surely come under fire and if they continued, they would definitely be stopped as it neared the bridge. With death around the corner, Khasru used the veil to his advantage as he swiftly maneuvered himself into the water under its guise while the young boy propelled against the current keeping his calm all the while. Stealthily, Khasru swam to take shelter right under the very bridge which the jeep was speeding towards and just as the boat neared, he heard the men ordering Sunil to stop the boat and remove the saree so that they could inspect it from above. Seeing that the boat was empty, the soldiers got back on their vehicle and left the scene. With a sigh of relief, Khasru swam back on the boat and the two commenced their journey. After reaching Motalib Khan's residence, not only did they receive a warm welcome, but Khan also ensured that the Freedom Fighters could use his residence when required and further expressed his willingness to participate in the war. All of a sudden there was a commotion outside the house and people were running frantically. Upon inquiring, Khasru learned that the Pak military was looting the local bazaar--they would often do so to flex their authority upon the locals while extorting their commodities--and gathering individuals in queues. No one could give an exact headcount of the soldiers, but Khasru was informed that they came on three patrol boats. Infuriated, Khasru requested Khan for a brave helper while he began to plot an attack in his mind. Khan suggested that Ajay would be the right person to accompany him on the boat ride back. As they reached the outskirts of Ruposhi bazaar, Khasru examined the surroundings and noticed three patrol boats at the bank and began to weigh his options as to whether he should conduct a raid or an ambush. But as time was of the essence, the situation seemed suitable for an ambush. Khasru asked Ajay to manage a shovel with which he dug a mini trench by the river bank and took position with his LMG under the camouflage of the bushes. Pleased with their pillage, the Pak military carelessly began to head back to their camp on the patrol boats unaware that Khasru was patiently waiting, finger on his trigger, scoping for the moment to unleash his wrath upon them. As soon as they were within his range, keeping the Shitalakshya River as a witness, Khasru vowed to mark the day as a memorable chapter in history, determined to annihilate his enemies singlehandedly he pulled the trigger with all his rage riddling his targets with bullets as he exclaimed \"Joy Bangla\" emptying all five of his LMG's magazines. Two of the patrol boats sank shortly while the third one drifted away with wailing voices from the remaining wounded soldiers on board. Unbeknownst, they too opened fire haphazardly at no proper target. With luck in his favour, Khasru managed to dodge their bullets by a few centimetres and remained unharmed throughout the ambush as his guerilla training proved worthwhile. He was later informed that the third boat reached Demra ghat but had more dead bodies than alive. Following the incident, the Pak army brought in reinforcements, shut down the ghats and attacked with mortars and heavy machine guns, killing whoever they found ruthlessly and set houses ablaze, including that of Khan's who managed to escape with his family. Prior to that, Khasru had informed the villagers of the possibility of a counterattack by the enemy and asked them to abscond, and at the same time transferred his base along with his comrades. Those who didn't pay heed weren't as lucky. Meanwhile, the Freedom Fighters were just three kilometres away at a nearby village, ready to engage in combat. However, despite them being heavily armed, without any functional boats to travel with, the Pakistanis did not dare attack the village where Khasru and his comrades set up camp. Or perhaps they somehow sensed that a destructive fate awaited them all on the other side. Having accomplished many fearless missions with ingenuity throughout 1971, Kamrul Alam Khan Khasru considers Operation Ruposhi as one of the most thrilling and remarkable undertakings of his life. And he was able to carry it out due to his loyalty for the land, its people, and the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.   Minam Haque is a member of the Editorial Team.\n"

      "text": "Human beings, by nature, are surprisingly resilient. We fight back against natural disasters, human-induced hazards, economic vulnerabilities, and health shocks and, in the process, we keep learning how to cope with and adapt to these adversities. But the degree to which one can withstand such adversities varies from person to person, even from community to community, based on their capacity and resources. We use the term \"resilience\" to refer to such capacity of a system (individual, group, and community) to \"bounce back\" after coming across hardships. Today, resilience is widely used from different perspectives both in academic and development discourses. Accordingly, building resilience of people to natural, environmental and other socio-economic hazards has become a key development agenda over the last couple of decades. The United Nations (UN) in its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) incorporated the issue of resilience emphasising on \"building the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters.\" Moreover, Bangladesh's 7th Five Year Plan (7FYP) adopted complementary strategies of building resilience of people to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in addition to strategies for economic growth of 7.4 percent. However, Bangladesh is reportedly at greater risk of natural disasters because of global warming and climate change taking place. The northeastern haor region of the country is, among other regions, at the receiving end of the adverse impact of that change. The overriding challenge of haor inhabitants is perhaps the fact that they have limited livelihood options if their existing livelihoods are disrupted by natural calamities. The complexity of this challenge restricts their livelihood options--holding them back from joining the journey towards national progress. The haor dwellers mainly rely on Boro crops and fishing, while a minority section depends on livestock rearing and small business. Hence, enhancing resilient livelihood of haor dwellers--a livelihood that can sustain its key functions (food, income, poverty reduction, etc.) and absorb the impacts of disasters and shocks without causing major disruption in the day-to-day functions --is their utmost need, in line with the priority of SDGs and 7FYP of Bangladesh. Four possible interventions can be chalked up to enhance the livelihood resilience of haor dwellers. Firstly, we need to ensure security of the crops cultivated in the area. Early flash flood is a matter of prime concern for these geographically vulnerable areas, disrupting livelihoods every 2-3 years. Flash floods damage the Boro crop which is the only means of livelihood for most of them. A number of factors are associated with this. Flash floods take place mainly because of depression-like landform and rainfall runoff from across the border of India. The governance issues pertinent to the construction and repair of the embankment compound this geographical challenge. Last year, the government came up with a solution: the Kabita (money for work) Policy 2017, laying out the details of activities of the embankment projects which are time-bound for the associated committees. But even after the policy was put into effect, the formation of the committees and starting of the projects have reportedly been delayed. With a view to ensuring their crop security, strong implementation of the policy is certainly required. Popularising existing short-duration crop variety in the areas, climate-smart vegetable cultivation, bringing kanda--a slightly higher land typically government-owned and unused--into cultivation, and enhancing agricultural research are also needed to ensure resilient livelihoods for the population. Secondly, when it comes to livelihood resilience, it is necessary to create linkages between wider markets and the haor region which is restricted by geographical isolation, and fragile and inadequate road networks. According to the Master Plan of Haor Area, 11 of the haor upazilas are not yet connected with road networks. During flash floods and regular inundation, boats are the only means of transport; the situation gets worse when afal--a type of high wave--takes place during monsoon flooding. The road networks and other communication means need to be improved taking the ecological aspect of the area into account. With the leading role of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), commercial livestock rearing needs to be facilitated, especially sheep farming which has high adaptive capacity to the ecology of the region. These people will be keen to start commercial livestock rearing once access to the wider market becomes easier. Thirdly, the government should encourage private sector investment and small-scale entrepreneurship in these areas. The key may be to provide the right incentives/leverage, e.g. tax exemption, special investment loan, and legal protection for those willing to invest in the area. The commercial sector will gain momentum if communication infrastructure is developed and skilled human resources are made available. Following BRAC's model of skills development, establishment of vocational institutes and linking the trainees to the employers may be an effective approach for the government and other organisations. In addition to government efforts, NGOs should also come forward with some skills development programmes. And finally, all of our development agenda should reflect the special needs of the hard-to-reach region. Special allocation for the region in our budget is also essential. On the government's part, the master plan should be implemented with high priority. We expect wider reflection of the master plan in the next FYP. Furthermore, given the socio-economic backwardness and vulnerable ecological set-up, the next FYP should include the haor region in its lists of \"lagging regions\" and \"disaster-prone regions.\" While recurrent natural disasters continue to hold the population living in the haor basin back, resilient livelihood may pave a sustainable way forward in the face of such disasters. If our development agenda remains too focused on national growth rate, the lagging regions will stay left behind--with even greater spatial disparity. Unless we are able to create a resilient haor community, achieving the SDGs--the thrust of which is \"leaving no one behind\"--will remain an unfulfilled aspiration.

      "text": "Annual holidays and other closures eat up more than half the academic year at many secondary schools and madrasas, one of the reasons why students have to turn to private tutors. This also leaves the teachers struggling to complete the syllabus. So they rush through the curriculum to prepare the students for examinations, eventually affecting the quality of education, teachers and experts said. Secondary schools and madrasas have at least 137 holidays -- 85 public holidays and 52 Fridays. Many of these institutions are used as centres for public examinations. Students of these institutions lose another month or so of classroom learning as a result. There are 30,000 secondary schools and madrasas in the country now. Last year, 3,412 of them were used as centres for SSC and equivalent exams, 2,541 for HSC and equivalent exams and 2,903 for JSC exams. Officials at the Dhaka Education Board said around 1,000 institutions host at least two public exams. Another 400 schools and madrasas host all the three exams, meaning there are no classes in these institutions for around 230 days, or about eight months. \"We need to rush through the syllabus, especially in the later part of the year,\" said a teacher at Tejgaon Govt High School in the capital. This is a key reason for students to go to coaching centres or private tutors, he added. Abdul Mannan, director of the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE), acknowledged that public examinations seriously hamper academic activities. \"It is a common complaint that teachers of these schools cannot complete the syllabus,\" he added. Educationists say students are deprived of classroom learning because of too many holidays and public exams. \"Students have to depend on private tuition as they do not get proper education at schools,\" said Prof Siddiqur Rahman, who was the chief consultant of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board when it developed the existing curriculum for secondary education in 2012. To improve learning at schools, educationists suggest cutting the summer and winter vacations. They also want a shorter vacation for festivals. Prof Siddiqur said they had proposed bringing down the annual holidays to 118 days, including weekends and 24 days for midterm and final exams, in 2012. \"We had made the proposal so teachers can complete the syllabus in time,\" he said, adding that they were yet to get a response from the authorities. He is also in favour of cutting the duration of public exams. \"SSC and HSC exams should not take more than 20 days. And there is no need for holding JSC exams at all.\" In addition to the annual holidays and other shutdowns, natural disasters such as floods often lead to unplanned closures. Also, headteachers have the authority to close their school for three days in a year. Jahangir Hossain, a director at the DSHE, said they were planning to set up public exam centres in each of the 491 upazilas so that there is no need for schools to suspend class for exams. \"The education ministry asked us about a month ago to submit a project proposal for the construction of exam centres,\" he told The Daily Star early this month. Officials are now working on the proposal.   According to the initial plan, there will be one exam centre for every 4,000 students. If an upazila has more than 4,000 students, there will be more than one centre. Each room will have seating arrangements for 100 students, and it will have multimedia projectors, CCTV cameras, and fire safety equipment."

      "text": "Many readers are likely to have come across the powerful photo and news published on schools affected by flood in northern and central regions of Bangladesh in The Daily Star on August 4, 2016. The photo of schoolgirls, wading through knee-deep floodwater at the premises of a school in Tangail Sadar upazila to attend classes, spoke more than a thousand words. Education in emergency deserves more attention in Bangladesh, one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change, and children have to bear a disproportionate brunt of its effects. In Bangladesh, children comprise 39.7 percent of the population. A prosperous future is contingent upon the opportunity for these children to grow as able and competent citizens with equality and without discrimination. It is, therefore, obligatory for the country to provide a congenial environment for children to reach their maximum potential. Government's efforts for children's wellbeing have been sincere and sustained. Bangladesh is among the first few countries to ratify the two most significant global treaties that protect the rights of children namely, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Formulation of the National Children Policy 2011, National Children Act 2013, and National Child Labour Elimination Policy 2010 are significant steps in ensuring a better life for each and every child across the country. Bangladesh enters the era of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with a solid development base arising from progress on several Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets. Adequate education will drive productivity of young adults and ultimately economic growth in the coming decades. Despite all this significant progress, poverty coupled with natural disasters prevent many children from enjoying their right to education, which is embodied in the UNCRC. Bangladesh is also committed to ensure primary education for all children. Article 17 of the Bangladesh Constitution specifies that the State shall adopt effective measures for the purpose of establishing a uniform, mass-oriented and universal system of education and extending free and compulsory education to all children. Compulsory Primary Education Act, 1990 and Primary Education Development Programme (PEDP) also show the importance of basic education for all children. However, all these policies and programmes are often defeated by the ever changing climate of Bangladesh that often leads to natural disasters. Impacts of disasters such as cyclones, floods, flash floods, riverbank erosion on children's education are severe and harmful. It damages school infrastructure, disrupts educational activities and displaces children and their families. Children also lose their learning materials. The UNICEF report states that on average, 900 schools suffer severe damage from floods, cyclones and river erosion every year in Bangladesh. More than 4,666 schools are affected by disasters per year. In the the past three years, natural disasters - particularly cyclones - have disrupted the education of more than 1.5 million children. If we want to achieve the SDG's, there is no alternative but to ensure education of the children before, during and after any emergency. Preparedness, quality, participation and coordination are key principles while delivering education during any emergency situation. Preparedness for disaster allows time to think through the impact on schools, effect on the education system, ways to support the most vulnerable groups and how to gauge the response of other actors in advance. In Bangladesh, there is no common guideline for school emergency response and it is not addressed significantly in the country disaster management plan and policy. Different development agencies like Save the Children are working with the government for the development and standardisation of these guidelines under the comprehensive school safety theme through DIPECHO-8, an action plan supported by the European Commission. NGOs have been providing non-formal primary education (NFPE) to out-of-school children principally in remote disaster-prone locations, including coast, chars, haors, and hill tracts since 2007. Education was suspended after Cyclone Roanu hit the coastal areas, but with support from international donors like IKEA Foundation, non-formal primary education was resumed quickly in Cox's Bazar through Save the Children's operated SHIKHON programme. Bangladesh sits on a three-way junction of major tectonic plates, and dangerous pressure is building along a fault line, according to research published earlier this year. The situation could unleash a massive earthquake, putting children's lives and education at high risk. We need to get our act together right now to protect the future of Bangladesh by redefining the role of institutions in both education and disaster management.

      "text": "Today, at least one in four people in Bangladesh lives in urban areas. And in 30 years, at least half of the country's population will be living in cities. Dhaka is already the world's most crowded city and its population size will double by 2030. Chattogram will emerge as a megacity with 5-10 million people. Narayanganj, Sylhet, Gazipur and Rajshahi will experience a similar growth. Over time, the country will see its 4,500 Union Parishads convert into small towns. These predictions are in line with 2018 UN estimates that more than half of the world's population will be living in urban areas by 2050. Globally, cities are emerging as platforms for production, innovation and trade. And more people are moving to tap into these opportunities. But rapid urbanisation is also resulting in unbalanced growth. Targeting and reducing urban poverty, delivering public services and providing decent work for all, to name just a few key issues, are becoming more challenging. Climate risks are further compounding the problems. Cities are being forced to reconsider how to handle the effects of both slow and rapid-onset disasters such as droughts, floods and river erosion. What will these mean for governance, finance or inequality in urban areas? How can cities become more resilient and sustainable? Bangladesh is also facing these tough questions while experiencing the fallouts of unsustainable urban development. Bangladesh is among the world's most climate vulnerable countries. Two hundred thousand coastal residents will be forced to migrate with the continual rise in the sea level, according to recent studies. The majority will likely head to Dhaka or to neighbouring districts in the coastal region. Already, inequality is rising partly because there are not enough formal jobs to absorb growing urban populations. Dhaka and Chattogram are under pressure as secondary cities are not growing as fast as the big ones. Affordable housing is another giant challenge as urban areas have a fragmented housing delivery system; this is resulting in a rapid growth of slums and informal settlements without any tenure security. Inadequate urban policies and lack of implementation are making the situation worse. Despite the increasing significance of Bangladesh's cities, the role that urban areas will play is neither widely understood nor fully recognised in the public debate in the country. Municipal budgets tend to be strained and can depend heavily on government support. And even while more urban stakeholders are stepping in to tackle the challenges, work tends to be either siloed or uncoordinated. Even then, Bangladesh can showcase good examples of urban development: in 2016, Rajshahi became a global model for tackling ambient air pollution in cities. Its efforts to clean up brick kilns and make the city greener were lauded and has had far-reaching impacts on public health. Narayanganj has demonstrated how to become financially solvent. And, Jhenaidah municipality is determined to provide quality public healthcare and affordable housing to support low-income communities and help reduce urban poverty. Success stories such as these can inspire action for building resilience for more sustainable cities in Bangladesh. Next steps now should focus on replicating these home-grown solutions to the country's urban challenges. Bangladesh's action on building sustainable and resilient cities will also have big implications for how well it meets its international commitments: the country is a signatory to the New Urban Agenda and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Discussions on these agendas emphasise on creating safe and inclusive cities so that no one is left behind. As a promising start, in line with the SDGs, the government of Bangladesh has already noted specific strategies and priorities for promoting sustainable urbanisation in its 7th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). Now, the step forward should be to translate those commitments into action. To do so, Bangladesh needs its urban stakeholders--the government, communities, NGOs, urban activists and anyone with a stake in the country's cities--to partner. October 31, the World Cities Day, 2018 presents an excellent opportunity for doing so to help build sustainable and resilient cities in Bangladesh.

      "text": "When I was visiting a museum in Athens last year, one of my Greek friends was explaining to me about an ancient water supply canal that went through underneath the museum. It was amazing to see that the authorities in Athens realised the importance of providing clean water for its newly urbanised citizens, even thousands of years ago. Sadly, in the 21st century, 1,400 children under five die every day from diseases (such as diarrhea) linked to lack of safe water and inadequate sanitation according to Unicef, at a time when the world is richer, technology is better, and knowledge is ever-expanding. It appears that the governments, especially in South Asia and Africa, either do not understand the deep correlation between water and human wellbeing or simply do not care about those who are primarily affected--the voiceless poor. The close connection between water scarcity and poverty is made clear in both the United Nations' Human Development Report 2006 and the Millennium Declaration 2000. It is essential for human survival but currently over two billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress, and about four billion people experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year (UN 2019). When I was visiting my hometown in Sunamganj last year, some farmers told me their accounts of how water is making their families poorer. For example, they cannot irrigate their croplands during the dry season for lack of water.  Although the UN Water Development Report 2019 recognises safe drinking water and sanitation as basic human rights, as they are indispensable to sustaining healthy livelihoods and are fundamental in maintaining the dignity of all human beings, across South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa water scarcity is forcing young girls to drop out of school in large numbers. Traditionally, in these societies, it is women's responsibility to walk miles just to fetch clean water for their families.  Meanwhile, inadequate and unequal access to water is both a result and a cause of poverty. The economic development that so many people need to climb out of poverty remains stagnant without the availability of water. With rapid population growth and increased industrial demand, water withdrawals have tripled over the last 50 years and are likely to continue, making billions vulnerable to food security and economic activities.   Water scarcity hits the poorest the hardest. They pay a poverty premium, directly and indirectly, to meet their water needs. A wealthy Warden Road (Mumbai) or Gulshan (Dhaka) resident has guaranteed availability of freshwater while the poor living in the nearest slum of Dharavi in Mumbai or Korail in Dhaka not only struggle to find appropriate source of quality water but also pay more compared to the well-off. Eminent business thinker CK Prahalad, an expert in the field, exclusively illustrates this in his book The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid.  According to the UN Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 2019, Bangladesh has made significant strides in poverty reduction and all developing countries are urged to follow in Bangladesh's footsteps. In a brilliantly edited book Poverty and Water, Haakon Lein writes about Bangladesh in the chapter titled \"Water, agricultural development and rural poverty in Bangladesh.\" He finds that during the 1990s, Bangladesh achieved substantial economic growth and made significant progress in poverty reduction. There may be many explanations and one of them is related to agriculture. Lein argues, along with other issues in agriculture, the single most important factor has been water, or, more precisely, the fact that Bangladeshi farmers have been relatively successful in gaining control over water resources found in this delta. Agricultural growth has been driven by the expansion of dry season irrigation based on privately owned tube wells and pumps, combined with the spread of new high-yielding rice varieties, he goes on to say.  However, 24.2 million Bangladeshis are still undernourished, meaning one in six don't get enough to eat, and the benefits of economic growth have been distributed unevenly across the country.   When I was visiting my hometown in Sunamganj last year, some farmers told me their accounts of how water is making their families poorer. For example, they cannot irrigate their croplands during the dry season for lack of water and due to floods during the monsoon, as heavy rains wash away their crops. At my request, some local government officials investigated the area, and explained to us the complexities, including government discouragement for private solutions that Lein had pointed out. Water scarcity may endanger democracy and the state of human rights in India, according to the recently published UN Human Rights Report. It observes, 400 million people in India will have no clean drinking water by 2030. There will be mass migration to the already overpopulated and under-resourced cities; more people will compete for fewer resources; and food prices will go up. In the face of desperation, rule of law might not survive, which will have global implications, the report added, giving India's government five years to act. For water-stressed countries, it is not necessarily about physical lack of water available for human use. Africa faces huge problems in securing sufficient clean water for all, but physically, the continent has more water available per capita than Europe. Even Cherrapunji in India, the wettest place on earth, suffers from recurrent water shortages. And bad policies are one of the main contributing factors.  Apart from water-poverty correlations, water will acquire the same strategic significance in the 21st century as oil did in the past century and will therefore play a crucial role in future geo-political relations. The prospect of \"water wars\" is increasingly becoming likely: the number of water-related conflicts reported worldwide has risen sharply in the past 15 years, according to the Pacific Institute, a water research group.   Every country surrounded by mighty rivers such as the Nile, Mekong, Jordan Valley or Brahmaputra--vital sources of water for billions of people--are at risk of conflict. In his book Water: Asia's New Battleground, Brahma Chellaney argues, \"Water scarcity is Asia's defining crisis of the 21st century.\" Water has emerged as a critical issue that will determine whether Asia is headed towards greater cooperation or greater competition as it has the world's largest number of people without basic or adequate access to water with the lowest per-capita availability of all the continents. It would be very unwise if the international community ignores this pressing issue concerning the most basic element of human survival.

      "text": "    Mahfuz Anam, Editor & Publisher, The Daily Star\n Bangladesh is identified as one of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change. Every aspect of our life will be affected by climate change. The Daily Star wants to collaborate with experts and activists to have a better understanding of the climate change issues and the ways to combat it.                     Brig Gen Shahedul Anam Khan, ndc, psc, (Retd), Associate Editor, The Daily Star \n Bangladesh will be at the receiving end of the impacts of climate change in the years to come. The manifestations, after-effects and consequences of climate change need to be analysed meticulously. Within the next forty years, almost 40 million people will lose their homes because of global warming. The security implication of climate change is also huge. We must identify different types of threats and ways to mitigate those threats. We need a coordinated effort to prevent the climate change consequences.                Major General A N M Muniruzzaman, ndc, psc (Retd), President, BIPSS\n Climate change is recognised as a major security threat to the world. It affects individuals, communities and countries around the world. Climate change causes hunger, disease, poverty and threatens social and political stability. It heightens existing social and political tensions, and can lead to new ones. If unchecked, climate change is likely to aggravate old tensions and trigger new conflicts. It is for these reasons that the United Nations Security Council recognised climate change as an international security issue. Significant changes are taking place in the global climate. The global temperature is on the rise. The last four years have marked the hottest temperature in over 200 years. We are also seeing the process of rapid melting of the ice sheets and glaciers. All these are also leading to sea level rise with potential grave consequences. The world today is experiencing more extreme weather events and more frequent natural calamities. The adverse impacts of climate change will be all encompassing. However, they can be analysed on two platforms- human security and hard security. On the human security dimension, the impacts would be more severe in what is now being called a nexus of food, water and energy security. It will also impact human health and habitation. Our efforts to achieve development could be severely hampered leading to more people going under the poverty line. The risk of hunger due to climate change impacts is extremely high and it could go up to 10 percent to 20 percent by 2050. Reduced agricultural productivity is potentially among the worst consequences of climate change. Similarly, our supply of fresh and safe drinking water will also be severely impacted. More than 2 billion people live in countries that are experiencing high water stress. The situation is likely to worsen as climate change threatens our sources of water. Human health will be another vulnerable sector. Climate change will result in large numbers of death due to vector-borne and water-borne diseases. It will degrade our quality of life and give rise to new diseases. Climate change will also threaten our quest for development. We could see more than 100 million people will be pushed to extreme poverty by 2030. Our ambition for achieving the SDGs will be difficult to achieve under climate-induced conditions. Perhaps, the biggest threat will come from loss of human habitation resulting in loss of livelihood that can trigger internal displacement and mass migration. Our energy infrastructures and grid system will become extremely vulnerable due to climate-induced conditions. Competition over scarce resources can lead to total breakdown of social cohesion and trigger conflict among different social groups. We have already experienced such scenarios in Darfur. Climate-induced marginalisation of people will take place in large numbers making them extremely vulnerable to the recruitment drive by criminal and terrorist organisations. It is for these reasons that our Honorable Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, recently wrote in the World Economic Forum Publication: \"I am less concerned about conventional \"warfare\". Instead, I foresee climatic stress causing tensions to simmer and sparking different forms of conflicts within communities. We must rise above the politics of doubt, and accept that climatic vulnerabilities lead to a fragile economy and risk human security\". A major threat to stability will come from sea level rise. As the sea continues to rise, it will inundate many of our coastal megacities like Shanghai, Mumbai, financial centers like New York, London, communication hubs like Rotterdam, and all these could paralyse the international system. Two-third of the global population lives within 100 kilometers of the coast so it will make many of the existing areas unlivable triggering mass migration or movement of people. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable states facing the challenge of climate change. We are already experiencing all the negative impacts of climate change in Bangladesh such as scarcity of drinking water, saline intrusion into our cultivable land, loss of livelihood and severe weather events. Bangladesh also faces serious threats from the rise in sea level which is likely to create a climate refugee population of 25 million people.         Dr. Saleemul Huq, Director, International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB)\n Due to climate change, there will be a huge number of displaced people in the country. Millions of people will not be able live in the low-lying coastal areas of Bangladesh. Therefore, massive migration is inevitable. The focus will be on dealing with internal migration, which will most definitely take place in the future. We must take steps to educate children on internal migration. There should be opportunities created for the climate refugees, so that they would not be thinking about Dhaka city when it comes to future settlement. There should be climate-resilience, migrant friendly towns to accommodate the flow of migrants. There should be an introduction of climate passport in order to identify the displaced people due to climate change and this approach could be used for settlement of refugees in other countries. We should have mechanisms in place to train the climate refugees so that they can earn their own livelihood. We should also teach them to be good citizens of other countries. We must be resilient in the face of rising sea level. Climate change pattern is changing, and we must be prepared for tackling these changes.       Mohammad Abdul Wazed, Former Director General, Department of Disaster Management, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief\n Over the years, the impacts of climate change have intensified around the world. The frequency of disasters and the massive scale of destruction have taken a toll on our economy. We must seek ways of adaptation as it is the best way to cope with such situations. The development projects must consider issues of sustainability. We must find ways to produce early warning capacity that could save thousands of lives. Research and innovation will help us to combat the adverse effects of climate change. Salinity is an environmental issue that we cannot afford to ignore. We should have a mechanism of sharing real-time data among climate change affected countries across the globe.          Prof. Dr. Imtiaz A Hussain, Professor, Global Studies and Governance Program, School of Liberal Arts & Social Sciences, Independent University, Bangladesh (IUB)\n We should focus on environmental issues such as diversion of River Ganges. Many environmental disasters can be prevented by taking early measures. Most of the ecological disasters can be prevented if we take early steps to tackle them. By the year 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans. We should change our lifestyle to get rid of plastic. The social norms have driven us to not wear the same clothes twice. Eid is the biggest shopping occasion in Bangladesh. We need to encourage people to reuse old clothes, even for occasions such as Eid.         Dr. Ferdousi Begum, Executive Director, Development of Biotechnology & Environmental Conservation Center (DEBTEC)\n Climate insurance should be introduced for farmers facing climate change related threats. We must have an elaborate policy for ensuring water security as scarcity of water will be a major issue in the near feature. There should be a policy outline for the security of women and for people with disability. We must change our consuming behavior to prevent unmindful production of plastic and wastes.           Rear Admiral A S M A Awal, NBP, OSP, ndc, psc, MDS, MBA (Retd), Former Ambassador & Assistant Chief of  Naval Staff\n At present there are about 875,000 Rohingya refugees living in Kutupalong refugee camp. The locals are witnessing environmental degradation on a massive scale. The environmental degradation is making Kutupalong refugee camp one of the worst affected areas in South Asia. Climate change is a global problem. It is not affecting the developing countries only. There are clear indications that climate change is adversely impacting highly developed nations such as the USA.         Mizan R Khan, PhD, Professor, Department of Environmental Science and Management (ESM), North South University\n Adaptation is key to reduce the climate change related security risks. We must understand security through the lens of human security as well as through the path of climate resilience. The adaptive capacity of the citizens to ensure state security should also be focused on. Although migrants are viewed negatively in many countries, in recent years, positive aspects of migration have been identified. There should be a strategy in Bangladesh to work alongside different nations to address climate change issues.           Eshani Ruwanpura, Programme Specialist - Adolescents & Youth, UNFPA\n Peaceful, just and comprehensive societies are necessary to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Climate change is a major deterrent to our progress towards achieving the SDGs.               Dr. Nurul Islam Nazem, Professor, Department of Geography and Environment, University of Dhaka\n We must consider the domestic and international dimensions of climate security and focus on our preparedness. It is a fact that we did not contribute enough to prevent the adversities of climate change and therefore we remain vulnerable. Emphasis should be given on strengthening diplomatic relations to save ourselves from climate change. In a recent survey of 12,000 households in Dhaka, about 20.1 percent people were identified as climate change migrants. The climate change migrant population is fighting for survival in the cities. There should be an effective institutional measure to help the migrants to adapt with the changing scenarios. This is the most appropriate time for planning in order to save agricultural lands, water bodies, forests and human settlements.          Brig Gen Mirza Baker Sarwar Ahmed, ndc, Psc (Retd), Vice Chairman, RAOWA\n The major polluting nations should support climate funds. These countries were not present in the Climate Change Conference. They must be held accountable for their role in polluting the nature.             Shamir Shehab, Lecturer, North South University \n Although research indicates that water-intensive crop and cotton production severely degraded land in Syria, there is still lack of any conclusive evidence to establish a direct link between the Syrian conflict and climate change.             Shafqat Munir, Research Fellow, BIPSS\n Climate related stress can be a major cause of marginalisation of people which can lead to radicalisation.                    Ayesha Kabir, Consulting Editor, The Daily Prothom Alo (online edition)\n I think the idea of climate passport is relevant to our present situation. Various forms of extreme nationalism have been growing all over the world that can pose a serious challenge to the resettlement of climate refugees.               Commodore Kazi Emdadul Haq, (L), BSP, ndu, psc, BN (retd), Director General, Bangladesh Institute of Maritime Research and Development (BIMRAD)\n It is the developed countries which are primarily responsible for climate change. We should ask for land from the developed countries in order to have islands for resettling the poor and destitute climate refugees.             Dr. A Atiq Rahman, Executive Director, Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies (BCAS)\n Climate change is not only causing problem to the developing nations. It has even affected the ecosystem, economy and population of developed countries like the USA. It has also affected the electrical system of Puerto Rico, recently. The sea level rise will be a big issue in the future. There are floods happening in places where there were no signs of flood for the past thousand years. The number of deaths due to climate change all around the world is also increasing. Climate change is also affecting rice production in Bangladesh. Climate change would also put a huge impact on the river systems. Due to the ecological disasters, political borders will also be at stake as people would move beyond the borders.   Major General A N M Muniruzzaman   We should understand the vulnerability aspects of climate change. Climate marginalisation can have a huge impact on a country. There are strong links between climate change and environmental migration. We need a significant international co-operation to win the battle of climate change. We need to promote climate diplomacy to build cooperation among all the nation states. Now-a-days, big corporates like Coca-Cola are taking initiatives to fight climate change. This mechanism needs to be promoted. There should be a framework for climate governance.   Prof. Dr. Imtiaz A Hussain We must take care of our environment to ensure sustainable development. We should emphasise on using eco-friendly products such as jute. We also need more R&D to find new measures to combat the threat posed by climate change."

      "text": "Bangladesh is one of the fastest growing urbanising countries of the world. By 2025, 50 percent of Bangladesh is supposed to be urbanised. Cities are growing rapidly. By 2050 the number of city dwellers is supposed to increase by 66 percent (from 4 billion in 2016 to 6.3 billion in 2050). As demand for land increases, the tendency to encroach on wetlands is also on the rise. Filling up of ponds, wetlands, rivers, khals and depressions, cross bunds across rivers, and drying up of wetlands disrupt natural water settings; dumping rubbish on wetlands degrades natural green spaces enhancing pollution and dying of rivers. Wetlands are the most useful natural productive ecosystem in the world. Estimates indicate that about 6.4 percent of land in the world are wetlands. Varieties of species of microbes, plants, insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds, fish and mammals are part of a wetland ecosystem. The complex, dynamic relationships among those organisms in a wetland environment create unique food webs. They vary in America, Europe, Africa and Asia and differ from one another playing an integral role in the ecology of watersheds. Species of birds and mammals rely on these food cycles for food, water and shelter, especially during migration and breeding. Thus they become part of a global cycle for water, nitrogen and sulphur. Wetlands are the storehouses of carbon within plants and soil and carbon dioxide is not released to the atmosphere as a result. Wetlands help to moderate global climate change. They are natural water purifiers; improve water quality; protect from floods; control shoreline erosion; exude natural beauty; and create opportunities for recreation at no cost. By protecting our wetlands, we actually protect ourselves. Wetlands are the \"kidneys of the landscape\", rechargers of aquifers giving \"purified\" water for safe drinking. Bangladesh is highly rich in wetlands. Aerial photographs show rivers and streams, freshwater lakes and marshes, haors, baors, beels, jheels, lakes, ponds, water storage reservoirs, floodplains, flooded cultivated paddy fields and estuarine and mangrove system. They are considered as \"biological supermarkets.\" We have about seven to eight million hectares of wetland as permanent rivers and streams (480,000 hectares), estuarine and mangrove swamps (610,000 hectares), shallow lakes and marshes (120 000-290 000 hectares), large reservoirs (90,000 hectares), small ponds and tanks (150 000-180 000 hectares), shrimp ponds (90000-115000 hectares) and seasonally flooded floodplains (5,770,000 hectares). Millions of human-made ponds, tanks and khals, in the end, also turn into natural wetlands and serve us without any rest. We have a deep emotional attachment with these wetlands: \"Bhate mache Bangali\" being an example. The lives of our rural community are inseparable from these wetlands and resources; they get their nutrition from small fish captures, aquatic plants and rice straws and many other types of greenery. The Tanguar haor and the Sundarbans are two world heritage sites where wetlands are a central attraction. Haors are bowl-shaped depressions mostly found in the north-east region; and monsoon flooding is the cause behind their creation. Total haor area is about 24,500 sq km. There are about 411 haors covering an area of about 8000km over the districts of Sunamganj, Sylhet, Moulvibazar, Habiganj, Netrokona and Kishoreganj. Beels are large surface water bodies that accumulate rainfall runoff water in depressions forming wetland bearing local characters and are found all over Bangladesh. Beels are essential parts of active floodplains of the Surma-Meghna, the Brahmaputra-Jamuna, and the Ganges-Padma river systems varying in size and shape. Baors are oxbow lakes formed from the morphologically effluent dead arms of rivers. Oxbow lakes are quite visible in the older floodplains of the western part of the country. Oxbow lakes act as local water reservoirs, and help to control local flood level. The haors, baors, beels and jheels all together play a unique role for the environment, ecology, economy and livelihood of local people in the country. Wetlands make significant contributions to the economy, society, and ecology of the country. Fish production in wetlands contributes substantially to national income. The fishery sector provides full-time job opportunities to over 1.2 million people. About eight percent of the total population of the country depend on the fishery sector for livelihood. These wetlands provide a habitat for many aquatic animals which are economically valuable. Haors, baors, and beels support 60 types of fish species and at least 75 species of vegetation, which is nearly half of the national total of 158 species of vegetation. Wetland values were estimated in Hail Haor in 2000 and came to be USD 650 per hectare--almost double that of the net return of single crop rice cultivation. However, wetlands of Bangladesh as well as of other countries face serious threats. Almost 40 percent of our rivers are already dead or lost. Wetlands are under attack in various ways: encroachment, urbanisation, flash floods, siltation and sedimentation, river bank erosion and wave action, reduction of navigability, scarcity of drinking water, fragile and inappropriate road network, degradation of ecosystem, indiscriminate harvest of natural resources, over-exploitation of fisheries resources and swamp forest, weakness in leasing system for fisheries, inadequate community management, inadequate operation and maintenance of existing infrastructures, etc. Over the past 250 years or so, 53 percent of wetlands in the US have been lost due to human activities. Wetlands are declining and more than 64 percent of the world's wetlands have been lost between 1900 and 2008. Dhaka City, the fastest growing urban city of Bangladesh, has already lost 66 sq km of marshy and peaty inundated low-lying areas--it went from 133 sq km in 1968 to 67 sq km in 2001. Similarly, inland lakes of 3.3 sq km have been encroached upon--it went from 5.1 sq km in 1968 to 1.8 sq km in 2001. More than 50 percent of wetland areas have been reduced over the period of 1968 to 2001. Bangladesh has been very active to preserve wetlands by adopting policies, strategies and action plans. Bangladesh Haor and Wetland Development Board is responsible for management and regulation of wetlands and haors in Bangladesh. The Department of Bangladesh Haor and Wetlands Development has also been established. Environment Court Act 2010; Environment Conservation Act 1995; Water Act 2013; National Environment Policy (1992); National Water Policy (1999); National Fisheries Strategy and Inland Capture Fisheries Strategy (2006); Jalmohal Management Policy (2009), etc., are some examples of government efforts. Various projects have been taken up for the sustainable management of wetlands. Fish sanctuaries have been introduced and community-based fishery management has been implemented in Sunamganj haor areas. We need to retain, restore and preserve our wetlands. Land use planning in urban areas needs to be taken into consideration along with involvement of local residents in wetland management, preservation and restoration of urban wetlands, and reduction of water consumption and harmful runoff. World Wetlands Day is celebrated every year on February 2 to raise global awareness about the value of wetlands for humanity and the planet. It also marks the date of adoption of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands in 1971, in the Iranian city of Ramsar. World Wetlands Day was celebrated for the first time in 1997. Wetlands for a Sustainable Urban Future was the theme for the World Wetlands Day this year. Urban wetlands make cities liveable in many ways. They reduce flooding, replenish drinking water, filter waste, provide urban green spaces, and provide sources of livelihoods. These wetlands are now crucial as the number of people living in cities has passed four billion and will continue to rise. By 2050, 66 percent of world population will live in cities seeking better livelihoods. Unfortunately, most of us are unaware of the value and importance of urban wetlands. Wetlands are often viewed as wastelands. World Wetlands Day 2018 aims to raise awareness about how urban wetlands contribute to the future of sustainable cities. Urban wetlands should be integrated into a city's sustainable future planning and development; not viewed as wastelands. Cities should adopt policies and actions which help conserve and promote urban wetlands. Wetlands are a precious national resource. The economic value of wetlands simply cannot be calculated. Our spirit, mind, body and health are related to wetlands. We need to save our wetlands--both in the rural and urban areas.

      "text": "Bangladesh is the only country in the world where stock trading has remained closed because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Until this week, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Jordan were the three countries where stock markets had been shut. Sri Lanka started the trading yesterday and witnessed a huge sale pressure.  The Colombo stock market's index of the most liquid shares, S&P SL 20, plunged more than 10 per cent on the first day of the trading since March 20. Jordan, where trading had been suspended since March 16, also experienced the same when it reopened on Sunday. The Amman Stock Exchange's ASE Index dropped more than 15 per cent. The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and the Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) have been closed since March 26 in line with the government's general holiday aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. zThe longest closure of the stock market since the Liberation War would hurt the image of the markets, according to analysts. \"The impact of the shutdown would be clear in the long-run,\" said Mohammed Rahmat Pasha, chief executive officer of UCB Capital Management. \"The setting of the floor price turned the markets into illiquid ones and it would be costlier to regain the image internationally.\" Before the shutdown, the stock market regulator fixed the floor price of all stocks by calculating the previous five days' average prices in order to prevent fall. But after the floor price was fixed, most of the stocks did not find buyers. The shutdown further means that none can sell shares even if they need to. \"Many foreign investors are preparing to sell shares in large volume once the market reopens,\" said a top official of a stock brokerage house that deals foreign portfolios. The stock market has been suffering because of the COVID-19 all over the world, but they would bounce back strongly when the economy makes a turnaround. However, there is no such hope in Bangladesh and it will suffer more due to the wrong policy, he said. The main blow would come if the country's capital market is kicked out of the MSCI Index. The index captures mid- and large caps across more than two dozen emerging markets. It is a float-adjusted market capitalisation index. The MSCI Bangladesh Index was launched on Dec 1, 2009. If the shutdown continues, it may be kicked out of the index in the next rearrangement, said a broker. If Bangladesh is removed from the index, a huge sell pressure would occur naturally, as many foreign index fund managers invest by looking at the index, said an institutional investor. The ongoing market closure is the longest since the last shutdown in 1969 when the mass upsurge took place. The market resumed in 1976. Trading was closed for four days at a stretch in 2004 due to massive floods. Apart from these, the market was largely closed because of technical glitches. \"When all the stock markets are open all over the world, the closure of our market would give a negative signal to investors,\" said a merchant banker. \"The market should resume operations as early as possible,\" Pasha said. A share trading has two parts: one is share transfer and another is transferring money. Central Depository Bangladesh Ltd (CDBL) carries out share transfer and a department of the DSE transfers the money. \"We carry out the share transfer through online and it is possible to continue trading with our limited presence in the office,\" said Shuvra Kanti Choudhury, managing director of CDBL. The money transfer system of the bourse is still manual, so DSE officials need to go office and brokers also need to reopen, said an official of the bourse. Recently, the Dhaka bourse sought permission from the regulator to open the market. However, there is little possibility for getting the consent as two commissioners left the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission recently and the tenure of the chairman is also going to expire this month, said an official of the commission.

      "text": "More and severe floods are likely in Bangladesh and India due to climate change, says a UN study published on March 21. The UN report titled \"World Water Development Report 2020\" said apart from flooding, Bangladesh will also be the country worst hit by droughts due to increased concentration of pollutants and low-quality groundwater sources. The report began by saying that climate will continue to change, affecting societies mainly through water, and \"will affect the availability, quality and quantity of water for basic human needs, threatening the effective enjoyment of the human rights to water and sanitation for potentially billions of people\". \"Collaboration on information-sharing has long provided an important anchor for broader collaboration on transboundary issues -- as for example between Bangladesh and India on flooding -- and climate change is likely to increase the imperative for this,\" the report read. The report said intense monsoon in August 2017 affected 40 million people in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, claiming nearly 1,300 lives and putting 1.1 million people in relief camps. \"Floods could cost South Asia as much as $215 billion each year by 2030. Floods are also expected to contaminate water sources, destroy water points and sanitation facilities, and therefore pose a challenge to universal access to sustainable water and sanitation services,\" it observed. \"The frequency of floods has increased over time. The important point is the timing of the floods -- we now see floods early in the year as well as late in the year,\" Brac University Prof Emeritus Ainun Nishat told The Daily Star yesterday, adding that India and Bangladesh have been sharing data on water levels of rivers, including flood forecasting. Climate change and increasing demand for water will stress the region's groundwater resources, as the availability of surface water is affected by increasing climate variability. Groundwater use in the region could increase by 30 percent by 2050, the report said. Increased concentration of pollutants when conditions are drier is of concern for groundwater sources that are already of low quality in certain locations in India and Bangladesh, it added. Bangladesh's irrigation and water supply to major cities are heavily dependent on groundwater but the groundwater is not replenished in a proper way, Nishat said. \"Groundwater is depleting and so the contamination in ground-level water will increase. But now the government is focusing on using surface water and we see that for Dhaka city, water is brought from the Meghna,\" he added. The report said Bangladesh performs \"medium low\" in implementing the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). \"Our integrated water policy is basically geared towards supporting agriculture. We do not have any specific water plan for fisheries, environment and many other sectors. The situation is very poor in eco-system management,\" Nishat said. The current national development plan recognises that Bangladesh cannot undertake meaningful water resource development programmes on its own and aims to strike new transboundary agreements, the report added. \"So far, however, a water-sharing agreement is in place for only one of its 57 transboundary rivers - the Ganges -- with India,\" it said."

      "text": "The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) has kept open over 5,400 primary schools in haor areas to accommodate labourers harvesting paddy. Officials said doors of around 5,041 primary schools in four districts of Sylhet division and another 400 in Kishoreganj and 16 in Netrakona are open to the labourers. Farmers grow paddy on the low-lying wetlands in those districts only once a year. But flashfloods during this period of the year damage crops at times. Meanwhile, only about 10 percent of paddy harvesting was done in Sylhet division until Sunday, according to an estimate of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE) in the division. Farmers have been complaining about a shortage of harvesting workers due to the nationwide Covid-19 shutdown. AKM Shafayet Alam, DPE deputy director in Sylhet division, said they were ready to accommodate labourers at all schools in haor areas. He said they took the decision following an order by Primary and Mass Education Secretary Akram-Al-Hossain. Shafayet said early rainfall coupled with possible flash floods, forecasted by the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), was another reason for keeping the schools open to workers. On April 13, the BWDB forecasted that flash floods might hit the haor areas of Sunamganj and Sylhet as India's meteorological department predicted excessive rainfall in its bordering areas and in the north-eastern part of Bangladesh. Taking the forecast in consideration, district officials issued a notice asking farmers to harvest boro paddy as soon as possible. In a move to slow down the spread of coronavirus, the government initially closed all educational institutions from March 17-31. Later, the closure was extended to April 25. The closure till April 25 means schools and colleges will remain shut until May 31 as they would have holidays for the Ramadan and Eid-ul-Fitr, if the government does not cancel or cut those. District primary education officers in Kishoreganj and Netrakona said they instructed all teachers to talk to farmers and local public representatives to inform them that they could accommodate harvesting labourers at schools. Speaking to The Daily Star on Sunday, DAE Additional Director (Sylhet division) Srinibas Debnath said paddy was cultivated on 474,195 hectares of land in the division this year. The boro harvest season began last week and it would probably continue until the first week of next month, he added.  "

      "text": "The Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) has asked all teachers of secondary schools to lend farmers a hand in an attempt to speed up the harvest of Boro paddy as flash flood can occur in several districts at any time. The DSHE on Tuesday night issued a directive in this regard so that farmers, especially those from the haor region who are expecting a bumper production of Boro, can take their produce home amid a countrywide shutdown imposed to fend off the spread of coronavirus. Prof Syed Md Golam, director general of the directorate, said they issued the directive in line with the prime minister's instruction where she urged all to help farmers harvest their crops. \"We also kept in mind the possibilities of flash floods and heavy rain which would wreak havoc on the crops,\" he said, adding that farmers need to have the harvest completed before a disaster strikes. Head of institutions, along with other teachers and trained students, for example, the members of scout, would assist the farmers by maintaining social distancing guidelines. The directives also asked the school authorities to let the farmers of nearby areas use the school compounds to stockpile their produce as many farmers in haor areas reside far away from the fields. Moreover, farmers and their helpers may use the school buildings for temporary accommodation, the directive added. According to the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), Boro has been cultivated on 447,195 hectares of land in Sylhet division with a production target of 23.71 lakh tonnes. Srinibash Debnath, additional director of DAE in Sylhet, said they were expecting very good yield this year as no disease was yet to affect the crops. As of Tuesday, 31 percent of the produce was harvested in the haor areas against 21 percent in the whole division, he said, adding that the progress was satisfactory. The official, however, voiced worry that flash flood may hit the region any time. According to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre of Bangladesh Water Development Board, a flash flood may hit the haor region at the end of the week due to excessive rainfall in the north-eastern part of the country and the Indian states of Assam and Meghalaya. Earlier, officials of the Directorate of Primary Education said they have kept open over 5,400 primary schools in haor areas to accommodate the labourers who are harvesting paddy."

      "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a grave challenge to the policymakers. The government of Bangladesh is engaged in an uphill task to contain the contagion through enforcing lockdowns and raising public awareness, shoring up testing and treatment facilities and framing incentive packages so that damage to the national economy is minimised. A declared priority of the government is to lessen the hardship of workers engaged in various sectors. In the past, during periods of national crisis (cyclone or floods), migrants remitted higher than the regular amounts to help households tide over the emergency. This time, however, the global scale of the crisis--triggering a sudden contraction in the flow of remittance--has exposed a big section of their left behind families to severe vulnerability. In addition, voluntary return and forced deportation of tens of thousands of workers have further compounded the crisis. Many returned empty-handed. Reports that migrants from the Gulf states and Europe were not abiding by quarantine rules created an anti-migrant psyche. Households in which migrants returned faced resentment of the locals. They were subjected to harassment, physical assaults, extortion and discrimination in accessing medical care. Without valid evidence, returnee migrant workers were identified as the source for the spread of the infection. The class element of such labelling is evident. There was hardly any stigmatisation of other returnees (business people, students, visitors and other professionals) who failed to adhere to the quarantine rules. Marginalised migrants were the convenient villain. In this challenging situation, RMMRU proposes several immediate and mid-term measures pertaining to the labour migration sector for consideration of the government.   Immediate Measures Allocation of fund targeting migrant households: The Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment's allocation of resources for emergency support to the migrants in destination countries and its plan to extend reintegration loan from the Wage Earners' Welfare Fund (WEWF) are important steps. Unfortunately, a much larger amount is needed than what can be mobilised from this Fund. Instead of relying on the WEWF, which is generated from the migrant workers' own subscription, such fund should be sourced from the government's own exchequer. This will send a positive signal of the government's commitment to the migrants. There is a need to extend financial support to the migrant families who are in distress and the returnees who came back empty-handed. The government should consider allocation of a large amount of resources, perhaps to the tune of thousands of crores of taka, to provide cash grants to the vulnerable migrant households so that they can stave off hunger and malnutrition. Civil society organisations can be effective partners of the civil administration at the grassroots in identifying the deserving households. Concerns in destination countries: Taking advantage of the Covid-19 outbreak, some destination countries have taken measures to deport migrants in irregular status. Instead of adhering to international law to protect all migrants during a situation of global crisis, exerting pressure on the countries of origin to take back their nationals with the threat of blacklisting is egregious. The government should urge the concerned states to keep the matter in abeyance until the situation normalises. It is important to note that, in many instances, workers who now find themselves in irregular status migrated through the regular channel with valid visa and work permit, meeting the administrative requirements of both countries of origin and destination. On arrival in the countries of employment, they became victims of the machinations of unscrupulous rent-seeking Kafeels (sponsors) or recruiting agencies at that end. Many migrant workers who lost their jobs due to the coronavirus crisis either returned voluntarily or were deported; they have not been able to secure their due wages and other benefits. The government should make sure that those affected can claim back such dues as soon as the situation permits. In some destination countries, migrants cannot access free test and treatment and are thus unable to secure those services. The fear of detention precludes those in irregular status from undergoing tests. The government should urge the concerned countries not to make any distinction between citizens and migrants as it would only jeopardise the health of their own population. In most instances, migrant workers live in cramped, unhygienic condition. The fear is, if one is infected it will spread like wildfire. The government needs to engage with the authorities of destination countries so that appropriate measures are taken to minimise the risk. Current efforts of Bangladesh missions to disseminate information about safety in Bangla should be a continuous endeavour. The impact of Covid-19 pandemic will differ significantly on the basis of gender. The Bangladesh missions should work out modalities with the authorities of destination countries to maintain unhindered communication with the female migrants working at home to ensure they remain safe and are provided with healthcare, should the need arise. Concerns of safety of the women working in other sectors should also receive equal attention. To keep its foreign exchange reserve buoyant, the government should consider giving additional financial incentives to the remittance senders. In some areas of destination countries, remittance transfer houses are not operating and migrants are unable to send remittances. The government should urge those countries to keep such facilities open so that migrants who still have earnings can send remittances.  Responsibility of the BAIRA: The Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) should create an emergency fund through the contributions of its members, particularly those who are wealthy. It should immediately instruct the members to submit a list of migrants whom they have charged money to facilitate their migration. The Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment should demand such a list from the BAIRA. BAIRA should also instruct its members to return money to workers in cases where the recruiting agencies have not started processing the documents. From the emergency fund, BAIRA should provide assistance to those migrant families whose papers were processed but could not secure flights due to the sudden outbreak of the pandemic. The government should ensure that the latter group of workers is given priority in deployment without having to pay any additional sum when labour migration resumes.   Mid-term measures  Guideline for serving migrants during emergency situations: There is no established guideline about how labour migrants should be dealt with in emergency situations. This crisis has created an opportunity to frame such a guideline that can be incorporated in the Overseas Employment Policy, 2016. Resources have to be allocated for emergency situations under the Guideline. Likewise, the Communicable Diseases (Prevention, Control and Eradication) Act, 2018 needs to incorporate the migrant issue with due importance. Database of returnee migrants: Using the arrival data of civil aviation and immigration departments, the Ministry of Health has done an important work in identifying migrants who returned after the outbreak of Covid-19. This has created an opportunity for generation of a database of all returnee migrants through the coordination and collaboration of various ministries of the government, including home affairs, civil aviation and MEWOE. Irregular migration and trafficking: In the aftermath of the pandemic, the scope and opportunity for migration through formal channels will substantially reduce. This will create conditions for the trafficking and human smuggling syndicates to prey on the aspirant migrants. The government should remain vigilant and take stern action against the kingpins, not merely the ground-level operatives of such nefarious trade; and in partnership with the civil society organisations, it should take measures to create awareness against irregular migration. Responsibility of regional and international processes: In the post-pandemic phase, the member-states of Colombo Process, Abu Dhabi Dialogue and the Global Forum on Migration and Development should, taking lessons from the crisis, develop appropriate short and long-term strategies for protection of migrants during emergency. As the leading state of the much-celebrated Global Compact on Migration, Bangladesh should initiate discussions in these forums at the opportune moment. Migrants are the lifeline of Bangladesh. All along during crisis situations, they stood by the country. At this critical time, we as a nation should do our best to support the vulnerable migrants and members of the left behind families. Such support to the migrants should be no less than what has been extended to others: business, formal-sector workers and agriculture. Migrant workers are eagerly waiting for an announcement to this effect.

      "text": "The catastrophic public health impact of the Covid-19 crisis has sent the world reeling, but its full ramifications have only begun to unfold. The pandemic is shaking the foundations of economic, social and cultural institutions across societies. Amidst this turmoil, the historical instances of faith actors playing a vital stabilising role during global crises offer a beacon of hope. Thus, while faith actors have not always had a positive impact, history entrusts them with a critical part in healing the world from the ravages of this pandemic. The expansive social roles of religious organisations in Bangladesh must, therefore, be recognised, integrating their wide-ranging contributions--from the material to the spiritual--into the social response to this pandemic, underscoring the profound curative power of faith in the gravest times of suffering. The Covid-19 pandemic is having an extreme impact on lives and livelihoods in Bangladesh, threatening some of the remarkable gains made in the decades of progress towards development and social cohesion. Religion can play a crucial mitigative role at all levels of this impact, from the micro-level role of religious actors, in offering individuals spiritual and material relief, to the macro-level contributions of religious organisations, in meeting broader crisis-induced humanitarian and socioeconomic challenges. This potential has been realised in Bangladesh since the early years of the Liberation War in 1971, when the country was struck by devastating cyclones, floods, and famines. In tandem, various religious organisations have assumed longstanding roles in evacuation efforts, humanitarian aid and service delivery during crises, in addition to wider efforts towards social development, from advancing gender equality to ensuring minority rights' protection. It is thus essential to draw on the experiences and insights of the faith world in shaping the social response during and beyond the lifecycle of the Covid-19 crisis. The lessons from the past and contemplations on the future of the pandemic can only be actionable where these are adapted to the specific nature of this crisis. It is thus important to understand that the Covid-19 crisis reintroduces old challenges in serious magnitude and also poses unique problems, which will require faith actors to reaffirm their social commitment and reorient themselves to thwart the novel threats to Bangladeshi society. With a backdrop of a massive humanitarian crisis, the onslaught of Covid-19 brings unprecedented economic and social challenges in its wake. The crisis has already struck at the Bangladesh economy's core pillars of ready-made garments and remittances. With the spate of order cancellations from its major European and American buyers, the Bangladesh RMG sector already faces an estimated loss of USD 1.5 billion. Similarly, the loss of migrant workers' wages due to global economic slowdown will mean plummeting remittances, with dire consequences for families in rural Bangladesh which depend heavily on the remittance inflow. The overall economic impact of this crisis will not only decelerate the growth of the economy but also exacerbate poverty and social inequality, as reported by the World Economic Forum. The marked gender dimension of the pandemic particularly exposes women and girls to risks of harm and deprivation. Entrenched gender stereotypes are likely to confine them to housework and caregiving roles and may lead to further gendered harms such as sexual exploitation, early and forced marriage and early pregnancy, both in the present and post-pandemic scenes, as Plan International and UNESCO have warned. Moreover, both Ain o Salish Kendra and Manusher Jonno Foundation have reported rising levels of domestic violence against women since the onset of the lockdown. Tensions are also simmering within various social pockets as the crisis threatens to deepen existing fissures in our society, accentuating class and group interests and pitting sects against one another. From the propagation of incendiary views on the causes of the Covid-19 crisis to the fomenting of unrest through hatemongering, the bonds of cohesion in society are being assailed on multiple fronts. Faith actors in Bangladesh can mitigate the devastating impact of the Covid-19 crisis on all its fronts, using both time-tested and innovative approaches. Vital religious resources are contained in the holy texts and jurisprudences of different faiths, which can both inspire and instruct adherents in times of hardship. This can ensure continued moral development and active citizenship among followers and also alert them against misguided approaches to religion which are inimical to social wellbeing. Similarly, religious practices aimed at alleviating the sufferings of the vulnerable can be adapted to address the dire needs arising from this crisis. On the other hand, the practice of religion can be maintained despite necessary public health measures, thereby continuing to deliver spiritual and moral guidance to the adherents. This can be done through creative adaptations in practice, the aid of technology as well as the endorsement of hitherto less-practiced forms of worship that conform to health-based prescriptions. Methods of community mobilisation and thought leadership relied on by religious leaders during past crises can be repurposed for the present times. Religious actors can work, both individually and institutionally, to tap into their extensive networks that grant them greater access to the remotest parts of the country than is often available to state and other non-state actors. Similarly, as faith leaders are highly revered within their communities, their efforts towards maintaining public health standards and fostering social cohesion are likely to be efficacious. Established partnerships can be reenergised, and new ones forged, to deliver stronger and broader responses against the crisis. An interfaith dimension to collaborations between religious organisations can greatly enhance social cohesion, and partnering with non-religious entities will also be highly beneficial. Religious actors' association with state organs offers important advantages in terms of resources and security, while state organs can benefit from expanded access and increased legitimacy vis-a-vis religious constituencies. Religious organisations' engagement with their non-religious counterparts can also create larger resource pools for building more robust responses and establish a mutual support system in terms of distinct expertises and unique pathways of access. It is thus essential to draw on the experiences, insights, and vast capacity of the faith world in facing this pandemic and looking to the future. The key social role of religious organisations is affirmed by the work undertaken through research collaboration between the Centre for Peace and Justice, Brac University, and the World Faiths Development Dialogue, Georgetown University, USA--which explores the faith dimensions of development and social cohesion in Bangladesh. The research identifies productive interactions between the faith world and the development sector and lays important stepping stones to recognising the expansive roles of religious organisations in Bangladeshi society. Such work now takes on renewed urgency and greater significance, as the existing and emerging dimensions of this pandemic reveal the importance of including faith actors in charting the course through this turbulent time and reaching safe harbour in the post-Covid-19 world.

      "text": "Overall flood situation in the country deteriorated further today as water levels at all major rivers marked rise inundating more fresh areas, marooning thousands of people and disrupting road communications in different areas. Water levels at 79 river stations monitored by Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) have marked rise while 11 stations recorded fall today.  Among the 93 monitored stations, water levels at 23 river stations are flowing above danger level while water levels at two river stations have been registered steady, said a bulletin issued by the FFWC. The major rivers in Chattogram, Sylhet and Rangpur divisions may rise rapidly. \"Water levels in all the four basins are rising but of them rivers in Meghna and Brahmaputra basins particularly in the Teesta sub-basin are swelling in a faster pace,\" a FFWC spokesperson told BSS at around midday today. Netrokona, Sunamganj, Sylhet, Chattogram, Cox's Bazar, Bandarban, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Jamalpur, Gaibandha and Bogura were among the worst affected areas where the flood situation may deteriorate further due to rainfall in north, north-east and hill regions, said FFWC. The government has already started relief operations in the affected areas and opened control rooms to monitor the flood situation. Medical teams led by civil surgeons are working in the affected areas Patenga Met office recorded 122.4 mm of rainfall during the last 24 hours ending 3 pm today, causing serious disruptions to civic life, port and businesses activities in the city. City's all rivers, canals and drains were full to the brim of floodwater caused by the torrential rainfall coupled with full tide water. Low-lying areas including Chawkbazar, Bakalia, Sholakbahar, Agrabad, Halisahar, Muradpur, Bohaddarhat, Kapasgola, Parbartak Intersection, KB Aman Ali Road, DC Road, Chandgaon, Sholashahar Gate No. 2, East Nasirabad and Dewanbazar areas were inundated in nearly knee-to-waist-deep water. Chattogram District Administration evacuated around 800 families from risky hill slopes in the city fearing landslide and sent them to eight shelter centres, said Delwar Hossain, Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue). Shah Amanat International Airport sources said a few flights could not land in the airport while some others were delayed to fly because of heavy downpours. Chattogram Civil Surgeon Office formed 284 medical teams and a control room for monitoring emergency situation in flood affected areas. Flood situation has worsened further as water level of the river Teesta at the Nilphamari point is flowing by 50 cm above its danger mark. Onrush of water from upstream region and heavy rainfall triggered floods in 15 char areas under Nilphamari district leaving over 20,000 families marooned. Low-lying areas in the district were flooded as water levels in the major rivers rose sharply, said Md Abdullah Al Mamun, executive engineer of Water Development Board of Nilphamari. Incessant rainfall and onrush of water from upstream flooded Chokoria and Pekuya upazila of the district leaving over one lakh people marooned. Cox's Bazar district witnessed incessant rainfall in the past seven days and the Matamuhuri river is flowing above its danger mark due to onrush of water from hilly areas, said an official of upazila Water Development Board. Chairman of Suragpur-Manikpur union Azimul Haque told BSS that roads, houses, schools and other infrastructures went under floodwater creating immense suffering for the people. Chokoria Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Nuruddin Muhammad Shibli Noman said local administration is distributing dry food among the flood-hit people. A total of 30 tonnes of rice were disbursed in the flood affected areas. Overall flood situation in hill district deteriorated due to heavy rain and onrush water from upstream. Sangu River at Bandarban and Dohazari points has crossed danger level, according to the Flood Forecasting warning Center (FFWC). Road communications of hill district Bandarban with other parts of the country remained suspended as Chittagong-Bandarban road at Keranihat area is under water for five days. About 20,000 people of low-lying areas of the district remained struck by flood water. More than 2500 families have taken shelter in 131 shelter centers. District administration is distributing 'khichuri', meat and drinking water two times a day among the affected people. Dry foods are being distributed in other shelter centers. Monsoon flood triggered by heavy rainfall and onrush of hilly water inundated 40 villages under Jhinaigati upazila in Sherpur district leaving 5,000 families marooned. Officials and representatives of local government bodies told BSS that several hundreds of houses, roads and other infrastructures have been completely or partially damaged alongside standing crops of vast tract of lands, which went under water. Flood situation in Sherpur district may deteriorate further, if monsoon rains are likely to prolong, the Met Office sources said. About 40,000 families have been affected in seven northern districts where flood situation further deteriorated today despite onrushing water from the upstream receded at Teesta Barrage Project (TBP) point. Officials of Water Development Board (WDB) said the major rivers of Rangpur, Nilphamari, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Bogura and Sirajganj were flowing above their danger marks (DM) at eight points in the basin at 3 pm today. Teesta crossed its DM for the first time in recent times at Kawnia point where the river was flowing 12 cm above its danger level at 3 pm, Superintending Engineer (SE) of WDB for Rangpur Circle-1 Md. Harun Ar Rashid said. The Teesta was flowing 50cm above the DM at Dalia at 12 last night while at 37cm above at 3 pm today, Executive Engineer of the WDB's TBP Division Rabiul Islam told BSS. The Dharla was flowing 57 cm above the DM at Kurigram, Brahmaputra by 12 cm at Noonkhawa, 45 cm at Chilmari and by 42 cm above the DM at Fulchhari and Ghaghot by 16 cm at Gaibandha points at 3 pm today, he said. WDB officials said the Jamuna was flowing 37 cm above the DM at Bahadurabad while 3 cm below the DM at Sariakandi, 24 cm below the DM at Kazipur and 48 cm below the DM at Sirajganj point. However, there is a possibility of improvement of flood situation in the side of Teesta in Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari and some areas of Rangpur and Gaibandha districts due to sharp fall of onrushing water. The government has launched relief operation as the current spate of deluge exposed thousands of people to sufferings following inundation of vast low-lying areas in the upper Brahmaputra basin. Water level of the Brahmaputra, one of the mighty rivers in the country, crossed its danger mark today morning inundating the river basin areas including char ones. The water levels in the Brahmaputra rose by 46 cm. With the rise of water level in the Brahmaputra river, the river basin areas of Sundarganj, Sadar, Fulchhari and Saghata upazila had been inundated and the standing crops particularly jute and summer vegetables went under flood water. Apart from this, flowing rise of water level in the river, the erosion took serious turn at many places along the western sides of the river including Horipur, Kapasia and Kamarjani of the district creating immense sufferings and much anxiety to the erosion victims and also making the river bank people threatened. The district and the upazila administrations had got ready with relief materials and manpower to address the flood situation in the district efficiently. They were also monitoring the situation closely and briefing the higher authority concerned about the latest situation and its doings side by side with opening a control room at the DC office to help inform the people about floods, the DC added."

      "text": "The floods, which have been ravaging the north and hilly regions, are now approaching the districts adjacent to the capital from the north. The Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre (FFWC) forecast that the situation may deteriorate in Manikganj, Rajbari, Faridpur and Munshiganj today. On the other hand, it might improve in Tangail, Sirajganj, Bogra, Jamalpur, Kurigram, Gaibandha Netrokona, Sunamganj and Sylhet. In a bulletin yesterday, the FFWC said the water levels of the major rivers, except the Ganges-Padma, were in a falling trend.  The Lakhya river in Gazipur was flowing 6cm below the danger level, while the Balu river in Demra was 56cm below its danger level.  The Padma river at Sureswar point in Shariatpur district may cross the danger level today. The Jamuna river was flowing 82cm over the danger level at Aricha point till 3:00pm yesterday. The FFWC yesterday found different rivers flowing above the danger level in 21 stations out of 93.  In Manikganj, around 50,000 flood-hit families in 70 villages are living in dire condition for lack of food and pure water.  At least 30 educational institutes have been closed in Daulatpur, Shivalaya, Ghior, Harirampur and Saturia upazilas, according to the district's flood control room. Due to river erosion, 300 families have become homeless in the last few days, said Md Babul Mia, acting district commissioner of Manikganj.  Meanwhile, ferry service on the Paturia-Daulatdia river route has been disrupted for the last seven days due to the heavy current in the Padma.  In Faridpur, around 2,000 families and 4,056 hectares of crops of Sadar, Sadarpur, Bhanga and Char Bhadrason upazilas have been hit by the deluge. Some 15 primary schools have also been closed, while around 50 roads have been submerged.  Contacted, Roksana Rahman, additional deputy commissioner of the district, said they had opened a flood monitoring cell to deal with emergencies. Elsewhere in Munshiganj, the Padma river has eroded the lands of 10 families in Kharia village under Lauhojong upazila over the last three days. In Tangail, people in Kalihati upazila's Shampur area dug out a diversion road on the Tangail-Bhuapur Road yesterday to divert flood water in the area. As a result, vehicular movement on the road remained suspended. Earlier on Thursday night, around 50m of the Bhuapur-Tarakandi Road was damaged due to floodwater.    In Rajbari, over 500 families have been directly affected by the flood in the last three days.   In Gaibandha and Kurigram, most of the flood-affected people have taken shelter on dykes and highlands and are suffering from a crisis of food and drinking water.  A total of five people have so far drowned in the flood in Gaibandha."

      "text": "It is unfortunate that Covid-19 came at a time when the conservative or right-wing forces are in power in several of the major countries of the world, including USA, UK, Brazil and India. Given their agenda of guarding their national interests, albeit territorially conceived, and that again, mainly for winning national elections and remaining in power, the spread of Covid-19 found them paralysed beyond description. In fact, as The Washington Post reported on April 19, even when more than a dozen US researchers, physicians and public health experts were providing real-time information about Covid-19 to the US administration from Geneva headquarters of the World Health Organization (WHO) when the virus emerged in Wuhan in December 2019, the president of the US remained unaffected, calling it either a hoax or another kind of flu or something that will vanish soon!  Indeed, sealing borders or policies resembling political gimmicking became more important than giving time and resources to understand and contain the virus. Trump, for instance, banned foreigners visiting China to enter the US from February 2, but kept it open to the American citizens traveling from China as late as end March. Not sure why this was done, knowing very well that the virus would not be able to distinguish an American from a non-American. Nearer to our home, India too was slow in responding to the spread of Covid-19, and then when it started to respond it came out with the idea of cancelling visas to non-Indians from March 13 onwards and calling for a 14-hour all-India \"public curfew\" on March 22. The first one is easy to implement, but since the virus is fully country-blind the impact would be no different from that of the US. The second one probably was intended to be more symbolic and a way to build awareness, but then how it would be operationalised defies logic, particularly when New Delhi alone has more than 300,000 street children, while some estimates put the total number of street children in India as high as 18 million. In the midst of all this there was one interesting move on the part of India and that was to call a Saarc virtual meeting on March 15. But then in the backdrop of having no Saarc Summit since 2014, the virtual meeting remains ineffective, if not out of place, not only because it was programmed to contain China's influence in South Asia, which few would be excited about at this moment, but also it was too late to stop the spread of Covid-19. More collective efforts ought to have been pursued by the major powers, indeed, as early as January 2020 when news of Covid-19 started pouring in from China and WHO, and not wait till March 12 when WHO came out with a scientific declaration of Covid-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Bangladesh too lacked knowledge and preparation in responding to the pandemic. It had some plans in the beginning when 316 Bangladeshis were evacuated from Wuhan on February 1 and quarantined for 14 days in Dhaka, although none of them tested positive for Covid-19. Bangladesh, however, lost hold of the situation when thousands started returning from Europe, mainly from Italy and Germany, and this continued even after international flights were banned on March 14. Some estimates put the figure between 450,000-550,000 passengers returning from abroad in the first three months of 2020. Although late in February the passengers were asked to go for self-quarantine in their respective locations for 14 days, but the instruction lacked strict supervision. Returnees too were less enthusiastic in maintaining the quarantine. It may be pointed out here that Bangladesh was relatively slow in dealing with Covid-19 in January and February mainly because the whole country was geared towards the centennial birthday celebration of the Father of the Nation, which was due on March 17. The prime minister, however, took the bold decision of postponing the event on March 8. On April 17 the government declared that the entire country is at risk of Covid-19. Now there is no option but to face the virus boldly and smartly! What is to be done then? Banishing fear ought to be the first thing. This is because fear takes us nowhere, it can only make things worse. Not only because much of it arises from ignorance, but also because, as Ibn Rushd would say, it leads to intolerance and violence. Indeed, by mid-March 2020, social media was full of fearful news, creating panic in the minds of people. Secondly, taking lessons from the countries who have fared better in dealing with Covid-19 ought to be prioritised. China, South Korea and Vietnam are some of the countries that would immediately come to mind. Apart from getting information from the media and the internet, governmental and non-governmental, even personal, contacts ought to be activated for a continuous flow of knowledge and know-how. Since some of these countries have opened up special hospitals, even factories producing essential items, it is important to know from multiple sources how that is being done and in what way Bangladesh could replicate it without jeopardising the lives of the people. Bangladesh missions, including the diaspora, can play a critical role in disseminating the knowledge and mapping the requirements so that Bangladesh would know how to save lives, what to produce, and what to supply. Thirdly, there is an urgent need to reenergise the GO-NGO partnership, which has proven its efficiency and effectiveness in Bangladesh in dealing with both natural and human-induced disasters. The former refers to the periodic floods and cyclones, while the latter refers to the Rohingyas, over a million of them, now residing in refugee camps in Cox's Bazar. Indeed, the partnership need to be activated not only in the much-required health sector, which, I understand, is getting some pace, but also in the advocacy of hand-washing and social distancing, delivering food and medicines, helping farmers, even providing education and supporting community policing at the ward/thana level. Fourthly, public health ought to be revisited. There is certainly a lot to learn from the regimes that have fared better during the pandemic, from Vietnam, for instance, mainly because, like Bangladesh, it is also a developing country. In fact, in matters related to public health, the democratic-authoritarian dichotomy has become meaningless. Instead, what is required is professionalism in delivering things when it is required in emergencies. One cannot help remembering here the words of Alexander Pope, \"For forms of government let fools contest; whatever is best administered is best.\" Public health ought to be mainstreamed, indeed, at levels of education, from kindergartens to tertiary, and not limit the knowledge to medical schools only. Also public health ought to be the subject of the visual and print media, professional courses, both civil and military, cultural performance, indeed, with a larger allocation in the national budget. Fifthly, making good use of civil-military relationship. Bangladesh is the only country in South Asia where its military fought side by side with the people for the independence of the country during the Liberation War. I am, indeed, referring to 1971. This has created a structure which has proven useful not only during natural disasters but also in international peacekeeping, with Bangladesh peacekeepers even managing hospitals in Gbarnga, Liberia, during the Ebola outbreak in 2014. The expertise of the military in disaster management ought to be utilised alongside the civil authority and international agencies to the full. In this context, the military can play a critical role in ensuring inter-district communication, including supply of food and essential goods, besides helping in lockdown efforts. Sixthly, re-starting the economy. This relates more to the formal sector than the informal sector, although the workforce of the latter probably has suffered more than the workforce of the former. This is because the income of many in the informal sector is on a daily basis, whereas in the case of the formal sector it is mostly monthly. A complete or partial lockdown otherwise is possible in the formal sector, but not in the informal sector. If one looks at the composition of the informal sector then one will find that in all three employment sectors--agriculture, industry and service--the informal employment is overwhelming, indeed, according to the Labour Force Survey Bangladesh 2016-2017, 95.4 percent in the agriculture sector, 89.9 percent in the industry sector, and 71.8 percent in the service sector of the total employment in that sector. This, of course, has advantages and disadvantages. One critical, if not unfortunate, advantage is that the informal economy will keep on running even in a dire situation. This gives us hope in the sense that a large section of the population, given that they are employed in the informal sector, would continue reproducing their lives in some form or another. Apart from not being able to get employed because of the lockdown and not getting the daily wage, the disadvantage of the informal workforce would be in their getting exposed to Covid-19 in a much bigger way. This is where creative intervention is required in reproducing the informal sector, which cannot be stopped in anyway, of course, without the workforce getting exposed to Covid-19. Washing hands, physical distancing, even testing for virus, would play a major role in reproducing the informal sector. The matter is different for the formal sector, which needs to be \"smart\" to bounce back. There is bound to be a short-term downturn, but it is destined to have a quick upturn, provided it can play its part smartly. A cue can be taken from the South Korean tech giant Samsung, whose operating profit in the first three months of 2020, when Covid-19 was creating havoc all over the world, rose from a year ago and beat expectations slightly. The reason is not difficult to understand. Samsung was selling items, mainly memory chips, whose demand went up as more people were working from home and making their purchases online. As Albert Einstein once said, \"In the midst of every crisis, lies great opportunity.\" Indeed, a thorough knowledge, backed by in-depth research, is required to map the items that would be required in short, mid, and long-terms. The need for medical items, including PPE, ventilators, sanitisers, gloves, and the like is understandable. Securing the health condition of the workforce, particularly physical distancing, the production of such items ought to be carried out in full speed and, if required, with extra workforce. Given the relative secured space, the EPZs could play a greater role in restarting the production lines. Clothing certainly would be one item that would be required mid-term onwards. A greater smartness is required in this sector, mainly because there are countries (Vietnam, for instance), who have managed to restart their RMG sector, and then, there are few other countries (Myanmar, for instance), whose workforce, particularly those who have lost their jobs, is being supported by the European Union with emergency cash fund. Since Bangladesh has to compete with both Vietnam and Myanmar, for instance, in the RMG sector, it is important that Bangladesh keeps a track of things around the world so that it can best strategise its clothing industry. A change from shopping malls to e-shopping is bound to happen in both short- and mid-terms, the quicker the reorientation is done in the demand-supply channels the better. A proliferation of e-offices will also make virtual business the new norm, indeed, as much in the cities as in the rural areas, where e-entrepreneurs, subject to their availability and training, would certainly make a difference. There is no denying the fact that a dubious business-political nexus, involved in money laundering, exists in the country. The government needs to keep a close eye on this more than ever. Indeed, a part of the laundered money in Bangladesh is regularly siphoned off to the developed countries, with the latter legalising the illegal money to the full! In fact, one report, published in March 2020, indicates that capital flight from Bangladesh stands at USD 7.53 billion on an average per year, and that again due to misinvoicing during import and export alone. Since those involved in capital flight are from the same nexus, it becomes difficult to stop such transfer of wealth. As one critic pointed out, \"Many politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen try to launder money as their children stay abroad.\" This is where the government, including civil watchdogs, must remain extra vigilant as \"fear\" at home would make the nexus and many more rationalise their illegal transfer of wealth even more. Seventhly, education in the broadest sense of the term needs to be reinvented. There is no doubt that during this crisis some have made use of  the \"de-class space\" with the help of the internet through various apps, such as Skype, Zoom, Google, and many more, instead of delivering lectures at the locked down traditional classrooms. But this needs to be institutionalised at all levels, from kindergartens to tertiary levels, with an effort to have education connected globally in real time. Fresh MOUs need to be signed to partner within and outside the country to offer gradable e-courses. But then, the national curricula at various levels need to be revisited as well. Not only for mainstreaming public health, as indicated earlier, but also for mainstreaming knowledge of survival, with a focus as much on the futures, nature and post-nationality as on the civilisational ingenuities. Finally, restoring confidence in the minds of people with the objective of reproducing social resilience. It is important to keep in mind that humans are not only political and economic beings but also spiritual beings. There is no doubt that some would find solace and get spirited in prayers, some in music, some in poetry, some in plays and films, some in breathing fresh air, and then some just by remembering their mother walking past by them from nowhere. Whatever may be the means keeping faith in humans and restoring confidence in them are equally urgent in reproducing social resilience, without which overcoming the current crisis or any crisis, for that matter, would become difficult if not impossible.

      "text": "Flood situation has worsened in Sherpur as new char areas and croplands went under water due to the sudden swelling of Old Brahmaputra river while the situation has improved slightly in Lalmonirhat. Meanwhile, the flood situation in Kurigram remain unchanged. Sherpur The increasing water of Old Brahmaputra River has led to the inundation of new char areas, croplands and houses, triggering fears of a devastating flood, reports UNB. Water Development Board said the river rose by three feet within 24 hours and was flowing just below the danger level at Sherpur Ferryghat Point at 6am today. Sherpur's relief office said 172 villages in 35 unions of five upazilas had been flooded after heavy rains in the country and upstream regions adjacent to Bangladesh, leaving at least 63,000 people stranded. Anowara Begum, the district's fisheries officer, said the flooding of ponds and fish enclosures have caused an estimated damage of Tk 5.18 crores.  Fifty-two educational institutions have been forced to suspend academic activities after they had gone under water. The rising water is also causing panic among the people. Locals said new areas were suddenly submerged after 8pm on Wednesday and the Sherpur-Jamalpur Highway Porar Dokan diversion had gone under knee deep water within the night. Kurigram The Brahmaputra, Dudhkumar and Dharla rivers were flowing 130cm above their danger marks at Chilmari Ghat point, 101 cm at Noonkhawa point and 9cm at Dharla Bridge point respectively at 6:00am today, according to the control room of Kurigram WDB. But water levels in all the 16 rivers of the district including the Brahmaputra, the Dudhkumar, the Dharla and the Teesta decreased compared to previous days. The control room said the Brahmaputra, Dudhkumar, Dharla and Teesta rivers decreased two centimetre (cm) at Chilmari Ghat point under Chilmari upazila, two cm at Noonkhawa point under Sadar upazila, six cm at Dharla Bridga point under Sadar upazila and 23 cm at Kaunia Ghat point under Kaunia upazila of Rangpur respectively within last 12 hours. The district relief and rehabilitation office (DRRO) sources said some 6,14,596 people of 1,53,649 families in nine upazilas of the district were marooned by the floodwater while 4,996 people of 1,249 families (of them) have lost their dwelling houses due to the flood.  Around 33,127 hectares of lands are under the floodwater. Of them, 15,159 hectares of cropland damaged,\" the DRRO sources said. Lalmonirhat The Teesta water has started to reduce as onrush water from the upstream decreased at Gazoldoba barrage in the Indian state of Paschimbanga, according to Lalmonirhat district administration. Water level of Teesta was flowing 35 cm below the danger mark at Kaunia Ghat point in Kaunia upazila (Rangpur) under its danger mark, our Kurigram correspondent reports quoting WDB officials. Acting Deputy Commissioner of Lalmonirhat Ahsan Habib told our Lalmonirhat correspondent that nearly 60 percent of the flood-affected people have returned to their homes from the flood centres as the flood situation improved.
